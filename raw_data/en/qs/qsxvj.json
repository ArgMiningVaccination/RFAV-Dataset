As research has progressed towards a better understanding of the virology, pathogenesi s and immunological properties of HIV, vaccine designs that incorporate subunit proteins or epitope -based peptides have emerged as viable candidates for developing effective therapeutic and preventative treatments for HIV. Protein subunits and peptides in a vaccine elicit humoral immune responses by stimulating antibodies to neutralize the native virus. Though a high specificity related to HLA alleles decreases the universal effectiveness of a peptide vaccine approach, many protein subunit and peptide vacc ine designs incorporate conjugates or adjuvants to increase their immunogenicity. The purpose of this patent landscape study was to search, identify and categorize patent documents that are relevant to the research, development and distribution of a subun it protein or peptide based HIV vaccine. 1 Various Approaches for HIV Vaccine Development, http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/66/ figure/F1 (last visited Mar. 29, 2009). 2 HIV 101 , http://www.aidsdurham.com/Pictures/HIV.JPG (last v isited Mar. 29, 2009). 3 Peptides: Protein Subunits, http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/~courses/genchem/Tutorials/Ferritin/images/ peptide_ribbon.jpg (last visited Mar. 29, 2009). 4 New HIV vaccine, http://www.topnews.in/health/files/HIV -Vaccine.jpg (last visited Mar. 29, 2009). 8 Disclaimer This is an educational report and is neither inclusive nor comprehensive. Rather, it is an informational resource to facilitate a better understanding of the international patent literature landsca pe with regard to Protein/Peptide vaccines for HIV. This report is not a list of all potentially relevant patent documents. It is not a Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion. Furthermore, this report does not reach the level of a FTO analysis, but instead c onstitutes an educational presentation of potentially relevant information. While the search engines utilized in this project are extensive, it is likely that the entire spectrum of patent documents was not obtained utilizing the various search strategie s and methods articulated herein. Therefore, it is not the supposition of this team that all relevant patent documents were discovered during the creation of this report. As the team members are not experts in the field of Protein/Peptide vaccines for HIV, it is also highly possible that the categorization of the patent documents found, coded and compiled are incomplete. The team cannot guarantee that these patent documents were evaluated at the level of expert scientific sophistication. Due to the li mited time frame (~15 weeks) imposed upon this project, the number of patent documents evaluated was established by this constrained schedule, the overall semester demands and the general press of business. As such, additional patents may have been availa ble for evaluation, but without the necessary time, they may not have been considered. Also, certain patents were unable to be examined due to the lack of claims or foreign language restrictions. Again, this report should not be viewed as a FTO analysis but instead constitutes an educational report. 9 I. About the Technology 1. Subunit/ Envelope Protein Vaccines 1.A. Obstacles to HIV Vaccines While a few antiretroviral therapies exist for HIV -1, more than 95% of individuals infected with th is disease live in places where access to such therapies is limited due to its high cost. It is because of this that a vaccine is believed to be the best and only real long -term solution to the AIDS pandemic.5 The search for a HIV -1 vaccine has proven to be a challenging problem for a number of reasons. First, there has never been a recorded case of natural immunity to HIV. As such, researchers have been unable to identify immune correlates of protection from natural infection. There is still hope, h owever, that individuals do exist who have a natural immunity to HIV -1. There have been rumors that female prostitutes in Kenya and Gambia have been exposed to HIV and remain uninfected. It is from these women that researchers have discovered the importa nce of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activities in vaccine development.6 Second, there is no suitable animal model for assessing the effectiveness of any of the proposed vaccines against HIV -1. Chimpanzees present a number of problems to the vaccine tri als including: 1) the high cost of their care; 2) the fact that they are an endangered species and are thus not highly accessible; 3) and the fact that while they are susceptible to HIV -1 infection, they do not succumb to its disease except in very few cases. As such, SIV, which induces AIDS -like symptoms in macaques, has been used widely to model HIV -1 pathogenesis. To overcome some of the problems researchers have encountered using SIV, a chimeric virus of HIV -1 and SIV termed SHIV has been generated. This virus encodes vpu, vpr, rev, env and tat genes derived from HIV -1 in the backbone of SIV genome. This chimeric virus, however, is limited in that the swift loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes is very different from the slow decline of a HIV -1 infected immune system. Also, SHIV is also limited by the fact that the genome is only partially derived from HIV -1.7 The third obstacle to HIV vaccines has been the many ways by which the HIV -1 virus evades the human immune system. HIV -1 evades humoral immune r esponses against its envelope glycoprotein in three ways: extensive glycosylation, a high degree of genetic variation, and complex tertiary and quaternary structures. HIV -1 also has a number of means of evading cellular immune responses.8 This type of i nvasion includes: (1) down regulation of Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by Nef, (2) ability of HIV -1 to integrate into the host genome, 5 Michael W. Cho, Subunit Protein Vaccines: Theoretical and Practical Considerations for HIV -1, 3(3) CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE 243, 243 (2003). 6 Id. 7 Id. at 244. 8 Id. 10 which allows the virus to stay dormant for prolonged periods, (3) destruction of CD4+ T lymph ocytes, which play a central role in immunity, and (4) immune suppression by Tat.9 1.B. Vaccine Strategies Comparison There are six categories of vaccine strategies including subunit protein, live attenuated, whole -inactivated, DNA, live vector and comb inatorial vaccines.10 Only live attenuated, whole -inactivated and subunit protein vaccines are currently being licensed. Table 1 illustrates the common uses of these vaccines.11 Table 1: Viral Vaccines12 9 Id. 10 Id. at 244 -45. 11 Id. at 245. 12 Id. Routine childhood vaccination Chickenpox (Varicella) Live attenuated Hepat select Adenovirus Live attenuated Japaneses encephaliti s virus Whole inactivated Hepatitis A virus Whole inactivated Influenza virus Whole inactivated Rabies Whole inactivated Yellow Fever Live attenuated Smallpox 1.C.1. Introduction to Subunit Vaccines Subunit vaccines can be composed of either peptides or proteins that are prepared either from virus, a recombinant source, or synthetically as in the case in the case of peptides. Unlike live att enuated and whole -inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines are not considered to be dangerous. Based on its modality, subunit protein vaccines are generally considered to better at eliciting both helper T cell responses as opposed to cytotoxic T cell respon ses and antibody responses.13 There are several differences between and characteristics of subunit vaccines based on peptides and those based on whole proteins. (Refer to Figure 1 for a comparison of protein and peptide subunit vaccines). First, peptide s can more quickly and easily be obtained in greater amounts than whole proteins. Second, unlike whole proteins, purer forms of peptides can be obtained. Third, peptides may be able to elicit both helper T cell and cytotoxic T cell responses. Fourth, in peptide vaccines, known CTL and helper T cell epitopes can be specifically utilized to direct the immune response. However, peptides vaccines used for one person may not affect or help a different person with a dissimilar HLA haplotype as T cell epitope s are restricted to the genetic haplotype of the individual person's MHC. Fifth, HIV is likely to more easily escape an immune response based on a peptide vaccine than a whole protein vaccine because peptide vaccines cause immune reactions against less e pitopes.14 Sixth, an advantage of whole proteins over peptides is that no prior studies on the HLA typing and epitope mapping is required. Finally, unlike peptides, proteins are proficient at eliciting potent humoral immune responses.15 Figure 1: Compa rison of protein - and peptide -based subunit vaccines. helper T cell, B= B -cell, and C= cytotoxic T cell epitopes.16 13 Id. 14 Id. at 246. 15 Id. at 247. 16 Id. at 246. 12 1.C.2. Pr otein/Envelope Subunit Vaccines Envelope glycoprotein is the only protein that is exposed on the surface of HIV - 1 virions and can elicit Nab response.17 (Refer to Table 2 for vaccine candidates). \"Native\" Glycosylation site mutants CD4 independent complexes Envelope with truncated gp41 cytoplasmic domain Polyvalent envelope vaccines Large collec tion of envelopes Consensus or ancestor sequence(s) Combinatorial strategies Live vector gp160 + gp140 and Peptide -based envelope immunogens and vaccine strategies18 Because a large portion of the HIV -1 envelope glycoprotein surface is covered with areas that cause either a reduced or an isolated incident antibody response, research has considered strategies of eliciting more broadly reactive Nabs. These strategies include the use of fusion intermediates, glycosylation site -mutated envelopes, CD4 -indepen dent envelopes and variable loop -deleted envelopes. (Figure 2 below illustrates these strategies). The fusion intermediate strategy involves the interactions between CD4, envelope glycoprotein and chemokine receptors. The CD4 -independent envelope strate gy may be able to cause antibody responses against the conserved coreceptor - binding domain.19 The theory behind the variable loop -deleted envelopes strategy is that the deletion of variable loops V1/V2 and V3 improves binding of Nabs directed 17 Id. at 247. 18 Id. at 248. 19 Id. at 249. 13 against th e CD4 -binding region. However, as of now, only two variable loop -deleted HIV-1 envelopes have been found to be functional. Finally, the glycosylation site mutant strategy requires the use of deglycosylated envelope proteins as immunogens to provide a means of increasing highly reactive Nabs.20 Figure 2: Strategies that are being explored to induce broadly cross -reactive Nabs.21 Two alternative strategies to those listed above include polyvalent envelope vaccines and oligomeric envelopes. Polyvalent envelope vaccines cause expand B cells which target conserved regions of envelope, and hopefully result in more reactive Nabs.22 Oligomeric envelopes, on the other hand, may potentially serve as superior immunogens than monomeric forms in eliciting Nab s.23 2. Peptides 2.A. Peptide Formulas A peptide is a series of amino acids linked together by a peptide bond, a chemical bond between the carbonyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid.24 Polypeptides are large sequences o f amino acids; however, a sequence of 20 Id. at 250. 21 Id. at 249. 22 Id. at 251. 23 Id. at 253. 24 BRUCE ALBERTS ET AL ., ESSENTIAL CELL BIOLOGY 74-75 (2d ed. 2004). 14 more than 50 amino acids is generally considered to be a protein.25 Below (Figure 3) are the 20 amino acids found in peptides: Fig. 3: Amino Acid Structures26 Problems using peptides in vaccines against HIV stem f rom the diversity of HIV, the human leukocyte diversity antigens (HLA), which are associated with presenting antigens to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and the ability to stimulate the long -term memory of the immune system.27 In order to combat these challenges, r esearchers suggest that therapeutic immunogens should contain multiple epitopes to ensure sufficient potential to target a diversity of virus strains and HLA. Efforts to maximize the number of available epitopes include attempts to artificially string tog ether multiple epitopes as well as 25 Id. at 120. 26 New England Biolabs Inc., http:/ /www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/general_data/ amino_acid_structures . asp (last 2009).

Problems with these techniques may arise where this leads to functional epitopes that are unrelated to HIV, possibly affecting immunogenicity.28 Other strategies to get around the complexity of HIV related immune responses include enhancing the effectiveness of peptide therapeutics by glycosylation, amino -acid- sequence modification, pegylation and cyclization. Additionally, several studies have explored modifications that not only provide subtle conformational changes to the peptide/MHC structure as well as incorporating resistances against proteases. This includes incorporations of -amino -acids into epitopes to increase the binding affinity of the mimetic for the MHC molecule relative to the wild type peptide.29 Refer to Figu re 4. Figure 4: Non -natural -acid Modifications in Peptide Vaccines30 2.B. Epitopes and Epitope Based Vaccines for HIV I nfection With the spread of AIDS still rampant in many parts of the world, there is an urgency to develop a vaccine against HI V. Developing an effective vaccine against the 28 Id. at 750. 29 Anthony Purcell et al., More Than One Reason to Rethink the Use of Peptides in Vaccine Design , 6 NATURE REVIEWS : DRUG DISCOVERY 404, 411 (2007). 30 Id. at 412. 16 virus has been a scientific challenge.31 Although advances in molecular biology and biotechnology over the years have enabled the generation of designer antigens, the ability to transform them into successf ul vaccine candidates has been limiting.32 The development of vaccines and their subsequent use as preventive vaccines was one of the most important developments in medicine.33 Vaccines make use of the adaptive part of the human immune system to protect fr om future infections (prophylactic or preventive vaccines) as well as to fight chronic diseases (therapeutic vaccines).34 Cellular adaptive immunity is triggered by the recognition of immunogenic peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Cla ss I and II molecules by T -cell receptors located on the surface of T cells.35 These peptides are derived from antigens, i.e., proteins that can cause an immune response, as a result of rather complex antigen processing pathways in vivo. Peptides capable of causing such an immune response are called epitopes and represent the smallest subunits that may be used therapeutically.36 An epitope is a localized region on the surface of an antigen that is capable of eliciting an immune response and of combining wi th a specific antibody to counter that response.37 Also, a n epitope is a short sequence of amino acids, which the immune system can recognize and react against. Such short sequences of amino acids are called peptides. Proteins, by contrast, are very long sequences of amino acids, sometimes with a length of more than a thousand amino acids. A polyepitope is a chain of epitopes.38 A B cell epitope is an antigenic determinant recognized and bound by the B -cell receptor and isolated on the surface of the ant igen.39 A T-cell epitope is an antigenic determinant recognized and bound by the T -cell receptor and is located in the inner, unexposed side of the antigen, and become accessible to the T -cell receptors after proteolytic processing of the antigen.40 The u se of epitope based peptide vaccines as therapeutics is a preferable mode because of advances in their delivery, stability and design.41 As synthetic entities, peptide based vaccines are simple because they can be administered directly without a need for a replicating vector. HIV shows extensive genetic diversity and has the ability to escape immunological pressure through mutation of both potential neutralizing domains for antibody responses as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes for cell 31 Cho, supra note 5, at 243. 32 Id. 33 Nora C.

Peptides can also be synthesized with known post -translational modifications and/or deliberately introduced protease -resistant peptide bonds to regulate their processing independent of tissue -specific proteolysis and to stabilize these compounds in vivo .43 There are numerous options for constructing a vaccine once a set of potential antigens is known. The antigens or parts thereof can be used as intact proteins, they can be administered as RNA or DNA coding for the antigen or the epitopes contained in the antigens may be used for vaccines.44 Skilled selection of epitopes can precisely direct the evoked immune response at conserved and highly immunogenic regions of several antigens. Due to these advantages and the applicability in personalized vaccination, EVs have recently been getting more and more attention.45 42 Sommerfelt & Sorensen, supra note 27 , at 749. 43 Purcell et al., supra note 29 , at 404. 44 Toussaint et al., supra note 33 , at 1. 45 Id. 18 2.C. Peptide Conjugate Vaccine and the Immune Response Fig. 5 : A Flowchart of Both the Humoral Immune Respon se and the Cellular Immune R esponse46 A peptide conjugate vaccine is created by covalently attaching a poor antigen to a carrier protein, thereby conferring the immunological attributes of the carrier on the attached antigen. This technique is generally e ffective to prevent infection of bacteria and viruses. A peptide conjugate vaccine can be use d to trigger either a cellular immune response or a humoral immune response.47 Normally, an immune response is triggered by an uptake of immunogen or antigen by an antigen presenting cell (APC).48 The antigen or immunogen undergoes proteolysis to form peptides that bind to Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC II) molecules.49 This covalent bond moves to the surface of the APC for T -helper (Th or CD4+) cel ls to detect. When a T h cell detects and binds to MHC II on the APC, the T h sends out signaling molecules that cause proliferation of B cells and cytotoxic T (Tc or CD8+) cells.50 Interestingly, the immune system can follow two different paths 46 Dr. Jon Robertus, Overall Immune Response, available at http://courses.cm.utexas.edu/j robertus/ch339k/ overheads . al., supra note 29 , at 404. 49 Id. at 405. 50 Id. at 407. 19 after this point. The humoral immune response or the cellular immune response can cause the elimination of virus or bacteria through different mechanisms. During a humoral immune response, B cells also ingest the antigen by reacting with the B cell's antibody. In side the B cell, the antigen undergoes proteolysis to form peptides that bind with MHC II and once again move to the surface of the B cell. T h cells that bind with APCs activate T h to bind with the MHC II on the B cell. This causes the B cell to prolifera te and differentiate into antibody producing plasma cells or B -memory cells. These antibody producing plasma cells will lower the amount of antigen and protect the body.51 During a cellular immune response, the virus or bacterial infects a cell. The viru s or bacteria is then degraded to form peptides. These peptides then complex to Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) molecules and move to the surface of the infected cell. T c cells interact with the infected cell by recognizing both the anti gen and the MHC I molecule. This interaction causes the T c to release toxins that induce apoptosis in the infected cell. Once the infected cell dies, the T c cell detaches and looks for another infected cell with MHC I and the antigen displayed on the surface.52 A peptide conjugate vaccine takes advantage of the fact that both these processes require peptides to attach to the MHC I or MHC II to display the antigens. Antigens are recognized by the immune system as foreign substances. Antibodies are not ma de against the entire antigen but specific chemical groups known as antigenic determinants or epitopes. Many antibodies can be made in the body, each antibody reacts with a different epitope. Antigens have different epitopes on their surfaces that bind w ith a specific antibody.53 HIV is a troublesome virus because it is constantly changing and cannot be fully removed by the immune system. A benefit of a peptide conjugate vaccine is that it looks for common peptides/epitopes that exist within HIV infected cell. By knowing which peptide bonds to the binding cleft of MHC I and MHC II, a specific antibody showing specific epitopes can be formed and target HIV infected cells.54 Understanding the structure of MHC I and MHC II helps when generating a peptide -conjugate vaccine. An MHC I molecule contains a polymorphic heavy chai n and a monomorphic light chain: (2 microgobulin) and a antigenic peptide ligand. The heavy chain contains an antigen -binding groove that attaches to antigenic peptides , typically 8 - 10 amino acids in length. Based on specific amino acids that project out of the binding cleft, the speci ficity of allelic form of bound peptides to MHC can be determined. This allows one to display specific antibodies on the infected cell.55 On the other hand, the structure of MHC II molecules differs from the structure of MHC I molecules . MHC II 51 Id. at 405. 52 Id. at 407. 53 WebMD Antibody. http://dictionary.webmd.c om/terms/antibody(ab) (last visited Feb. 15, 2009). 54 Purcell et al., supra note 29 , at 405. 55 Id. at 408. 20 molecules contain two polymorphic heavy chains ( and ) that form a heterodimer (). This heterodimer forms a binding cleft that attaches to the peptide antigen. Peptides that attach to the MHC II are typically longer, 13 amino acids in length. Typically, residues 1, 4, 6 and 9 which attach to the class II bound peptide typically interact with the binding cleft. Generating peptide -epitopes that bind to a specific region of the MHC II will allow for specificity in the humoral immune response.56 A synthetic peptide -epitope vaccine offer s several advantages such as safety in use and ease of production. However, this type of vaccine also has drawbacks such as poor immunogenicity of the simple peptides and the need to potently stimulate T cells and immunological memory. These peptide vaccines are also limited to specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes which results in vaccine specialized for different types of individuals. Furthermore, there are multiple peptides that are present within the body and hence the mo dified peptide might not follow the same pathway as a natural peptide of the HIV virus . In order to reduce these issues, different conjugates may be used to covalently attach to the peptide -epitope and increase the ability of the peptide - epitope to attach to either a MHC I or a MHC II compound.57 2.D. Peptide Screening As Peptides can be efficiently processed and presented on MHC class I molecule they have been successfully used to elicit CTL immune response.58 Peptides have also been shown to elicit hig hly protective mucous immunity.59 Studies show that V3 loop peptides have been unsuccessful in eliciting broadly reactive Nabs.60 In developing a protective HIV -1 vaccine epitopes which are capable of inducing broad neutralizing Ab responses are to be i dentified and various methods have been made employed to identify these epitopes.61 The high mutation rate in HIV -1 envelope proteins and the complex structure of gp120 as an oligomer along with gp41 results in a high degree of antigenic polymorphism.62 To overcome these obstacles, random peptide libraries are screened using sera from HIV -infected subjects to identify antigenic and immunogenic mimics of HIV -1 epitopes.63 56 Id. at 409. 57 Id. at 407. 58 Cho, supra note 5 , at 255. 59 Id. 60 Id. 61 Giuseppe Scala et al, Selection of HIV -Specific Immunogenic Epitopes by Scree ning Random Peptide Sera , 162 J. IMMUNOLOGY 6155, Using Phage -Displayed Random Peptide Library (RPL) Many methods are used for the selection of peptides binding a target molecule by means of screening large RPL.64 The objective of screening is to identify antigenic peptides that bind HIV -1-specific antibodies from a large pool of random peptides so tha t the peptides in turn could be used as immunogens to elicit antibodies with properties similar to the initial antibody used to screen random peptides.65 Refer to Figure 6 for two approaches to elicit Nabs using random peptide libraries: (A) Peptides that bind immune sera and (B) peptides that bind IgG b12.66 FIG 6: Schematic Diagram of Two Approaches to Elicit Nabs Using RPL67 2.D.2. Selecting Peptides from a Phase Displayed RPL Phage display is a simple functional genomic methodology for screening a nd identifying protein -ligand interactions and is widely used in epitope mapping and in screening for receptor agonists.68 Phage display is also used in various forms, to identify peptide -ligand and protein -ligand interactions that are of importance in infection.69 Random peptide libraries are screened using sera from HIV -infected subjects to identify antigenic and immunogenic mimics of HIV -1 epitopes.70 Further they are counter -screened with HIV -negative sera, peptides specifically recognized by Abs from HIV -1-infected individuals are isolated.71 Results shows that pools of HIV -1 64 Cho, supra note 5 , at 256. 65 Id. 66 Id. at 255. 67 Id. 68 Lisa M.

Antibodies to HIV 3.A. Antibod ies Overview Antibodies are blood -borne proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that play an essential role in the humoral immune response. Antibodies are directed against foreign materials primarily situated outside of the cells of the body such as the protein and polysaccharide components of bacterial cell walls, bacterial toxins, and viral coat proteins.75 The immune system produces millions of different antibody molecules that have the ability to bind to any type of foreign material to which t he body becomes exposed.76 The antibody reacts specifically with a foreign substance called an antigen which consists of proteins or polysaccharides.77 Humoral immunity is mediated by B lymphocytes or B cells. B cells incorporate antibody molecules into t heir plasma membrane to serve as receptors for antigen. Once an individual is infected with a virus or bacterium, B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies into the bodily fluids which soon becomes saturated with a high concentration of antibodies capable of reacting with the foreign substance.78 See Figure 7. 72 Id. 73 Id. 74 Id. 75 GERALD KARP, CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY : CONCEPTS AND EXPERIMENTS 706 (3d ed. 2002). 76 Id. at 712. 77 Id. at 707. 78 Id. at 707. 23 Figure 779 Antibodies are globular proteins built of two types of polypeptide chains, larger heavy chains and smaller light chains.

This combining site additionally had a complementary stereochemical structure to a particular portion of the antigen, which is termed the antigenic determinant or ep itope. An antigen can contain a number of different epitopes that can stimulate the production of a variety of different antibodies.84 3.B. Antibodies and Vaccine Design The most effective vaccines work by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutrali ze the invading virus.85 Identifying the antigens or epitopes which the immune system can effectively target is critical for designing the optimal and most effective vaccine and for monitoring the immunological effects of vaccination throughout the develop ment of the vaccine product.86 3.B.1. HIV Vaccine Design Problems The main obstacles to developing an immune response against HIV are the large genetic variation among HIV -1 strains worldwide, the virus' sophisticated shielding mechanisms and a failure t hus far to elicit a broadly reactive neutralization against native structures of the virus. Specifically, the virus chronically replicates in the host and evades the humoral immune response through extensive glycosylation of its surface proteins.87 Furthe r, a large proportion of the HIV -1 envelope protein surface is covered with regions that elicit a poor antibody response.88 To induce an effective neutralizing antibody response a vaccine must deliver the epitopes t hat both possess favorable properties fo r B cell inductive pathways and are available for high affinity antibody binding and esearch indicates that v iral epitopes that are conserved among most viral strains are more likely to generate cross -reactive antibodies.89 3.B.2. Prophylactic Use of Antibo dies Neutralizing antibodies are more effective as a prophylactic agent rather than a therapeutic agent. Several animal studies indicate that when present in sufficient amounts prior to exposure, neutralizing antibodies can be highly protective. However , it has been extremely difficult to elicit antibodies that are broadly reactive against HIV.90 A number of strategies are being investigated in order to elicit such a response and 83 Karp, supra note 75 , at 714. 84 Id. at 715. 85 David Montefiori et al., Antibody -Based HI V-1 Vaccines: Recent Developments and Future Directions , 4 PUBLIC LIBRARY OF SCIENCE 1867, 1867 (2007). 86 Nikolai Schwabe & Amanda Turner, Hastening Epitope Discovery for Vaccines , GENETIC ENGINEERING & BIOTECHNOLOGY NEWS (Feb. 15, 2008), available at http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chtitem.aspx? tid=2374&chid=1 . 87 Cho, supra note 5 et al., supra note 85 , at 1867. 88 Cho, supra note 5 , at 248. 89 Montefior et al., supra note 85 , at 1868. 90 Cho, supra note 5 , at 247. 25 include the use of CD4 -independent envelopes, fusion intermediates, variabl e loop - deleted envelopes and glycosylation site -mutated envelopes. These strategies are aimed at using envelope constructs that have exposed conserved regions, like receptor -binding domains, such that they can be targeted by the humoral immune system. 91 The main targets for eliciting the neutralizing antibodies are the surface gp120 and trans -membrane gp41envelope glycoproteins which mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion events that facilitate the entry of the virus into cells, such as CD4+ T cells. 92 See Figure 9. Figure 993 The antibodies neutralize HIV by binding to these constructs and thus blocking the entry of the virus into cells. However, c linical studies have failed to demonstrate that immunization with the gp 120 surface unit leads to the induction of broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies.94 More promising is the membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of the gp41 unit which lies at the base of HIV's envelope protein and is consistent across different str ains of the virus .95 Though research has yet to show a strong neutralizing response for this region, newly discovered features of MPER may be useful future targets for antibody -based vaccines .96 91 Id. at 248. 92 Montefiori et al., supra note 85 , at 1867. 93 HIV-1 Virion, http://www.web -books.com/eLibrary/Medic ine/Infectious/Images/HIV.jpg (last visited Mar. 10, 2009). 94 Montefiori et al., supra note 85 , at 1867. 95 New Target For Antibody -based Vaccine Identified (Jan. 10, 2008), http://huehueteotl.wordpress.com/2008/ 01/12/new -target -for-hiv-antibody -based -vaccine 3.B.3. Therapeutic Use of Antibodies97 After years of focus ing on adenoviral therapies, the concept of developing a passive immune therapy to combat HIV has been bolstered by animal studies using the macaque model showing that neutralizing antibodies could prevent infection with the chimeric simian -human immunodef iciency virus (SHIV). These animal studies strongly support the idea that neutralizing antibodies may be able to prevent HIV -1 infection in humans when present in sufficient amounts before or shortly after exposure to the virus. However, although animal studies have indicated promise in preventative therapies using neutralizing antibodies, conclusive evidence of a therapeutic use that may be effective in established infections is still lacking. 3.C. Antibodies and Peptide Libraries To be effective in a vaccine, any peptide component must be immunologically fit; when used as immunogens, the peptides must elicit antibodies that cross -react with the native intact pathogen. For the identification of and measuring effectiveness of peptides for use as immunog ens, peptide libraries are a promising tool for subunit vaccine design.98 From the HIV research perspective, the overall goal of screening peptide libraries is to identify antigenic peptides that bind HIV -1-specific antibodies from a large pool of random p eptides. The peptides identified could then be used to elicit antibodies with properties similar to the original antibody used to screen for the random peptides.99 A peptide library is a large collection of different peptides consisting of a systematic co llection of amino acids and can be synthesized on a solid phase, mostly on resin, which can be a flat surface or beads.100 There are different types of peptide libraries such as random peptide libraries (RPL) and natural peptide libraries (NPL). Random pep tide libraries are those which have phage -displayed peptides encoded by synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts. Alternatively, natural peptide libraries have phage particle display fragments of natural pathogen proteins encoded by short DNA f ragments of the pathogen genome.101 Peptide libraries have a number of applications such as describing variations of antibody specificity, identifying bioactive peptides, generating synthetic vaccines, and purifying proteins.102 For HIV research using random peptide libraries, antibodies with desired properties are prepared from either HIV -1 infected patients or from monoclonal 97 Gabriela Stiegler & Hermann Katinger, Therapeutic Potential of Neutralizing Antibodies in the Treatment of HIV -1 Infection , 51 J.

HIV Genome The Genome of HIV is a single -stranded positive sense RNA molecule about 9.5 kb in length. The HIV genome has 9 genes: gag, pol, env, tat, rev, nef , vif, vpr, and vpu. See Figure 1. Among these genes, gag (encoding core proteins), pol (encoding protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase), and env (encoding envelope protein gp160, which eventually cleaved into an external gp120 subunit and a tra nsmembrane gp41 subunit) are structural genes. The other 6 genes are non -structural genes. Tat and rev are regulatory genes involved in controlling the expression of one or more other genes. Nef, vif, vpr, and vpu are accessory genes. 106 103 Cho, supra note 5 , at 255. 104 Id. 105 Id. 106 Marc P. Girard et al., A Review of Vaccine Research and Development: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , 24 VACCINE 4062, 4069 (2006). 28 Figure 1 1107 4.B. Tat Tat is short for transactivator. Tat binds to the Transactivator Active Region (TAR), located at the 5'terminus of HIV RNA strands, and activates the transcription of the remainder of the HIV genome. Regulatory genes, including tat, are cru cial to HIV replication in infected cells. In the absence of Tat, HIV is still able to infect the cell, but HIV completely fails to replicate itself. Tat is expressed very early after the HIV infection, even before the virus integrates with the host cell 's genetic machinery. Tat is released by acutely HIV -infected T -cells and helps to recruit and activate uninfected cells. This mechanism helps to spread the HIV infection throughout the body.108 As shown in Figure 1 1, Tat protein is encoded by 2 exons located near the center of the viral genome. The wild -type Tat protein is composed of 101 amino acids. Residues 1 -72 are encoded by the first exon and residues 73 -101 are encoded by the second exon.109 Tat protein can be subdivided into five distinct functio nal regions on the basis of its amino acid composition: a N -terminal activation region, a cysteine -rich domain, a core region, a basic region, and -rich region.110 Exon 2 encodes Figure 12. The N -terminal region binds to the T -cell activation marker CD26 and T -cell receptor CCR2.112 This region has also been considered to inhibit important regulators of the immune response and impair the T -cell function.113 Cysteine -rich region is considered to be involved in metal ion binding.114 107 ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/ (then follow 00.061.1.06.009.

Amino acid residues in this region are considered to for m an alpha -helix structure which enhances Tat -TAR binding.117 The most studied region of Tat is the Basic region, which contains a highly -conserved RKKRRQRRR motif. This peptide motif is essential for binding to the TAR of RNA.118 The RGD motif in the C -terminal region is proposed to mediate interaction of Tat with cell surface proteins including integrins.119 Instead of the wild -type composed of 101 amino acids, an 86 -amino acid form of Tat has been frequently used in laboratories. In a few laboratory viru s strains of HIV (e.g. LAI, HXB2, pNL4 -3), a single nucleotide change at putative residue 87 creates a premature termination codon, which results in a truncated protein. An 86 -amino acid version is sufficient for virus replication in vitro. Although resi dues of 87 -101 of Tat might not contribute greatly to the ex vivo replication of HIV, their conservation in the wild-type strains may indicate their biological importance.120 Figure 12121 114 Jonathan Karn, Tat, a Novel Regulator of HIV Transcription and Latency , available at http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/COMPENDIUM/2000/partI/Karn.pdf . 115 Koken SE et al., Intracellular Analysis of In Virto Modified HIV Tat Protein , 269 J.

Developmen t of Tat -based V accines Over the past 20 years, En v protein has been used for HIV vaccine development, in an attempt to induce anti -Env antibodies that are capable of neutralizing the HIV infection. However, Env is difficult to neutralize because envelope proteins mutate rapidly and have the extreme cros s-clade variability. The HIV infections elicit antibodies to neutralize Env, but these responses tend to be against only to the sequences unique to the Env that triggered the antibody response.122 This is similar to what happens with influenza each year, bu t HIV mutates much faster than influenza virus. One study shows that for broadly neutralizing flu monoclonals, 50% neutralization can be achieved with 10-100ng of antibody, while for broadly neutralizing HIV -1 monoclonals, even 50ug of antibody frequently fails to achieve 50% neutralization of the original isolates.123 Several features of Tat make it a good candidate for HIV vaccines. First, unlike the structural HIV -1 proteins such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which are expressed later in the viral life cycle, Tat is more frequently found in the early stage of the disease than during the symptomatic stages.124 Thus, the presence of anti -Tat antibodies seems to protect infected individuals from progressing to AIDS.125 Second, anti -Tat cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) are frequently found in individuals who are infected naturally by HIV. Despite the small size of protein, multiple CTL epitopes have been identified in Tat, and it is considered that Tat is an important target for the T -cell immune response.126 Third, the immunogenic regions of Tat are more conserved among the different HIV-1 clades than the Env protein. The parts of the protein that are recognized by the immune system (i.e. epitopes) do not change much over the course of infection. In a study usi ng serum samples from HIV -infected Italian, Ugandan, and South African subjects, it was indicated that the immunogenic and functional domains of Tat were well conserved among distinct HIV -1 subtypes and had a high degree of similarity with the correspondin g sequence of Tat from a laboratory isolate.127 Thus, it is suggested that a Tat vaccine may be useful in different geographic areas of the world.128 Fourth, biologically active Tat has immunomodulatory features that make it an attractive adjuvant. An adjuv ant is a substance included in a vaccine formulation to 122 HIV-1 TAT Vaccines, supra note 108 . 123 Harriet L. Robinson, HIV/AIDS Vaccines , 82 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS 686, 687 (2007). 124 Stefano Butto et al., Sequence Conservation and Antibody Cross -Recognition of Clade B Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Type 1 Tat Protein in HIV -1-Infected Ita lians, Ugandans, and South Africans , 188 J.

In that study, m ice immunized with Gag alone respond to 6 different Gag - derived T cell epitopes, whereas mice immunized with Gag and Tat responded to 11 different T cell epitopes. Similarly, mice vaccinated with Env in combination with Tat responded to 17 peptides, 12 mor e than mice vaccinated with Env alone.130 Thus, Tat is not only an antigen, but also a novel and potent adjuvant capable of broadening the spectrum of epitopes recognized by T cells.131 Lastly, Tat can be used both as preventive and therapeutic vaccine. Sin ce Tat is necessary for the HIV replication, it may block the initial cycles of virus replication and prevent HIV spread in the organism. It can also be used as a therapeutic one because reduction of viral replication can slow or block disease progression in HIV -infected individuals.132 Tat-based vaccines have been tested in pre -clinical studies by using different animal models, including mice, rabbits, and macaques. Immunization with Tat protected macaques against SHIV infection or resulted in attenuate d virus replication in the animals.133 SHIV is a SIV/HIV hybrid virus that is genetically engineered to carry an HIV env envelope and SIV core.134 A study conducted in SHIV -infected macaques indicated that vaccination with a biologically active Tat protein o r tat DNA is safe. Preclinical studies in monkeys also indicate that the Tat/Env combination is safe and enhances the immune -response to the single components.135 The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) has been sponsored Phase I clinical trials in Italy. A Phase I clinical trial of a subunit Tat vaccine was carried out in Italy on HIV seropositive and HIV negative volunteers. The trial showed that the vaccine was well-tolerated and immunogenic.136 Phase II trials are being prepared in Italy, Ugand a, and South Africa. Phase I studies of Tat/Env vaccines are also being prepared by the Italian scientists.137 129 HIV-1 TAT Vaccines, http://www.hiv1tat -vaccines.info/science_dictionary.htm (then follow adjuvant) (last visited Feb. 18, 2009 ). 130 Riccardo Gavioli et al., The Tat Protein Broadens T cell Responses Directed to the HIV -1 Antigens Gag and Env: Implications for the Design of N ew Vaccination Strategies Against AIDS , 26 VACCINE 727, 727 (2008). 131 HIV-1 TAT Vaccines, supra note 108 . 132 Id. 133 Girard et al., supra note 106 , at 4068. 134 HIV-1 TAT Vaccines, supra note 129 (then follow SHIV) (last visited Feb. 18, 2009 ) 135 HIV-1 TAT V accines, supra note 108 . 136 Girard et al., supra note 106 , at 4068. 137 HIV-1 TAT Vaccines, supra note 108 . 32 II. Patent Search Methodology and Results 1. Patent Search Methodology The International Technology Transfer Institute began on January 12, 2009 with a conference call between the c linic members, Professor Jon Cavicchi, Dr. Stanley Kowalski and Dr. Kerri Clark (the clinic contact person at PIPRA ). The scope of the project was defined as conducting a patent landscape analysis of technologies pertaining to protein/ peptide vaccines applicable to HIV. The team began by reviewing past and recent literature relating to HIV vaccines and , in particular , to developing protein /peptides vaccines. The seven -member team was divid ed into two groups. E ach group was headed by a team leader whom the project leader oversaw. The group s were assigned to research and present on different aspects of peptide/ protein vaccines. The topics were separated into four main categories, each category assigned to a dif ferent team member/group. The four categories were: 1) 2) Peptide a) Formulae b) Epitopes c) Conjugates d) Screening 3) Antibodies (screening tool) a) Antibodies to HIV - Screen peptide library b) Antibodies to HIV - as vaccine 4) TAT -based vaccines Recent literature and articles were utilized to determine keywords, especially keywords specific to each topic. These keywords were then used to do preli minary searches on Delphion a nd/or the USPTO. Group pres entations on the above categories gave t eam members initial exposure to the research topic and insight into necessary terminology . The team s then commenced an intense four -month journey of patent searching and coding. Delphion was the primary patent se arching database used by the team members . In addition to a general protei n/peptide vaccine search, each group was assigned to search for patents relating to the aspect of antibodies, peptide screening method s and TAT -based vaccines. The search methodo logy was devised to initially generate a broad set of patents and then to narrow down the results using the Iterative Search Approach, as promoted by Professor Cavicchi. 33 These searches utilized keywords derived from the literature reviewed and initial searches to generate useful search strings; the searches also used United States Patent Classifications, International Patent Classificat ions and Derwent Classifications that were identified through subsequent searches and team meetings. The combination o f keywords, inventor/assignee names and classifications in search strings was useful for parsing the technology into compartments and allowing each team member to generate a different set of search results that keywords alone could not provide. This appro ach generated a broad set of patents. From here, k eywords and classifications generated from this broad set of patents were used in subsequent rounds of searching. After each round of searching, team meetings would identify the most important keywords, i nventor names, assignee names, and classifications for use in subsequent search strings that became more defined and effective. The initial keywords used in the four main categories in the subsequent search round were: - First category ( assigned to search for subunit (envelope) proteins ): o Protein, vaccine, HIV, human im munodeficiency virus, subunit, sequence, formula , composition, lentivirus. - Second category (assigned to s earch for patents relating peptide and sub -category and screening method): o Protein, peptide, polypeptide, sequence, formula, HIV, vaccine, immune response, epitope*, HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, vaccine , amino acids, vacc ines, human immunodeficiency virus, conjugates, screening. - Third category (assigned to search for patents relating to a ntibodies (screening tool)): o HIV, human immunodeficiency amino acids, cytotoxic, humoral. - Fourth category (assigned to search for patents relating to TAT -based vaccines): o HIV, human immunodeficiency virus, vaccine* , tat, regulat*, antibody regulation, env, amin o acid, ctl, cytotoxic. Most of these keywords were searched using the s earch field of Title, Abstract Claims within Delphion since searches under the field of Description or Specification were found to be too broad . It was useful to limit each sea rch using the most important keywords under the search field of Claims. The keywords above were then co mbined with U.S. classifications and subclasses, International patent classifications and subclasses and Derwent classes to generate different sets of search results. Some of the most common classifications used were US Classifications 424/184.1, . The top assignees and inventor s varied widely with each category. 34 The search strings gave the team an outcome of more than 2144 patents, which was then de -duplicated using the family option in MicroPatent\u00ae into 1200 patents (de - duplication refers to the removal of patents within the s ame family so as to reduce redundancy in patent coding) and finally manually reduced to 954 patents . The search results were then assembled together and extracted into PDF files for coding and into Excel spreadsheets for data analysis. The subsequent dat a analyzed were placed into a Master Sheet. The 954 patent documents were divided among the seven team members for coding. Each team member analyzed the claims in the documents and coded under one of the following seven categories . 1. Prime Boost 2. Protein 3. Peptide 4. Peptide Formulas 5. Epitopes 6. Conjugates 7. Peptide Screening 8. Antibodies to HIV 9. Antibodies Screening Library 10. Tat -based Vaccine 11. Therapeutic v. Prophylactic Each patent was initially coded by individual team members and emphasis was placed on claim language in order to determine whether the patent was relevant to peptide/protein vaccine for HIV. When coding, team members also took consideration of the patent's title, abstract, and additional information (including the as signee, inventor and IPC/US classification codes). Each relevant patent (relevancy determined by the initial team member coding that patent) was then reviewed by the entire team and Dr. Kowalski and each patent was re -coded according to their relevancy. Of the 954 patents, 350 patents were found to be relevant. The coding results were inserted into a Master Sheet demonstrating which categories were relevant to each individual patent. 35 2.

Patent Search Results Spreadsheet Summary 3.1. Categorization Summary Patent documents on peptide vaccines generally fall into 11 categories: (1) Prime Boost (2) Protein (3), Peptide (4) Peptid e Formulation (5) Epitopes (6) Conjugates (7) Peptide Screening (8) Antibodies to HIV (9) Antibodies Screening Library (10) Tat -based Vaccine (11) Therapeutic v. Prophylactic. 1. The Prime Boost category contains patent documents138 that are classified as peptide vaccines which enhance the immune response to HIV by repeated administration, a phenomenon called boosting. Typically, the first administration of the vaccine is prime element where you infect the patient with an initial dose. The following treat ments of vaccine are classified as the boost element of the vaccine. This method is usually used when a single administration of a peptide vaccine is not sufficiently strong or sustained to provide effective protection. Interestingly, priming a patient with a live attenuated HIV is generally considered too risky for uninfected people because there is an increasing chance of becoming infected with HIV. However, many studies show that it is possible to develop a preventative vaccine using prime boosting of components of a partially split HIV, rather than the live attenuated virus.139 2. The Proteins category contains patents that are defined as whole proteins that are utilized in a protein vaccine for HIV. Generally, protein vaccine s incorporate proteins t hat are utilized to induce an autoimmune response to HIV. These patents are limited to only proteins and not polypeptides. Although it may be difficult to determine when a polypeptide can be large enough to be classified as a protein, for the purposes of this report this group is limited to only whole proteins described in patent that ind uce an immune response for HIV. 3. The Peptide category is comprised of patents that claim either peptides, polypeptides or a composition that comprises a chain of amino acids for peptide vaccines. Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked together by peptide 138 Patent documents include US patents; US patent applications; WIPO PCT applications; Japanese patents; European patents, European 139 Laurence Peiperl, Why Prime -Boost?, http://chi.ucsf.edu/vaccine/vaccines?page=vc -05-01 (last visited April 19, 2009). 69 bonds.140 Generally, peptides have fewer than 40 amino acids and can act as hormones and neurotransmitters. Polypeptides are generally longer chains of at least 50 amino acids. For the development of a useful peptide vaccine, a potential candidate peptides are identified through either cytolysis or by an APC (Antigen Presenting Cells) ingesting a HIV and breaking it down. For the purposes of this report, polyp eptides are classified under the Peptide rather than under the Protein section. 4. Peptide/Protein Formula tion category contains patents that claim a combination of peptides or proteins are used as a peptide or protein vaccine. These patents generally suggest that one or more peptides or proteins can be used in conjunction to create a peptide or protein vaccine. Typical claim language will characterize a peptide/protein formula as at least one peptide that can be us ed in any combination thereof. 5. Epitopes category contains patents pertaining to a region on the surface of an antigen molecule which the antibody attaches itself.141 HIV has both good and bad epitopes.142 Bad epitopes waste the immune response reaction while good epitopes promote a correct response to HIV.143 Since HIV is rapidly mutating, a good epitope can be found in regions where the virus maintains the same structure. Furthermore, HLA -HIV associations144 can also suggest the location of good epitopes to use for peptide vaccines for HIV.145 6. The Conjugate category contains patents that claim a covalently attached protein carrier that elicit a sufficient immune response. Typically, peptides alone are too small to induce a sufficient immune response.146 Therefore, carrier proteins, such as KL H147, BSA148 and OVA149 that contain many epitopes are used to generate T -helper cells, which induce the B -cell response.150 This group is limited to only fusion proteins and carriers and does not include any common 140 Peptides http://www.vitaminstuff.com/definitions/definitions41.html (last visited April 19, 2009). 141 Epitope. http://www.thefreedictionary.com /Epitopes (lasted visited April 19, 2009). 142 David Heckerman et al. , Graphical Models for HIV vaccine design , available at https:// velblod.videolectures.net/2007/pascal/icml07_corvallis/heckerman_david/icml07_heckerman_gmhi _01.pptx (2007). 143 Id. 144 HLA ( Human Leukocyte Antigen s) is a g enetic designation for the human major histocompatibili ty complex. There are two types: class I and c lass II. A HLA -HIV Association is the binding of these major histocompatibility complexes with the peptides from a HIV vaccine. 145 Id. 146 Peptides for Immunization. http://www.thermo. com/eThermo/CMA/PDFs/Various/File_9276.pdf (lasted visited April 19, 2009 ). 147 Keyhole Lipet Hemocyanin (KLH) is a copper containing, non -heme protein found in arthropods and mollusca and is a common ly selecte d carrier for immunization. Id. 148 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) is a stable and highly soluble plasma protein form cattle. SO it is a popular carrier protein for vaccine s. Id. 149 Ovalbumin (OVA) is a protein isolated form the egg whites and is a good choice for a carrier protein to verify antibodies spe cific for peptides. Id. 150 Id. 70 adjuvants, which are commonly used molecules th at promote a respo nse in for any type of vaccine. 7. The Peptide Screening or Library category includes patents that claim a process or method to detect peptides for HIV or patents that compiled a peptide library for HIV. These patents should not included any diagnostic test done to deter mine whether a mammal has HIV. 8. The Antibodies to HIV category contains patents that claim antibodies specific to HIV. Antibodies are B - cell proteins that recognize and attach to specific sites on antigens to block the ir effect.151 When triggering an immune response, a vaccine would most likely promote the production of antibodies. During this study, patents that claim antibodies that are specific for HIV or released as a result of the vaccine will be relevant to this g roup. These antibodies will recognize HIV antigens and will block their effected. 9. The Antibodies Screening or Library category consists of patents that claim either the process to detect antibodies specific to HIV or claim an antibody library for HIV. 10. The Tat-based Vaccine category contains patent that pertain to Tat -based vaccines for HIV. Tat -based vaccine are generally vaccine that based on a native Tat protein, which is a early regulatory protein key for HIV replication and AIDS pathogenesis, h ighlights the importance of targeting the virus very early after infection.152 One benefit of Tat based vaccine is that modify the virus -host interactions at the very beginning of infection, thus containing the depletion of critical immune cells and the pro gression of HIV.153 11. The final group in this report categorizes patents that are classified as Therapeutic v. Prophylactic. In this category, the patent will claim methods that are either prophylactic or therapeutic to HIV. A prophylactic peptide vaccine is a vaccine that will prevent HIV from infecting an individual. A therapeutic composition will treat HIV after a patent has been diagnosed with the virus. For the purposes of this report, when a vaccine is only claimed within the patent, the patent wil l be assumed to be under the prophylactic category because an HIV vaccine will prevent the infection. 151 Carol & Richard Eustice, What are Antibodies? , http://arthritis.about.com/od/arthritislearnthebasics/g/ antibody.html (last visited Apri 19, 2009 ). 152 Antonella Caputo et al. , Recent Advances in the Development of HIV -1 Tat -Based Vaccines . 2(4) Current HIV Res earch 357 ( Oct. 2004). 153 Id. 3.2 Master Spreadsheet 71 Patent Number Prime Boost Protein Peptide Peptide Formulation Epitopes Conjugates Peptide Screening Antibodies to HIV Antibodies Screening Library TAT-base Vaccine Therapeutic v.

Patent Search Analytics The following results reflect an analysis of the 351 relevant patents. This analysis was performed using multiple commercial analytic tools including Microsoft Excel\u00ae, Micropatent\u00ae and Aureka\u00ae . Micropatent\u00ae Results 2D Bar Count (Patent count vs. Assignee) Pie Chart (Patent count vs. Assignee) According to the above charts, Merck & Co., United Biomedical and Chiron Corporation are three top assignees in field of Protein/Peptide Vaccine s. 108 2D Bar Chart (Patent Count vs. Main IPC Class) Pie Chart (Patent Count vs. Main IPC Class) According to the above charts, the Main IPC Class in the field of Pro tein/Peptide Vaccine s is A61K. This result was discovered early on in the patent searching process and was utilized in narrowing our results. C07 K, C12N and G01N were also three Main IPC cited very frequently in patent applications. 109 3D Bar Count (Paten t Count vs. Assignee vs. Publication Date) According to the above chart, Merck & Co, Inc. and Chiron Corporation started filing patents in the f ield of Protein/Peptide Vaccines in the early 90's. United Biomedical, however, started filing patents on t he same technology in late 80's. 110 2D Bar Chart (Patent Count v. Year) According to the above chart, patents in the field of Protein/Peptide Vaccines have increased in frequency since the outset in the mid -80's. During the early 90's, the technol ogy saw a marked increase but decreased until the late 90's where the technology experienced a marked increase in patent applications. 4.A.2. Aureka\u00ae ThemeMap\u00ae Results Aureka\u00ae was utilized to generate preliminary Aureka\u00ae ThemeMaps\u00ae for HIV Protein/Pep tide Vaccine Landscape. These ThemeMaps \u00ae were generated from the 351 relevant patents/patent applications using language from the claims, title and abstract and title, abstract and claims. Maps therefore represent a very broad view of the representative technologies which are embodied in the entire patent landscape. As such, these ThemeMaps \u00ae provide an overview of potentially applicable technologies. For example, from the Claims Map, it appears that a large portion of the claimed technology is in the ar ea of peptides, TAT and nef. Additionally, unlike the results suggested by Micropatent \u00ae154, the Title, Abstract and Claims Map suggests that the United States Government is a key assignee in the field of protein/peptide vaccines 154 Unlike Micropatent \u00ae which only uses the information available on the US patent apps. , Aureka \u00ae allows for the input of information not found on the US patent apps. As such, prior to running analytics in Aureka \u00ae, the team was able to ascertain assignees f or various US patent app s. which were not available for analysis in Micropatent \u00ae. This likely accounts for the differences between the Micropatent \u00ae and Aureka \u00ae top assignee results. 111 Aureka ThemeMap\u00ae 1: Theme Map \u00ae based on the language from the title and abstract in the 351 patents. 112 Aureka ThemeMap\u00ae 2: Theme Map \u00ae based on the language from the claims in the 351 patents. 113 Aureka ThemeMap\u00ae 3: Theme Map \u00ae based on the language from th e title, abstract and claims in the 351 patents and illustrates where the top six assignees (based on data inputted into Aureka\u00ae) are clustered in relation to the technology. 114 4.A.3. Microsoft Excel \u00ae As mentioned above, we found that the comm ercial tools utilized in this project did not reflect the slight variation in the assignee's names. First, with regard to United States Patent Applications, the assignee name is not listed on the application itself so the inventor name tends to be inserte d into the assignee category. Second, with regard to assignee names, there are slight variations not recognized by commercial tools such as Corp. as opposed to Corporation. To fix this problem, we used the United States Patent and Trademark website to de termine the names of assignees not listed. Then, using our Master Spreadsheet in Excel\u00ae, we generated additional graphs and charts. 4.A.3.i .

Cho MW With th e spread of AIDS still rampant in many parts of the world, there is a global urgency to develop a vaccine against HIV -1. Without a doubt, developing an effective vaccine against the virus has been a monumental scientific challenge. Although advances in mol ecular biology and biotechnology over the years have enabled us to generate \"designer antigens,\" our ability to transform them into successful vaccine candidates has been limiting. This review will be divided into three sections: First, the theoretical ben efits and limitations of subunit protein vaccine strategy will be presented. Secondly, recent progress in our understanding of immune responses against AIDS vaccine candidates that incorporate recombinant proteins or peptides will be reviewed, mainly those that are designed to elicit humoral immune responses. Finally, some of the factors that must be considered in designing and evaluating future vaccine candidates will be discussed. 2. Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2008 Jun;8(6):745 -57. Prospects for HIV S\u00f8rensen B Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 infection continues to challenge the development of antigen -specific immune -based strategies for t he management (therapeutic immunisation) and prevention (vaccination) of HIV -1 infection. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to assess current prospects for HIV -1 therapeutic immunisation with particular emphasis on the contribution of peptide -based immunogens. M ETHODS: The potential for therapeutic immunisation to provide immunological support that can allow for prolonged safe ART -free periods is discussed in light of the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study. Different approaches to p eptide design are considered including the quality of T-cell responses desired. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Synthetic peptide immunogens are amenable to modification to improve immunogenicity and reactivity to multiple virus subtypes. Ideally peptide immunogens sh ould incorporate combinations that target restricted, relevant polyfunctional epitopes to regions of HIV -1 associated with control of infection. Peptides showing a beneficial effect following therapeutic immunisation may provide the basis for a future prev entative vaccine. 3. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2007 May;6(5):404 -14. 128 More than one reason to rethink the use of peptides in vaccine design . Purcell AW , McCluskey J , Rossjohn J The use of peptides as therapeutics is experiencing renewed enthusiasm owing to advances in delivery, stability and design. M oreover, there is a growing emphasis on the use of peptides in vaccine design as insights into tissue -specific processing of the immunogenic epitopes of proteins and the discovery of unusually long cytotoxic T -lymphocyte epitopes broaden the range of targe ts and give clues to enhancing peptide immunogenicity. Peptides can also be synthesized with known post -translational modifications and/or deliberately introduced protease -resistant peptide bonds to regulate their processing independent of tissue -specific proteolysis and to stabilize these compounds in vivo. We discuss the potential of peptide -based vaccines for the treatment of chronic viral diseases and cancer, and review recent developments in the field of peptide -based vaccines. 4. PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Dec;4(12):e1000246. Epub 2008 Dec 26. A mathematical framework for the selection of an optimal set of peptides for epitope -based vaccines. Toussaint NC D\u00f6nnes P , Kohlbacher O Epitope -based vaccines (EVs) have a wide range of applications: from therapeutic to prophylactic approaches, from inf ectious diseases to cancer. The development of an EV is based on the knowledge of target -specific antigens from which immunogenic peptides, so -called epitopes, are derived. Such epitopes form the key components of the EV. Due to regulatory, economic, and p ractical concerns the number of epitopes that can be included in an EV is limited. Furthermore, as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding these epitopes is highly polymorphic, every patient possesses a set of MHC class I and class II molecules of differing specificities. A peptide combination effective for one person can thus be completely ineffective for another. This renders the optimal selection of these epitopes an important and interesting optimization problem. In this work we present a mat hematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) that allows the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and the efficient identification of optimal sets of epitopes. Out of a user -defined set of predicted or experimentall y determined epitopes, the framework selects the set with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response. Our ILP approach allows an elegant and flexible formulation of numerous variants of the EV design problem. In order to demonst rate this, we show how common immunological requirements for a good EV (e.g., coverage of epitopes from each antigen, coverage of all MHC alleles in a set, or avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates) can be translated into constraints or modificatio ns of the objective function within the ILP framework. An implementation of the algorithm outperforms a simple greedy strategy as well as a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm and has runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes. 129 5. J Immunol. 1999 May 15;162(10):6155 -61. Selection of HIV -specific Fauci AS Efforts to develop a protective HIV -1 vaccine have be en hindered by difficulties in identifying epitopes capable of inducing broad neutralizing Ab responses. In fact, the high mutation rate occurring in HIV -1 envelope proteins and the complex structure of gp120 as an oligomer associated with gp41 result in a high degree of antigenic polymorphism. To overcome these obstacles, we screened random peptide libraries using sera from HIV -infected subjects to identify antigenic and immunogenic mimics of HIV -1 epitopes. After extensive counterscreening with HIV -negati ve sera, we isolated peptides specifically recognized by Abs from HIV -1- infected individuals. These peptides behaved as antigenic mimics of linear or conformational HIV-1 epitopes generated in vivo in infected subjects. Consistent with these findings, sera of simian HIV -infected monkeys also recognized the HIV -specific epitopes. The selected peptides were immunogenic in mice, where they elicited HIV -specific Abs that effectively neutralized HIV-1 isolates. These results demonstrate that pools of HIV -1 mimot opes can be selected from combinatorial peptide libraries by taking advantage of the HIV -specific Ab repertoire induced by the natural infection. 6. Trends Microbiol. 2006 Mar;14( 3):141 -7. Epub 2006 Feb 7. Phage of infectious diseases. B Microbial infections are dependent on the panoply of interactions between pathogen and host and identifying the molecular basis of such interactions is necessary to understand and control infection. Phage display is a simple functional genomic methodology for screening and identifying protein -ligand interactions and is widely used in epitope mapping, antibody engineering and screening for receptor agonists or antagonists. Phage display is also used widely in various forms, including the use of fragment libraries of whole microbial genomes, to identify peptide -ligand and protein -ligand interac tions that are of importance in infection. In particular, this technique has proved successful in identifying microbial adhesins that are vital for colonization. 7. PLoS Med. 2007 Dec;4( 12):e348.

Immu nogenically Components Via Epitope Discovery from Natural Peptide Libraries Leslie J. Matthews, Robert Davis and George P. Smith Antigenic peptides that bind pathogen -specific Abs are a potential source of subunit vaccine components. To be effective the peptides must be immunogenically fit: when used as immunogens they must elicit Abs that cross -react with native intact pathogen. In this study, antigenic peptides obtained from phage display libraries through epitope discovery were systematically examined for immunogenic fitness. Peptides selected from random peptide libraries, in which the phage -displayed peptides are encoded by synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides, had marginal immunogenic fitness. In contrast, 50% of the peptides sel ected from a natural peptide library, in which phage display segments of actual pathogen polypeptides, proved very successful. Epitope discovery from natural peptide libraries is a promising route to subunit vaccines. 10. Vaccine. 2006 May 8;24(19):4062 -81. Epub 2006 Feb 28. A review of vaccine research and development: the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Girard MP , Osmanov SK , Kieny MP Since the discovery of AIDS in 1981, the global spread of HIV has reached pandemic proportions, representing a global developmental and public health threat. The development of a safe, globally effective and affordable HIV vaccine offers the best hope for the future control of the pandemic. Significant progress has been made over the past years in the areas of basic virology, immunology, pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and the development of antiretroviral drugs. However, the development of an HIV vaccine faces formidable scientific challenges related to the high genetic variability of the virus, the lack of immune correlates of protection, limitations with the existing animal models and lo gistical problems associated with the conduct of multiple clinical trials. More than 35 vaccine candidates have been tested in Phase I/II clinical trials, involving more than 10,000 volunteers, and two Phase III trials have been completed, themselves invol ving more than 7500 volunteers. Multiple vaccine concepts and vaccination strategies have been tested, including DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, live vectored recombinant vaccines and various prime -boost vaccine combinations. This article reviews the state of the art in HIV vaccine development, summarizes the results obtained so far and discusses the challenges to be met in the development of the various vaccine candidates. 11: J Virol. 2003 Mar;77(5):3157 -66. CD The human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein i s essential for virus replication and is a candidate vaccine antigen. Macaques immunized with Tat or chemically modified Tat toxoid having the same clade B sequence developed strong antibody responses. We compared these antisera for their abilities to reco gnize diverse Tat sequences. An overlapping peptide array covering three clade B and two clade C Tat sequences was constructed to help identify reactive linear epitopes. Sera from Tat -immunized macaques were -reactive with clade B and C sequences but recognized a clade B -specific epitope the basic domain. Sera from Tat toxoid -immunized macaques had a more restricted pattern of recognition, reacting mainly with clade B and with only one clade B basic domain sequence, which included the rare amino acids RPPQ at positions 57 to 60. Monoclonal antibodies against the amino terminus or the domain RPPQ sequence blocked Tat uptake into T cells and neutralized Tat in a cell -based transactivation assay. Macaques immunized with Tat or Tat toxoid p roteins varied in their responses to minor epitopes, but all developed a strong response to the amino terminus, and antisera were capable of neutralizing Tat in a transactivation assay. 12.

Extracellular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein human immunodeficiency virus (HIV -1) Tat protein added to the culture medium of rat cerebellar neurons promoted aggregation and formation of spoke -like neurites in a dose-dependent manner. Tat proteins containing mutations in the Arg -Gly-Asp (RGD) cell adhesion motif or a deletion of the cysteine -rich domain had no effect on neuronal morphology. In contrast, a Tat protein that con tained a deletion of the proline -rich domain promoted neuronal aggregation. Aggregation of neurons was inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibodies directed against the RGD and basic domains of Tat, but not against the proline -rich domain. The same d omains of Tat required to induce aggregation also mediated adhesion of neurons to Tat - coated substrates. The HIV -2 Tat protein, which lacks an RGD sequence but contains cysteine - rich and basic domains similar to HIV -1 Tat, induced aggregation and acted as a substrate for adhesion when added at higher concentrations than HIV -1 Tat. Vitronectin, fibronectin, and RGD -containing peptides did not induce morphological changes in neurons or act as substrates 132 for adhesion. The ability of Tat to induce morphological changes and promote adhesion was independent of the ability of Tat to transactivate HIV gene expression. Our results suggest that extracellular Tat protein most likely alters neuronal morphology and mediates adhesion by acting in a manner similar to an ex tracellular matrix protein. 14 J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):8366 -75. Intracellular analysis of in vitro modified , B Human immunodeficiency viruses HIV -1 and HIV -2 encode a Tat protein that specifically activates transcription from the viral long terminal repeat. To characterize the properties of the Tat proteins, we have expressed them in E scherichia coli. The purified Tat protein was biochemically analyzed and tested for activity upon electroporation into human cell lines. This protein electroporation was used for the intracellular analysis of in vitro modified Tat protein. Our results indi cate that the transcriptionally active form of the Tat protein is a monomer. Furthermore, we found that Tat activity is dramatically inhibited by preincubation of the protein with strongly reducing agents. In contrast, no inhibitory effect was measured upo n incubation with metal -chelating reagents. These results suggest that the cysteine residues of Tat are involved in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. 15. Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics 686, 687 (2007).

Sequence conservation and antibody cross -recognition of clade B human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 Ta t protein in HIV -1-infected Italians, Ugandans, and South Africans. Butt\u00f2 S Ensoli B ; Tat Multicentric Study Group We determined immune cross -recognition and the degree of Tat conservation in patients infected by local human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 strains. The data indicated a similar prevalence of total and epitope -specific anti-Tat IgG in 578 serum samples from HIV infected Italian (n=302), Ugandan (n=139), and South African (n=137) subjects, using the same B clade Tat protein that is being used in vaccine trials. In particular, anti -Tat antibodies were detected in 13.2%, 1 0.8%, and 13.9% of HIV -1-infected individuals from Italy, Uganda, and South Africa, respectively. Sequence analysis results indicated a high similarity of Tat from the different circulating viruses with BH -10 Tat, particularly in the 1 -58 amino acid region , which contains most of the immunogenic epitopes. These data indicate an effective cross -recognition of 133 a B-clade laboratory strain -derived Tat protein vaccine by individuals infected with different local viruses, owing to the high similarity of Tat epito pes. 17. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Feb 13;98(4):1781 -6. The HIV -1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev are frequently targeted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes deriv ed from HIV -1-infected , BD ; HIV Controller Study Collaboration The HIV -1 regulatory proteins Rev and Tat are expressed earl y in the virus life cycle and thus may be important targets for the immune control of HIV -1-infection and for effective vaccines. However, the extent to which these proteins are targeted in natural HIV -1 infection as well as precise epitopes targeted by hu man cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) remain to be defined. In the present study, 57 HIV -1-infected individuals were screened for responses against Tat and Rev by using overlapping peptides spanning the entire Tat and Rev proteins. CD8+ T cell responses agains t Tat and Rev were found in up to 19 and 37% of HIV -1-infected individuals, respectively, indicating that these regulatory proteins are important targets for HIV -1-specific CTL. Despite the small size of these proteins, multiple CTL epitopes were identifie d in each. These data indicate that Tat and Rev are frequently targeted by CTL in natural HIV -1 infection and may be important targets for HIV vaccines. 18. Vaccine. 2008 Jan 30;26(5):727 -37. Epub 2007 Dec 4. The Tat protein broadens T cell responses directed to the HIV -1 antigens Gag and Env: implications for the design of new vaccination strategies against AIDS. Gavioli R , A , Ensoli B . We have previously shown that the biologically active Tat protein targets and efficiently enters dendritic cells, and increases the proteolytic activities of the immunoproteasome, thereby favoring the generation and presentation of the subdominant MHC -I binding C TL epitopes of heterologous antigens. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tat broadens in vivo epitope - specific T cell responses directed to heterologous antigens including HIV structural proteins. Specifically, co -immunization of mice with OVA and T at proteins induces CTL responses against subdominant and cryptic OVA -derived epitopes, which are not detected in mice vaccinated with OVA alone. Similarly, mice vaccinated with the HIV -1 Gag, Env or V2 -deleted Env Tat show Th1 -type and CTL responses directed to a larger number of T cell epitopes, as compared to mice vaccinated with these proteins in absence of Tat. In contrast, Tat did not affect Th2 -type responses to these structural HIV proteins. These results indicate that T at is not only an antigen but also a novel Th1 -type adjuvant capable of broadening in vivo the spectrum of epitopes recognized by T cells, and suggest that Tat can be considered an optimal co -antigen in the development of novel vaccination strategies again st AIDS. 134 APPENDIX B: Description of Patent Databases & Platforms Used in this Report Platform Name - Aureka General information Aure ka is a Thomson Reuters product Full text data coverage: United States (US) patents and applications, European (EP) paten ts and applications, World Intellectual Property Organization (WO) PCT applications, German (DE) patents, applications, and utility models, French (FR) applications, British (GB) applications, and Japanese (JP) applications Updated to accommodate IPC -R (In ternational Patent Classification Reform) codes Searches Boolean searching allows users to search specified topics or patent fields and to narrow or broaden the search results as needed Two wildcards (* and ?) can be used to account for US and English sp elling Patent and non -patent citations are associated with every publication record Ability to search for a range of PCT publication dates Ability to sub -search a hit list to narrow your searches US litigation data is displayed in records and is available in the Legal Status view, although it is not searchable Includes non -patent citation, such as journal articles, book chapters, technical reports, etc. from US, EP, WO, GB, and DE Document lists are the results of a search or series of searches, listed w ith the data and in the preferred order Analysis and mapping Clustering tool (Vivismo) extracts and groups records by like concepts into hierarchically organized folders for a quick snapshot Vovismo can cluster Aureka docume nt lists of up to 1,000 averag e length documents in less than a few minutes.

There are about 450 Classes of invention and about 150, 000 subclasses of invention in the USPC. Classifications are typically expressed as \"482/1\". o The first number, 482, represents the class of invention. o The number following the slash is the subclass of invention within the class. Patents are always classifi ed at the subclass level. A Subclass definition is a complete description of the subclass. The Subclass Definition can incorporate an explanation of the class, a glossary, search notes, references to subclasses within the class, and references to other cla sses and subclasses. Classes and subclasses have titles which provide a short description of the class or subclass. Classes and subclasses also have definitions which provide a more detailed explanation. Many Classes and subclasses have explicitly defined relationships to one another. One or more classifications (i.e., class/subclass designations) are assigned to each granted patent and each published application. A patent classification also represents a searchable collection of patents grouped together according to similarly claimed subject matter. A classification is used both as a tool for finding patents (patentability searches) and for assisting in the assignment of patent applications to examiners for examination purposes.

The IPCs are typically expressed as A63C 11/14. o A represents a Section. o The n umber following a Section, 63, is a Class. o C represents a Subclass. o 11 is a Main group. o The number following the slash, 14, is a Subgroup. The authentic version of the IPC is published in English and French languages. Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch Ge rman, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish versions are also available. The IPC is used in more than 100 countries. Thus, the IPC is used as a tool for finding, for example, both US and JP documents. Available at: http://www.wipo.int/classifications/fulltext/new_ipc/ipcen.html Classification Codes applicable for this report The most frequently found codes are underlined. Section A: Human Necessities o A61K: Preparations for Medical, Dental, or Toilet Purposes 39/21 : Retroviridae, e.g. equine infectious anemia virus o A61P: Therapeutic Activity of Chemical Compounds or Medical Preparations Section C: Chemistry; Metallurgy o C07H: Org anic Chemistry o C07K: Peptides 7/08: Having 12 to 20 amino acids 14/005: From viruses o C12N: Micro -Organisms or Enzymes; Compositions Thereof; Propagating, Preserving, or Maintaining Micro -Organisms; Mutation or Genetic Engineering; Culture Media o C12Q : Measuring or Testing Processes Involving Enzymes or Micro -Organisms; Compositions or Test Papers Therefor; Processes of Preparing Such Compositions; Condition -Responsive Control in Microbiological or Enzymological Processes Section G: Physics o G01N: In vestigation or Analyzing Materials by Determining Their Chemical or Physical Properties 33/68: Involving proteins, peptides or amino acids 141 APPENDIX E: Derwent Classifications (http://www.delphion.com/derwent/docs/derwentclass.pdf ) Description of Derwent Patent Classifications - Categorizes patent documents using a simple classification system for all technologies; consistently applied to all patents by Thomson Scientific subject expe rts, enabling effective and precise searching in a particular area of technology. - International Patent Classification (IPC) is an internationally recognized classification system, which is controlled by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) a nd assigned to patent documents by Patent Offices. - Where possible we indicated next to the Class the equivalent IPC in an abbreviated form (e.g. A47, F23 5). However, this should only be taken as a guide, since there are areas where the DWPI Classes are assigned intellectually by our subject experts, and no strict correspondence is claimed. Classification Codes (applicable for this report) - Class D16: Ferm entation industry - including fermentation equipment, brewing, yeast production, production of pharmaceuticals and other chemicals by fermentation, microbiology, production of vaccines and antibodies, cell and tissue culture and genetic engineering. - Class B04: Natural products and polymers. Including testing of body fluids (other than blood typing or cell counting), pharmaceuticals or veterinary compounds of unknown structure, testing of microorganisms for pathogenicity, testing of chemicals for mutagenicit y or human toxicity and fermentative production of DNA or RNA. General compositions. - Class S03: Scientific Instrumentation - Photometry, calorimetry. Thermometers. Meteorology, geophysics, measurement of nuclear or X -radiation. Investigating chemical or ph ysical properties. 142 APPENDIX F: Chemical Patents Index (CPI) Manual Codes (http://www.thomsonscientific.jp/support/code/mc/cpi/cpi_mc1_eng.pdf ) General Informatio n - Derwent manual codes increase the accuracy of online patent searches by arranging patents by categories - The codes can be used by incorporating them into online search strategies when they are initially being developed - Many of the codes are redundant by c overing a single subject under several codes - As a result, the searches are extremely narrow and produce only a handful of relevant search results Classification Codes (applicable to this r eport ) - Antiviral o B14-A02B1 retrovirus o (Including Non-antiviral is coded B14 -G01B). o B14-S11A antiviral activity Author's Curriculum Vitae MICHELLE WINDOM mwin dom@piercelaw.edu EDUCATION Franklin Pierce Law Center , Concord, NH Candidate for Juris Doctor, 2009 Member, Pierce Law Review Member, Student Bar Association Finance Committee 1L Representative Member, Student Intellectual Property Organization Frankli n Pierce Law Center, Concord, NH Masters of Intellectual Property, 2006 Member, Student Bar Association Finance Committee MIP Representative Member, Student Intellectual Property Organization Tulane University, New Orleans, LA Masters of Engineering, Biom edical Engineering, 2004 Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA Bachelor of Science, Biological Engineering, 2002 Member, Biological Engineering Society Member, Zeta Tau Alpha Sorority EXPERIENCE Fall Oliff & Berridge, PLC 2009 Associate Summer Oliff & Berridge, PLC 2008 Summer Associate Summer Duane Morris LLP (Philadelphia, PA) 2007 Summ er Associate Summer Tulane University Office of Technology Transfer 2006 Intern PUBLICATIONS Michelle Windom et al., Educational Report of the Patent Landscape of DNA Vaccines for HIV , Franklin Pierce Law Center, May 2008.
