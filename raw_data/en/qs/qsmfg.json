You've probably seen welders wearing some important safety equipment like gloves and safety glasses or welding helmets as they work. They use these for eye protection from welder's flash, also known as welder's rash. Even though you can get rid of welder's flash with home remedies or medical assistance, it is a painful condition. But what exactly is it, and why does it develop? When the cornea of the eyes gets exposed to UV rays, a flash burn occurs. As welding torches are the most prevalent cause of these burns, this condition has come to be commonly known as the welder's flash. In medical terms, however, it is known as UV keratitis. This form of eye damage can happen to anyone who has their eyes exposed to intense ultraviolet light. Besides a welding torch, UV radiation from other sources can also be a serious hazard that can cause Arc Eye. A few home remedies can help you deal with welder's flash or prevent it from happening. Read on to know more. In This Article Symptoms Of Welder's Flash The flash from the welding torches, known as the welding arc, is known to seriously damage the cornea of the eye. This gives welder's flash its name. The symptoms include ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26680683)), ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2571692/)): - Mild to severe pain in the affected eye (or both the eyes) - Increased sensitivity to light - Bloodshot eyes - Blurry vision - Watery eyes [Irritation in the eye](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-get-rid-of-eye-itching/) - A feeling that you have got something in the eye The closest comparison to the pain of welder's flash is when your eyes get dry and stick to your contact lens, tearing off a tiny layer of corneal cells. The cells grow back quickly, but the pain is intense when it occurs. A [study](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2773188) showed that between 2010-2019 the NEISS database estimated there were a total of 109,127 welding-related injuries. The injuries have decreased over the years with a high of 13,415 cases in 2010 lowering to 6,944 in 2019. Men made up the vast majority of cases (98%), which mostly affected people between the ages of 10 and 49. What Causes Welder's Flash? Ultraviolet radiation from these sources can cause welder's flash: - Welding torch - Direct sunlight - Solar eclipse - Reflection of the sun on water or snow - Lightning - Sunlamps (found in tanning salons) - Other lamps like halogen lamps, photographer's flood lamps, etc. Under the welding conditions of this research, the effective irradiance of UVR produced during the arc welding of cast iron rose with an increase in welding current. Also, the amount of UVR emitted depended on the type of process (gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) < shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) < gas metal arc welding (GMAW)) and the filler material's constituents. See the graph below for more information. Effective Irradiance Of UVR Emitted By Arc Welding Of Cast IronSource: [Comprehensive analysis of hazard of ultraviolet radiation emitted during arc welding of cast iron](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970392/) Welder's flash needs accurate care and treatment since this ophthalmic condition is very painful. In addition to medical treatment, a few home remedies may also help to speed up recovery from this condition.

[Dana Spearin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-spearin-264b1625b/), an optometrist, says, \"If you are wearing the proper safety equipment, it is unlikely you will go blind. However, if you are not, you could impair your vision from welder flash if it damages the macula. This is called solar retinopathy. Welders flash usually just causes photokeratitis or sunburn of the cornea, and that typically heals within 2-7 days.\" Are welders flash permanent? According to Spearin, \"If welders flash only results in photokeratitis, this will heal and is not permanent. If it results in solar retinopathy, it can cause permanent vision loss. Sometimes, it is mild, and at other times, it is more severe, depending on the location of the macula that is damaged.\" How long does welder's flash last?
