Sometimes they may focus very well (over-focus) on tasks of high interest such as video games but not on tasks that may be difficult, require more effort or be less interesting to them, such as school work.</p><h3>Difficulty controlling behaviour and emotions</h3><p>A child who finds it difficult to control their behaviour might show symptoms of hyperactivity. They may often fidget, have trouble playing quietly, be \"on the go\" or talk too much. If a child has symptoms of impulsivity, they may have trouble waiting for their turn and frequently interrupt others.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2> <ul> <li>The main symptoms of ADHD are difficulty controlling attention, behaviour and impulses. This can appear as inattention, over-focusing, hyperactivity and impulsivity.</li> <li>Symptoms usually become more obvious from age seven to nine but can sometimes appear as late as age 13 to 15.</li> <li>ADHD is diagnosed when a child's symptoms are excessive, last for a number of months and occur in two or more settings. </li> <li>An ADHD diagnosis is made by a qualified health-care professional, based on a thorough clinical history, a physical examination and descriptions of symptoms by the parent and teacher.</li> </ul>||<h2>How ADHD appears in school-age children</h2><p>One of the key times for diagnosing children is when they are aged seven to nine years old. At this age, parents and teachers often start to notice problems with the child's school work and friendships.</p><h3>School performance</h3><p>Many children with ADHD may also have more difficulties than their peers with learning to read, spell or do math. But even without any specific learning difficulty (such as dyslexia), ADHD can interfere with a child's ability to learn, follow classroom routines and complete school work. They may have trouble understanding how the classroom works and may find it hard to give focused, organized answers to a teacher's questions. Homework can also be a challenge, as ADHD may make it difficult for a child to write down homework, remember to take the necessary books home and start or complete homework by themselves.</p><p>The website <a href=\"http://www.teachadhd.ca/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">TeachADHD</a> offers more information on how ADHD affects children in the classroom and offers a range of guidelines for teachers. </p><h3>Social emotional abilities</h3><p>Children with ADHD often have more social and emotional problems than other children. This is true for both boys and girls. For instance, ADHD is linked with being a victim of bullying and being rejected by peers.</p><p>In terms of emotions, children with ADHD can experience sudden mood swings, which may appear as over-reactions to small issues or becoming frustrated very quickly. They may also have a strong need for instant satisfaction.</p><p>These social and emotional issues can occur because of a child's:</p><ul><li>difficulty reading social cues, for example failing to read facial expressions accurately or interpreting neutral behaviour or comments as negative</li><li>problems with conversation skills, problem-solving or other social skills</li><li>trouble controlling behaviour, for instance interrupting or not taking turns, which may irritate other children</li><li>difficulty controlling their emotions, for example reacting angrily or inappropriately when they are upset</li></ul><h2>How ADHD appears in teens</h2><p>While a diagnosis of ADHD is usually confirmed by age nine, some older children may not be diagnosed until they transition to high school. This is because the transition and adjustment to high school usually place new demands on a child's organizational skills and reveal difficulties with controlling attention that might have been hidden previously.</p><h3>School performance</h3><p>Many of the school difficulties experienced by younger children with ADHD continue into the teen years. Compared with their peers, teens with ADHD are three times more likely to drop out of school. However, many students with ADHD do graduate from high school and go on to higher education, which is encouraging. They may still face challenges with learning and academic performance, however, so proper supports remain essential.</p><h3>Social emotional abilities</h3><p>Teens with ADHD may have:</p><ul><li>more negative moods, such as anger, <a href=\"/Article?contentid=18&language=English\">anxiety</a> and stress</li><li>fewer positive moods, such as happiness, alertness and a sense of wellbeing</li></ul><p>In teenage boys, ADHD may contribute to risky behaviours such as gambling and addictions, including substance abuse and video addiction. In girls, ADHD is more likely to be associated with <a href=\"/Article?contentid=18&language=English\">anxiety</a>, <a and <a href=\"/Article?contentid=277&language=English\">binge eating</a>. For older teens, there is increased risk of driving offences and accidents.</p>||<h2>How is ADHD diagnosed?</h2> <p>There is no specific test for ADHD. Usually, your doctor or another qualified health-care professional will examine your child and ask questions about:</p> <ul> <li>your child's developmental history</li> <li>how your child behaves at home and in other situations</li> <li>how long your child has had symptoms and whether they cause problems</li> <li>whether your child is experiencing problems at school or with school work</li> </ul> <p>The health-care professional will usually ask you to fill in some structured questionnaires so they can learn about your child's general behaviour at home. If you have any concerns that the doctor has not asked about, such as problems with your child's nutrition or sleep, make sure to discuss them. It might help to write down your questions before your child's appointment.</p> <p>Often families seek advice from a doctor after they and/or the child's teacher have expressed concerns about the child's symptoms.</p> <p>Once your child is in school, the health-care professional can find out if they are inattentive, impulsive or hyperactive in that setting as well as at home. Your child's teacher will likely be asked to fill in structured questionnaires or rating scales as well as report cards to provide the information the health-care professional needs. A child will be diagnosed with ADHD only if their symptoms are excessive and persistent and cause difficulties at home and at school.</p> <h2>Will a diagnosis be made right away?</h2> <p>It will probably take two or three visits to the doctor to diagnose ADHD, as they will need time to collect information from your child's teacher and consider all the information that has been gathered.</p>||<h2>What happens after a diagnosis of ADHD?</h2> <p>Once your child is diagnosed with ADHD, treatment can begin. You, your child's doctor or psychologist and the school will need to work together on a plan to manage your child's ADHD.</p> <p>This plan will begin with a thorough discussion about ADHD and possible treatments and supports for parents and for your child or teen.

These other problems respond best to behavioural treatments in addition to medication.</p><p>Medications also cannot make up for any gaps in learning before a child started ADHD treatment. It is very important that children with ADHD get the <a href=\"/Article?contentid=1999&language=English\">right academic support</a> to help them reach their full potential.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2> <ul> <li>Medications work well to treat the core symptoms of ADHD but work best with behavioural treatments for any related emotional, learning or behavioural issues.</li> <li>In most cases, ADHD is treated with stimulants. Common, mild side effects include headaches, difficulty falling asleep, irritability and jitteriness. Rare but more serious side effects include allergies, severe agitation, heart problems and suicidal thinking.</li> <li>Your child will be prescribed a low dose of medication that their doctor will monitor and adjust over time to make sure it continues working.</li> <li>Your child's doctor may change the dose schedule or recommend a \"drug holiday\" to minimize the side effects.</li> </ul>||<h2>What types of medications treat ADHD?</h2> <p>In most cases, ADHD is treated with stimulants. These have been widely used for ADHD for more than 40 years. They are effective for at least two-thirds of children with ADHD and have relatively few side effects.</p> <h3>How stimulants treat ADHD</h3> <p>Stimulants increase levels of brain chemicals called dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals affect a person's mood, alertness, memory, level of attention and response to stress. Increasing the levels of these chemicals reduces inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. However, symptoms return as the stimulants wear off.</p> <p>There is strong evidence to support the short-term benefits of stimulants for the core ADHD symptoms, but evidence for long-term benefits is more limited. As a result, it is important to monitor ADHD medications closely to make sure that they are still helpful for your child as they grow older. It is also common for ADHD symptoms to return when medications are stopped.</p> <h2>Types of stimulants</h2> <p>There are </ul> <p><em>Methylphenidate</em></p> come in pills or capsules that must be swallowed whole or capsules that can be opened and mixed with food.</p> <h2>How long do stimulants <p>These stimulants last for three to five hours. They start to take effect usually within 15 to 30 minutes of taking the first dose.</p> <p>The effects of a stimulant taken first thing in the morning may start to wear off before lunchtime. If your child needs these medications for school, they will usually need to take at least one stimulant during the school day.</p> <h3>Longer-acting stimulants</h3> <p>Longer-acting stimulants last for eight to 14 hours. A child can take one dose in the morning and not need to take another dose at school. Longer-acting stimulants can also help children get through after-school activities.</p> <p>The disadvantage of longer-acting stimulants is that they are sometimes slow to take effect and may interfere with sleep.</p> <h2>How does my child's doctor know if the medication is working?</h2> <p>Your child's doctor will likely start your child on a small dose and gradually increase it until there is an effect on the target symptoms. The doctor might ask you and your child's teacher to fill in rating scales at various doses of the stimulants to help them compare the effectiveness of different doses on your child's symptoms.</p> <p>If the first stimulant does not have a positive effect or has too many side effects after a few doses, the doctor will try another stimulant. Children can react differently to medications, but most children will respond well to at least one of them.</p> <p>If your child's symptoms still do not improve after trying three or more different medications, the doctor may reassess your child. It is possible that a diagnosis of ADHD may not be correct or that your child may have other conditions with ADHD.</p>||<h2>Further information</h2><p>For more information on ADHD, at home</a></p><p> <a href=\"/Article?contentid=1999&language=English\">ADHD: Communicating with your child's school</a></p><h2>Resources</h2><p>The following resources support and additional information on href=\"http://www.ldao.ca/\" et al.

It is given to your child through a vein by intravenous (IV) infusion. PN provides liquid nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and electrolytes. </p><h2>Why does my child need parenteral nutrition?</h2><p>Your child will receive PN if they cannot absorb enough nutrition through their <a href=\"/article?contentid=1467&language=english\">gastrointestinal (GI) tract</a> or tolerate adequate food or fluids by mouth or through a <a href=\"/tubefeeding\">feeding tube</a>. Conditions that may require your child to PN can include <a href=\"/intestinalfailure\">short bowel syndrome</a>, <a href=\"/GHN?topic=GIhub\">digestive system disorders</a>, bowel motility disorders, certain cancers, injury or trauma to the intestines and after surgery or procedures when a child cannot eat for a prolonged period.</p><p>PN can be given in addition to oral or tube feeding or as your child's only source of nutrition.

There is a risk of infections every time the CVAD is accessed. These infections are referred to as central line-associated blood infections (CLABSI). Using <a href=\"/article?contentid=3391&language=english\">aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT)</a> during central line care is essential to preventing the occurrence of a CLABSI. Recurrent episodes can affect many parts of the body and have a significant impact on quality of life due to prolonged admissions in hospital.</p><h3>Central line thrombosis</h3><p>A central line thrombosis is a blood clot that occurs in the veins that are used for CVAD placement. The development of clots related to central lines poses significant risk as CVADs are required for administration of PN. Some factors that contribute to the development of thrombosis include the location of the central line, the size of the line and the development of CLABSI.</p><h3>IFALD: Intestinal failure-associated liver disease</h3><p>Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) can develop in children receiving TPN, and several risk factors contribute to its occurrence: </p><ul><li>infections</li><li>prematurity</li><li>absence of food through the GI system</li><li>the composition of the TPN</li></ul><h2>Late complications</h2><h3>Metabolic bone disease</h3><p>Metabolic bone disease is caused by changes in the way minerals are absorbed. Children on PN may not properly absorb minerals that are important to bone health such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. Other factors that contribute to bone disease include vitamin D deficiency, dehydration or loss of minerals (bicarbonate) in the stools. </p><h3>Renal disease</h3><p>Renal disease can occur due to long-term use of PN. Persistent dehydration, contamination of elements in TPN solutions and exposure to medications that are damaging to the kidneys are some of the factors that contribute to the development of renal disease. </p><h3>Micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies<br></h3><p>Children on PN may have decreased ability to absorb vitamins and minerals, which can lead to low levels of micronutrients. Deficiencies in micronutrients can occur with children on and off TPN support.</p><p>Standard and routine monitoring such as bloodwork and ultrasounds is very important to prevent complications on children who are on long-term TPN.</p>||<h2>How will my child receive parenteral nutrition?</h2><p>Your child's PN will be customized to their individual nutritional needs. It will be provided at the hospital by your child's health-care team or at home by a trained parent or caregiver. The PN will be delivered by a pump through an <a href=\"/article?contentid=2451&language=english\">intravenous (IV) line</a> or a central venous access device (CVAD) directly to the blood stream.

Generally, short-term PN will be infused through an IV line, and long-term PN will be infused through a CVAD. PN administered at home will always be administered through a CVAD.</p><p>The number of days per week and hours per day that your child will receive PN will be customized to their needs and depend on several factors:<br></p><ul><li>your child's age<br></li><li>your child's ability to tolerate solid foods and fluid by gut</li><li>the number of calories your child requires</li><li>the amount of fluid your child requires</li><li>your child's ability to maintain normal glucose levels when off PN</li></ul><p>Younger children with high stool losses and poor tolerance of gut feeds will require more time on PN support. Children who are eating and tolerating some foods and fluids will be able to have more time off PN support. </p><h3>Cycling off parenteral nutrition</h3><p>The goal of treatment with PN will be to cycle your child off PN completely. The number of hours off PN or IV fluids will depend on your child's status. Being cycled off PN is beneficial for the liver and quality of life. However, too much time off can lead to dehydration, which can damage the kidneys over time. Achieving a balance is especially important. </p><p>As your child's intestine adapts to absorb more nutrients, the amount of nutrients required in the solution will decrease. Cycling your child off of PN will be begin slowly, stopping the PN infusion for a few hours of the day. Eventually, your child may be able to take days off until the PN is stopped completely. </p>||Main| [About Content||Health A-Z||<p>Learn about premature babies. While premature babies can be born and develop normally, some may suffer growth and developmental problems later on in life.</p>||<p>Normally, a fetus spends <a href=\"/Article?contentid=328&language=English\">40 weeks growing and developing</a> in the womb before birth and entry into the world. This length of time is called term or full-term. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), babies born before completing 37 weeks in the womb are defined as preterm or premature. Although preemies, as premature babies are sometimes called, can be perfectly healthy at birth and develop normally both in body and mind, almost all will require some form of specialized supportive medical care after birth, and some will have continuing problems that will affect their growth and development.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2> <ul><li>Babies born before 37 weeks in the womb are considered premature.</li> <li>Many, but not all, premature babies will require some form of specialized supportive medical care after birth.</li> <li>There are multiple causes of premature birth, including conditions of the mother, conditions of the fetus, and conditions of the uterus or placenta.</li> <li>There are many medical concerns associated with premature birth, including breathing problems, immature heart, gastrointestinal a condition that causes your child's spine to curve sideways. Learn about the different types of scoliosis, some of its causes, and the risk factors that can increase your child's chance of developing a more severe curve.</p>||<h2>What is scoliosis?</h2><p>Scoliosis is a condition that causes your child's spine to curve sideways and twist. This curve can lead to changes in their shoulders, ribcage, pelvis, waist, and the overall scoliosis, the spine curves to one side, usually to the right, resulting in one shoulder being higher than the other.</figcaption> </figure>||<h2> Key points </h2><ul><li>Children with scoliosis have a curve in their spine.</li><li>There are three main types of scoliosis: idiopathic, congenital and neuromuscular. The most common type of scoliosis is idiopathic scoliosis, which typically develops at the beginning of puberty.</li><li>The exact cause of idiopathic scoliosis is unknown. There are likely many different contributing factors.</li><li>There is a greater risk that your child's curve will increase if they are diagnosed at a young age, before they have begun their menstrual periods and/or if their bones are still growing.</li></ul>||<h2>What causes scoliosis?</h2><p>Most children with scoliosis have idiopathic scoliosis. Researchers do not know what causes idiopathic scoliosis. Genetics might be one cause. There are many other theories including hormonal problems, abnormal bone or muscle growth and other factors that have not been identified. It is not known if these factors cause the scoliosis or are the result of scoliosis. Most researchers agree that more than one factor causes scoliosis.</p><h3>Genetics</h3><p>Scoliosis tends to run in families. In one study, about one in 10 people with scoliosis had a first-degree relative with scoliosis. A first-degree relative is a parent, sibling, or child. In the same study, about two in 100 people with scoliosis had a second-degree relative with scoliosis. A second-degree relative is a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or half sibling.</p><h3>Growth issues</h3><p>Scoliosis gets worse during puberty when teenagers are rapidly growing. Scoliosis patients are generally taller than their peers in early puberty, around ages eight to nine. Once patients hit age 10 and up, their height is about the same as everyone else their age.</p><p>Most children have rapid growth at the time of puberty but most do not develop scoliosis. This supports the idea that more than one factor may cause scoliosis.</p><h2>How common is scoliosis?</h2><p>Most scoliosis occurs at the onset of puberty, around the ages of 10 to 16 years of age. Of children and teens in this age group, 2% to 3% will develop scoliosis. There are equal numbers of males and females with small curves of less than 10 degrees. However, females tend to outnumber males (10 to 1) in curves greater than 30 degrees. Less than 10% of patients diagnosed with scoliosis will require surgery.</p>||<h2>Diagnosis</h2><p>In order to diagnose scoliosis, your child requires an X-ray to view the bones in their back. These bones are called vertebrae. When viewed from the front or the back, the spine is normally in a straight line. If your child has scoliosis, the vertebrae will usually curve to form the shape of an S or C.</p><p>The size of your child's curve will be measured. The curve may be small, medium, or large in size, and is measured by degrees:</p><ul><li>Small curves are 20 degrees or less.</li><li>Medium curves are between 20 and 50 degrees.</li><li>Large curves are greater than 50 degrees.</li></ul>||<h2>Will my child's curve need treatment?</h2><p>The need for treatment depends on the type and size of your child's curve. In general:</p><ul><li>If your child has a small curve of less than 20 degrees, they may only need to be observed over time.</li><li>If their curve is medium-sized, between 20 to 50 degrees, they may either be observed or treated with a <a href=\"https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/Article?contentid=974&language=English\">brace</a>.</li><li>If they have a larger curve, greater than 50 degrees, they may require surgery.</li></ul><p>There are many factors that your child's surgeon will consider before recommending treatment:</p><ul><li>How old they are</li><li>How large their curve is</li><li>Whether your child is still growing</li><li>Whether they have an S-shaped or C-shaped curve</li><li>The progression of their curve: how fast the curve is increasing in size</li><li>How your child feels about the look of their back</li><li>Whether your child is experiencing complications, how severe they are, or is at risk of developing complications if the scoliosis is left untreated</li><li>Whether your child is unhappy with the appearance of their back (if their scoliosis is idiopathic)</li></ul><p>For more information about the treatment of scoliosis, see the \"Treatment\" section of the Scoliosis Learning Hub.</p>||<h2>Complications</h2><p>If your child has congenital scoliosis, they might have problems in other areas of their body. Almost 25% of children with congenital scoliosis have problems with their kidneys or urinary tract. Approximately 10% have <a href=\"https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/heart?topic=congenitalheart\">congenital heart disease</a>.</p><p>If your child has neuromuscular scoliosis, the curves in their spine may get larger and lead to more problems. For example, a child with neuromuscular scoliosis might find it hard to sit on their own. If they have a large curve and weak rib muscles, they may have problems with breathing.</p><h2>Does scoliosis cause pain?</h2><p>Sometimes scoliosis can be painful for patients. Researchers studying teens with scoliosis found that older teens, teens who had almost finished growing, and girls who had already started menstruating were more likely to have back pain associated with scoliosis. Factors that did <u><strong>not</strong></u> predict pain with scoliosis included family history of scoliosis and type and size of curve.</p><p>It is important to remember that 60% to 80% of the general population will have back pain in their lifetime. The stress involved with the diagnosis of scoliosis could expresses itself as back pain. Children with scoliosis need to talk with their doctor or orthopaedic surgeon about any pain they are experiencing.</p><h2>Does scoliosis affect the heart and lungs?</h2><p>Scoliosis can affect a person's ability to breath (lung function) because of the impact that it has on their ribcage. Lung function is how well the lungs are working. It is also called pulmonary function. For children with mild-moderate curves, their lung function is not typically severely affected. Your child's lung function is assessed with tests done in a pulmonary function lab, and testing may be done if your child is booked for surgery. If your child has a mild-to-moderate curve, they will usually not require testing.</p><h3>How is lung function tested?</h3><p>Several tests can be done. In general, these tests look at:</p><ul><li>Lung capacity\u2014how much air your child can move in and out of their lungs.</li><li>How fast they can move this air in and out of their lungs.</li><li>The stiffness of their lungs and chest wall. The chest wall includes the rib cage, diaphragm, and abdominal wall.</li></ul><h3>Can certain types of curves affect breathing?</h3><p>In general, only thoracic (mid-back) curves have the potential to affect your child's breathing. Smaller thoracic curves that are between 20 and 45 degrees can cause decreased lung function during heavy exercise. Scoliosis is unlikely to affect your child's ability to do daily activities or moderate exercise if they have a small curve.</p><p>Thoracic (mid-back) curves between 45 and 88 degrees can cause decreased lung function during moderate exercise. However, physical exercise programs designed to train the lungs can improve lung function significantly.</p><p>Patients presenting late with curves over 100 degrees can have a reduced lung capacity by 50%. Curves greater than 120 degrees can lead to right-sided heart failure, which is when the right chamber of the heart has difficulty pumping blood to the lungs. Curves greater than 120 degrees can also cause breathing difficulties in everyday activities.</p><h3>Early onset scoliosis can affect breathing</h3><p>Early onset scoliosis is scoliosis that occurs in children before the age of five years. The cause is not known. While many of these curves remain stable and even disappear on their own, others may increase in size quickly. Without treatment, early onset scoliosis can lead to deformity of the chest and spine. This can lead to problems with breathing.

It is often swollen and painful. Abscesses usually do not heal by themselves, and they may keep getting worse unless they are treated. Treatment starts with antibiotics. However, in some cases, an abscess cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. Instead, it may need to be opened so the pus can drain, allowing it to start healing.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2> <ul> <li>An abscess is a collection of pus somewhere in the body. Sometimes it needs to be drained. When the collection is deep, an interventional radiologist uses image guidance to drain the abscess.</li> <li>Draining an abscess is usually a low-risk procedure.</li> <li>You will be asked to sign a consent form before the procedure.</li> <li>Your child will likely have a drain inserted in the abscess.</li> <li>The procedure is done using local anaesthetic, and your child will receive a general anaesthetic or sedation.</li> <li>Be calm, honest and tell your child what to expect. Children feel less nervous and scared when they are given information about what will happen in the small intestine\" /> <figcaption class=\"asset-image-caption\">An abscess can form in any part of the body. Using image guidance, a tube is placed into the abscess to drain it. This helps control the infection, prevents it from spreading and promotes healing.</figcaption> </figure> <p>An abscess drainage procedure is a way to remove pus from the abscess.</p><p>If the abscess is just under your child's skin, a doctor can usually open and drain it using a scalpel (surgical knife). However, if it is deep in your child's body, it will be drained by an interventional radiologist using image guidance.</p><p>Draining the pus will usually help the abscess heal and make your child feel better sooner. A sample of the pus is often sent to the laboratory to help find out what is causing the infection.</p>||<h2>On the day of the abscess drainage</h2> <p>When your child arrives at the department they will be dressed in a hospital gown and assessed by a nurse. Your child may have an intravenous started and may have some freezing cream put on the skin near the abscess. You will also be able to speak to the interventional radiologist who will be draining the abscess and the anaesthetist or nurse who will be giving your child medication to make them comfortable during the procedure.</p> <p>During the abscess drainage, you will be asked to wait in the surgical waiting area.</p> <h2>Your child will have medicine for pain</h2> <p>Children are given medicine for treatments that may be frightening, uncomfortable or painful. This includes <a>local anaesthesia</a>, <a href=\"/Article?contentid=1260&language=English\">sedation</a> and/or <a href=\"/Article?contentid=1261&language=English\">general anaesthesia</a>. The type of medicine that your child will have for the procedure will depend on your child's condition.</p> <h2>How to see where the abscess is. These pictures guide the interventional radiologist in directing a small needle through the best route into the abscess (usually through the skin).</p> <p>Most often, a small soft tube (drain) is placed in the abscess using ultrasound and X-ray guidance. This drain is then attached to a drainage bag to allow the pus to drain away from the abscess. The drain will stay in your child's body until most of the pus has drained.</p> <p>For most abscess drainages, your child will not need any stitches.</p> <p>The procedure will usually take one hour.</p>||<h2>After the abscess drainage</h2> <p>Once the abscess drainage is complete, your child will be moved to the recovery area. The interventional radiologist will come and talk to you about the details of the procedure. As soon as your child starts to wake up, a nurse will come and get you.</p> <p>The interventional radiologist will come to see your child later on to ensure the drain is working properly. The drain usually stays in until most of the pus has drained out of the abscess. Most children stay in the hospital while the drain is in.<br></p> <h2>Antibiotics</h2> <p>Your child may require antibiotics following the drainage.</p> <h2>Taking out the drain</h2> <p>When the tube is no longer needed, it is removed at your child's bedside. A small bandage is placed over the drain site.</p> <h2>Going home<br></h2> <p>In most cases, children go home only after the drain is removed. Your doctor will let you know when they are well enough to go home. For more details on how to care for your child after an abscess drainage, please see <a href=\"/Article?contentid=1221&language=English\">Abscess drainage: Caring for your child at home after the procedure</a>.</p>||<h2>Giving consent before the procedure</h2> <p>Before the procedure, the interventional radiologist will go over how and why the procedure is done, as well as the potential benefits and risks. They will also discuss what will be done to reduce these risks, and will help you weigh any benefits against the risks. It is important that you understand all of these potential risks and benefits of the abscess drainage and that all of your questions are answered. If you agree to the procedure, you can give consent for treatment by signing the consent form. A parent or legal guardian must sign the consent form for young children. The procedure will not be done unless you give your consent.</p> <h2>How to prepare your child for the procedure</h2> <p>Before any treatment, it is important to talk to your child about what will happen. When talking to your child, use words they can understand. Let your child know that medicines will be given to make them feel comfortable during the procedure.</p> <p>Children feel less anxious and scared when they know what to expect. Children also feel less worried when they see their parents are calm and supportive.</p> <h2>Food, drink and medicines before the or general anaesthetic.</li> <li>If your child has special needs during fasting, talk to your doctor to make a plan.</li> <li>Your child can take their regular morning medicine with a sip of water two hours before the procedure.</li> <li>Medicines such may increase the risk of bleeding.

It affects 85% of teenagers, some as young as 12, and often continues into adulthood. It is also called \"pimples,\" \"zits\" or \"blemishes\".</p>||<h2>Key points</h2><ul><li>Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease in teenagers.</li><li>Acne occurs deep within the skin, and severity and outcomes vary from person to person.</li><li>Acne causes comedones (whiteheads and blackheads), papules, pustules or even nodules.</li><li>Picking, squeezing and popping can lead to scarring.</li><li>Acne is manageable with the appropriate treatment. Ask your doctor or your dermatologist about your options.<br></li></ul>||<h2>What vessels in the skin\" /> <figcaption class=\"asset-image-caption\">Acne occurs when the sebaceous glands produce more oil, clogging different parts of skin tissue.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The skin is formed by many layers of tissue, containing hair, glands, muscles, sensory receptors and blood vessels. During puberty, a group of hormones are released called androgens. Androgens allow the sebaceous glands in the skin to produce an oily substance called sebum. Acne is in part caused by this increase in sebum that naturally occurs during puberty.<br></p><p>Normal amounts of sebum keep skin and hair from drying out. However, excess oil can mix with dead skin cells and clog hair follicles (the tiny tunnels that lead to the root of the hair) and pores (the opening in the skin where the hair passes through).</p><p>A common type of bacteria that lives on the skin, known as <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em>, sometimes contributes to acne by causing inflammation. The acne signals white blood cells to the area, which damage the tissue and cause an inflammatory response. This causes swelling and infection.</p><p>Acne leads to persistent redness and inflammation, especially on the face, scalp, back and chest, where the most sebum is produced.</p><p>Acne varies from mild to severe, depending on what kind of blemishes appear. The different types of acne include:<br></p><ul><li>comedones</li><li>papules</li><li>pustules</li><li>nodules</li></ul><p>Comedones are pores that are blocked with oil and dead skin cells. They can be open (\"blackheads\") or closed by the skin (\"whiteheads\").</p><p>A blackhead is generally level with the skin surface and cannot be removed by normal washing of with an oxidized sebum, which appears black at the top, and a surface view of skin with blackheads\" /> <figcaption class=\"asset-image-caption\">The pore of a blackhead is open.

Pustules appear as red, inflamed circles with a central, raised bump that is yellowish or white. The bump is filled with pus. Pus is the result of inflammation and contains white blood cells, dead skin cells and bacteria.</p> <figure class=\"asset-c-80\"> <span class=\"asset-image-title\">Pustule</span> <img src=\"https://assets.aboutkidshealth.ca/akhassets/IMD_acne_pustule_EN.png\" alt=\"Cross section of pus under the skin and white blood cells that have moved toward the surface, and surface view of pustules\" /> <figcaption class=\"asset-image-caption\">Pustules form a few days after the white blood cells in a papule make it to the surface of the skin.

Reactions can range from minimal distress to more significant depression, anxiety and, less commonly, thoughts of suicide or self-harm. For these reasons, treating acne matters.</p> <h2>Treatment of acne</h2> <p>Treatment depends on the severity and type of acne. An effective treatment will help reduce future breakouts and improve the skin's appearance. Keep in mind that up to six weeks of treatment might be necessary to start noticing results.</p> <p>In most cases, your doctor or dermatologist will prescribe topical treatments (applied directly on the skin). Sometimes the doctor may prescribe an oral treatment (taken by mouth).</p> <h3>Cleansing skin</h3> <p>Acne is a process deep within the skin. Washing your face regularly helps remove dead skin cells and excess oil, but does not play a significant role in the prevention or management of acne.</p> <p>If you have acne, avoid scrubbing your face when washing, because this may worsen inflammation and irritation. Instead, gently wash your face with warm water. You may also use a mild cleansing product if you want.</p> <h3>Topical retinoids</h3> <p>Topical retinoids unplug comedones and improve the process of shedding the old cells. They may also help reduce any inflammation.</p> <p>Some side effects may occur when using a topical retinoid. These include mild irritation, redness (erythema), dryness, peeling and sensitivity to sun. If you are pregnant, or thinking about having a baby, talk to your doctor or dermatologist before using a topical retinoid, as they should not be used during pregnancy.</p> <p>Avoid skin damage, such as waxing or exfoliation (e.g., facials) when taking retinoids.</p> <p>Common topical retinoids are available in cream and gel form. There are benefits to both creams and gels, depending on the severity of acne and the sensitivity of your skin. Retinoids are also available in many strengths and formulations. Therefore, there is no one better option; your doctor will recommend a retinoid most appropriate for you.</p> <h3>Topical antimicrobials</h3> <p>Topical antimicrobials are used to kill bacteria that contribute to inflammation. They also help fight inflammation directly. One option is benzoyl peroxide, which is available over the counter. When benzoyl peroxide touches the skin, oxygen is created. <em>P. acnes</em> cannot survive in the presence of oxygen.</p> <p>Use caution when applying benzoyl peroxide because it is a potent bleaching agent that can damage fabrics. The pharmacist can answer any questions you might have.</p> <h3>Oral antibiotics</h3> <p>An oral antibiotic (taken by mouth) is sometimes used to treat more significant acne, especially in cases where the acne has spread to the back and chest. Such as topical treatments, oral antibiotics reduce inflammation.</p> <p>Antibiotics can also stop <em>P. acnes</em> from multiplying. However, the use of antibiotics should be limited because bacteria can develop a resistance to them.</p> <h3>Combined treatment</h3> <p>A combined treatment can be an effective means of treating acne. In this case, a topical retinoid and an antimicrobial cream or gel can be used together. Sometimes they are combined into one product, while other times they are used separately. For example, a topical antimicrobial may be applied in the morning and a topical retinoid may be used at night.</p> <p>Oral medications are also used in combination with a topical treatment. Most people taking a pill benefit from a topical cream or gel.</p> <p>Your doctor or dermatologist will advise you on how and when to use a combined treatment for acne.</p> <h3>Oral isotretinoin</h3> <p>Isotretinoin (known Epuris in Canada; and Roaccutane in Europe) is a chemical compound related to vitamin A. In most cases, isotretinoin is used to treat severe nodular <ul> an anti-inflammatory</li> <li>it stops sebaceous glands</li> </ul> <p>However, this type of acne treatment must be closely monitored because isotretinoin has a number of side effects. More common side effects include dry skin, lips, nose and eyes. All side effects will begin to disappear when treatment stops.</p> <p>However, there are more severe side effects. For example, isotretinoin can interfere with the development of a fetus. If you are pregnant or thinking about having a baby, talk to your doctor or dermatologist about the side effects of isotretinoin. There are also concerns about depression, inflammatory bowel disease and impact on liver.</p> <h3>Hormonal therapy</h3> <p>Treating acne with female hormones is an effective treatment option for some female patients. This means taking an oral contraceptive (the birth control pill). This type of treatment limits sebum secretion by reducing androgen levels. Other topical and oral treatments can be used along with oral hormonal therapy.</p> <p>Treating acne using hormones is not for everybody.

These disorders occur when areas of the brain that are used for movement, sensation and speech are damaged. Some causes of ataxia in children include: infection, head injury, prescription drugs, and toxins such as illicit drugs, lead poisoning and carbon monoxide.</p><p>Acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia is the most common form of acute ataxia found in children.</p><p>The following definitions can be helpful in understanding the term acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia:</p><ul><li>Acute \u2014 all signs and symptoms appear within a short period of time, in this case within two days.</li><li>Post-infectious \u2014 occurring after an infection.</li><li>Cerebellar \u2014 coming from the cerebellum. The cerebellum is a part of the brain important in controlling movement.</li></ul><p>It is most commonly seen between the ages of two and five, but can also occur in older children.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2> <ul> <li>Ataxia is a movement in children.</li> <li>Acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of acute ataxia in children and is diagnosed after more serious conditions have been excluded.</li> <li>Most children return to normal without treatment.</li> <li>Seek medical attention for any major changes to your child's movements or changes to their level of consciousness.</li> </ul>||<h2>Signs and symptoms of ataxia</h2><p>A child with ataxia has difficulty controlling their movements and may appear clumsy or awkward. They may have some of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>falling while trying to walk or stand</li><li>difficulty walking in a straight line</li><li>bending forwards while walking</li><li>walking with feet spread wide apart</li><li>difficulty child has an infection, the body's immune system produces antibodies that act to destroy viruses and bacteria. Sometimes the antibodies act against the cerebellum, mistaking it for a virus or bacteria. The antibodies can also sometimes trigger other parts of the immune system to affect the cerebellum. In both cases, the child's cerebellum is temporarily affected by the immune system and does not work properly. As a result, the child will not be able to control their movements normally, leading to ataxia. </p><p>The typical timeline of acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia is as follows: </p><ul><li>A child will get an infection, usually with a fever.</li><li>The infection and fever get better.</li><li>A few days to three weeks later ataxia starts to develop. Difficulty with walking is the most common symptom. </li><li>Ataxia develops quickly, usually over the course of one to two days. </li></ul><p>Acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia can occur after many types of infections. About 20% of cases have been linked to <a href=\"/Article?contentid=760&language=English\">varicella (chicken pox)</a>, but it can also develop after other viral infections, some types of <a href=\"/Article?contentid=784&language=English\">pneumonia</a>, and Lyme disease.</p><p>Some viruses that can cause post-infectious cerebellar ataxia are prevented with routine vaccinations.

Instead, it is diagnosed by a process of elimination, where more serious types of ataxia are first excluded. </p> <p>Your child's history, or the description of recent events leading up to the ataxia, will help their medical team make this diagnosis. They will be looking for a recent infection, as well as acute onset of your child's ataxia. The medical team may also ask about other signs or symptoms, such as persistent fever, seizures or neck pain, which could point to a different cause of the ataxia.</p> <p>Your child will undergo a physical exam, with a focus on their nervous system. The medical team will look for the signs and symptoms of ataxia. They will also look for symptoms that could suggest a different diagnosis.</p> <p>Based on your child's history and physical exam, their medical team may suggest more tests. These can include blood work or imaging the brain using a CT scan or MRI.</p>||<h2>Treatment of acute post-infections cerebellar ataxia</h2> <p>Post-infectious cerebellar ataxia usually goes away on its own, and does not require treatment.</p> <p>However, your child may be sent home from the hospital while still experiencing symptoms of ataxia. In this case, special precautions must be taken to keep your child safe.</p> <h3>Taking care of your child at home</h3> <p>Your child may be sent home before their ataxia has gone away. Your child may have difficulty walking and may fall easily. It is very important to make sure the home environment is safe for your child during this time. You may have to supervise your child at all times throughout the day. Please talk to your child's doctor if you need a letter to stay home from work or school to supervise your child.</p> <p>It is important that you are comfortable taking your child home before they can walk or move normally. Please talk to your child's medical team if you are worried about keeping your child safe at home.</p> <h3>Will my child go back to normal? When?</h3> <p>In the majority of cases, acute post-infectious cerebellar ataxia goes away completely in two to three weeks.

So if your young child is having a procedure that you would find painful, they are likely experiencing at least as much pain as you would experience.</p><p>Indeed, certain procedures may be more painful for young children because their brains cannot yet help them cope with pain, for example by using distraction. Never discount your young child's pain-related distress even if they have an injury or procedure that you would not find painful.</p>||<h2>Key points</h2><ul><li>In infants and toddlers, common causes of acute pain include teething, bumps or falls, and vaccinations by needle.</li><li>Signs of acute pain in this age group include irritability, whimpering, sudden changes to facial expression and flailing of arms or legs.<br></li><li>In medical settings, health-care providers assess pain by using standard tools and checking your baby's heart and breathing rate, and their oxygen levels.</li><li>Always feel free to share your own opinion and any concerns about your child's pain with the health-care team.</li></ul>||<h2>Assessing acute pain at home </h2><p>Because your young child cannot speak yet, you can only tell how much pain they are experiencing through the painful situation and their behaviour. In this case, the context means thinking about whether the procedure would be painful for an older child or could be painful for a young child even if not painful for someone older. Based on this information, you would then watch for any changes in your child's behaviour.</p><p>Behavioural signs of acute pain include:</p><ul><li>irritability</li><li>sharp changes in facial expressions (for example grimacing with eyes shut and brow bulging)</li><li>crying or whimpering</li><li>flailing or thrashing arms or legs</li><li>changes in their feeding, playing and/or sleeping routines</li><li>rigidness or limpness</li><li>changes in breathing</li><li>changes in how they interact with people and things around them</li></ul>||<h2>Assessing acute pain in medical settings</h2><p>In the hospital, your child's health-care team uses a range of tools to determine how much pain an infant is feeling. </p><p>In the NICU setting, one of the most common tools for assessing pain in infants is the <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-premature-infant-pain-profile-revised-%28PIPP-R%29:-Stevens-Gibbins/76e49d44432665d7dffd5a9a7a2fdd55466f7f32/figure/0\" target=\"_blank\">Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R)</a>. This tool rates many of the behaviours that a child might display at home as well as physiological signs (signs inside the body), such as your infant's:</p><ul><li>heart rate<br></li><li>oxygen saturation (how much oxygen is in their blood)<br></li><li>breathing rate</li></ul><p>For older infants and children aged up to two, health-care providers usually use the <a href=\"http://www.olchc.ie/Healthcare-Professionals/Nursing-Practice-Guidelines/Pain-FLACC-Behavioural-Pain-Assessment-Scale-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scale</a>. This tool looks at several of the behaviours described above.</p> <p>In medical settings, your child's health-care team plays an important role in clarifying the level and cause of pain, but feel free to share your opinions and concerns about your infant's pain with them.</p>||<h2>Websites</h2><p>Comforting Your Baby mins 50 secs)<br>Psychological and physical strategies for parents to reduce vaccination pain in healthy infants</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Oqa1Fag5eQ\" target=\"_blank\">Reduce the pain of vaccination in babies</a> (13 mins 08 secs)<br> Tips for parents on helping healthy infants get through vaccinations</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y49FOGtmwo\" target=\"_blank\">Easing your baby's pain: A mother's story</a> (3 07 secs)<br> Three ways to instantly reduce your infant's pain in the NICU</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nqN9c3FWn8\" target=\"_blank\">The Power secs)<br> How breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact can help when an infant is experiencing a painful procedure</p>||<p>Content developed by Rebecca Pillai Riddell, PhD, CPsych, OUCH Lab, York University, Toronto, in with:<br>Lorraine Bird, MScN, CNS, Fiona (2012).
