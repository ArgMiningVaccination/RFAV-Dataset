A Q&A with Dr. Manoj Jain Our battle against the virus is both an individual and collective effort: our individual immune systems and our public health system. Question: How does our immune system work to fight COVID-19? Answer: Our immune system is our greatest and best defence against the virus. The reason COVID-19 is causing so much infection is because it is a novel virus and our immune system has not seen this virus ever before. Hence, nearly everyone is susceptible to COVID-19 infection. So, either we will become infected with the virus or be protected by a vaccine from the infection.

B cells build antibodies against the proteins for the virus and T cells search and destroy virus particles. At present we can measure antibody level in persons to see if the individual has had the COVID-19 infection in the past and are protected. Studies show that immune memory is present at least up to eight months after a COVID-19 infection. If I have antibodies and/or have had COVID-19 infection do I need to get the vaccination? Yes. At present we do not have enough scientific information on how long antibodies last after an infection, so it is best to get the vaccine. Also there have been cases of reinfection, such cases may be prevented after a vaccination. Given these situations, it is recommended that everyone get a vaccination even those who have had a recent infection and those who are positive for antibodies. What causes some person to become severely ill? It is unclear why some people have a mild illness with COVID-19 while others become critically ill. Severe illness is likely due to an uncoordinated hyper reaction of the immune system in the later stages of infection. We prevent this reaction with early treatment with monoclonal antibodies, which directly impact the virus with artificially developed antibodies. We prevent severe illness or hyper reaction of the immune system at the later stage\u2014during hospitalization\u2014with treatment using steroids. What can we do to boost our immune system? Good diet, exercise, sleep and relaxation are all critical to a strong immune response both to fighting the virus infection as well as to getting a good antibody and T cell booster from the vaccine. One interesting study on relaxation and meditation found a group of individuals who practiced meditation after their flu vaccine had stronger antibody response compared to those who did not do the relaxation technique. When will we reach herd immunity? While individual infection and vaccination provides immunity to a person, larger groups need to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity. When large percent of the population, such as over 70% have either had the infection or have been vaccinated, then the virus transmission begins to abate, because there are fewer susceptible individuals. However, with the mutant highly transmissible strain, it will require 90% of the population to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Our battle against the virus is both an individual and collective effort: our individual immune systems and our public health system.
