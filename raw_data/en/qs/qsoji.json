This review focusses only on the us e of herbal medicines. Most African people accept herbal medicines as generally safe with no serious adverse effects. However, the overlap between conventional medicine and herbal medicine is a reality among countries in health systems transition. Patients often simultaneously seek treatment from both conventional and traditional health systems for the same condition. Commonly encountered conditions/diseases include mala ria, HIV/AIDS, hypertension, tuberculosis, and bleeding OPEN ACCESSPharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 638 disorders. It is therefore imp erative to understand the modes of interaction between different drugs from conventional and traditional hea lth care systems when used in treatment combinations. Both conventional and traditi onal drug entities are metabolized by the same enzyme systems in the human body, resulting in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics interactions, whose properties remain unknown/unquantified. Thus, it is important that profiles of in teraction between different herb al and conventional medicines be evaluated. This review evaluates herbal an d conventional drugs in a few African countries and their potential interaction at the pharmacogenomics level. Keywords: herbal pharmacogenetics 1. It has been observed that an in creasing number of people in deve loped and developing countries use herbal products for both preventive and therapeutic purposes. Often the use of herbal medicines is associated with attenuation of si de-effects produced from therapeutic drugs [1]. For centuries humanity has used plants for medicinal purposes and over the last few decades there has been a most remarkable revival of herbal medicine. This has been partly due to the elusive cure for HIV/AIDS that has prompted many countries to refocus their atte ntion on herbal medicinal plants, w ith increased fundi ng being poured into related research areas. Herbal medicines are used for the treatment of many ailments, including immune and psychiatric disorders, microbial and vi ral infections, non-communicable diseases such as cancer, malaria, and injuries, and repr oductive health issues such as infe rtility. Some of the factors that facilitate high usage of herbal me dicines include their loca l abundance, cultural si gnificance, history of known efficacy, and, most importantly, inexpensive procurement compared to conventional pharmaceuticals [2]. It is estimated that 30%-50% of all drugs on the market are either derived from or their design was inspired by herb al medicinal plants [3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of Asian and African populations re ly on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs and in the developed countries 70%-80% of the population use some form of complementary and alternative medicine at some stage [4]. The use of medicinal herbal plants is one of the oldest known forms of therapy, which has evolved in such a way that each culture, country, or region ha s created its own pharmacy of locally grown medicinal plants. Herbal medicinal products are easily accessible. They are found in informal markets, pharmacies, health-food stores, and even online [5]. This abundan ce has, however, brought with it the issue of \"fake\" herbals which find their way onto the market alongside real ones. As herbal remedies are considered \"pure and natural\" there is a belief that they are al so \"safe and harmless\" [6]. Although herbal medicines are from natural sources, some naively believe that th ey are always non-toxic [7] and that they are always complications-free after use. And ye t, there are several stories of pa tients who developed complications and even died after taking some herbal medicines [8 ]. In fact, in some part s of Africa, it is common practice that herbal traditional h ealers or doctors withhold some of the herbal medicines from their patients and only dose th em under their strict supervision because of known toxicities should overdoses Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 639 occur. However, most of the herbals are prescribed as \"take home\" treatments making it easy for patients to \"overdose\" themselves. In terms of pharmacogenomics, it is known that medicinal herbal pl ants are metabolized by drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). This has several imp lications for their therapeutic efficacy. Firstly, DMEs are encoded for by polymorphic genes which ha ve a potential to affect the way these compounds are metabolized. The variation in DM E genes results in variant enzyme s presenting with altered activity or abolished activity [9,10]. Thus, in a population w ith individuals carrying a myriad of polymorphic DME genes, a huge variability exists in the way i ndividuals respond to any of the herbal medicines taken. This leads to classification of people into different drug res ponse phenotypes, which includes poor metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, and ultra-rapid metabolizers, with respect to specific drugs, which then influences the drug's physiological effects [11]. It is therefore necessary to take into account the pharmacogenetics effects of DMEs when herbal medicina l plants are used as a source of therapy. Besides being metabolized, herbal medicinal drugs are also ab le to affect the expression of some of the DMEs, either through inhibi tion or induc tion [12,13]. The same enzyme system that metabolizes herbal medicinal compounds is also responsible for the metabolism of conventional drugs. This has huge im plications among patients who intermittently make use of both health care systems. In some cases, he rbal medicinal plants induce DMEs that metabolize particular conventional drugs such that, when given together, the conventional drug does not reach therapeutic levels because of the increased abunda nce of the DME [14]. On the other hand, herbal medicinal drugs could present with inhibitory effect s preventing/delaying the re moval of co-administered conventional drugs and resulting in them reachi ng toxic levels. According to the World Health Organization, Africa is burdened with increasing communicable and non-communicable diseases that pose many challenges on already poorly resourced hea lth systems [15]. Medicinal herbal plants present an alternative for combating these diseases, with the aim of reducing their associated morbidity and mortality. However, the pharmacogenetics implications of the use of these herbal plants have not been properly assessed. In this article, we report on the us e of medicinal herbal plants in the era of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and increasing non-communicable diseas es, and their pharmacogenetics imp lications, focusing on Southern and West African populations. Literatu re related to herbal medicine use and genetic polymorphisms for DMEs known to metabolize these was evaluated. We performed a bibliometric analysis related to herbal medicine use and genetic polymorphisms for DMEs known to metabolize various drugs to evaluate the use of medicinal herbal plants in the era of HIV, malaria, and some non-communicable diseas es, and their pharmacogenetics implications. The study focused mostly on data available from a selected group of Sout hern and West African countries and these countries were ch osen mostly due to accessibility. 2. Search Methods for Relevant Literature The literature for this review was accessed thro ugh databases such as Pu bMed/Medline and Google Scholar. The main words/phrases used in the search were: drug-drug interactions , disorders, herbal treatment, pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomic s, and cytochrome P450. Individual words or Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 640 combinations were narrowed down by emphasizing \"A frica\", then lastly, Southern Africa and West Africa, separately. Only articles th at could be accessed in full format were used. The review was limited to the disorders mentioned above a nd herbal plants reported to be co mmonly used by Southern and West African populations. We acknowledge that the review is not exhaustive of all the published sources. However, the wide-ranging nature of the search criteria and phrases used in the search enabled us to discuss in detail the implicatio ns of pharmacogenomics in the use of herbal medicinal plants. 3. Discussion of Pharmacogenomics Implicatio ns on the Co-use of Conventional and Herbal Medicines 3.1. Brief Overview Developing countries are not oriously affected by many health ch allenges, especially \"diseases of poverty\", such as waterborne diseas es, viral infections, such as HIV/ AIDS and influenza, malaria, and an emerging pandemic of non-communicable diseases. The intersection of all these disease conditions means that, at any time, in any one patient, ther e is a high likelihood of receiving drugs that are metabolized by the same enzyme. This has huge implicat ions, since this leads either to sub-therapeutic levels or high concentrations that reach toxic levels. Table 1 shows a list of some drugs used for the treatment of commonly encountered health challenges, highlighting the overlapping enzyme system. Adding medicinal herbal plants to th is already complicated picture furt her adds to major health issues. A close look at Southern, Eastern, Central, and West Africa shows that there are certain common herbal medicinal drugs that are prescribed for the treatment of commonly occu rring conditions, such as malaria, hypertension, and HIV/AIDS [ 16,17]. Some of the medicinal drugs used in these different regions either belong to the same plant species or are derived from clos ely related plant species. Examples of these include Moringa pterygosperma and Moringa oleifera , which have a wide use in sub Saharan Africa Many studies have evaluated the metabolism of some of these medicinal drugs with respect to the enzymes that are involved. The main indication is that there is an overlap in the DMEs that are involved in the metabolism of each of the herbal compounds, just as in the case of conventional drugs. For both health systems (herbal and conventional), the polym orphisms in DMEs affect their activities and, therefore, their disposition. It is important to note that genetic variants of DMEs exhibit bo th qualitative and quantitative differences between differe nt racial and ethnic populations. Indeed, CYP2D6 provides a very good example, where certain variants are only found in part icular populations, for example: CYP2D6*17 among black Africans, CYP2D6*10 among Asians, and CYP2D6*2N reported in most populations but at different freque ncies [18]. Among patients using bot h the conventional and traditional drug systems, the issues to contend with includ e drug-drug, herb-drug, herb-herb interactions, and genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for DMEs. Below we evaluate specific examples of diseases/conditions and how they are managed by the di fferent regimens, be it c onventional or traditional herbal medicines.

A Focus on Malaria 3.2.1. Herbal Medicinal Herbal Plants Used in the Management and Treatment of Malaria Malaria is one of the leading causes of morbid ity and mortality with 124-283 million estimated cases per year, resulting in an estimated 367,000-755,000 fatal ities [19]. Conventional drug development has often neglected malaria such that most of th e drug discoveries emanated from accidents or drug- repurposing [33]. The use of plant-de rived drugs for the treatment of malaria has a long and successful tradition, with a litany of many plants being indicated for the trea tment of malaria, with some of the compounds providing good sources fo r the detection of active compone nts with novel an ti-plasmodial activities [34]. The first antimalarial drug, quinine, wa s isolated from the bark of Cinchona species found in South America ( Rubiaceae ) in 1820 and is one of the oldest and most impor tant antimalarial drugs, which is still in use today [35]. In the 1940s, anot her antimalarial drug, chlo roquine, was synthesized and is also currently in use for the treatment of mala ria [36]. In Ghana there is rich literature on the use of plants for malaria treatment by various local communities [37,38]. Some of the anti-malarial medicinal plants used in The evidence from South African traditional healers al so demonstrates a wide use of herbal medicine in combating malaria [42,43]. For example, there is extensive utilization Mimusops obtusifolia medicine prac titioners [45] . Although all these plants have been commonly used by traditional healers, their efficacy has not been extensively studied or sc ientifically validated. Maybe, this is one of the problems with conventional medicine that, as we seek to scientifically validat e the efficacy of herbal medicines, we take a reductionist approach, wanting to work with extracted components and not mixtures. Cassia sieberiana and Vernonia amygdalina have at least been scient ifically shown to exhibit antimalarial properties, further justifying their ex tensive utilization for malaria prevention [46]. 3.2.2. Conventional Drugs Used in the Management of Malaria and the Pharmacogenetics Landscape The use of herbal medicine has b een the mainstay for the clinical control of malaria for hundreds of years. For example, artemisinin rich teas were in troduced in China 1500 year s ago [47], while in the 17th century South America tree barks containing quinine were exploited. It was only in the 20th century when synthetic and semi-synthetic compounds star ted to be developed. The pharmacogenetics of antimalarial herbs is, however, poorly known, alt hough its application might be critical in the optimization of malaria treatment [48]. It has recently been demonstrated that host genetic variation in DMEs influences the selection of (AQ) (CQ), presents with several genetic variants (e.g., CYP2C8*2) that are associated with decreased CYP2C8 enzyme activity, which aff ects metabolism of CYP2C8 substrate drugs, thereby Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 643 leading to variability in the rem oval of malaria causing parasite s in the infected hosts [50]. CYP2C8 polymorphic variants show qualitative and quantitativ e differences between different populations, for example, allele CYP2C8*2 is the most common variant in Africans, associated with the poor metabolizer phenotype (PM), whereas CYP2C8*3 is rare among Africans [51]. While the effects of genetic polymorphisms for conventional drugs used in the treat ment of malaria seems to be well studied, there is no data on the effects of the various antimalarial herbal medicines on CYP2C8 or, vice-versa , there is no data on which herbal medicines are substrates for CYP2C8, information that is important in understanding the differential eff ects of herbal medicine among popul ations that are in different geographical locations or of different racial extraction. 3.3. HIV/AIDS Management 3.3.1. Scrounging for a Cure: the Use of Medicinal Herbal Plants in HIV/AIDS Management An HIV cure has been elusive for the last 30 years and all current drugs have been effective only in reducing the viral load but not in eliminating the vi rus completely. Several antiretroviral drugs are on the market and their mode of action involves combin ation therapy. Despite the availability of several pharmaceutical drugs, their cost and associated side -effects makes the majority of African populations unable to afford or continue on these treatments on a consistent and/or sustai nable basis [52]. Access, especially to second-line therapies, is often well beyond the means of most patients [53], making it difficult to meet the World Health Organizati on's (WHO) plans to have 15 million persons on antiretroviral drugs by 2015 [ 54]. The virus resistance and toxicity [ 53] associated with some of these drugs makes it difficult for patients to enjoy qu ality of life while taking them. Looking at all these challenges faced by conventional medical care, it has been seen that there is a recent boom in the use of traditional medicine systems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where HIV/AIDS is endemic. The lack of suitable vaccines has also propelled the use of herbal medicinal plants. Thus, we are at a juncture, where in search of good health, in many regions of Africa and elsewhere, where people start using medicine from the two health systems simultaneousl y or sequentially, as note d by King & Homsy [55], resulting in a kind of medical pluralism. HIV/AIDS research has received a lot of attention, especially vaccine development and, lately, drug discovery and development. The failu re to get a cure has increased th e attention to herbal medicinal plants. Some African indigenous plants have be en shown to possess antir etroviral activity using in vitro experiments [56,57]. The herbals that have shown promise are being tested as treatments for HIV- related infections. The use of traditional medicine and natu ral health products is widespread among those living with HIV infection [58]. Ethnobotani cal studies conducted in different African countries, for example, Uganda [59], Tanzania [60], Nami bia [61], and Cameroon [62], show that traditional healers and lay-people extensively utilize me dicinal plants to manage the e ffects of HIV/AIDS. Two principal African herbal compounds used for HIV/AIDS management in s ub-Saharan Africa (SSA) include Hypoxis hemerocallidea (common name: African potato) and Sutherlandia frutescens . These two herbal remedies are currently recommended by the South African Ministry of Health for HIV management [16]. The 14 member states of the S outhern African Development Community (SADC), namely, Angola, Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 644 Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesot Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Swazila nd, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbab we, also support their use [16]. A cross-sectional survey has indi cated the use of medicinal herbal plants in the management of HIV/AIDS among patients in Ghana [63]. Two plants, Betula alba and Sutherlandia frutescens , have found their way into herbal clinics for the manage ment of HIV/AIDS due to their immunostimulatory and antimicrobial properties [17]. Anona senegalense is an herbal plant that has been acknowledged to be used for HIV/AIDS treatment by the people of th e Northern part of Ghan a [38]. As part of an ethnobotanical research, some of the common medicinal plants used by traditional healers in the management of HI V/AIDS in Botswana [64]. However, it is worth noting that the partial benefit attributed to some traditional medicines in HI V/AIDS management could be due to their immune-boosting acti vity rather than a direct inhibi tory effect on vi ral replication. 3.3.2. FDA Approved ARVs and Pharmacogenetics Landscape The use of combinations of antiretroviral drugs to provide potent antiretr oviral therapy (ART) has dramatically impacted the morbidity and mortality due to HIV/AIDS [65]. Despite this revelation, clinicians are increasingly faced with challenges in the selection and management of antiretroviral therapy regimens, including the choice of the most e fficacious drugs that have the lowest toxicity and do not interact with other drugs used for commonly occurring condi tions. Although the introduction of viral genotyping and combination- therapy pharmacokinetic data ha s provided some guidance, the investigation of host genetic factors that impact bot h the efficacy and toxicity of ART may also aid in selecting the best regimen fo r individual patients [66]. African populations are among the most genetically diverse [67] and possibly present with a wide range of pharmacogenomics profiles that need to be considered for each dr ug or class of drugs [68]. Several pharmacogenetics studie s on HIV/AIDS cohorts on regimens shown that the CYP2B6 c.516G>T SNP affects plasma EFV levels. This has been among Ghanaians [69], South Africans [ 18], Zimbabweans [70], Ethiopians [71], and c.983T>C [73] and CYP2B6 g.15582C>T [74], have also been shown to play a significant role in plasma EFV c oncentration. Genetic variation recept or-CAR), and UGT2B7 ha s also been shown to be associated with significan tly elevated efavirenz concentra role in plasma efav irenz concentration [75,76]. There is an imperative need to us e this knowledge on the known DMEs th at affect ARV drugs in adding value to herbal medicines. For ex ample, very little information is available on how and which herbal medicines affect the activities of enzymes such as CYP2B6. For example, in vitro inhibition studies using heterologously expressed CYP2B 6, incubated with its probe-substrates in the presence of specific herbal compounds, may assist in evalua ting if there is any inhibition of activity. In order to be able to identify specific therapeutically active components (e.g., phytochemicals) in he rbal extracts, various computational tools and models, such as pharm acophore modelling, virtual screening, docking, and neural networking [77], can be employed. Whatever components are identified could become candidates Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 645 for possible rational drug design. Id entifying profiles of differential RNA, protein expression, and metabolites in cells or patients exposed to particul ar herbal medicines could take advantage of the advanced \"Omics\" technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics [78] to ultimately come up with response profiles. Thes e profiles may be used for asse ssments of efficacy and safety, further validating the utility of herbal compounds as is done for conventional medicine. 3.4. Hypertension Treatment 3.4.1. The Use of Medicinal Herbal Plants in Hypertension Management and Treatment The burden of hypertension (HTN) in Africa is widely reported, with the World Economic Forum acknowledging its effects on productivity [79]. Hypertension is the most fre quently observed risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in both urban and rural communities in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) and will contribute to the growing burden of CVD [80]. Traditional herbal medicine may have significant impact on HTN treatment and control in sub-Sahara n Africa [81]. Traditional medicine use is high among adults in SSA with a prevalence ranging from 38.5%-90% [82]. Traditiona l herbal medicine is commonly used around the world for both cardiovasc ular disease in genera l [83] and hypertension specifically [84]. According to Ziblim et al. [38], in the Northern parts of Ghana, medicinal herbal plants such as Parkia biglobos and Moringa oleifera are used in the management of hypertension. As mentioned earlier, different regions or geographical settings have their own pl ants that they use to manage common conditions they encounter. For example, Tetrapleura tetraptera and Alstonia boonei are used by the Akan people, who are mostly found in the southe rn and coastal towns of Ghana, for managing hypertension [85], and Launaea taraxacifolia is used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, which is a risk factor for hypertension [86] are indicated for the management of high blood pressure conditions, whereas, Agathosma betulina has been used among South African population groups as an effective diuretic and anti-inflammatory agent [90]. There are also reports that Allium sativum has been reported to have hypotensive effects. A compila tion of medicinal plants in South Africa has also listed Aloe ferox and Hoodia gordonii as plants used in managing hypertension in South Africa. 3.4.2. Anti-Hypertensive Drugs and Relate d Pharmacogenetics Observations High blood pressure (BP) is the most common single ri sk factor for cardiovasc ular-related events and deaths worldwide [91]. In a recent re view, it was observed that in the last 10 years incidence of systolic BP has risen more in most of Africa, except the east, than what is being observ ed in any other region of the world [92], and that hyperten sion seems to be more aggressi ve among patients of African ancestry [93]. Losartan has been shown to be a pote nt, orally active, and highly selective angiotensin-II receptor antagonist for the treatment of hypertension [94]. In vitro and in vivo investigations suggest that genetic in CYP2C9, CYP11B2 , CYP3A4 , and CYP3A5 , that affect catalytic activity of the respective enzymes, also affect response to losartan [95,96]. For example, dias tolic and systolic blood Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 646 pressure in patients with the CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype who were on losartan was reduced compared to the baseline level [97] in comparis on to patients with other genotypes made up of deficient alleles (e.g., CYP2C9*1/*3 ). Since traditional herbal medicine forms part of the larger primary health system in poor countries, it is of importance that the effects of the various herbal mixtures in the different African regions be investigated for the effects of their expre ssions and activity of the associated DMEs. Understanding the modes of interacti on between the different drugs is lik ely to lead to improved use of both traditional and c onventional medicine. 3.5. Tuberculosis and Bleeding Disorders 3.5.1. Herbal Management of Tuberculosis and Bleeding Disorders Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern with over 2 bill ion people currently infected, 8.6 million new cases per year, and more than 1.3 milli on deaths annually [98]. Among African traditional herbal medicine, tuberculosis is treated through targeting sympto ms (for example, coughing, loss of weight and appetite, and night sweats). In the advent of resi stance by the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis [99], the use of herbal medicine for tuberculosis treatment presents another potential means of combating the disease. Herbal medicines for the treatment and management of tuberculosis have been in existence for a long time, with traditional healers normally treating the signs and symptoms and in so doing helping to \"cure\" patients. Tuberculosis (TB) is a condition that commonly occu rs with HIV infection a nd been mentioned by traditional healers as some of the most regularly used herbal plants to treat and manage TB, possibly through having been shown to possess antimycobacterial activ edulis ) is also one of the noted herbal plants used to treat TB infection in HIV patients among the Xhosa speaking people of the Eastern Cape in South Africa [101]. In Ghana, traditional methods of treatments based on medicinal plants are stil l an important part of social life and culture, and the acceptability of herbal plants as effective remedies is quite hi gh; the most commonly used herbal plants for the management of TB with a few studies showing the activity of these herbal plants against the slow-growing pathogenic strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [98]. It is no secret that traditional hea lth systems have long been involved in the symptomatic treatments of tuberculosis, and whether th ey are effective is an argument to be taken in another review. What is clear is that the metabolism of the indicated he rbal compounds or mixtures has not been a focus for studies or, alternatively, nor ha s the effects of these herbals on the indicated genes and their product. Thus, we highlight in this review that conventional and traditional herbal medicines will always co-exist, thus, it is our duty (researchers and health practitioners from both systems) to evaluate and understand the interactions of th ese drugs from both these health systems. Bleeding disorders are also a common feature of attention among herbal medi cinal practitioners, as injuries are a common occurrence in any active population. In Ghana, se lected herbal plants, 8 647 Ficus gnaphalocarpa are used by traditional healers for tr eating a number of bleeding-related disorders [38]. Antiplatelet and antic oagulant properties used ethno-medicinally in the treatment of hemorrhaging or as an ticoagulants and bleeding disorders in South Africa some of the common herbal medicinal plants that are used for treatment and management of different bleeding disorders [105]. However, the effects of these herbals on gene e xpression (especially for genes of pharmacogenomics importance) have not been evaluated. Nor, are the effects of the vari ous genes on the herbal drugs/mixtures. This review contributes to bri nging such awareness and possibly paving a way for reconsideration of effectiven ess of different drug systems. 3.5.2. Commonly Used Drugs to Combat Tuberculosis and Bleeding and Their Pharmacogenetic Outlook Among the several drugs used to treat tuberculos is, pharmacogenomics is known to be prominent in the disposition of isoniazid, a key first-line drug for tuberculosis treatment, with minimal pharmacogenomics indications for rifampicin [106]. Isoniazid is metabolized by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), an enzyme coded by a polymorphic gene that presents with several vari ants, most of which are associated with decreased NAT2 activity [107] . The , and NAT2*14 the majority of the slow acetylator genotypes and have been reported across most world populations [108], however, still showing differences among populations. The slow acetylator st atus of NAT2 has been strongly a ssociated with is oniazid-induced hepatotoxicity, thus, haplotypes coding for slow acetylat or status could serve as useful biomarkers for prediction of anti-tuberculous drug- induced toxicity [109]. In additi on to NAT2, appears that CYP2E1 and solute carrier organic anion transporte r family member 1B1(OATP1B1) coded for by SLCO1B1 gene, could also be important biomarkers for isoni azid-induced liver toxicity in adult patients with tuberculosis [110]. For example, am ong Indian pediatric patie nts the risk of liver toxicity was enhanced by a variant in the CYP2E1 gene [111], while the SLCO1B1 low-level rifampin exposure [106]. Warfarin is the most commonly used oral an ti-coagulant; whereas the most commonly used anti-platelet medications include aspirin and clopidogrel, each of which influences blood haemostasis through different mechanisms. Marked inter-indivi dual variations in res ponse to these commonly prescribed medications have been well-documented and represent a significant challenge to medical practice [112]. Warfarin consists of both R and S en antiomers, with the S being more active. Each form, however, is metabolized through a different mechanis m, with the S-warfarin metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 and R-warfarin metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 [113]. Studies suggest that genetic variation in CYP2C9 impairs metabolism of S-warfarin by a bout 30%-40% [114]. Th e distribution of CYP2C9 polymorphisms among sub-Saharan popul ations is characteri zed by the absence or rarity (< 1%) of the defective alleles CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 , which are relatively common in Europeans [115]. In addition to CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 also play important roles in warfarin metabolism, thus, genetic variation in their genes would result in variability in warfarin response. Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 648 3.6. The Combined Use of Conventional and Herbal Medicine and their Interaction with Polymorphisms in Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Genes Pharmacogenetics describes patients' variation in re sponse to therapy due to genetic factors [18] and this is of special interest for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, where impairment in metabolic activity is likely to cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The majority of phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are polymorphic. Genetic polymorphism of DMEs encompasses gene copy number variation includ ing gene amplification and deletion, small inse rtions and deletions, as well as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [10]. The polymorphisms of DME genes are important determinants for drug response, and, indeed, the ma jority of pharmacogenomics drug labels refer to genes encoding phase I and phase II enzymes [116]. African populations have a larger genetic diversity than other populations [117]. Genotyping of Zimbab weans [118] and Ethiopi ans [119] showed the existence of qualitative and quantitative differences in genetic polymorphisms in different populations. It has been increasingly acknowledg ed that herbal medicines and conventional drugs can potentially interact in the same manner observed among conventional drugs ( i.e., drug/drug interactions) [120]. As alluded to earlier, both herbal medicinal drugs and conventional dr ugs are effectively removed from the human body through metabolism by the same enzyme metabolizing systems, which to a large extent enzyme system, and the various transporters. Thus, when one looks at populations in health transition, there are many ch allenges which include drug-drug, drug-herb and herb-herb interactions. One example of herb-drug in teraction is the observed effects of the Ayurvedic syrup, \"Shankhapushpi\", as reported by Bateman et al. [121], which causes a decrease in the plasma concentration of phenytoin resulting in loss of seizure control in epileptic patients. Another challenge is that there seems to be no consideration in herbal medicine dosing which takes into account the diversity of patients in terms of their bei ng adults, children, or el derly; however, physiol ogical differences among these groups are known. In developing nations, traditional herbal medicine is the major source of health care for most except a privileged few [122]. There is re markably little correlati on and scientific eviden ce to support the safe or effective combination of traditional and conve ntional medical care a pproaches. Many people who today choose herbal products in a ddition to prescription medications a ssume that becaus e these products are natural, they must be safe, even when the eviden ce for this assertion is essentially anecdotal. Studies have shown that herbal medicines are highly vari able in quality and compos ition, with many marketed products \"in some cases\" containing little of the intend ed ingredients and act ually including some unintended contaminants such as heavy metals and traces of prescription dr ugs [123]. Sometimes there are problems with identification of plants; for example, some plants might look similar in appearance, yet are different with respect to their herbal medicinal use. A survey in Ghana [40] reported on possibilities of misidentification of plants by some merchants. It is important, therefore, that a registry of pharmacopoeia be kept to authenti cate the identity of herbal plants us ed by practitioners, especially formulations that claim to contain certain plant species. Howe ver, this should not dist ract from the fact that herbal medicines have had many centuries of use and validation among communities. Similar to conventional drugs, herbal medicines can also induce or inhi bit the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs), thereby co mpromising the metabolizing of other herbals or Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 649 conventional drugs that they are co -administered with. For example, it has been observed that St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) affects the rcent of all prescr iption drugs [124] through its with th e drug efflux transporter p-gl ycoprotein (P-gp) coded for by ABCB1 perforatum inhibits P-gp, leading to overdosing substrate drugs such as fexofenadine [125]. Hypericum perforatum has also been shown to cause a decrease in the bioavailability of theophylline [1 26] when co-administe red. as Cassia auriculata and Cardiospermum halicacabum have been shown to of both carbamazepine and theophylline [127]. synthetase and thus prolongs bleeding tim e [128] and therefore influences the therapeutic outcome for persons taking warfarin or other drugs that affect platelet activity. Inhibition of coagulation leading to postoperative bl eeding and requiring surgical re-explorati on after preoperative use of the herbs ginkgo, ginseng, an d the Chinese herb Huang qi, combined with vitamin E and the prescription drugs quinine sulphate and sertraline hydrochlor ide was reported in a 60-year-old woman with breast carcinoma [129]. 3.7. Contestations in Knowledge Production: Issu es in the Co-Existence of Conventional and Herbal Medicines It should be acknowledged that the two health sy stems, conventional and traditional medicine, will co-exist for a very long time to co me and continue to be used concomitantly. Some of the reasons for the above assertion include the inaccessibility, expens iveness, and ineffectiven ess of conventional drugs to completely cure existing diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS , asthma, psychotic disord ers) [130]. Also, as long as traditional medicines remain cheap and retain some visible evidence of useful ness, people will always use them. Lastly, the provision of herbal medicine is cu ltural, and is view ed as a holistic way of healing that cures not just the ailment but also addresses spiritual issues anchored on a people's belief system [131]. In some cases, if one is cured, it is thought to extend to members of the family and the community at large. This contrasts with conventiona l medicine, which is individualistic and reductive in practice. Africa presents a diverse collectio n of herbal medicines reflectin g the geographica l and cultural diversity on the con tinent. As an emerging realization, a few in vitro studies have been done in evaluating commonly used herbal plants in Southern and West African countries on th eir induction or inhibition properties for drug metabolizing enzymes, as seen in Table 1. The data shows that the concurrent use of these herbal drugs with conventi onal medications that are metaboliz ed by drug metabolizing enzymes, especially the cytochrome P450 enzymes, should be av oided to prevent the risk of adverse drug reactions. One area of contention in terms of studying the effect s of drugs and herbal me dicines is the issue of validation [132]. In many parts of the world, traditional herbal medicine is always \"accused\" of toxicity even without any confirmation of that . However, when one interacts with herbal traditional practitioners, it is obvious that there are ways of administering herbal medicines that , while avoiding toxicity, achieve effectiveness. In fact, some practit ioners even warn their patients on how to avoid overdosing. The major issues with herbal medicines include (1) the form in which the herbal is taken (extracts, raw, or processed), (2) quantitie s to be given, (3) varying effects depending on part of plant used ( i.e., roots, leaves, flowers, bark, or seeds), and (4) harv esting season and time of day [132,133]. However, harvesting seems to be taken into account in traditional herbal medicine through \"agreed\" times of Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 650 collection for certain herbals. Recently, however, tradit ional herbal medicine has started to be exploited by some unscrupulous practitioners who enter into this health system for money. For example, in South Africa removal of unwanted pregnancies using herbal medicine is a thriving business, while in other parts of Africa \"fake\" herbal medi cine is used to con the poor with promises of enhancing their employment prospects. All this gives traditional medi cine a bad name that makes it difficult to promote the good aspects; thus, it is imperative to put in place measures to control and manage this health system. This is not without precedence: traditional Chines e medicine which emphasizes holistic aspects of healing is widely accepted world-wide, and has b ecome a billion-dollar indus try [134]. One of the problems that may have affected acceptance of herbal medicines in Africa is a history of colonialism, and Christianity, where herbal medicine was cha llenged as unscientific and from a dark age. There has been a slow amalgamation of conventiona l and traditional herbal medicine, and mainly a looking-down upon of herbal medicines, because modern medicine come s out with a western worldview dominated by laboratory science as the dominant wa y of knowledge production. Traditional medicine is viewed as backward and as such in need of purification, \"cl eansing\", or sanitization in the laboratory for it to be safe. And yet, many generations have been us ing these medicines, in context-specific ways that attest to their effectiveness. It has been shown in some instances that the reductionist laboratory or western view has failed to harness activities observed in some herbal mixtures through purification [132] and needing to identify an active component. Could it be that some herbal mixtures provide a holistic amount of chemicals leading to effectiveness which is lo st when evaluated in isolation? Or, can it be that some active components of herbal medicines are pr esent in insufficient quantities in some plants, requiring some mixtures as part of boosting them? Only more research can tell, but these questions are posed to generate discussion and possible angles for evaluation of both herbal and conventional medicines. Lastly, we beg to ask, why is it that in terms of nutrition, there is a hug e obvious call for people to revert back to traditional foods (mostly unprocessed), yet this seem s to exclude traditional herbal medicines? Pharmacogenomics knowledge evaluation doe s not assume any one of the health systems, conventional or traditional, is superior or inferior, but that, since they are affected by the same enzyme system or they affect the same enzyme system, it is of paramount importance to tease out which combinations should be avoided. We have a different opinion to the general pe rception that traditional African medicine is inferior and that it must only be used after scientif ic tests in the laboratory, as this has implications for those people without access to western or mode rn facilities who rely heavily on traditional herbal medicine. We do, however, accept that traditional herbal medicine is diverse and can benefit from borrowing procedures in conventional drug development to make it optimally usable, safe, and environmentally caring. There is nothing wr ong with establishing regulated pharmacies that dispense traditional medicine. Thus, proper value additi on to African herbal medicines is likely to lead to their acceptance, just as w ith Chinese traditional medicine. It is important to acknowledge th at when one talks about traditi onal and modern medicine, one is referring to knowledge production and its control. Using laboratory-cont rolled research by scientists helps in standardization of procedures and produc tions. Similarly, it is important that traditional practitioners embrace a code of conduct for the use of herbal medicines with an ultimate view of standardizing treatment of patients [132]. Conventional medicine s that have evolved from traditional herbal medicines mostly identify single active ingredie nts, and this at times cr eates an expectation that all herbal medicines could produce identifiable, isolatable, and quant ifiable active components. This Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 651 may not be possible for all herbal medicines as co mpounds could have synergistic and/or complementary functions. It is acknowledged that bo th traditional and conventional medi cine can be used for effective treatment of health conditions, but for a population in health transition where access to conventional medicines is limited, it becomes important to also integrate proven knowledge skills and benefits of herbal medicines into the modern systems of medicine, which can be unlocked through more research, ensuring appropriate quantities, and efficacious and safe treatment. This assists towards the establishment of appropriate guidelines for monitori ng its use and side effect s as done for conventional medicines. The evolution of better-equipped pharmacies for traditional medicines with appropriate manuals for consultation will improve the values and judicious use of traditional medication. 4. Conclusion and Outlook This article examined similarities in the use of allopathic and herb al medicines in African populations undergoing transitions in health, with malaria, HIV, hypertension, TB, and bleeding disorders being used as examples. The review also aime d to stimulate discussion on the co -administration of these medicines with their attendant challenges. Herb al medicines are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potentia l of herb-drug inte ractions which leads to ADRs [39,42]. There is a lack of understanding as to how herbal me dicines affect drug metabolizing enzymes or how drug metabolizing enzymes affect these herbal medicines. We have gone beyond asking the questions \"Which one should be used?\" or \"Which one is better?\" to the current ques tion \"How can we optimally make use of both in a population that has access and is using both systems?\", as it is known that both allopathic and herbal medicines are used concurrently in populations in health-transition. For Africa, with its multiple hea lth challenges, including constraine d access to allopathic medication, the acknowledgement by the WHO in 2008 that herbal traditional medicine may play a more important role, was very relevant. The fact that literature searches yielded few re sults on possible herb-drug interactions highlights the paucity of research in this important area of research (Table 2). There is need for concerted research to understand the similarities in herbal medicine and allopathic medicine for treatment of the same ailments. Genetic differen ces among African populations with respect to genes coding for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics targ ets affect the disposi tion of both allopathic drugs and traditional herbal medicine s. These differences then reflect as variations in response to herbal or allopathic drug treatment for any condition, especially the commonl y-occurring diseases. Medicinal herbal plants contain a lot of compounds in one mi xture that pose a challenge on how they are studied (in the laboratory) with respect to interaction with drug metabolizing enzymes a nd allopathic medicines. There could be a need for standardization in the pr eparation of the herbal me dicinal drugs, reflecting on the different factors that affect safety or efficacy, as mentioned earlier (e.g., pa rts of plant or route of administration and time of harvesting). However, this ma y also be a call for a paradigm shift in terms of how to study such systems. Perhaps a reductionist appr oach is not necessary, but the laboratory approach should be integrated with tradit ional herbal medicine. A focus on pharmacogenomics helps us break the wall imposed between allopathic drugs and traditio nal herbal medicines, thereby focusing on their metabolism instead, and on critical enzymes such as the cytochrome P450 family enzymes (Table 2). This cautions patients, physicians, and traditional medical practitioners on the use of interacting combinations which should be avoided to reduce drug-induced health problems. The effects of Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 652 co-administration of these drugs include possible inhi bitory and inductive effects. Thus, to add value, one needs to conduct studies to understand the modes of interaction of herbal medicines and allopathic drugs, taking into consideration the gene tic variability of th e African population. Table 2. Commonly used herbal plants in Southern and West African count ries that interact with drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). Medicinal Plant Purported Medici nal Value DMEs It is important to note th at although herbal medicine s have been used for centu ries, and that they were found to be of benefit despite some complications , there is the need to understand their role in populations that have access to both systems. It is imperative that a more systematic approach to herbal medicine is taken by health ministries of countries u tilizing herbal medicine in health care so that their use can be monitored, controlled, and studied along th e lines of pharmacovigilance, as in conventional medicine. However, in African populations with a high burden of disease and low income among patients, the monitoring could preven t access to this primary health care resource where access to modern health care treatment is limited. It is therefore im portant that a systematic pharmacovigilance approach is taken to obtain reliable information on the safe ty and usage of herbal medicines [141,142]. Research Pharmaceuticals 2015 , 8 653 can determine safe dosages and manuals can be deve loped to defray costs wh ile providing benefits to health.
