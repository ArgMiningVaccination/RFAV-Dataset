Methods: A web-based survey was conducted among 433 young female adults who have taken at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The prevalence and duration of systemic and generalized symptoms were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The factors associated with symptoms post-vaccination were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed. A P value of  0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: Of the 404 surveys returned (93.3%), 371 respondents have received both vaccine doses. COVISHIELD was the vaccine of choice among 73% of respondents and nearly 91% of the respondents reported a re-infection post-vaccination. At least one form of the symptom as a side effect of vaccination was experienced by 88.4% (n = 357) of the participants. This included generalized symptoms (77.5%) followed by musculoskeletal (53.2%), localized (38.9%), psychological (35.1%), gastrointestinal (25.5%), gynecological (24%), and endocrine symptoms (22.5%). Presence of chronic ailments was significantly associated with experiencing localized symptoms (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.25-3.91), psychological symptoms (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.34-4.34), neurological symptoms (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.38-6.46), gastrointestinal symptoms (OR 4.76, 95% CI 2.59-8.75), respiratory symptoms (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.29-4.67), endocrine symptoms (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.58-5.38), and gynecological symptoms (OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.21-7.44). Older than 21 years was significantly associated with the experience of gynecologic symptoms (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.24-3.64). Not being re-infected post-vaccination has lower odds of experiencing psychological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Our result suggests serious planning and counseling are warranted while disseminating COVID-19 vaccination among young female adults especially those with comorbidities to foster trust and coverage....", "sitename": "LWW", "date": "2023-06-29", "cleaned_text": "Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is termed as one of the biggest public health crisis of recent times which has equally impacted physical, mental, social, and economic planes of people. Various public health measures like social distancing, wearing mask, washing hands, etc., were advocated by health agencies and governments to prevent the spread of this infectious viral disease. Besides this, numerous vaccines were rolled out against COVID-19 under emergency use approval category considering the urgency to combat this pandemic.[ [1]] COVID-19 vaccines are reckoned to trigger similar sequelae as that of an actual COVID-19 infection owing to immunomodulation.[ [2]] A recent systematic review of adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines reported that these vaccines are associated with local symptoms like pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness as well as systemic reactions such as fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache.[ [3]] Besides these, there are brief reports on neurological, respiratory, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular adverse events following COVID-19 vaccinations.[ [4-6]] However, the Government of India's websites on adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) have only reported mild headaches, pain in the injection site, mild fever, and irritability as the adverse event of vaccination against COVID-19.[ [7]] This suggests a deviation from the actual reported adverse events in the studies. A recent study from India reported that awareness regarding reporting of AEFI is very low among all the stakeholders.[ [8]] This may considerably affect vaccine surveillance programs and can lead to more distrust and confusion among the general public. Besides this, the literature suggests that females are more prone to COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse events compared to males.[ [8-11]] A recent review that explored the effects of vaccines in the background of COVID-19 among women deliberated on comprehending women's issues while designing vaccination programs owing to their diverse physical, mental, and social pressure.[ [12]] However, the evidence of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination on women, especially on Indian women is not well documented. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the health status of young female adults residing in a private college in North India. Methods Design and sample selection A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire after obtaining the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee (F.No: 12/SHMCNYS/IEC/2021-22/P51). The participants were young female adults who are pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate programs in medicine, life science, and management in a private college. The forms were distributed to the students through the class coordinators and informed consent was obtained from these participants before participating in the survey. The inclusion criteria were to include young female adults aged between 18 and 50 years who have taken at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and those who did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine were excluded from the study. At the time of the survey, the study setting had 2383 students eligible for participating in the study. The sample size was calculated to be n = 331 for a confidence interval of 95% and a margin of error of 5%. However, considering a non-response rate of 30%, the final sample size required for the study was n = 433. Survey instrument A 38-item online questionnaire was developed by using Google Forms, Google LLC, California, United States of America by the investigators based on a previous study that investigated the non-life-threatening adverse effects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines on healthcare workers.[ [13]] This questionnaire was developed to suit the target audience and the same has been piloted among 30 participants before initiating the survey. Based on the comments from a pilot population, some relevant questions particularly related to female health were added or rephrased. The questionnaire was divided into 6 main categories, 5 questions describing demographic characteristics, 3 about vaccine type, dosage, and duration since vaccination, 1 about chronic disease history, 27 questions about the effects of vaccination, and 2 questions about the participants' perception about the effectiveness of vaccination programs. The questionnaire can be accessed from [supplemental file 1](javascript:void(0)). Statistical analysis The survey link was left open and kept active to collect responses for approximately 4 weeks (April 2022 to June 2022). All the data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 27, (IBM, New York, United States of America). The data was cleaned before analysis. No missing data or inconsistencies were found. To facilitate analysis, the variables were recoded and new variables were computed. The variables under each group of symptoms were combined into a single variable, similarly, the duration of each of the subgroups of symptoms was combined to compute the total duration of the particular symptoms. For example, the musculoskeletal symptoms were captured as \"Muscle pain,\" \"Joints pain,\" and \"Muscle stiffness\" as three different variables. These three variables were combined to form a single binary variable \"Experienced Musculoskeletal symptoms,\" coded as \"Yes\" and \"No.\" Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were applied for analyzing the data. The characteristics of the study participants and the symptoms were analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Mean and 95% confidence interval of mean were computed for the duration of symptoms. Bivariate analysis was conducted employing Chi-squared tests to identify the variables to be included in multivariate analysis. Specifically, the association between participants' characteristics and experience of symptoms post-vaccination was assessed. Only the variables found to be associated with symptoms were included in the multivariate model. Binary logistic regression was used to identify and explain the association between the sample characteristics and experience of symptoms post-vaccination. Given that eight types of symptoms (generalized symptoms, localized symptoms, psychological symptoms, neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, endocrine symptoms, and gynecological symptoms) were studied, eight binary logistic regression models with the experience of specific symptoms as the dependent variable were used. Adjusted odds ratios and a 95% confidence interval for adjusted odds ratios were calculated. Results The questionnaire was circulated among all the students of the study setting, for which we received 404 valid responses. The majority of the study participants were aged between 18 and 21 years and were pursuing undergraduate programs. Covishield/Oxford AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India, Pune, India was the most commonly used vaccine type and nearly 92% of the study population had taken two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Nearly 90% of the participants reported that they had a re-infection post-vaccination. Approximately 38% of the participants strongly felt that getting vaccinated protected them from getting infected. [Table 1](javascript:void(0)) outlines the characteristics of the study sample. Among the participants, 88.4% (n = 357) experienced at least one form of the symptom as a side effect of vaccination. Most of the participants, i.e., 77.5% (n = 313) reported experiencing generalized symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, sweating, etc., lasting for an average of 6 days post-vaccination. This was followed by musculoskeletal symptoms (53.2%), localized symptoms (38.9%), and psychological symptoms (35.1%). Further, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and endocrine-related symptoms were reported 22.5% of participants, respectively [see [Figure 1](javascript:void(0))]. A detailed outline of the post-vaccination side effects experienced by the participants post-vaccination is reported in [supplemental Table 1](javascript:void(0)). Factors associated with symptoms experienced post-vaccination The binary logistic regression analysis reported that the sample characteristics, health history, and vaccination history were significantly associated with the post-vaccination side effects experienced by the participants. It was observed that a history of chronic ailments was significantly associated with experiencing localized symptoms, psychological symptoms, neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, endocrine symptoms, and gynecological symptoms [see [supplemental Table 2](javascript:void(0))]. Age of greater than 21 years was significantly associated with the experience of gynecologic symptoms among females. While earlier studies reported that females experience a greater incidence of symptoms post-COVID vaccination, the relationship between the age of the female and experience of gynecologic symptoms is little explored. Similarly, it was noted that individuals who were not re-infected post-vaccination had lower odds of experiencing psychological symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and respiratory symptoms. This is suggestive that an individual's experience of psychological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms is suggestive of risk for re-infection. Additionally, it was noted that age, number of doses of vaccine, perception of the effectiveness of the vaccine, etc., were not significantly associated with the experience of the majority of symptoms. A detailed outline of the factors associated with symptoms experienced post-vaccination is given in [supplemental Table 2](javascript:void(0)). Discussion The present study aimed at analyzing the impact of vaccination on the health status of young females who were vaccinated at least once by any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines in India. Data on vaccination history, side effects experienced, and perception of the effectiveness of vaccines were captured. The results of this study exclusively covering the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on young female adults has larger practical implications in designing vaccination programs for COVID-19 in the light of evidence that suggests women react differently to vaccines compared to men.[ [12]] Acceptance of vaccine among young female adults COVISHIELD was the most commonly used vaccine by the majority of the participants and 92% of the participants completed the two mandatory doses of the vaccination. This shows increased acceptance/adherence to vaccine programs among the younger population of society. The results are in agreement with an earlier study that reported a positive trend of vaccine acceptance among Indian college students.[ [14]] Another encouraging trend was observed as close to 68% of participants reported that vaccination did not interfere with their day-to-day activities. We observed precariousness in the opinion of the participants regarding the effectiveness of vaccination. Nearly 42% of study participants were not sure if vaccination against COVID-19 will protect them from getting infected, whereas 38% of the cohort was convinced that they will be protected by getting vaccinated. Similarly, 50% of the population opined that they are sure that the vaccine may prevent further infections whereas the rest of the cohort was either doubtful or disagreed with this view. Re-infection post-COVID-19 vaccination Interestingly, 90% of the cohort reported that they have been re-infected with COVID-19 even after the vaccination. This fact may be considered with utmost importance, as this may negatively impact the confidence levels or intent of the people towards COVID-19 vaccination. The present study reiterates the findings of earlier studies which reported a significantly higher incidence of vaccine breakthrough infections in females compared to males.[ [15-17]] This points towards the need for studies in this direction. Generalized side effects post-COVID-19 vaccination There have been reports on systemic and local side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.[ [18-20]] Factors like complete vaccination status, the brand of vaccines, age group, female gender, and previous history of COVID-19 infection are associated with the adverse events of the COVID-19 vaccine.[ [20]] Most of the studies acknowledge the prevalence of adverse effects following vaccination, meanwhile, they also report that these side effects are not serious in nature.[ [19], [20]] In the present study, nearly 89% of our participants experienced at least one side effect post-vaccination. However, these symptoms/adverse effects lasted only for 2-8 days. Generalized symptoms like weakness, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, sweating, dizziness, and flushes were predominantly seen in the majority of the participants. This is identical to the previous studies which reported fatigue, pain, headache, fever, etc., as the most common symptoms post-COVID-19 vaccination.[ [10], [21]] Systemic side effects post-COVID-19 vaccination Besides these, we have observed an array of symptoms reported by the study participants ranging from swelling of the arm to seizures. Few of our participants reported having changes in blood pressure (n = 20), chest pain (n = 18), syncope (n = 7), exacerbation of asthma (n = 6), decrease in memory (n = 37), mood swings (n = 29), amenorrhea (n = 36), and menorrhagia (n = 27). Earlier studies have also reported a rise in menstrual abnormalities to post-COVID-19 vaccination,[ [22-24]] whose long-term impact is yet to be identified. Similarly, reports suggest a possibility of asthma exacerbation post-COVID-19 vaccination.[ [25], [26]] Mental health post-COVID-19 vaccination Beside the somatic symptoms, nearly 35% of the study population exerted psychological symptoms related to poor sleep quality, anxiety, depression, maniac behaviors, and stress. A recent rapid review reports an incidence of altered mental states, psychosis, mania, depression, and functional neurological disorder as an adverse event of COVID-19 vaccinations.[ [2]] Our study corroborates the prevalence of psychiatric conditions as an adverse event to COVID-19 vaccinations which warrants further attention. Factors influencing the incidence of side effects post-COVID-19 vaccination History of chronic ailments was found to be a significant predictor for the experience of symptoms post-vaccination. Earlier studies on vaccine candidates reported that the COVID-19 risk-reduction post-vaccination was lower among those with one or more comorbidities, compared to those without them.[ [18]] The finding warrants that individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions should be kept under observation for an extended period of time to monitor for any adverse effects. Moreover, studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance from low and middle-income countries report that vaccine acceptance is poorer among individuals with chronic diseases due to fear of side effects.[ [27]] Side effects were found to create significant hindrances in daily activities. The findings can be inferred that the odds of hindrance faced in day-to-day activities are highest for generalized symptoms, followed by gynecological symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, it can be noted that the experience of side effects is slightly higher for Covishield [see [Figure 2](javascript:void(0))] with respect to generalized, localized, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and psychological symptoms, while gynecological symptoms for both vaccines remained at 24%. The hindrances in daily activities can demotivate individuals from taking a vaccine or postpone their intention to take the vaccine which may increase one's susceptibility to the COVID-19 infection. Reporting AEFIA matter of concern Chakraborty et al.[ [8]] on their recent study compared between Covishield (Serum Institute of India Private Limited, Pune, India) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech Limited, Hyderabad, India) and found a significant increase in the adverse event following Covishield. However, they also reported that nearly 76% of their study population did not report their adverse reactions to their treating doctors or concerned personnel. This foregrounds poor awareness about mild AEFIs reporting among Indian adults. This study is limited by the lack of information on whether the AEFIs reported by our study participants were reported to the concerned authorities or not. Nevertheless, this is one of the major factors responsible for the appropriate documentation of AEFIs. As on June 2022, the World Health Organization has reported an 18% increase in COVID-19 cases globally.[ [28]] This necessitates the need for continuous functioning of preventive strategies including vaccination. However, the polarizing attitude of the general public towards vaccination is reported to be a matter of concern. The hesitancy to vaccinate against COVID-19 among Indians was reported to be 60% by a recent survey, among which a substantial number of the surveyed population were health workers.[ [29]] This points out at development of substantial strategies that can foster public trust in this critical public health intervention, among which researching/publishing of adverse events associated with vaccines remains on the top priority. Strengths and limitations One of the strengths of this study is that it represents a comprehensive examination of the impact of vaccination on all body systems and the associated predisposing factors. Further, to our knowledge, this is the first study to report a gender-specific impact of COVID-19 vaccination, especially on young female adults. One of the major limitations of the present study is its cross-sectional nature and inclusion of the samples from a single city. Given that the symptoms post-vaccination were self-reported, there is a potential for recall bias for the symptoms deemed to be not so serious by the participants. Implications of the present study Even though the adverse events reported in our study cohort were not life-threatening, this needs serious consideration while planning for future vaccine programs. Further, it warrants for nationwide study to identify the possible adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, especially in females who are reported to be more vulnerable to have adverse events of COVID-19 vaccination.[ [10], [20]] Further, it hints at the stratified distribution of vaccines after assessing the comorbid conditions of the individual participants seeking vaccination. Conclusion The present findings indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine is associated with significant but non-life-threatening generalized and systemic side effects among young female adults. The presence of a chronic condition heightens the chances of having an adverse event. Our findings are in confirmation with literature suggesting women are at significant risk of developing adverse effects against COVID-19 vaccination. While our study indicates a strong association of vaccination with generalized and systemic side effects among women, it can be argued that there is a need for follow-up studies, systemic reviews, and meta-analysis to establish causal associations and generalizable prevalence estimates for post-vaccine side effects among females. Further, by understanding the nature of side effects, one should expect that while undertaking COVID-19 vaccination, it will instill greater confidence in the mind of the common public, which may enhance the acceptability of the vaccine. Nevertheless, this may also help in preventing misleading information from being spread by anti-vaccine groups and heighten the credibility of vaccine programs.
