Scripps Health Plan v6 11 Effective January 1, 2016 3. HOW TO USE THE PLAN Choice of Physicians and Providers PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SO YOU WILL KNOW FROM WHOM OR WHAT GROUP OF PROVIDERS HEALTH CARE MAY BE OBTAINED. A close physician -to-patient relationship helps to ensure the best medical care. Each Member is required to select a Primary Care Physician (PCP) at the time of enrollment. To ensure access to services, each Member must select a PCP who is located suffi ciently close to the Member's home or work address to ensure reasonable access to care, as determined by Scripps Health Plan Services (the Plan) . If you do not select a PCP at the time of enrollment, the Plan will designate a PCP for you, and you will be notified of the name of the designated PCP. This designation will remain in effect until you notify the Plan of your selection of a different PCP. A PCP must also be selected for a newborn or child placed for adoption, prefera bly prior to birth or adoption, but always within 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption. You may designate a pediatrician as the PCP for your child. The PCP selected for the month of birth must be in the same medical group or IPA as the mother's PCP when the new born is the natural child of the mother. If the mother of the newborn is not enrolled as a Member or if the child has been placed with the subscriber for adoption, the PCP selected must be a physician in the same medical group or IPA as the subscriber. If you do not select a PCP within 31 days following the birth or placement for adoption, the Plan will designate a PCP from the same medical group or IPA as the natural mother or the subscriber. This designation will remain in effect for the first calendar month during which the birth or placement for adop tion occurred. If you want to change the PCP for the child after the month of birth or placement for adoption, see the section below on Changing PCP or Designated Medical Group or IPA. If your child is ill during the first month of coverage, be sure to read the information about changing PCP during a course of treatment or hospitalization. Remember that if you want your child covered beyond 31 days from the date of birth or placement for adoption, you should contact Scripps HR Service Center at 1-858-678-MyHR (6947) to add your child to your coverage. Role of the Medical Group or IPA Most Scripps Health Plan PCPs contract with medical groups or IPAs to share administrative and authorization responsi bilities with them. Your PCP coordinates with your desig nated medical group or IPA to direct all of your medical care needs and refer you to specialists or hospitals within your designated medical group or IPA unless , because of your health condition, care is unavailable within the medical group or IPA. Scripps Health Plan v6 12 Effective January 1, 2016 Your designat ed medical group /IPA or Scripps Health Plan ensures that a full panel of specialists is available to provide your health care needs and helps your PCP manage the utilization of your health plan benefits by ensuring that refer rals are directed to providers who are contracted with them. Medical groups or IPAs also have admitting arrangements with hospitals contract ed with Scripps Health Plan in their area and some have special arrangements that designate a specific hospital as \"in -network.\" Your designated medi cal group or IPA works with your P CP to authorize services and ensure that service s are performed by their in -network provid er. The name of your PCP and your designated medical group or IPA is listed on your Scripps Health Plan member identification ca rd. The Scripps Health Plan Customer Service Department can answer any questions you may have about changing the medical group or IPA designated for your P CP and whether the change would affect your ability to receive services from a particular specialist or hospital. Changing PCPs or Designated Medical Group or IPA You or your dependent may change PCPs or designated medical group or IPA by access the Scripps Benefits Enrollment System at www .Scripps.org/HRB enefits. Each covered member may designate a different PCP and you may chan ge your PCP the first of any month, provided you make the e lection in the Scripps Benefits Enrollment System prior to the 14th of the preceding month. You can also find a PCP by visiting www.myScrippsHealthPlan.com and selecting Provider Lookup. If you change to a medical group or IPA with no affiliation to your PCP, you must select a new PCP affili ated with the new medical group or IPA and transition any specialty care you are receiving to specialists affiliated with the new medical group or IPA. The change will be effective the first day of the month following notice of approval by Scripps Health Plan . Once your PCP change is effective, all care must be provided or arranged by the new PCP, except for OB/GYN services provided by an obstetri cian/gynecologist or a family practice physician within the same medical group or IPA as your PCP. Once your medical group or IPA change is effective, all previous authorizations for specialty care or procedures are no longer valid and must be transitioned to specialists affiliated with the new medical group or IPA, even if you remain with the same PCP. Customer Service will assist you with the timing and choice of a new PCP or medical group or IPA. Voluntary medical group or IPA changes are not permitted during the third trimester of pregnan cy or while confined to a hospital. The effective date of your new medical group or IPA will be the first of the month following discharge from the hospital, or when pregnant, following the completion of post -partum care. Additionally, changing your PCP or designated medical group or IPA during a course of treatment may interrupt the quality and continuity of your health care. For this reason, the effective date of your new PCP or designated medical group or IPA, when requested Scripps Health Plan v6 13 Effective January 1, 2016 during a course of treatment, will be the first of the month following the date it is medically appropriate to transfer your care to your new PCP or designated medical group or IPA, as determined by the Plan. Exceptions must be approved by the Scripps Health Plan Medical Director. For information about approval for an exception to the above provision, please contact Customer Service . If your PCP discontinues partici pation in the Plan, Scripps Health Plan will notify you in writing and designate a new PCP for you in case you need immediate medical care. You will also be given the opportunity to select a new PCP of your own choice within 15 days of this notification. Your selection must be approved by Scripps Health Plan prior to receiving any services under the Plan. In the event that your selection has not been approved and an emergency arises, see I. Emergency Services in the \"Benefit Descriptions \" section for in- formation . IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ENROLL IN THE SCRIPPS HEALTH PLAN , SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE PLAN'S DELIVERY SYSTEM, BUT THE CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF ANY ONE DOCTOR, HOSPITAL OR OTHER PROVIDER CAN NOT BE GUARANTEED. Continuity of Care by a Terminated or Non -Participating Provider Members who are being treated for acute condi tions, serious chronic conditions, pregnancies (including immediate postpartum care), or terminal illness; or who are children from birth to 36 months of age; or who have received author ization from a now -terminated or non - participating provider for surgery or another procedure as part of a documented course of treatment can request completion of care in certain situations with a provider who is leaving the Scripps Health Plan provider network. Contact Customer Service at 844-337-3700 to receive information regarding eligibility criteria and the policy and procedure for requesting continuity of care from a terminated or non -participating provider. You may also access a Transition of Care (TOC) form on our website at www.ScrippsHealthPlan.com . Relations hip with Your PCP and other Physicians If the relationship between you and a Plan physician is unsatisfactory, then you may submit the matter to the Plan and request a change of Plan physician. How to Receive Care At the time of enrollment, you will choose a PCP who will coordinate all covered services. You must contact your PCP for all health care needs, including preventive services, routine health problems, consultations with Plan specialists (except as provided under Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services , and Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services), admission into a hospice program through a participating hospice agency, emer gency services, urgent services and for hospitali zation. The PCP is responsible for Scripps Health Plan v6 14 Effective January 1, 2016 providing primary care and coordinating or arranging for referral to other necessary health care services and requesting any needed prior authorization. You should cancel any scheduled appointments at least 24 hours in advance. This policy applies to appointments with or arranged by your PCP or the Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) or for OB/GYN services. Because your physi cian has set aside time for your appointments in a busy schedule, you need to notify the office within 24 hours if you are unable to keep the appointment. That will allow the office staff to offer that time slot to another patient who needs to see the physician. If you have not selected a PCP for any reason, please contact Customer Service at 844-337-3700 , Monday through Friday, between 8:00a.m. and 5 : 0 0 p.m. to select a PCP. Obstetrical/Gynecological (OB/GYN) Physician Services A female Member may arrange for obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/GYN) services by an obstetrician/gynecologist or a family practice physician who is not her designated PCP. A referral from your PCP or from the affiliated medical group or IPA is not needed. However, the obstetri cian/gynecologist or family practice physician must be in the same medical group or IPA as her Personal Physician. Obstetrical and gynecological services are defined as: Physician services related to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal (pregnancy) care, Physician services provided to diagnose and treat disorders of the female repro ductive system and genitalia, Physician services for treatment of disorders of the breast, Routine annual gynecological examina tions/annual well-woman examinations. It is important to note that services by an obste trician/gynecologist or a family practice physi cian outside of the PCP's medical group or IPA without authorization will not be covered under this Plan. Before making the appointment, the Member should call the Customer Service Department at 844 -337 -3700 to confirm that the obstetrician/gynecologist or family practice physician is in the same medical group or IPA as her Personal Physician. Referral to Specialty Services and Second Medical Opinions You can receive specialty services through a referral from your PCP. Your PCP is responsible for coordinating all of your health care needs and can best direct you for required specialty services. Your PCP will generally refer you to a Plan specialist or Plan non-physician health care practitioner in the same medical group or IPA as your PCP, but you can be referred outside the medical group or IPA if the type of specialist or non-physician health care practitioner you need is not available within your PCP's medical group or IPA. Your PCP will Scripps Health Plan v6 15 Effective January 1, 2016 request any necessary prior authorization from your medical group , IPA or the Plan . For mental health and substance abuse services, see the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services paragraphs in the \"How to Use the Plan \" section for information regarding how to access care. The Plan specialist or Plan non-physician health care practitioner will provide a complete report to your PCP so that your medical record is complete. If there is a question about your diagnosis, plan of care, or recommended treatment, including surgery, or if additional information concerning your condition would be helpful in determining the diagnosis and the most appropriate plan of treatment, or if the current treatment plan is not improving your medical condition, you may ask your PCP to refer you to another physician for a second medical opinion. The second opinion will be provided on an expedited basis, where appropriate. If you are requesting a second opinion about care you received from your PCP, the second opinion will be provided by a physician within the same medical group or IPA as your PCP. If you are requesting a second opinion about care received from a specialist, the second opinion may be provided by any Plan specialist of the same or equivalent specialty. All second opinion consultations must be pre-authorized. Your PCP may also decide to offer such a referral even if you do not request it. State law requires that health plans disclose to Members, upon request, the timelines for responding to a request for a second medical opinion. To request a copy of these timelines, you may call the Customer Service Department at 844-337 -3700 . To obtain referral for specialty services, includ ing lab and x-ray, you must first contact your PCP. If your PCP determines that specialty services are medically necessary, the physician will complete a referral form and request necessary authorization. Your PCP will designate the Plan prov ider from whom you will receive services. When no Plan provider is available to perform the needed service, the PCP will refer you to a non-Plan provider after obtaining authorization. This authorization procedure is handled for you by your PCP. After Hours Your primary care physician or a designated covering physician will be available to you by telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week . When you need care after hours, on weekends or on holidays, always try to call your doctor first . He or she will be able to direct you to the most appropriate place for treatment. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Scripps Health Plan has contracted with a Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) to underwrite and deliver all mental heal th and substance abuse services through a unique network of mental health Participating Providers. (See Mental Health Service Administrator under the Definitions section for more information.) All non -emergency mental health and substance abuse services mu st be arranged through the MHSA. Members do not need to Scripps Health Plan v6 16 Effective January 1, 2016 arrange for mental health and substance abuse services through their P CP. (See 1. Prior Authorization paragraphs below.) All mental health and substance abuse services, except for emergency or urgent services, must be provided by a MHSA Participating Provider. A list of MHSA Participating Providers is available in the online Scripps Health Plan Provider Directory. Members may also contact the MHSA directly for information and to select a MHSA Particip ating Provider by calling 800- 866-6534 . Your P CP may also contact the MHSA to obtain information regarding MHSA Participating Providers for you. Non -emergency mental health and substance abuse services received from a provider who does not participate in the MHSA Participating Provider network will not be covered, except as stated herein, and all charges for these services will be the Member's responsibility. This limitation does not apply with respect to emergency services. In addition, when no MHSA Parti cipating Provider is available to perform the needed service, the MHSA will refer you to a non -Plan provider and authorize services to be received. For complete information regarding benefits for mental health and s ubstance abuse services, see Inpatient Me ntal Health and Substance Abuse Services and Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services in the Benefit Descriptions section. 1. Prior Authorization Prior authorization is required for all nonemergency Mental Health Hospital admissions including acute inpatient care and Residential Care. The provider should call Mental Health Service Administrator (MHSA) at 800-866-6534 at least five business days prior to the admission. Non -Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services, including, but not limited to, Behavioral Health Treatment, Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP), Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Psychological Testing and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) must also b e prior authorized by the MHSA. The MHSA will render a decision on all requests for prior authorization of services as follows: for urgent services, as soon as possible to accommodate the Member's condition not to exceed 72 hours from receipt of the request; for other services, within 5 business days from receipt of the request. The treating provider will be notified of the decision within 24 hours followed by written notice to the provider and M ember within 2 business days of the decision. If prior authorization is not obtained for a mental health inpatient admission or for any Non -Routine Outpatient Mental Health Services and the services provided to the member are determined not to be a Benefit of the plan, cov erage will be denied. Prior authorization is not required for an emergency admission. Scripps Health Plan v6 17 Effective January 1, 2016 2. Psychosocial Support Notwithstanding the benefits provided under Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, the Member also may call 1800-866-6534 on a 24 -hour basis for confidential psychosocial support services. Professional counselors will provide support through assess ment, referrals and counseling. Emergency Services What is an Emergency? An emergency means an unexpected medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably assume that the absence of immediate medical attention could be e xpected to result in any of the following: (1) placing the Member's health in serious jeopardy, (2) serious impairment to bodily functions, (3) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. If you receive non -authorized services in a situation that Scripps Health Plan determines was not a situation in which a reasonable person would believe that an emergency condition existed, you will be responsible for the costs of those services. Members who reasonably believe that they have an emergency medical or me ntal health condition which requires an emergency response are encouraged to appropriately use the \"911\" emergency response system where available. What to do in case of Emergency? Life Threatening : Obtain care immediately. Contact your P CP no later than 2 4 hours after the onset of the emergency, or as soon as it is medically possible fo r the Member to provide notice. Non -Life Threatening : Consult your Personal Physician, anytime day or night, regardless of where you are p rior to receiving medical care. Follow-Up Care : Follow -up care, which is any care provided after the initial emergency room visit, must be provided or authorized by your P CP. For a complete description of the Emergency Services benefit and applicable copayments, see Emergency Services in the Benefit Descriptions section. Urgent Services If you require urgent care for a condition that could reasonably be treated in your P CP's office or in an urgent care clinic (i.e., care for a condition that is not such that the absence of immediate medi cal attention could reasonably be expected to result in placing your health in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part), you must first call your P CP. However, you may go directly to an urgent care clinic when your assigned medical group or IPA has provided you with instructions for obtaining care from an urgent care clinic in your P CP's service area. Urgent Care services out of area are covered only if a prior authorization is obtained . Scripps Health Plan v6 18 Effective January 1, 2016 Urgent Care Clinic Copayment: $4 0 Inpatient, Home Health Care, and Other Services Your PCP is responsible for obtaining prior authorization before you can be admitted to the hospital or a skilled nursing facility, including sub -acute care admissions, except for mental health and substance abuse services which are described in the previous Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services section. Your PCP is responsible for obtaining prior authorization before you can receive home healt h care and certain other services or before you can be admitted into a hospice program through a participating hospice agency. If your PCP determines that you should receive any of these services, he or she will request authorization. Your P CP will arran ge for your admission to the hospital, skilled nursing facility, or a hospice program through a participating hospice agency, as well as for the provision of home health care and other services. For hospital admissions for mastectomies or lymph node disse ctions, the length of hospital stays will be determined solely by the Member's physician in consultation with the Member. For information regarding length of stay for maternity or mat ernity -related services, see Pregnancy and Maternity Care, for informati on relative to the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act.

PAYMENT BY THIRD PARTIES Third Party Recovery Process and the Member's Responsibility If a Member is injured or becomes ill due to the act or omission of another person (a \"third party\"), Scripps Health Plan , the Member's designated medical group, or th e IPA shall, with respect to services required as a result of that injury, provide the benefits of the Plan and have an equitable right to restitution, reimbursement or other available remedy to recover the amounts Scripps Health Plan paid for services pro vided to the Member from any recovery Scripps Health Plan v6 81 Effective January 1, 2016 (defined below) obtained by or on behalf of the Member, from or on behalf of the third party responsible for the injury or illness or from uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. This right to restitution, reimburs ement or other available remedy is against any recovery the Member receives as a result of the injury or illness, including any amount awarded to or received by way of court judgment, arbitration award, settlement or any other arrangement, from any third p arty or third party insurer, or from uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, related to the illness or injury (the \"recovery\"), without regard to whether the Member has been \"made whole\" by the recovery. The right to restitution, reimbursement or ot her available remedy is with respect to that portion of the total recovery that is due for the benefits paid in connection with such injury or illness, calculated in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3040. The Member is required to: 1. Notify Scripps Health Plan , the Member's designated medical group, or the IPA in writing of any actual or potential claim or legal action which such Member expects to bring or has brought against the third party arising from the alleged acts or omissions causing the injury or illness, not later than 30 days after submitting or filing a claim or legal action against the third party; and 2. Agree to fully cooperate and execute any forms or documents needed to enforce this right to restitution, reimbursement or o ther a vailable remedies; and 3. Agree in writing to reimburse Scripps Health Plan for benefits paid by Scripps Health Plan from any recovery when the recovery is obtained from or on behalf of the third party or the insurer of the third party, or from uninsured or underin sured motorist coverage; and 4. Provide a lien calculated in accordance with California Civil Code section 3040. The lien may be filed with the third party, the third party's agent or attorney, or the court unless othe rwise prohibited by law; and 5. Periodically respond to information requests regarding the claim against the third party, and notify Scripps Health Plan and the Member's designated medical group or IPA, in writing, within 10 days after any recovery has been obtained. A Me mber's failure to comply with 1 through 5 above shall not in any way act as a waiver, release, or relinquishment of the rights of Scripps Health Plan , the Member's designated medical group, or the IPA. Further, if the Member receives services from a Plan hospital for such injuries or illness, the hospital has the right to collect from the Member the difference between the amount paid by Scripps Health Plan and the hospital's reasonable and necessary charges for such services when payment or reimbursement is received by the Member for Scripps Health Plan v6 82 Effective January 1, 2016 medical expenses. The hospital's right to collect shall be in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3045.1. Workers' Compensation No benefits are provided for or incident to any injury or disease arising out of, or in the course of, any employment for salary, wage or profit if such injury or disease is covered by any workers' compensation law, occupational disease law or similar legislation. However, if Scripps Health Plan provides payment for such services it will be entitled to esta blish a lien upon such other benefits up to the reasonable cash value of benefits provided by Scripps Health Plan for the treatment of the injury or disease as reflected by the providers' usual billed charges. Coordination of Benefits When a person who is covered under this group Plan is also covered under another group plan, or selected group, or blanket disability insurance contract, or any other contractual arrangement or any portion of any such arrangement whereby the members of a group are entitled to payment of or reimbursement for hospital or medical expenses, such person will not be permitted to make a \"profit\" on a disability by collecting benefits in excess of actual value or cost during any calendar year. Instead, payments will be coordinate d between the plans in order to provide for \"allowable expenses\" (these are the expenses that are incurred for services and supplies covered under at least one of the plans involved) up to the maximum benefit value or amount payable by each plan separately . If the covered person is also entitled to benefits under any of the conditions as outlined under the Limitations for Duplicate Coverage provision, benefits received under any such condition will not be coordinated with the benefits of this Plan. The fo llowing rules determine the order of benefit payments: When the other plan does not have a coordination of benefits provision, it will always provide its benefits first. Otherwise, the plan covering the patient as an employee will provide its benefits befo re the plan covering the patient as a dependent. Except for cases of claims for a dependent child whose parents are separated or divorced, the plan which covers the dependent child of a person whose date of birth (excluding year of birth) occurs earlier in a calendar year, shall determine its benefits before a plan which covers the dependent child of a person whose date of birth (excluding year of birth) occurs later in a calendar year. If either plan does not have the provisions of this paragraph regard ing dependents, which results either in each plan determining its benefits before the other or in each plan determining its benefits after the other, the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply, and the rule set forth in the plan which does not have t he provisions of this paragraph shall dete rmine the order of benefits. Scripps Health Plan v6 83 Effective January 1, 2016 1. In the case of a claim involving expenses for a dependent child whose parents are separated or divorced, plans covering the child as a dependent shall determine their respective benefits in the following order: First, the plan of the parent with custody of the child; then, if that parent has remarried, the plan of the stepparent with custody of the child; and finally the plan(s) of the parent(s) without custody of the child. 2. Notwithstanding 1 above, if there is a court decree which otherwise establishes fin ancial responsibility for the medical, dental or other health care expenses of the child, then the plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with that financial responsibility shall determine its benefits before any other plan which covers t he child as a dependent child. 3. If the above rules do not apply, the plan which has covered the patient for the longer period of time shall determine its be nefits first, provided that: a. A plan covering a patient as a laid -off or retired employee, or as a dependent of such an employee, shall determine its benefits after any other plan covering that person as an employee, other than a laid -off or retired emplo yee, or such dependent; and, b. If either plan does not have a provision regarding laid -off or retired employees, which results in each plan determining its benefits after the other, then the provisions of a. above shall not apply. If this Plan is the primary carrier with respect to a covered person, then this Plan will provide its benefits without reduc tion because of benefits available from any other plan. When this Plan is secondary in the order of payments, and Scripps Health Plan is notified that there is a dispute as to which plan is primary, or that the primary plan has not paid within a reasonab le period of time, this Plan will provide the benefits that would be due as if it were the primary plan, provided that the covered person: (1) assigns to Scripps Health Plan the right to receive benefits from the other plan to the extent of the difference between the value of the benefits which Scripps Health Plan actually provides and the value of the benefits that Scripps Health Plan would have been obligated to provide as the secondary plan, (2) agrees to cooperate fully with Scripps Health Plan in obtai ning payment of benefits from the other plan, and (3) allows Scripps Health Plan to obtain confirmation from the other plan that the benefits which are claimed have not previously been paid. If payments which should have been made under this Plan in acc ordance with these provisions have been made by another Plan, Scripps Health Plan may pay to the other Plan the amount necessary to satisfy the intent of these provisions. This amount shall be considered as benefits Scripps Health Plan v6 84 Effective January 1, 2016 paid under this Plan. Scripps Health Pla n shall be fully discharged from liability under this Plan to the extent of these payments. If payments have been made by Scripps Health Plan in excess of the maximum amount of payment necessary to satisfy these provisions, Scripps Health Plan shall hav e the right to recover the excess from any person or other entity to or with respect to whom such payments were made. Scripps Health Plan may release to or obtain from any organization or person any information which Scripps Health Plan considers necess ary for the purpose of determining the applicability of and implementing the terms of these provisions or any provisions of similar purpose of any other Plan. Any person claiming benefits under this Plan shall furnish Scripps Health Plan with such informat ion as may be necessary to implement these provisions. 10. DEFINITIONS 1.
