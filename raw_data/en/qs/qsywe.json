They travel to the nucleus and insert their code into our DNA. They order the cell to make more viruses and then self-destruct, spreading the infection. Because they propagate inside the host's cell they are hard to treat without damaging the cell. Dr. David Brownstein, M.D.'s new book A Holistic Approach to Viruses documents his clinic's approach to preventing and treating viral illness. This very readable book covers the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system in an easy-to- understand way. For over 20 years the author and his partners have used a wholistic approach with great success. They focus on Vitamins A, C, D and the mineral Iodine. In addition, they use Hydrogen peroxide and Ozone as adjunct to their treatment. Dealing with viruses involves both reducing their infectiveness and limiting the host's inflammatory response. Vitamin A affects both of these components. It is essential for both Innate and Adaptive immune function. It is necessary for normal function of the linings of airways and GI tract. Low Vitamin A can make it easier for viruses to penetrate the oral and nasal mucosa. Vitamin A is helpful in many inflammatory conditions of the lungs, skin, and GI tract. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to increased mortality during times of infection. The water- soluble form of Vitamin A is called Beta Carotene and it needs to be converted in the liver to the active, fat-soluble form. This process is only 5-10% efficient so it is best to get it in the fat- soluble form from food or supplementation. Dr. Brownstein recommends high-dose Vitamin A for a four-day period at the beginning of an infection. Vitamin A toxicity is possible with long- term supplementation so it is best to work with nutritionally-literate doctor who can test and adjust dosing. Vitamin C is a well-known immune enhancer. Unlike most animals, humans cannot produce Vitamin C, therefor we must get it in our diet. It is found in many fruits and vegetables. Depending on the dose it can function as either an anti-oxidant or pro-oxidant. Lower doses allow Vitamin C to prevent oxidative damage. Higher doses allow the immune system to use its oxidative effect to produce hydrogen peroxide to destroy bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi. Vitamin C also has an anti-clotting effect which can be useful in viruses that produce clots and bleeding. Dr. Brownstein uses Vitamin C intravenously when the infection is severe. He also recommends oral doses in the range of 3-5000mg/day and when ill up to 1000mg/hour. If diarrhea occurs the dosage can be reduced. Liposomal Vitamin C has been shown to produce blood levels that approach those attained by IV. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in North America due to seasonal low levels of sun exposure and the use of sunscreens and general sun avoidance. Vitamin D also works on both the infectiveness and inflammatory components of viral infection. It helps the white blood cells identify and remove viruses and damaged cells. It also reduces inflammation as documented by lowering inflammation markers C-Reactive protein and IL-6 . Dr. Brownstein uses a short-term dosing of 50,000 units per day for the first 4 days of an infection. It is recommended to have your blood levels checked regularly and to keep it in the upper end of the normal range. Dr. Brownstein's also recommends Iodine for viruses using it successfully for decades addressing a variety of conditions as documented in his book Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can't Live Without It. This little-used mineral is very important to a normally functioning immune system. Iodine is required for normal white blood cell function. It has potent anti- microbial properties and is even used in the sanitizer used prior to surgery. In his book Dr. Brownstein describes other anti-viral approaches including nebulized hydrogen peroxide and ozone therapy. His book is recommended for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of how to deal with viral infections from a holistic perspective. 3 Comments How to Deal With Viruses Holistically Viruses are tiny bits of DNA that inject themselves into our cells.
