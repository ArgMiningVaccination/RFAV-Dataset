When consumed, this blending expands the heart center, gently heals, invites creativity, and peace. Ceremonial Cacao has been used for thousands of years by the Mayans, Aztecs, and Shamans around the world for its Spiritual and medicinal benefits. Its plant medicine is a beautiful and gentle teacher, that guides us to open our heart for healing and transformation, thus enabling us to journey through time to our true self. We invite you to take this time for you. Connecting with the gentle Spirit of Cacao is a beautiful opportunity to release what is no longer serving you and welcome in all of the creative, loving, and expansive energy that is available to each of us! The ceremonial cacao that Lisa uses for the session is ethically sourced from a small farm in Peru and aids in supporting their community.

Sharing this beautiful healing and spiritual modality with others is always such an honor and joy for her.

Benefits of Cacao: Cacao enables us to deepen our spiritual awareness, enhances the meditation experience, and connects us to more vivid dreams. The spirit of this plant medicine aids in healing and transformational experiences, as well as connecting more deeply to the land, Mother Earth, Pachamama, and the ancient teachings of our ancestors. This truly is a heart chakra opening experience. When sitting with the spirit of cacao, she gently guides you into the deepest parts of your soul, assisting in releasing blocks, finding forgiveness, allowing you to tap into your higher self, expand your true essence, self-love, and compassion.
