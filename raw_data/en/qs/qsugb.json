The term \"staff\" or \"staff person\" does not include any person who is present at the facility for only a short period of time and whose moments of close physical proximity to others on-site are fleeting (e.g., contractors making deliveries to a site where they remain physically distanced from others or briefly entering a site to pick up a shipment). 2) \"COVID-19 vaccine\" means a vaccine for COVID-19 that has been authorized for emergency use, licensed, or otherwise approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 3) An individual is \"up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations\" when they have received all CDC-recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including any booster dose(s) when eligible. b) Each facility shall recommend all staff be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations and be tested in a manner consistent with CDC recommendations and the requirements of Section [390.760](/regulations/illinois/Ill-Admin-Code-tit-77-SS-390.760). 1) Each facility shall make available opportunities for staff to be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations, either directly at the facility or indirectly, such as through an arrangement with a pharmacy partner, local health department, or other appropriate health entity. 2) Facilities may adopt more stringent policies requiring all staff to be vaccinated. Nothing in the Section supersedes or modifies the date such policies are designated by the facility to take effect. 3) Facilities certified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMMS) must maintain compliance with all applicable CMMS regulations and guidance including but not limited to requirements in 42 CFR [483.80](/cfr/text/42/483.80). c) Each facility shall ensure that all individuals who administer the COVID-19 vaccines on site for staff pursuant to this Section are qualified and trained to administer the vaccine in accordance with all applicable federal and State laws and rules. d) Each facility shall post conspicuous signage throughout the facility notifying staff that the facility makes available opportunities for staff to be up to date on COVID-19 vaccinations.

Records of training shall be made available to the Department upon request. Examples of Department-approved training and educational resources include those offered for health care professionals by the: 1) CDC, available at [https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/covid19/](https://www2.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/covid19/)and [https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/projectfirstline/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/projectfirstline/index.html); and 2) Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), available at [https://www.immunize.org/covid-19/](https://www.immunize.org/covid-19/). f) Each facility shall maintain a record of staff COVID-19 vaccination status and test results in each staff persona's confidential medical file. Facilities that are not required to report COVID-19 aggregate vaccination and testing data into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) shall report this data to the Department weekly utilizing the online form available at [https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/ltc-vaccination-testing-reporting.html](https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/ltc-vaccination-testing-reporting.html). g) Nothing in this emergency amendment prohibits any facility from implementing vaccination or testing requirements for staff, residents, and visitors that exceed the requirements of this Section. Notes State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a comparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.

No testing is required for facilities in counties where community transmission levels are low.
