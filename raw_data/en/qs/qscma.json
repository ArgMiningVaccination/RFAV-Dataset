The primary focus of the I.V Vitamin Therapy Clinic is on the use of high-dose Intravenous Vitamin C (IVC) to treat a wide variety of conditions. Our approach provides help and hopes to individuals struggling with a long-term illness while focusing on getting and staying healthy rather than only addressing symptoms. Many conditions may benefit from IVC therapy. Some of those are arthritis, Lyme disease, bacterial infections, viral infections, pain after injury, and more. There is a great deal of medical research to support the use of I.V Vitamin C Therapy. It is one of the best antiviral agents available, with the ability to neutralize and eliminate a wide range of toxins. Vitamin C will enhance host resistance, significantly augmenting the immune system's ability to neutralize bacterial and fungal infections. We follow the Riordan Clinic Research Team, which has decades of studies and internationally published articles and has sent speakers worldwide to share this research. I.V Vitamin Therapy Clinic's staff follows strict I.V protocols and is trained in Intravenous Vitamin C. The National Institutes of Health has published evidence confirming Vitamin C's anti-cancer properties. When cancer patients who receive I.V Vitamin C report a reduction in their pain level and are better able to tolerate chemotherapy. Intravenous Vitamin C is complementary to oncologic care, so patients may continue their conventional cancer therapies if they choose to. - Packages & Punch cards - I.V.
