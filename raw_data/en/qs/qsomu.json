Hartford Hospital 80 Seymour Street Hartford, CT 06102-5037 (860) 545-5000 Health Referral Service (860) 545-1888 545-7664 www.harthosp.org Rounds Medical Advisory Board: Adrienne M.D. David Crombie, M.D. Joseph Klimek, M.D. Andrew Salner, M.D. Linda Taylor, M.D.R O U N D SH E A L T H T I P S Hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent the spread of germs. While washing with plain soap and water works well to remove soil and germs, antisep - tic soaps continue to kill germs after hand washing by leaving residual antibacterial chemicals on the skin. Alcohol-based instant hand sanitizers, both gels and foams, offer a quick way to disinfect hands when soap and water aren't available. Sold in personal-size bottles for pocket or purse, these products help reduce the risk of infection in homes, schools and hospitals, say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Found in 2,000 dispensers throughout Hartford Hospi - tal, instant hand sanitizers have even made their way to the gangways of cruise ships as a safeguard against shipboard stomach bugs. To properly use alcohol-based instant hand sanitiz - ers, cover hands with enough gel (a dollop about the size of a nickel) to get them wet, and then vigorously rub them together until they are dry, paying special attention to the nail area. \"Alcohol-based sanitizers have been shown to be less drying than soap and water for healthcare workers whose hands can become raw and irritated from fre- quent traditional soap and water handwashing,\" says Epidemiology Clinician Susan Malo-Schlegel, RN, MPH, CIC, of Hartford Hospital. \"Hand sanitizer should be used on hands that are not visibly soiled, since alcohol- based foams and gels aren't intended to remove dirt.\" The journal Emerging Infectious Diseases urges consumers to read labels carefully because some look-alike brands don't contain the recommended 60 to 70 percent alcohol concentration necessary to kill harmful microbes. Add alcohol-based hand sanitizers to emergency kits for infection control in the event a hurricane or blackout cuts off running water. Whether the active ingredient is ethyl alcohol, ethanol or iso- propanol, make sure that the product's alcohol concen - tration is between 60 and 95 percent. Going Up in Style in Blue Back Square Rising amid the steel and concrete in West Hartford Center is Hartford Hospital's latest satellite Wellness Center, planned for completion in spring 2007. Recently \"topped off\" with steel, the design of the Wellness Center offers a distinctive contemporary flair in keeping with West Hartford's rich architectural tradition. The new facility is part of the upscale 550,000-square- foot Blue Back Square\u2014a luxury condominium, restaurant, retail, and office complex\u2014just off I-84 in a suburban location with plenty of parking. In addition to medical and professional offices, the new facility will feature a 35,000-square-foot Healthtrax fitness center, the largest to date. Many Hartford Hospital physicians and cardiologists recommend exercise facilities for patients needing physical therapy or cardiac rehabilitation. The new Wellness Center will offer a wide range of medical services, including the Connecticut Surgical Group's surgery center, as well as physical therapy, diagnostic test- ing and specialty care in conveniently located offices. The new facility joins Hartford Hospital's extended network of suburban locations in Avon, Glastonbury, Hartford, Newing - ton, Wethersfield and Windsor.Hartford Hospital Wellness Center Handy Advice 2PIONEERING PROCEDURES NEW WEAPONS TO FIGHT CANCER Dr. Andy Salner and his team of radiation oncologists attack tumors with an arsenal of radiosurgical tools found nowhere else in Connecticut.PHYSICIAN PROFILEPIONEERING PROCEDURES \u2014 New Weapons to Fight Cancer Targeting Cancer Robert D. Siegel, M.D., FACP, is a medical oncologist and medical director of the Cancer Clinical Research Program at Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. He chairs the In - stitutional Review Board, which governs Hartford Hospital's research protocols involving human subjects in clinical trials. The Mary Mulready Sullivan Oncology Symposium, the hospital's widely attended event for healthcare professionals, focused this year on developments in targeted therapies. After studying medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Dr. Siegel did his internship and residency at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, followed by a fellowship in medical oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. Areas of special research interest include sarcomas, genitourinary tumors and lung tumors. A clinical associate professor of Medicine at the University of Connecticut, he is Board- certified in internal medicine, hematology and medical oncology. Dr. Siegel is married, with three sons (one of whom is shown at right) ranging in age from 17 to 24. He enjoys cycling, hiking and golf.Robert D. Siegel, M.D. The recent unraveling of the human genome has spawned an explosion in molecular targets for innovative cancer drugs. An individual's genetic blueprint comprises thousands of genes that code for a million or more different proteins\u2014the biochemical powerhouses of the body. The new science of proteomics \u2014the study of proteins within cells\u2014is driving pio- neering research into drugs aimed at the molecular mechanisms of cancer. A tumor mass only half an inch in diameter can contain as many as a billion cells. Cancer arises when even a single renegade cell goes awry and begins to proliferate wildly, replicat - ing snippets of faulty genetic material as it divides uncontrollably. How can doctors prevent the spread of these menacing cells throughout the body? Metastasis, with its far-flung colonies of invading cells run amok, kills many of cancer's victims. Cancer hijacks the complex machin - ery of the cell by switching on errant genes that code for wayward proteins or by wrongly turning off tumor sup- pressor genes. Cancer researchers are investigating vaccines and novel drug therapies aimed at genes, enzymes and growth factor receptors. Angio - genesis \u2014the development of a blood supply that feeds and nourishes the tumor\u2014is yet another target for new approaches to therapy.\"Our quest is to find drugs that impact cancer cells directly,\" says Robert D. Siegel, M.D., a medical on- cologist and director of Cancer Clinical Research at Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"Targeted therapies are replacing cancer drugs that bombard the body with harsh poisons in the hope of killing off cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells.\"A revolution in knowledge has led to winning strategies for cancer treatment Cancer is no longer thought of as a single disease that will someday be conquered with some as yet- undiscovered chemical \"magic bullet.\" Proteomics is spurring revolutionary research into \"designer drugs\" that will shape the chemotherapy of the future. \"Cells are molecular machines that reproduce and grow,\" explains Dr. Siegel. \"Cancer is unregulated growth that occurs when the cell loses its 'stop' and 'go' controls. The goal of drug discovery is to restore normal function to the cell, which we're doing with varying degrees of success.\" Often combined with chemotherapy or radiation, targeted drugs shrink tumors by blocking enzymes, over-ex - pressed proteins or growth factors that 4PIONEERING PROCEDURES \u2014 New Weapons to Fight Cancer unleash ravaging tumor cells. Patients at Hartford Hospital are participating in more than 30 ongoing clinical trials for experimental cancer drugs, in part- nership with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and other national centers. \"Now we can attack a specific cancer with a targeted therapy that attacks a receptor on the outside of the tumor cell,\" adds Dr. Siegel. \"Some drugs block growth factors, while another trial is studying an experimental anti- angiogenesis drug to shrink a lung tumor by starving its blood supply.\" Like detectives at a crime scene, researchers scrutinize blood vials and biopsies for molecular finger - prints that reveal abnormal genes. For example, women with a mutant HER-2/neu gene\u2014a quarter of women with metastatic breast cancer\u2014tend to have aggressive disease and poor prognosis because HER2 (human epi- dermal growth factor receptor) spurs cell growth. The drug Herceptin is designed to target the over-expressed growth factor by binding to the HER2 receptor, inhibiting the tumor cell's ability to respond to growth signals. Monoclonal antibodies are de- signed to harness the body's immune system to kill tumor cells with fewer side effects than conventional chemo - therapy. Rituxan, a targeted therapy for a specific type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was the first antibody ap- proved by the Food and Drug Admin - istration (FDA) to treat cancer, while Avastin was the first therapy approved to inhibit angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels develop and carry nutrients to a tumor. The FDA continues to extend targeted therapies to a wider range of cancers. Originally approved for colorectal cancer, Avastin has been shown to extend survival in advanced breast and lung cancers in combina - tion with standard chemotherapy. Erbitux, a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth fac- tor receptor (EGFR), was originally approved for head and neck cancer in combination with radiation, and has now been approved for metastatic colorectal cancer. Another targeted drug is Gleevec, developed to treat a progressive blood cancer called chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). People with CML overproduce a type of abnormal white blood cells that live longer than normal cells. While most types of chemotherapy kill all fast-growing cells\u2014both abnormal and normal\u2014Gleevec inhibits a spe- cific protein. \"Gleevec has been unusu - ally successful in targeting the specific genetic abnormality that causes CML,\" says Dr. Siegel. The FDA recently approved two new multitargeted drugs for advanced kidney cancer, historically resistant to standard chemotherapy. Renal cell car- cinoma, by far the most common type of kidney cancer, arises from inactiva - tion of a tumor suppression gene. Like Gleevec, two new breakthrough drugs are molecularly targeted therapies that bind to the active enzyme site of abnormal proteins. For patients who have become resistant to Gleevec, multitargeted drugs offer new treat- ment options. If you would like to learn more about clinical trials at Hartford Hospital, call the Cancer Clinical Research office at (860) 545-5363.Chuck Waldron , one of Dr. Siegel's patients, began a course of the once- a-day chemotherapy pill Gleevec last November. \"I take Gleevec with a meal every day just like a vitamin pill,\" says Waldron, who lives and works in Massachusetts and returns to the Cancer Center for monthly check-ups. \"I'm relatively lucky to have gotten chronic myeloid leu - kemia now instead of a just a few years ago when it would probably have required radiation and a bone marrow transplant. I'm a regular exerciser and I haven't missed a beat. Gleevec has few side effects\u2014some leg cramps, dehydration and stomach turmoil\u2014and I don't need to spend hours in the cancer center. The new drug has worked so well that I haven't even missed a day of work.\"A SUCCESS STORY HOW GLEEVEC WORKS Original Chromosome 9Chromosome 22 Breaks Of fPiece of Chromosome 22 has become attachedNew Abnormal Chromosome 9 Extra strand of DNA contains the Abl-Bcr GeneGLEEVEC Gene causes signal to stay \"ON\"When signal is \"ON\" cell produces many abnormal white cellsSTOPS Cellthe \"ON\" Signal Darren Pierce photograph 5PIONEERING PROCEDURES \u2014 New Weapons to Fight Cancer Radiation Oncology's Triple Threat Thanks to the generosity of Hartford Hospital donors, the new Varian Trilogy linear accelerator at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center is the first of its kind in Connecticut. The hospital is building on its reputation as a leader in radiation oncology with this versatile new scan\") diagnostic imaging pinpoints tumors with digital accuracy and positions them in the high-dose area despite any internal organ movement. Advances in low-dose, high resolu - tion X-ray imaging, precision delivery and patient positioning are the three advantages of the Trilogy system. In addition to image guidance, the other two components of the unique triad are intensity modulated radiation therapy and stereotactic radiation therapy. Since 2003, radiation oncolo - gists at the Cancer Center have used intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to \"shape\" a dose of radiation to match the contours of a specific tumor. \"We can superimpose thou- sands of small fields of radiation to sculpt the beam around a solid tumor,\" says Andrew L. Salner, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Cancer Program. \"The prostate gland tends to move within the body, so we image the tumor before treatment every day.\"Not only is the next-generation Trilogy linear accelerator safer and more sophisticated than existing systems, it adds new options for stereotactic neu- rosurgical treatment. With the Trilogy system, radiation oncologists and their neurosurgical colleagues can target inoperable lesions or tumors in critical areas of the brain, using image-guided delivery and a helmet-like device that holds a patient's head completely still during radiosurgery. \"We can now deliver a precisely placed, one-shot or multi-shot, extremely high dose of ra- diation to a tumor in the brain,\" says Dr. Salner. \"The beam is so highly focused that sensitive structures like the optic nerve receive significantly less radia- tion.\" Even more precise than so-called \"gamma knife\" radiosurgery, the state- of-the-art Trilogy system minimizes radiation damage to healthy tissue. Hartford Hospital's Radiation Oncology Department also offers brachytherapy\u2014either permanent or temporary\u2014for prostate cancer treat- ment. Permanent seed implants can be implanted into the prostate gland, where they give off radiation at a low dose rate over several weeks or months. \"Temporary brachytherapy can be targeted much more precisely to spare the urethra,\" explains Dr. Salner. \"Tiny catheters deliver highly radioactive iridium-192 seeds to the tumor. Be- cause the computer controls how long each seed remains in each catheter\u2014 from fractions of a second up to many Trilogy: seconds\u2014we can selectively control the radiation dose to different regions of the prostate.\" The hospital's prostate cancer team individualizes care for each patient and helps to determine which option is best for each patient. Brachytherapy is also used in the management of several other types of cancer. For example, women with local- ized breast cancer who meet specific criteria are candidates for MammoSite partial breast radiation, which can be completed in five treatment days instead of the usual six weeks. The technique utilizes high dose rate brachytherapy consisting of a twice- daily 20-minute treatment to focus on the portion of the breast at risk. Radiation oncologists are now col- laborating with medical oncologists/ hematologists to bring new approaches to cancer treatment. Hartford Hospital is pioneering a radioactive cancer breakthrough called radioimmuno - therapy. To deliver a dose of radiation to a tumor target, radiotherapy drugs hitch a ride on a monoclonal anti- body\u2014a protein designed to lock onto a specific area on a cell's surface. Once they acquire their molecular target, yttrium-90 or iodine-131 radioisotopes blast the cancer cell with a lethal dose of radioactivity. The FDA has approved two radioactive drugs, Zevalin and Bexxar, for patients with relapsed or recurrent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed chemotherapy. 6WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Brain Food Eating fish regularly may improve brain function, reports the Archives of Neurology. Fish contains DHA, a type of omega-3 fatty acid critical to healthy brain development. Although DHA declines with age, it can be replenished, say researchers at Chicago's Rush Institute for Healthy Aging. Cognitive decline is 10 percent lower in those who eat fish at least once a week.Breathing Boost The latest treatment for cystic fibrosis\u2014a concentrated salt solution inhaled through a nebulizer\u2014offers an inexpensive, safe way to boost lung function in people with cystic fibrosis. Inhaled hypertonic saline is also an effective therapy for reducing flare-ups of the chronic lung infections that afflict people with the deadly genetic disease, according to The New England Journal of Medicine.D's Day in the Sun Harvard School of Public Health researchers say vitamin D\u2014produced by the body dur- ing exposure to sunlight\u2014may have potent anticancer properties. Low vitamin D levels common in the sunshine-deprived Northeast have been linked with increased cancer in- cidence and mortality in men, reports the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, while women deficient in vitamin D are at risk for osteoporosis. Vitamin D seems to inhibit the growth of malignancies, although overexposure to sun can cause skin cancer.Nocturnal Noshing Americans filled 26 million prescriptions for the sleeping pill Ambien last year, up 53 percent since 2001. But experts at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center warn that Ambien can spur susceptible sleepers to raid the refrigerator or go out for ice cream with no memory of events on awakening. Ambien has been linked to sleepwalk - ing, hallucinations and even driving while asleep.Mumps Jumps As the mumps continues to spread across the Midwest, the outbreak is reaching epidemic proportions, warn the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Common symptoms include fever, headache and swollen salivary glands under the jaw, although hearing loss, meningitis and swollen testicles can occur. Public health officials worry that the highly contagious virus is hitching a ride on airliners.No Sweat Protein-enhanced sports drinks stave off fluid loss during warm-weather exercise, say St. Cloud State University Human Performance Lab researchers testing cyclists who exercised long enough to sweat away 2 percent of their body weight. Athletes who consumed protein drinks retained 15 percent more fluid than those who had ordinary sports drink, and 40 percent more than those who drank only water.Safer Sex An FDA panel recently recommended approval of Gardasil, a new vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection. In clinical trials Gardasil was 100% effective in preventing infection with HPV strains 16 and 18, responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancer. The vaccine\u2014given in three injections over six months\u2014also was about 99% effective in preventing HPV strains 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital wart cases.Dying for A Cigarette Smokers are more likely to die in middle age than nonsmokers or those who quit, reports the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only nine percent of women and 14 percent of men who never smoked died between the ages of 40 and 70, compared to 26 percent of women and 41 percent of men who smoked a pack or more a day. 7Beating the Odds At Hartford Hospital, Drs. Hammond and Dougherty head the transplant team for patients whose hearts are beyond rescue. Heart failure is the fastest-growing cardiovascular disease and the single leading cause of death in the United States. Slowly or suddenly, a diseased organ fails as end-stage heart disease looms or a massive heart attack strikes. Rare but lethal viral infections sometimes travel through the bloodstream and destroy the heart muscle.Whether the steady decline into heart failure takes days or decades, by the time transplant candidates reach Hart- ford Hospital they have likely battled congestive heart disease or irreversible heart injury from coronary artery disease, heart attacks, viral infection or some other cause. Potential heart transplant patients typically have an expected survival of less than a year. \"Harford Hospital's one-year heart transplantation survival rate is 92 percent, which exceeds national bench - marks,\" says James E. Dougherty, M.D., medical director of the hospital's Cardiac Transplant Program. \"Without a trans- plant, the risk of mortality for these patients would be 100 percent. Each year, thousands more Americans would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available.\" \"Transplants give heart patients a second chance at life,\" adds Jonathan A. Hammond, M.D., surgical director of the Cardiac Transplant Program. Transplanta - tion is intrinsically exciting\u2014it's incred - ibly gratifying and dramatic to help someone turn away from death's door.\" Hartford Hospital's first transplant recipient is still alive today, 22 years after receiving a donor heart. In 1984, a heart attack destroyed more than two- thirds of Andy Buczek's heart muscle. \"It was especially difficult because it came overnight,\" he recalls. \"I said, 'Get out of here\u2014I'm only 34 years old!\"Heart transplantation is a multi- disciplinary effort that blends art and science, surgery and medicine, immunol - ogy and pharmacology. Dr. Dougherty attributes rising survival rates in part to a new anti-rejection drug called cyclosporine. \"Organ transplantation is a controlled war. You're battling rejection and infection as the body tries to get rid of the new organ. Fighting rejection is a lifelong process.\" Victor and Mary Campbell of Bloom - field married on Febru - ary 14, 2001, while he was in Hartford Hospital awaiting a heart trans - plant. They chose the date\u2014Valentine's Day\u2014 to make a public appeal for a donor heart. \"We were planning to be married,\" recalls Victor, who was kept alive on a heart pump, \"but I had been waiting on a transplant list in the hospital for three months.\" On March 11, he learned that a heart had become available, donated by the family of a 25-year-old accident victim. \"I'll never forget when the doctors came THE BEAT GOES ON\"Heart transplant candidates failing while waiting for a donor organ can be bridged with a mechanical pump that can assume the function of the left or right ventricles, or both,\" says Dr. Ham- been used to resuscitate and reha- bilitate completely two of our patients for more than three months each prior to their successful transplants.\" in early Sunday morning to give me the news and to pre - pare me for surgery,\" Victor recalls. \"Dr. Hammond personally flew to Boston to pick up the heart,\" adds Mary. \"It was a perfect match. For us, it was a joyous occasion\u2014we were so grateful.\" Since receiving his new heart more than five years ago, Victor had one bout of trans - plant disease, successfully controlled with anti-rejection drugs. \"Occasionally there are days when he doesn't feel 100 percent,\" says Mary, \"but he's a miracle.\" CHEST PAIN: Alarming Symptom Chest pain is often an ominous signal of coronary artery disease, leading to 2.3 million hospital admissions nationwide for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Chest pain results from insuf - ficient blood supply to the heart muscle. The second most common reason for emergency room visits across the United States, chest pain accounts for eight percent of Hartford Hospital emergencies. More than a million Americans experience a heart attack each year, necessitating immediate artery-opening treatment with lifesaving clot-busting drugs and balloon angioplasty. \"If you're having a heart attack, rapid intervention is critical,\" says Raymond McKay, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Hartford Hospital. \"But half the people admitted to hospitals for chest pain are suffering from sore muscles, stress or some other non-cardiac event. We don't have enough beds to admit everyone with chest pain, but we can't just send patients home. If they're actually having a heart attack, up to a quarter of them will die.\"Hartford Hospital's Chest Pain Center will be the beneficiary of the 2007 Black and Red Gala, the hospital's premiere fundraising event. Black & Red proceeds will provide support for public education, equipment (treadmills), paramedics/EMT training, data analysis and renovations.Until now, patients often languished for hours in the Emergency Department before spending two or three days in the hospital while physicians \"ruled out\" a heart attack. With the establishment of Hartford Hospital's Chest Pain Center\u2014the first in north central Connecticut to be accredited by the Society of Chest Pain Cen - ters\u2014potential heart attack victims receive delay-free triage and fast-track treatment. High-risk chest pain patients are admitted to a cardiac unit, while low-risk patients go to the Chest Pain Center. \"Don't minimize chest pain,\" warns Dr. McKay. \"Come in and stay for less than 24 hours in a friendly environment where you'll un - dergo electrocardiograms, diagnostic blood work and a stress test. Don't be afraid to go to the hospital in case your chest pain turns out not to be cardiac-related. Our short-stay evaluation center may reveal life-threatening coronary artery disease and prevent a severe heart attack from occurring.\" 9 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | Painful Feet? Nasty Nails... Since tight or ill-fitting shoes often aggravate common foot problems, podiatrists may suggest a trip to a reputable shoe store to have your feet measured for length and width. \"Many women wear stylish shoes with high heels,\" says Larry A. Suecof, D.P.M., a podiatric surgeon with Connecticut Surgical Group. \"Although squeezing your feet into narrow shoes can exacerbate exist- ing problems, a comfortable shoe won't cause any harm.\" Particularly among women, there is a tendency to overlook the fact that after 25 years your foot may no longer be a size 7. Shoe sizes and styles vary widely, so don't go by the size marked inside the shoe but how it feels on the foot. Avoid cramming your feet into fashionably narrow high heels if you already have painful foot problems. Toe Troubles Tight, pointy shoes with high heels can contribute to knee and back problems, shortened calf muscles, claw-like \"hammer toes\" or painful corns in someone genetically predis - posed to structural problems. If you want to wear high heels, limit the time you wear them or alternate them with good quality square-toed shoes or comfortable flats. Foot Flaws While poorly fitting shoes don't cause foot problems, they worsen exist- ing conditions like Achilles tendon - itis, bunions (misaligned toe joints), benign nerve growths, heel pain and \"pump bump\" (a bone enlargement at the back of the heel). Inflammation of the band of fibrous connective tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot, called plantar fasciitis, can be aggra - vated by shoes that lack arch support. Faulty biomechanics can cause heel pain by placing stress on the bone and soft tissues. Shoe inserts or orthotic devices may be necessary to treat pain caused by heel spurs, bony growths on the underside of the heel bone that result from strain on the muscles and ligaments of the foot. Beware those purple-spotted creatures sporting devilish tails and evil grins, crawling creepily under hideous toenails. Looking more like escapees from Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are than a fungal infection, the creepy caricatures represent tiny organisms called dermatophytes that grow be - neath fingernails and toenails. If TV commercials are to be believed, many people spend years hiding their unsightly toenails, avoiding sandals and open-toed shoes because of ugly, discolored nails. An estimated 35 million people in the United States harbor dermatophytes under their nails, spread by sharing nail clippers or by going barefoot in bathrooms, showers or locker rooms. Dermatophytes are an active fungal infection that can cause discomfort and tenderness. Nail fungus infections don't go away on their own, and if left untreated, can worsen or spread to other nails. Once the fungus takes hold, it discolors and thick - ens nails, turning them brown, yellow or even black. Bits of dirt collect under toenails, which can become brittle, flaky and foul-smelling. Physicians prescribe antifungal medications to treat painful or disfiguring toenail infections. Unlike superficial treatments applied to the nails, oral medications travel through the bloodstream to root out the infection where it thrives and grows, deep in the nail bed. \"The ideal Lamisil patient is a young woman with one infected nail,\" says Larry A. Suecof, D.P.M., a podiatric surgeon with Connecti - cut Surgical Group. \"Lamisil is far more effective for fingernails than toenails. Unfortunately, the infection tends to recur once treatment is stopped.\" \"Fungal infections have a high relapse rate,\" explains Lisa Kugelman, M.D., a Board-certi - fied dermatologist at Hartford Hospital. \"Lamisil achieves a complete cure in no more than 70 percent of patients. The drug also has some strange potential side effects, such as causing people to lose their sense of taste.\" Physicians monitor liver en - zyme function over the course of treatment because Lamisil, along with Sporanox (itraconazole) and an older medication called Griseofulvin, can potentially damage the liver. The FDA has also warned that people taking Sporanox face a small risk of developing congestive heart fail - ure. Ask your doctor for advice if you have any underlying medical conditions. Michigan State University clini - cians report that applying Vicks VapoRub to infected nails may help clear up the fungus. While oral antifungal drugs are more effective, natural ingredients like eucalyptus, menthol and camphor have few side effects. A study at the university's foot care clinics showed that more than a third of the subjects who applied VapoRub daily reported improve - ment over the course of five to 16 months. 10Autistic children inhabit a solitary internal world, a bleak mental prison devoid of human emotions. Kids diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder typically are unresponsive to social cues, appear remote or preoccupied, and have difficulty expressing abstract feelings. Locked in a private sensory refuge, they seem oblivious to other people's emotions. Individuals with autism typically don't initiate or sustain conversations except on odd or inappro - priate topics of interest to them. \"One 22-year-old would only talk about TV's Nickelodeon channel,\" says Michal Assaf, M.D., a senior research scientist at the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Autistic kids are fascinated with things like train schedules. You can see why it makes them targets for bullying at school. Some severely autistic children do not speak at all, while others say terrible things.\" Many children with brain-based developmental disorders suffer from bewildering sensory overload that impairs brain function and triggers repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. While all autistic kids seem socially awkward, those with Asperger's Syndrome sometimes display extraordinary gifts of memory, music or mathematics. Despite their cognitive strengths, autistic people rarely grasp social nuances. Neuroscientists at the IOL use sophisticated nonin - vasive tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze the firing of brain cells and identify ana- tomical or structural abnormalities in autistic individuals. Researchers studying the baffling developmental disorder hope that neuroimaging will eventually break through the invisible biological barriers that block an autistic individu - al's feelings and emotions. Someday, they hope to pinpoint how autism shapes social functioning in as yet uncharted regions of the brain. Dr. Assaf's pilot project, supported by grants from Hartford Hospital and the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR), maps brain activity with fMRI while autistic subjects play an interactive game of dominos with investigators. For researchers, the goal of the game is to explore brain mechanisms involved in social cognition Domino Theory: Insights into the Autistic Brain processes such as motivation and mentalization\u2014the abil- ity to conceptualize someone else's thoughts and feelings. \"We want to see if their brains 'light up' differently from those of healthy controls during social interactions,\" she explains. \"To play the game, they have to take risks. They must predict what an opponent will do\u2014and are punished or rewarded accordingly.\" While using fMRI to investigate the neural networks underlying autism's cognitive impairments is not new, Dr. Assaf's groundbreaking study is attempting to correlate brain activity with predictive behavior in a social context. \"No one has attempted to link brain activation associated with complex social interaction with social aspects and impairments in autism,\" explains Dr. Assaf. \"If we can prove our hypothesis, we hope someday to be able to use this task for differential diagnosis.\" Investigators will also collect a saliva sample from test subjects for later genetic analysis. While specific genes are known to raise susceptibility to the disorder, other fac- tors apparently are at work. Even when one identical twin has autism, the other twin has only a 60 percent chance of sharing the same diagnosis. Since the difference prob- ably lies buried somewhere in the 100 trillion synapses that make up the wiring of the brain, fMRI may someday pin down autism's elusive causes. Dr. Assaf is enrolling autistic young adults age 12 to 30 in the investigational study.

Place in a plastic bag and refrigerate until ready to serve. Up to 15 minutes before serving, dress the green beans: Combine the lemon juice, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl. Spear both garlic halves with a dinner fork. Using this as a whisk, drizzle the oil into the lemon mixture and whisk to combine. Add the green beans, slivered almonds and zest, and toss to coat. Season with pepper. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmigiano-Reggiano into paper-thin strips. Scatter over the green beans and toss gently before serving. Serve on a platter with grape tomatoes for added color. (Makes six servings) (2 oz. cheese) Calories: 200 Protein: 5.9 g Carbohydrate: 11.8 g Fiber: 3.6 g Green Beans with Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over grilled fish, roasted vegetables, pasta or polenta to bring out the flavor and boost the benefits to your heart. Olive oil and piquant cheeses add a tangy twist to green beans. The words \"extra-virgin\" on the label mean that the oil is derived from the first pressing of fresh, premium olives. Extra-virgin oils range in flavor and pungency from fruity and flavorful to bold or buttery. Color may vary from gold to green, depending on the olives. The high content of monounsaturated fatty acids and anti-oxidative substances add up to olive oil's healthy heart advantages. A World Health Organization study showed that olive oil protects against cardiovascular disease, while the American Journal of Epidemiology says olive oil controls LDL (\"bad\") cholester - ol levels and raises HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels. Serve Parmigiano-Reggiano, a sweetly pungent cheese, with pasta, seafood, risotto, soups, polenta, vegetables or fruit. Sliced or shaved, the firm, moist cheese comple - ments savory foods. Sold in a huge wheel with Parmigiano-Reggiano stamped on the rind, it should be kept refrigerated, in paper or foil (not plastic, which doesn't allow the cheese to \"breathe\").1 clove garlic, halved lengthwise \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 2-inch strip lemon zest, cut into thin slivers freshly ground black pepper to taste 1 2- to 3-oz. chunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano Total fat: 15.7 g (48% monosaturated fat) Cholesterol: 2.9 mg Vitamin C: 12 mg "}
