The goal of the program is to arm you with the right tools to halt the development of heart disease and stroke. The chemicals from smoking damage the lining of your arteries, causing inflammation and narrowing, explains Dr. Morad. These chemicals cause the blood to thicken, which increases the likelihood of clots forming inside the veins and arteries. Smoking also raises your heart rate and blood pressure. All of this additional stress on the heart can lead to heart attack or stroke. \"The more you smoke, the higher your risk, \" says Dr. Morad. \"A person who smokes two packs a day increases his or her risk for heart attack or stroke by 900 percent. But the fact is, no number of cigarettes is good for your heart. Less than five cigarettes a day can increase your risk for heart attack or stroke by 40 percent. Even secondhand smoke is estimated to be responsible for 35,000 deaths from heart disease each year. \" Using forms of tobacco other than cigarettes can be equally as harmful. \"While cigar or pipe smoking is perceived as safer, they both contain the same carcinogens as cigarettes, \" says Dr. Morad. \"Smoking four cigars is equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes. Marijuana smoking increases heart rate and blood pressure. The rate of heart attack right after smoking marijuana is increased by up to five times. If you have a history of heart attack, smoking marijuana increases your risk for death by up to threefold. \" Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes or vaping, have been promoted as a safe alternative to smoking.

Gi s 402.559.2010 / 402.559.2496.This is my first opportunity to write to you in my role as vice president of Operations at Bellevue Medical Center. Fall is a season of transition and change. It's also a good time to reflect on the past and to give thanks for the blessings in our lives. As part of that reflection, I am proud to be part of a team committed to excellence, which is one of our organizational values at Nebraska Medicine. We strive for the highest standards of safety and quality and we work to achieve exceptional results. That commitment to excellence was recently exemplified by two important recognitions. Bellevue Medical Center was recognized by the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association for our commitment to ensure stroke patients receive the most appropriate treatment according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines. This is important because we know that stroke is a time-critical diagnosis, and well-organized expert care can reduce death and disability. In addition, Bellevue Medical Center has earned full accreditation as a Chest Pain Center with Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) from the American College of Cardiology (ACC). This is the first time we have achieved this level of accreditation. This reinforces that our patients will receive the most timely and expert care if they experience a heart attack. (Read more about both of these awards on the back page.) Transition and change continue to be key themes on our campus in terms of growing the services we provide and making care more accessible. As one of our goals to offer the most advanced care, we recently began providing 3-D mammography. This procedure has been shown to improve detection rates by as much as 30 percent. Epilepsy care is also coming to the Bellevue area, with the opening of our new epilepsy clinic at Twin Creek, which will be staffed by board-certified epilepsy specialists. We are making health care services more accessible to the residents of Plattsmouth by changing the model of care to a walk-in friendly Immediate Care Clinic to better serve the residents in that area. This fall, I hope you're able to enjoy the colors of the season and to give thanks for being part of the amazing Bellevue community.

The therapy is part of a growing treatment option in cancer that harnesses the body's own immune system to attack a tumor. T cells are white blood cells that help the body fight infection and cancer. These clinical trials involve taking the patient's own T cells and programming them to recognize a marker on the cancer cell, leading the immune system to attack the cancer. \"These two trials use the same overall concept as the new CAR T -cell therapy that has shown so much success with our lymphoma patients, \" says Sarah Holstein, MD, PhD, Nebraska Medicine hematologist and medical oncologist, who specializes in multiple myeloma treatment and research. The two studies will encompass multiple groups of myeloma patients, including newly diagnosed patients with high-risk disease, as well as relapsed/ refractory patients who are no longer responding to chemotherapy. \"Early studies have shown a remarkable efficacy for this new therapy, \" says Dr. Holstein. \"In several studies, more than 90 percent of patients had significant responses and these were patients who had essentially run out of treatment options. The exciting thing about the studies we will be opening is they will allow patients to receive CAR T -cell therapy earlier in the course of their disease. We hope this will result in patients achieving deeper and longer-lasting responses. \" Currently, there is no cure for multiple myeloma and many patients receive multiple therapies through the course of their disease management. Treatment for many newly diagnosed myeloma patients typically starts with chemotherapy, followed by an autologous stem cell transplant, where stem cells are harvested from a donor. \"Even though the transplant process can be very effective at keeping the disease under control for long periods of time, the vast majority of patients will still relapse, \" says Dr. Holstein. \"These patients never get a break. They typically stay on one therapy until it stops working and then move to the next one. We hope that CAR T -cell therapy will change that.\"Medical centers across the country are eager to offer this therapy to their patients. The experience and expertise we have gained from our early involvement in the lymphoma CAR T -cell therapy clinical trials has enabled us to be on the forefront of these new myeloma studies. \" Dr. Holstein says hope for long-term disease control for multiple myeloma has never been brighter. \"There is much optimism that this may be the next big breakthrough treatment for myeloma patients, \" she says.

Find Out Why If you are always tired, have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, snore or stop breathing during your sleep, or need sleep aids, you should be evaluated to find out why. Most sleep problems can be attributed to an underlying cause, whether it's depression, anxiety, pain or sleep apnea, says Michael Summers, MD, pulmonologist and medical director of the Nebraska Medicine Sleep Disorders Center. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to serious health issues, including high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems, heart attack, stroke, lack of diabetes control, Alzheimer's disease, decreased seizure threshold and exacerbation of chronic pain. Getting evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea, the most common sleep disorder, can now be done in the comfort of your home. The home sleep apnea test requires you to wear a finger probe that measures oxygen levels, a belt that goes around the chest to measure effort of breathing and a sensor under the nose to measure airflow. This data is then evaluated and interpreted by a sleep medicine specialist. If it is determined that you may have another type of sleep disorder, you may be recommended for an overnight sleep study in our accredited sleep lab. \"Our sleep lab is staffed by medical experts specially trained to diagnose and treat multiple sleep disorders to help get you back on the road to a good night's sleep, \" says Dr. Summers. \" After your evaluation, we will follow up and work with you to resolve or manage your sleep issue. \" Not Feeling Rested?

Osteoporosis is responsible for 2 million broken bones every year in the U.S. and causes 75,000 deaths, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. It is estimated that 1 in 2 women and up to 1 in 4 men ages 50 and older in the U.S. will break a bone due to osteoporosis. Often called the brittle bone disease, osteoporosis causes the bones to become weak and brittle with age. The problem is, most people don't know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone. In an effort to boost the number of patients diagnosed and treated for osteoporosis and prevent secondary bone fractures, Nebraska Medicine recently opened an osteoporosis clinic at the Orthopaedics clinic at Lauritzen Outpatient Center. \"The elderly are at the highest risk for a fracture because their bone is more fragile, \" says Laura Graeff-Armas, MD, Nebraska Medicine endocrinologist, who specializes in osteoporosis. \"Hip fractures could mean the end of life for some of these patients. Many of them go to a skilled nursing facility and never return home. We want to prevent these types of injuries. \" Have Y ou Had Y our Bones Checked?

Three-dimensional mammography allows the radiologist to view the breast in multiple thin layers or \"sliced\" images, providing better detection of smaller masses. \"Three-dimensional mammography decreases callbacks by 40 percent due to the greater clarity provided by these images, \" says Cheryl Williams, MD, Nebraska Medicine radiologist. \"Overall, it is estimated that it increases breast cancer detection by 10 to 30 percent. The smaller a tumor is when we find it, the more likely it is that we'll be able to cure it. \" October Is Breast Cancer Awareness Month Call 800.922.0000 to schedule your mammogram now.6 Advancing Health | Fall 2018 features CARDIOLOGYfeature CANCER CARE Holistic Approaches to Breast Cancer Surgery Dr. Shannon Wong, plastic and reconstructive surgeon, performs an advanced breast reconstructive procedure that provides a more natural-feeling breast.Find a location near you. | NebraskaMed.com/Locations 7The breast cancer team at Nebraska Medicine is committed to providing each patient with a customized plan that addresses the individual's physical, emotional and spiritual needs now and in the future. \"With all the advances in breast cancer care, women are living for many years after a breast cancer diagnosis, \" says Jessica Maxwell, MD, Nebraska Medicine surgical oncologist and oncoplastic surgeon. \"However, the results of surgery can often leave women feeling disfigured and negative about their bodies and become a constant reminder of the cancer. Today, we are looking at survivorship and how to best help women not only survive but thrive by taking a whole-person approach. \" A \"whole-person\" approach entails the input of all the specialists involved in the patient's care, from the medical oncologist to the surgeon, radiation oncologist, radiologist, pathologist, genetics counselor, and plastic and reconstructive surgeon. \"This multidisciplinary approach allows us to develop a collaborative plan that provides the best treatment for the cancer as well as the best aesthetic outcome, \" says Dr. Wong. Oncoplastic surgery is another option that improves the cosmetic appearance of the breast while surgically removing the cancer. \"The goal is to return the breast to a healthy appearance, which can lead to better quality of life because it improves self-confidence, self- esteem and comfort with intimacy, \" says Dr. Maxwell, the only surgeon in this area who is trained to perform this unique procedure. Once the tumor is removed, Dr. Maxwell can reshape the breast to prevent contour deformities, realign the nipple and areola, and balance the breasts to provide symmetry \u2014 all during the same surgical procedure. A diagnosis of breast cancer can be both physically and emotionally draining. Even after treatment is over, the physical scars surgery can leave behind can serve as a painful reminder of that difficult time. Nebraska Medicine offers some of the most sophisticated breast reconstruction options to help women feel whole again after treatment is over. This was welcome news for Erin Aten, who was 29 years old when she received the devastating news that she had breast cancer. Having breast reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy was a necessary step to help her move forward emotionally and still feel complete. When Aten's doctors suggested an advanced breast reconstructive procedure called deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, she knew that was the procedure for her. Instead of implants, DIEP flap uses excess skin and fat from the abdomen to construct a new breast, which provides a more natural-feeling breast and tends to age like a natural breast, says Shannon Wong, MD, Nebraska Medicine plastic and reconstructive surgeon. The DIEP flap procedure differs from the traditional free TRAM flap approach in that it does not use abdominal muscle, making it less physically demanding on a woman; provides a quicker recovery; and carries less risk for other complications, such as abdominal hernia, says Dr. Wong, one of a few surgeons in the region who performs the procedure. DIEP flap also involves a microvascularization technique in which the surgeon carefully reattaches the blood vessels of the flap to blood vessels in the chest. This allows the patient to have feeling in her breasts. \"I wanted my breasts to feel as natural as possible and didn't want to worry about having additional breast surgeries in the future, \" says Aten. \"I trusted my doctors completely and am so happy with my decision. \" Dr. Maxwell also performs a nipple-sparing mastectomy, which involves maintaining the entire skin of the breast and hiding the scars in the skin lines under the breast to provide the appearance of a normal breast contour. \"We can also reconstruct the nipple or refer patients for a 3-D tattoo of the nipple-areola complex, \" says Dr. Wong.

Dr. Jessica Maxwell, surgical oncologist and oncoplastic surgeon8 Advancing Health | Fall 2018 features CARDIOLOGY Not many people take up Ironman competitions in their late 40s, much less after having spine surgery. But Renee Spencer did both. And it won her a first-place spot in her age group for the USA Triathlon Age Group National Championship. Two months later, she finished one person away from qualifying for the world team. \"The only regret I have is that I didn't have the surgery sooner, \" says Spencer. \"It was instant relief from my pain. \" Spencer was 46 years old when she decided to start training and competing in Ironman competitions. \"I did my first triathlon and did pretty well and thought, 'Wow, I can do this.' Before I knew it, I was training for Ironmans. \" An Ironman triathlon consists of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run. But then the pain started. It began in her legs and wouldn't subside, even with rest and physical therapy. After seeing several orthopaedic specialists, Spencer selected orthopaedic surgeon Chris Cornett, MD, with the Comprehensive Spine Program at Nebraska Medicine. An MRI revealed that one of her discs was worn to the bone. Dr. Cornett recommended conservative measures first, which included steroid injections and more rest to help alleviate the pain. But it never went away completely, and as Spencer began to rev up her workouts, so did the pain. It was time ... Spencer had to make a choice. If she wanted to continue to compete at the same level, she would need surgery. In December 2016, Spencer underwent a spinal fusion surgery. Dr. Cornett accessed the spine by entering near Spencer's abdomen to avoid going through the back muscle. He then removed the damaged disc and thickened tissues between the two vertebrae. A bone graft and cage was feature ORTHO CARE then used to fill the space between the two vertebrae. A metal plate and screws were used to hold the vertebrae in place while the bone grew together. \"Renee's procedure was so successful because a lot of thought and planning went into this before she had the surgery, \" says Dr. Cornett. \"Successful back and spine surgery is based on selecting the right procedure for the right person. Not everyone is a candidate for surgery, and different procedures are right for different people. I also follow my patients for two years after their surgery in case we need to tweak things along the way. \" \"I chose Dr. Cornett because he spent so much time explaining the procedure and showed concern for my physical and mental health, \" Spencer says. \"He assured me that this was the right procedure and that there was no reason why it couldn't be 100 percent successful so that I could return to training and competing. \" The specialists at the Comprehensive Spine Program are trained to treat spine issues from the common to the complex. This team of specialists includes physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialists, orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, pain specialists, and physical and occupational therapists who work together to ensure patients receive the best and most appropriate care quickly Dr. Chris Cornett discusses spine imaging results with patient Renee Spencer.

Spencer says she was walking the hallways of the hospital the same day as her surgery and was home the next day. \"I took one pain reliever the day I came home and never had to take another one again, \" she says. Spencer began increasing her walking distance every day. By six weeks, she was aqua jogging; at eight weeks, she was swimming; and by 10 weeks, she was bicycling. By 12 weeks, she had returned to two to four hours daily of competition training. Six months later, she was competing again and winning races.

The Patient Assistance Fund is also another means that allows us to provide a whole-person approach to care. It helps relieve the emotional stress that financial strains can have on a patient and family so that they can focus on getting well. \" It's exactly what the Case family needed. \"To me, this fund is just as important as the facilities here, \" says Jennifer. \"Without it, many people wouldn't be able to get the extraordinary care they need from the amazing doctors and nurses at Nebraska Medicine. \" Dakota has since gotten married and works at a hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as a cardiopulmonary patient care technician. \"I like being a source of strength and comfort for others who are having similar health problems. \" Dakota Case was born with a rare heart defect. By the age of 25, he had lived through three open-heart surgeries and had been listed for a heart transplant. But the summer of 2015 would prove to be one of the most trying periods of his life. His heart was pumping at an extremely low output \u2014 too low to provide enough blood to sufficiently supply his organs. Dakota spent that summer in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Nebraska Medical Center, and 40 days of it was on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to allow his lungs to grow stronger. ECMO takes over the work of a person's own lungs and/or heart by delivering oxygen to the blood. As Dakota's lungs grew healthier, he was able to receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), moving him closer to a heart transplant. \"It was touch-and-go for a whole month, \" says his mother, Jennifer Case. Jennifer and her husband, Chuck, who live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, left their home and business that summer so that they could be with Dakota during that tenuous time. The following spring, Dakota's condition deteriorated again. This time he would be hospitalized until he received a heart transplant. Again, Jennifer had to leave her home and family business so that she could stay with Dakota during that three- month period before and after the heart transplant. None of this would have been possible without the help of the Nebraska Medicine Patient Assistance Fund, says Jennifer.

Angie Rakes, MD, pain specialist One of the biggest mistakes people make when it comes to pain is they wait too long to seek help. The longer you wait for treatment, the more difficult it becomes to treat pain, as this allows the body to generate a map to pain that is difficult to break. If your pain continues longer than three months after you've worked with your primary care doctor and tried conservative measures, such as ice, stretching, anti-inflammatories and physical therapy, you may want to consider seeing a pain specialist. Our team uses a comprehensive approach to treating all types of chronic pain that attacks the pain from many fronts and uses some of the most cutting-edge medical therapies and surgical techniques. This may include medications, nerve blocks, steroid injections, ablation, spinal cord stimulators, Botox or acupuncture. You don't have to live with chronic pain. Chronic pain that is not treated successfully can become physically disabling and lead to depression, anxiety, loss of sleep, missed workdays and decreased physical functioning.
