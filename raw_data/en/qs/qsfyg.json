[Research](#fs-panel-28957) Major Research Interests: -Synuclein and Parkinson's trafficking a-Synuclein and Parkinson's disease The WITT group uses several organisms (yeast, mice and human cells) to study the mechanism of toxicity of the human Parkinson's disease-associated protein a-synuclein (a-syn). a-Syn is an intrinsically unfolded protein of unknown function that is the main protein component of Lewy bodies, which are proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions in dopamine-producing neurons in individuals who suffer from PD. High expression levels of a-syn or posttranslational modifications of the protein are thought to convert a-syn from a non-toxic protein into a toxic one. There is increasing evidence that the toxic conformation of a-syn is a prion: it acts as a template or seed that converts non-infectious a-syn monomers into infectious oligomers. Examples of ongoing projects (1) a-Syn intracellular lipid through the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus on route to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. In neurons, a-syn is thought to promote the fusion of presynaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. We have found that the trafficking of a-syn through the ER is exquisitely sensitive to the level of certain cellular phospholipids, and we are investigating how changes in phospholipid homeostasis alter, and in some cases blocks, a-syn transit through the ER. This work has implications to the mechanism of Lewy body formation. Figure 1 below shows how a-syn aggregates form in yeast cells that lack the mitochondrial enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd1/PSD1). The role of this ancient enzyme vis-\u00e0-vis a-syn solubility/toxicity is an intense area of our focus. (2) a-Syn, iron homeostasis, retromer: Many studies over the last 10 years have found a link between a-syn and iron homeostasis. Red blood cells contain relatively high levels of a-syn as well as neurons. Because many of the genes involved in iron homeostasis in human cells are also found in yeast, we are using yeast to investigate the connection between a disruption of cellular iron homeostasis and a-syn toxicity. The findings from yeast are being tested in worms and human cells. Figure 2 below shows how a-syn inhibits the Snx3-retromer-mediated recycling of Ftr1-Fet3. In yeast, Ftr1-Fet3 is a complex that imports iron into cells. The human orthologs of Fet3 are hephestin and ceruloplasmin. (3) Inhibitors of a-syn amyloid fiber formation: We have developed a unique method to predict the sequences of short peptides that can inhibit the fibrillization of a-syn. This is a very active area of research in the Witt lab. We have filed a patent disclosure on one of our peptide inhibitors and are actively identifying and characterizing even more potent inhibitors. (4) a-Syn and melanoma: It is curious that individuals with melanoma (who live) have a 2-fold higher risk of being afflicted with PD than age-matched healthy controls. And it works the other way, that is, individuals with PD have a significantly higher risk of developing melanoma than age-matched individuals without PD. Melanocytes, like dopaminergic neurons, express -syn. Melanocytes, like dopaminergic neurons, synthesize a pigment (melanin). Some of the most aggressive melanomas also express very high levels of -syn, as if somehow -syn promotes growth. To probe the function of -syn in melanoma, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout SNCA, the gene that codes for -syn, in SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells. The SNCA-knockout (KO) clones in culture exhibited a decrease in the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), an increase in ferritin, an increase of reactive oxygen species and proliferated slower than control cells. These SNCA-KO clones grafted into SCID mice grew significantly slower than the SK-Mel-28 control cells that expressed -syn. In metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1) increased threefold, and the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN1) decreased twofold relative to control xenografts. The excised SNCA-KO tumors exhibited significantly more ferric iron and TUNEL staining relative to the control melanoma xenografts. Collectively, depletion of -syn in SK-Mel-28 cells dysregulates cellular iron metabolism, especially in xenografts, yielding melanoma cells that are deficient in TfR1 and FPN1, that accumulate ferric iron and ferritin, and that undergo apoptosis relative to control cells expressing -syn. Our model for the dysregulation of iron metabolic proteins in SNCA-KO melanoma cells is shown below (Fig. 3).

[Team](#fs-panel-28961) Nirjhar earned his MBBS (equivalent to MD in US) from Rajshahi Medical College, Bangladesh, which is one of the leading medical schools in Bangladesh. In his medical career, he practiced as a family physician and as an instructor of Anatomy and Microbiology. Later, he joined a residency program in Cardiovascular and thoracic surgery, where he was doing well. But his strong passion for basic science encouraged him to pursue a career of a physician-scientist and he joined the PhD program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at LSUHS. Nirjhar's dissertation research is focused on understanding the role of the Parkinson's disease-associated protein alpha-synuclein in trafficking of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The central hypothesis of his project is that alpha-synuclein promotes melanoma-metastasis by modulating the trafficking of MVBs and controlling the release of extracellular vesicles. This project has the potential to pave the way for new research in areas of cancer biology.
