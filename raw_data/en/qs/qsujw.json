I have come to rely on them for healings of every kind, spiritual, emotional, and physical, and the spiritual growth they have made possible. It is a profound blessing to join with others in spiritual community to enjoy the blessing and healing current of the Entities of Light.\" ~ K.R., San Rafael, CA When I was twenty-six, I was bitten by a tick while vacationing with my community of nuns. My health went steadily downhill after that. It wasn't until thirty-nine years later, after many efforts to find the source of my illness, that I was finally diagnosed with Lyme disease and three co-infections. In a quest to improve my health, I went on a spiritual retreat in a sacred area. As soon as my feet touched the ground after getting out of the taxi, I literally felt the symptoms of Lyme disease being sucked out of the bottom of my feet and into the crystal bedrock below. I was filled with a new sense of energy and well-being. This feeling continued to grow stronger every day during the six weeks I spent there. After my miraculous healing, I was invited by the Spiritual Guides and Doctors connected to that land to bring groups there. Year after year, I witnessed countless miracles and deep healing for those who traveled with me on these healing journeys. In 2012, these same Spiritual Beings of Light requested that I start a meditation group which is how the Spiritual Healing Meditation began. These Light Beings promised they would come to support the healing journeys of all who attended, and they still come to this day. The foundation for my healing process was my trust and faith in God. These experiences only happened because I desired to walk deeper with God, which meant I desired to know myself and understand what I needed to change in myself to be more aware of my Oneness with the Divine. From that space I now know that we are all One and there is no real separation from God. We are all Creator's unique masterpieces, whole and holy. \"I am grateful to be able to enjoy the shower of Grace that occurs at the monthly Spiritual Healing Meditation Group. Being a skeptic, I initially doubted that any help or healing could be offered by benign spiritual beings. Happily, I was surprised and humbled as my life in faith discovered a new grounding. The guidance bestowed during these meditations has helped to illumine my spiritual path.\" ~ Craig Rippens, San Rafael, CA "}
