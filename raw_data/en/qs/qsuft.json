Implementation of the Fifth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2001-2005) Macroeconomic Achievements : During the five-year period 2001-05, the Lao economy maintained rapid and sustained expansion with GDP growing at about 6.24 percent per annum, which is an increase of a bout 0.3 percentage point over th e average growth rate of the previous five-year period (1996-2000). The total (public and private) investment mobilized rose significantly from 21.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to about 29 percent in 2005, and averaged at 27.8 percent for the five-year period. However, budget revenue mobilization remained at around 13.6 percent of GDP. The m onetary balance was positive and improved significantly; which contri buted to the control an d reduction of inflati on and the stabilization of the exchange rate for the Kip. The aggregate valu e of exports over 2001-2005 was estimated at USD 1.83 billion, ach ieving an average growth rate of 7 percent per year. The total value of imports over th e five-year period amounted to USD 2.86 billion with an average annual increase of 4.9 percent. The ratio of the trade deficit to GDP declined from 11.1 percent in 2001 to 8 perc ent in 2005. The ODA disbursements shown in the budget totalled USD 935 million, averaging at USD 187 million per year. The Lao PDR received 585 FDI projects with a total co mmitted capital of USD 2.8 billion, and USD 1.07 billion in disbursements during the period. About 505,000 ne w jobs were created in the five-year period surpassing the target of 500,000 jobs. Sectoral Performance : The economic sectors have undergon e significant restructuring. This restructuring has been concentrated on produc tion capacities, quality and efficiency, thus contributing to economic growth and meeting the initial requirements for international integration. The Government has concentrated on the developm ent of agricultural production, to reorient the agriculture sector from se mi-subsistence and subsistence to commercial production to ensure the enhanced supply of raw materials to the processing industries, meeting the growing domestic requirements for agricultural products, an d rapidly expanding agricultural exports. Consequent ly, the value of production in the agriculture sector has increased on average by 3.4 percent per year. In dustrial production has grown at a steady and rapid pace, with the sector-w ide average growth reaching 11.3 percent per year. In the industrial sector, several signi ficant activities have been implemented during the five-year period, a number of industrial zones were established and there has been a general increase in the number of new factories and companies cr eated. The services sector has taken positive steps forward to better meet the requirement s of production, trading and daily life of the citizens. Over the five-year period 2001-2005, the gr owth in services averaged at 6.7 percent per year. Social Development : Advances have been made in de veloping the country's education and health care systems; increasing the quantity an d quality of education facilities, and improving literacy rates; and expanding a nd improving primary health care and lowering mortality rates. The infrastructure has been further develope d; improving people's acce ss to basic services and connecting more rural areas to urban centres. The countr y maintained a low prevalence Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 2rate of HIV/AIDS; and recently reached its goal of eliminating opium cultivation. The poverty reduction initiatives were implemented aggressively in the localities (provinces, districts and villages) with the participation of the poor people, especially in some of the poorest districts and about 137,500 poor families graduated from poverty. Lessons Learned : Based on the actual conditions of completed and ongoing activities during the five-year period 2001-2005, a number of lessons have been learned, including the following. There is a need for increased focu s on the implementation of the restructuring policy, with the decisions expeditiously transl ated into detailed, complete and consistent programmes. Regulations, policy guidelines and laws have to be fully enforced. More decentralization has to take place. A sound unde rstanding of and commitment to sustainable development and proper approach es to achieve it are require d. The sustainable development must align economic growth with social and cultural development, social equity, environmental conservation, overall human deve lopment and democracy. Domestic resource mobilization has to be increased. It is necessa ry to further develop human capacities and the resources of the multi-ethnic people to efficien tly exploit and utilise the country's natural resources; ensure the protection of private pr operty rights and develop a supportive enabling environment for business. It is necessary to promote further ec onomic restructuring, accompanied by the development of the domestic market. International integration and the opening of the external market, whilst reta ining ownership, are requisite objectives. Continued reform of the public administration, including central and local organisations and the civil service, consistent with the country's socio-economic development level is essential. Part II. SIXTH NATIONAL SO CIO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2006-2010) Overall Development Strategy The Sixth National Socio Economic Developmen t Plan (2006-2010) plays a crucial role in achieving the overall targets outl ined in the Ten-Year Socio- Economic Development Strategy (2001-2010) approved by the 7th Party Congress (2001) and the directions set by the 8th Party Congress (2006). The overall directions for the Sixth Plan include transforming the multi-sectoral economy from uneven performance to fast and stable development within the market mechanism guided by the State. It will require the mobiliza tion of all resources including a renewed drive for mobilization of mo re internal resources to take full advantage of the opportunities. The main focus areas ar e: promoting economic development, with human development as a key vehicle; increasi ng competitiveness and utilizing comparative advantages to implement effectively interna tional economic commitments in the framework of the ASEAN and other bilateral and multilateral commitments, including WTO; and strengthening the positive linkages between ec onomic growth and social development, in addressing social issues such as poverty and other social evils, and help keep the socio- political situation stable. The indicators and targ ets for the Plan coincide with most of those for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries (2001-2010). Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 3Economic Balance : The basic principles of the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) and the fundamental economic balance are based on the development gui delines identified by the resolution of the 7th Party congress in the Ten-Year Socio- Economic Development Strategy (2001-2010); the expectation of capabilities of development ac tivities in the Sixth Plan (2006-2010); the various abundant development potentials that can be exploited and utilised to support economic balance in the future; and economic integration and globalisation. The annual average growth rate of GDP should reach 7.5- 8 percent, with agri culture and forestry increasing by 3-3.4 percent, industry by 13-14 percent and services by 7.5-8 percent. By 2010, the agricultural sector is projected to account for a bout 36 percent of GDP, with industry about 36.4 percent and se rvices about 27.6 percent. Th e GDP per capita is projected to reach USD 827. Labour and Employment Balance : Various measures will be implemented to upgrade the quality and productivity of the labour force. By 2010, approximately 3,366,000 people will be able to have access to employment opportunitie s. It is expected that in the period 2006- 2010, the number of people who need employme nt (new entrants) will be 1,217 million and that the new employment opportunities will be able to meet the demand of 652,000 people. The sectoral share of employment of the agriculture and forestry sector will drop to 73.9 percent in 2010, while that of industry and handi crafts sector will increase to 9.3 percent and of service sector to 16.9 percent. The unemplo yment rate will reduce to 3.8 percent in 2010. The focus will be on providing additional em ployment and developing human resources, particularly developing professional skills for the industrial s ector. The export of labour will be supported, with a target of about 5,000 workers working abroad each year. A policy on the use of foreign labour will be form ulated to attract people with professional skills that are not available in the Lao PDR. The Labour Code will be improved to ensure the balance of benefits for both employees and employers. Investment Balance : In order to ensure the economic growth of 7.5-8 percent, a total investment of 73.9 thousand billi on Kip is projected to be requi red to support the Sixth Plan (2006-2010), which is equivalent to about 32 percent of GDP. The investment would increase at about 19.3 percent per year, from 29 percen t of GDP in 2005 to 34.3 percent in 2010. Of the total, about 23.1 thousand billion Kip would come from the Government budget accounting for 31.25 percent of the total investment in the society. The investment from the private sector, both domestic and external, would cover the remaining 50.8 thousand billion Kip accounting for 68.75 percent of total investme nt. The ODA is projected to average at about USD 357 million per year over the five -year period 2006-2010; with about USD 600 million of foreign direct investment (FDI) will be mobilized each year. The sectoral shares of investment are projected at 16 percent for the ag riculture sector, and 42 percent each for the industry and services sectors. Budget Balance : The overall objective is to imple ment a policy of sound State Budget striving for higher revenues a nd prudent expenditures. The to tal expected budget revenue of the state for the five years will reach approximately 34,600 billion kip, growing at 19.9 percent per year on av erage. The state budget re venue collection is expe cted to increase from 14 percent of GDP in 2005 to 16.2 percent in 2010, or on average at 14.8 percent of GDP over the five-year period. The budget revenue collection performance will be increased and budget expenditures will be allocated more appropr iately. The total expenditure for the five-Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 4year period will be about 49,600 billion kip (21.4 percent of GDP), growing at 17.8 percent per year. The budget deficit over the Sixth Plan period will be about 15,000 billion kip or 6.07 percent of GDP. The budget deficit will d ecrease gradually from 7.3 percent in 2004 to 5.8 percent in 2010 and will be financed mainly through foreign concessionary loans and the mobilization of domestic investments to a certain extent. The State Budget Law will be amended. Export-Import Balance : The objectives are to develop the export of high value-added products with a stable growth rate, whilst re ducing the amount of raw materials exported. The total exports in the five year s would reach USD 3.48 billion, w ith an annual average growth rate of 18.1 percent. New tec hnologies and skilled labour are required to upgrade the quality and quantity of exports. One of the main objectives is the expansion a nd diversification of markets, while strengthening the present position in existing markets. On the imports side, the guiding principle is to prioriti ze imports of materials and equi pment for industrialization to enhance the competitiveness of locally produced commodities in the domestic market. The import turn-over in the five year period is es timated to be USD 4.5 billion, increasing on average at 8.8 percent per annum. In 2010 the imports should reach USD 1,045 million. The trade deficit in the five-year period 2006-2010 is projected to be about USD 1.02 billion, which is equivalent to 29.3 percent of tota l export turn-over, or 5 percent of GDP. Monetary Balance: The overall objective of monetary policy in the five-year period 2006- 2010 is to control inflation and keep it below 7 pe rcent per annum; and to ensure the safety of the banking and credit organiza tions, in order to stabilize th e investment environment and strengthen economic development. The rate of inflation will average at about 6-6.5 percent per year. Money supply and open market opera tions will be regulated to smooth out unduly large fluctuations in the Baht and the US Do llar flows. The capabilit ies of the BOL will be improved and the BOL will establish Units in ch arge of managing available capital in order to define and assess market demand, and adjust the purchase of fixed duration bonds and Government bills. The Government will issu e relevant regulations to utilize capital replenishment tools, which will help supplement the other tools such as the key interest rates of BOL. The overuse of the US Dollar in the economy will be limited and foreign exchange will be controlled to accumulate more foreign re serves. The confidence in the Kip is growing, as the Kip remains relatively stable. Higher denomination Ki p notes (50,000 and 100,000) will be issued. The target is to decrease the share of foreign currency in the total money supply from 65 percent in 2005 to 30 percent in 2010. Role of the State in the Market Economy: In the five-year period 2006-2010, it is necessary to ensure that the Government agencies effectively implement the tasks, including the promotion of the market econom y. The Government's role is to strengthen the effective coordination between the market economic mechanisms and the macroeconomic management. This is to be done through the pr ocess of reform and improvement of concerned sectors such as taxes, banking and the promotion of investment, to facilitate the promotion of the market's role. The socialist state, th rough the role of m acro management, should effectively use the economic t ools and coordinate with the management and legal tools, especially the tools for pr ioritization of the national planning and programming, the formulation of mid-term and long-term devel opment strategies, and the development of the Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 5growth potential of the economic system, in or der to guide the develo pment of the market economy. The economic laws should be firmly enforced ensuring transparency. Thematic and Cross-Cutting Areas Poverty Reduction : The various indicators have all shown commendable results on poverty reduction since 1990. The impressive declining trend in poverty incidence, if continued, would enable the country to achieve the M DG target of reducing the proportion of people below the poverty line by half by 2015. The G overnment is committed to poverty eradication and the promotion of equity among different groups of the Lao multi-ethnic population. The overall strategy is to assist the poor to help th emselves to fully utilise their labour and other modest resources, improve their situation and exit poverty. The Government will help enlarge the economic opportunities, enable the provision of basic social and essential economic services, ensure security and facilitate the participation and empowe rment of the poor in economic, social, political and ot her arenas to reduce poverty on a sustai nable basis. Proposed initiatives within the Plan incl ude the rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure, the development of agricultura l production and SMEs, the extension of credit to the poor, and the provision and effective use of basic social services . Additionally, it is important to provide a secure environment by ensuring the security of people and property against violence, destructi on, theft and unexploded ordnance (UXO), food insecurity and protection against unforeseen calamiti es such as natural disasters. Also, targeted interventions are to be implemented in the 47 poorest and 25 poor districts to achieve more rapid reduction in poverty. Decentralisati on and the two-way flow of informa tion will be enhanced, to enable the poor to actively participate. Poverty Focussed National Programmes ; The Lao PDR has maintained a low prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS as compared to that in the neighbouring c ountries by raising awareness and monitoring the situation. The National Stra tegy and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/STI for 2006- 2010 have been formulated, with the goal of ma intaining this low prevalence. The Lao PDR has recently reached its goal of eliminating op ium cultivation in the country, with the number of opium addicts also being reduced by a third. The national strategy for the post-opium scenario is being put into ac tion to sustain opium eradicati on, provide alternative livelihoods, cease drug trafficking, rehabilitate addicts, and increase awareness of the negative effects of drug addiction. The UXO contamination poses an ongoing development challenge to the Lao PDR. Community education, victim assistance and UXO survey and clearance operations are priority activities for the Government. The foundations of the \"National Regulatory Authority\" (NRA) for the UXO sector in the Lao PDR were established and the Authority has begun to function effectively. Gender Equality : The Government is taking concrete st eps to achieve gender equality in all spheres by: supporting poor women's economic ac tivities; improving their access to basic services such as education and health, and pr oductive resources, such as extension services; involving them in local decision-making; and generally increasing their involvement and taking their needs into account in developing po licies and plans. It is planned that all ministries will develop strategies and action pl ans to promote gender equality at national, provincial, district and village levels. More training will be provided to promote the role of women in the agricultural and business sectors and their access to credit will be improved. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 6Women's legal awareness and access to justice will be improved and the number of women in leadership positions is being increased. Governance : The Government intends to build an e ffective and ethical public service, to ensure that all Lao people can fully enjoy th eir constitutional rights by being educated and well informed, to establish a credible legal framework and to have accountable and transparent financial management practices . The governance programme aims to improve four main areas: public service improvement, pe ople's participation, rule of law and sound financial management. The capacities and ethics of civil servants will be further upgraded, along with systems such as the intranet, and working conditions. It is important that the public's confidence in and knowledge of the legal system and access to it is increased. Additionally, accountable and transparent financ ial management practices are necessary to achieve macro-economic stability. The Governme nt plans to make the budgetary framework more supportive of private sector growth and investment. Natural Resources and the Environment : The rich natural resource s of the Lao PDR play a vital role in the country's socio-economic developm ent. It is therefore important that they are protected and exploited in a sustainable manner. The Government plans to prepare and implement the national strategic plan on the environment. This entails improving environmental management, plans, policies an d laws; increasing environmental education and awareness; establishing mechanisms and promoting invest ment; and improving international coordination and cooperation. Mo re surveys and information need to be collected to further assess the situation and to develop relevant plans and policies. Industries will have to reduce and minimize pollution. Private Sector Development : A more favourable environment for the promotion of the private sector and the attracti on of FDI will be created by primarily improving the legal system and maintaining socio-economic stability . Additionally, existing regulations, laws and procedures will be modified and the administra tive application system for business activities of enterprises will be reformed to acceler ate the process of setting up a business. A favourable environment will be created to attr act FDI by accelerating investment procedures and developing a technically educated workforce. The policies on investment priorities will be reviewed including the re gulations on granting investme nt permits especially land acquisition fees, transport and teleco mmunications service charges. Science and Technology : The Government aims to create a technologically advanced nation with a highly skilled workforce. Upgrading the science and technology sector will reduce disparities between the Lao PD R and other countries in the region and facilitate economic integration. Importance is to be given to research in basic sciences for technological development, the exploitation of natural res ources and the protection of the environment. Scientific and technological research and teachin g will be upgraded along with the facilities, laboratories and equipment. There will be dissemination of basic information about intellectual property rights and copyright registration for people and organisations to register their science-technology products for industrial (p atent) rights. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 7Sectoral and Regional Development The sector-specific development guidelines fo r the five-year period 2006-2010 will be to develop sectors and regions aiming to strengt hen the nation's advantages and ability to compete in the international arena, by develo ping and utilising the country's natural and human resources. Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries : The vision is to transform the agriculture sector into a thriving sector based on innovative technol ogies and practices in high value-added production and processing, cateri ng to domestic and world mark ets. The rural economies will be diversified and farming methods and infra structure upgraded. A detailed development structure will be established for prioritised pl ants and domestic animals in the direction of large-scale production. The Ministry of Agricultu re and Forestry (MAF) will implement four strategic programmes on the sust ainable use of natural res ources, land allocation, food security, support services and others. The Government will actively seek and promote markets in order to improve the sale conditions for farm products. Significant changes will be made in the management and exploitation of forestry products through limiting logging and planting forests for economic a nd protection purposes. The Gove rnment will continue to invest in the introduction and breeding of high value aquatic products. Rural Development: The vision is to reduce the dispar ities between rural areas and urban centres by enhancing the transport and commu nications networks and improving the living conditions of the rural people, especially thos e in remote areas. The overall strategy is to create employment, increase incomes and rest ructure the rural economies. The Government will support the development of small-scale indust ries. Industrial centres in the three regions will be developed. Investments will be made in the development of the border economic zones to provide services for import-export, t ourism and border transpor t. The largest health programme in the next five years is the ex pansion of the rural health service network. Additionally, the education of the rural popu lation will be improved by increasing access to quality education. Education : The education system will be strengthened as the cornerstone of a human resources development strategy focussed increasing labour productivity. In order to improve the education of the whole population, it is nece ssary to concentrate on equitable access, quality, relevance and management of the educa tion system. It will implement the principle of compulsory primary education and the deve lopment of education at all levels, paying particular attention to the ethnic areas and the disadvantaged groups. The Education for All programme will be the main vehicle for increasing primary and lower secondary school participation and completion and reducing adult illiteracy. In the fi ve-year period 2006-2010, it is hoped that illiteracy will be completely abolished and that peoples' access to and attendance at quality primary, secondary, vocati onal and tertiary schools and universities will increase. More schools will be upgraded, constructed, and supplied with appropriate equipment and qualified teachers. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 8Health : The main objectives in improving the health status of the population of the Lao PDR are to reduce urban-rural health differentials, lower mother and child mortality rates, raise life expectancy and reduce the spread of commu nicable diseases. Prevention and increased treatment are the key methods in the health sector to achieve these objectives . Most of the priority programmes in the health sector ar e focussed on primary health care covering both preventive and curative aspects. People will be taught how to lead more hygienic lifestyles and encouraged to get vaccinated and seek hosp ital/clinic treatment when sick. The number of health centres and properly qu alified medical staff will be in creased as well as the quantity and quality of equipment and medicines. Access to the health service that is fair and equal will be increased. Industry and Minerals : The orientation of industrial deve lopment in the five-year period 2006-2010 is to give priority to developing the electricity and processi ng industries catering to domestic consumption and exports; while continuing to promote mining, and developing selectively some industries se rving agricultural and rural ec onomic development. Attempts will be made to bring new power stations into operation to boost the electricity exports and to meet the needs of domestic production and cons umption. Investment in mining and regional industries will be encouraged. The idea is to concentrate investment in innovative technologies, modernising the manufacturing foundations, reducing im ports, and gradually increasing exports. The distribut ion modes of some products will be improved to increase the transaction ability and commodity circulation. Infrastructure : The objective for infrastructure is to continue to maintain, improve and develop the socio-economic infrastructure with focus on such areas as inland, international, river and air transport; telecommunications; school s; and health centres to create favourable conditions for development. The necessary infras tructure will be provided to allow people in all parts of the country to easily participate in development activitie s and interact with businesses and markets outside th e country. Integrated inland infr astructure will be further developed, with particular emphasis on major roads. New airports will be built and the current ones upgraded. A number of river r outes and main river port systems will be improved and constructed. The construction of a railway system will commence. The distribution of sanitised water to the populati on and irrigation systems will be increased. Services including Tourism : In the five-year period 200 6-2010, the quality of service activities will be upgraded to meet the dema nds of production, consumption and exports, contributing to economic growth, the expansion of employment and the improvement of the people's welfare. The Government will concentrate on developing services with a quick turnover of capital and those th at generate sufficient revenues to the state budget. It will promote the effective and convenient exchange and flow of commodities in and outside the country. The human capacities and infrastructu re of basic necessary services such as information and telecommunication systems, tran sport, trade, and banking will be upgraded. More sports facilities will be made available to athletes, which coincide with the preparations for the 25th SEA Games. Regional Development : The long-term vision is to achieve balance between the three regions and among provinces within the re gions, building upon the natural and human resources in each area. The Government aims to address the disparities among and within Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 9regions through mobilising funds from all econom ic sectors and direct ing the funds for each region and the local authorities to follow-up on these. The potentials of each region in areas such as agriculture, forestry, hydropower, mining and tourism will be utilised in developing the regions equitably and boosting economic growth. The Government will continue investing in socio-economic infrastructu re, expanding the produc tion of goods, providing health and education facilities fo r the people and reducing poverty. Part III. IMPLEMEN TATION MEASURES A ND MONITORING AND EVALUATION ARRANGEMENTS Implementation Measures : The implementation measures for the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) are formulated within the fram ework of the Ten-Year Socio- Economic Development Strategy (2001-2010). The focus will be on the mechanis ms supporting monetary stability, sound management of finances, production of impr oved quality commodities, and effectively strengthening the economic structures. The Go vernment will consistently manage the multi- sectoral market economy with a socialist orient ation, establishing differe nt types of markets, creating favourable conditions for enterprises and people to do business, and improving the environment for investment attraction. The G overnment will formulate an action programme to fully utilize expertise a nd knowledge of the Party, all the people, and all Government Officials to fully achieve the set targets and missions of the Si xth Plan. The public administration will be reformed and upgraded, enhancing abilities to implement the Sixth Plan fully. The Lao PDR will look to other more developed countries, particularly those in the region, to learn from their experiences. The State policies will be implemented in a transparent manner with the aim to increase income and effectively utilize the budget by lowering expenditure. In coordina tion with the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL), the Committee for Planning and Investment (CPI) will lead and facilitate the conditions for growth in production and foreig n direct investment; and the improvement of financial management. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements : All levels of the Government from the centre to the localities have been and are involved in the monitoring and evaluation process. Monitoring can be seen at tw o broad levels: (i) implementa tion monitoring carried out by CPI, and (ii) impact monitoring undertaken by the National Statistics Centre (NSC). An important purpose of monitoring implementation is to utilise the information to improve future implementation. Information compiled on implementing entities should be used through appropriate assistance fr om the stakeholders to overco me constraints. The CPI is responsible for the coordination and form ulation of the National Socio Economic Development Plans (NSEDPs) and the P ublic Investment Programmes (PIPs). The Department of General Planning (DGP) in CPI has been coordi nating the activities among the ministries and sector s to prepare the m onthly, periodic and annual progress reports on the implementation of the Plan. Albeit the qua lity of the information provided is often incomplete due to limited capacities and inadequate communications systems. The Government is taking steps to build upon the existing system, at the CPI, in the line ministries, agencies and the localities. The results of the exercise will feed into the Monitoring and Evaluation System for the Sixth Plan (2006-2010). The NSC has begun to take steps to establish a uniform and consis tent national database on economic, social and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 10governance indicators. Many of these indica tors are incorporated in the LaoInfo 4.1. Simultaneously, work on the compilation of th e National Accounts usin g the 1993 Standard National Accounts (1993 SNA) system is continuing. The Government will create a strong statistical system to collect and provide the necessary information for the formulation of policies, strategies and plans, and monitor and assess progress and outcomes and impacts. Plan Formulation Process : The formulation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) commenced in February 2004, beginning with co nsultations with the localities on progress on implementation of the Fifth Pl an (2001-2005), and prio rities for the Sixth Plan. The central Ministries in the four priority sectors undert ook to cost the priority programmes in the NGPES (and the NSEDP) for the five-year period 2006-2010. The emerging priorities and suggestions formed the basis for preparation of the preliminary draft of the Sixth Plan. The Government shared the main ideas in the prelim inary draft with the partners in development, domestic and foreign private investors, Lao rese archers, mass organizatio ns and the localities. The feedback received was incorporated into the Plan. The four priority sector Ministries continued the work on the refinement of the costs for the priority programmes taking into account the focal area development programmes identified for the ten pilot districts. The results have been shared with the Central Committee of the Party in September 2005 and the National Assembly in October 2005. In January 2006, the draft Sixth Plan (work in progress) incorporating the guidance from the Party and the National Assembly and the feedback from the localities, was shared with the partners in development, domestic and foreig n private investors a nd Lao researchers and mass organizations; and discussed at the A nnual Round Table Process Information Meeting on 29 January 2006. Their feedback has been incorporated as appropriate. The revised draft has been considered and endor sed by the Party at the Eighth Congress in March 2006. The final draft of the Plan has been considered and approved by the Sixt h National Assembly at its inaugural session in June 2006. It is recognised that the planning work will continue to be upgraded and decentralised, and also more technical support will be provided. A monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be established for planning. The Sixth Plan will be disseminated nationwide to build the foundations for sector programmes. An informa tion system will be creat ed successfully to improve forecasting. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 11INTRODUCTION This Sixth Five-Year National Socio Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) document is organized in three parts. Part I provides an assessment of the implementation of the Fifth NSEDP (2001-2005). It covers the goals and targets of th e Fifth Plan, achievements, constraints and limitations, and lessons learned from implementation of the Fifth Plan. It forms a valuable backdrop for Part II, which presents the main elements of the Sixth NSEDP (2006-2010). Thus, Part II of the plan comprise s the overall developmen t strategy including the Plan targets; macro direc tions including macroeconomic polic ies, financial sector, fiscal management and SOEs; strategies for thema tic and cross-cutting areas including poverty reduction, governance and private sector deve lopment; and sectoral, rural and regional development strategies. Part III describes some of the main implementation actions; monitoring and evaluation a rrangements; the Plan formulation process; and the situation likely to prevail in 2010 . Some macroeconomic projections are provided in Annex 1 and the localized Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators and targets in Annex 2. A listing of some consultation steps followed in the formulation of the Plan is in Annex 3. PART I: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIFTH NATIONAL SOCIO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2001 - 2005) Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 13I. FIFTH PLAN GOALS AND TARGETS A. Context From mid-1997 to the end of 1999, the economy of the Lao PDR faced arduous difficulties, especially the significant negative impacts of the Asian Economic Crisis and recurring severe natural disasters. However, the Fifth Nati onal Socio Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) spanning the five-year period 2001-2005 was de veloped under more favourable conditions. The economy has begun to resume expansion and build up the potential for growing at a faster pace in the following years. Production forces and socio-economic elements have built the necessary initial base for future growth. The legal frameworks were gradually adjusted and their positive impacts on socio-economic development have been increased. The market-oriented economy emerged further and operated in a more efficient manner. Political and social stability were enhan ced. Relations with countries in the region and outside on economic and other fronts were expanded, with significant strengtheni ng of the capacity and standing of the Lao PDR in the region and th e global community. The developments outside the country also provided significantly favourable conditions. Stability and economic recovery in the Asian region and at the global le vel, scientific and technological innovations and globalization brought a bout many opportunities to overc ome the difficulties and obstacles. B. Goals and Targets 1. Goals The 7th Party Congress has set goals for th e Fifth Plan (2001-2005), which included the following: (i) ensuring social order and political stability; (ii) achievi ng rapid and sustainable economic growth; (iii) reducing the number of poor households at the beginning of the Plan by 50 percent by the end of the Plan; (iv) ensu ring complete and firm food security for the population; (v) providing appropriate alternativ es to shifting cultivation, the definitive eradication of opium cultivation, and encouragi ng sedentary agricultural activities; (vi) ensuring initial saving; (vii) st rengthening the organization and efficiency of enterprises, especially state-owned enterprise s; and (viii) developing skille d labour resources at different levels to serve the industriali zation and modernization process. 2. Targets These goals were further concretized by th e 7th Party Congress into the major socio- economic development targets that include the ones set out in Table I.1.

FIFTH PLAN ACHIEVEMENTS The regional and global contexts have evolved in line with the basic expectations outlined by the 7th Party Congress. The gl obal situation developed in a complex manner after the 11th September 2001 event in the United States, wh ich was followed by the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Terrorism and anti-terrorism became dominant issues, but peace and development cooperation remained major priorities at the international level. The global and regional economies have been recovering, with firm continuation of globali zation and increasing competition. Within Southeast Asia, SARS , Avian Flu, and floods and droughts have occurred. These developments have imposed severe difficulties on the Lao social and economic bases. Under the circumstances, the Party, the Government and the people of the Lao PDR have endeavoured to overcome the various constraints and obtain significant achievements. The results of implementation of the Fifth Plan (2001-200 5) in major sectors are discussed briefly in the following sections. A. Economic Growth During the five-year period 2001-2005, the La o economy has maintained rapid and sustainable growth. On averag e, the GDP grew at about 6. 24 percent per annum, which is about 0.3 percentage point higher than the average growth rate in the previous five-year period (1996-2000), but about 0.8 pe rcentage point lower than the Fifth Plan target. The growth rate failed to reach the target set by the Plan and the full potential of the economy was not utilized. However, it is heartening to note th at the growth rate achie ved is higher than that recorded in the previous Plan period (1996-2000). Useful to highlight the relative growth rates of: domestic private sector output; output from FDI enterp rises; and State output. This was possible in spite of the domestic and intern ational constraints, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the people, the Government and the Party. Furthermore, the average economic growth rate in the Lao PDR during the past fi ve years is among the hi ghest in the region (e.g. Cambodia: 4.2 percen t; and Vietnam: 7.5 percent). By 2005, the GDP per capita reached USD 491. B. Sectoral Performance All the economic sectors experi enced growth, which has been linked to structural changes and the enhancement of product quality. The s ectoral performance is presented in the following: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 171. Agriculture Sector During the past five years, the Government, line ministries, sect oral and local authorities of the Lao PDR have concentrated on the developm ent of agricultural pr oduction, following the direction set, i.e. orienting the agriculture se ctor from subsistence and semi-subsistence to commercial production to ensure the enhanced supply of raw materi als to processing industries, meeting the growi ng domestic requirements for ag ricultural products, and rapidly expanding agricultural exports. The compositi on of production and products has been restructured positively with increasing economic effectiveness. This therefore allowed a stable growth in the production of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, albeit under constrained development conditions. Over the last five year s, the value of production in the agriculture sector has increased on average by 3.4 percent per year. By 2005, the production of many crops increased si gnificantly compared to the last year of the fourth five-year Plan (2000). For example, maize (corn) producti on tripled to 372,560 mt as compared to that in 2000. Maize is grown largely in the Northern Provinces of Bokeo, Sayaboury, Houaphanh and Xiengkhouang and some Central Provinces. The production of coffee, concentrated in the Provinces of Ch ampasack, Saravane and Sekong, increased by 6 percent reaching 25,000 tons. Peanut productio n, largely in the Provinces of Sayaboury, Luang Prabang, Vientiane, Saravane and Champasack, doubled to 26,990 concentrated in the Provinces of Luang Prabang, Bokeo, Houaphanh and Champasak, also experienced a two-fold ease to 11,100 tons. The sesame plantation yielded 8,710 tons, up by 2.6 times, and was largely found in the Provinces of Luang Prabang, Sayaboury, Oudomsay, and Vientiane . The mung bean production was up by three times to 3,700 tons, and was concentrated in the Provinces of Luang Prabang, Vientiane, and Champasak. Tobacco of Borikhamsay, Khammouane, and Savannakhet provided a total harvest of 28,100 t ons. Sugar cane concentrated in Vientiane Capital and the Provinces of Luang Namtha, Phongsaly, and Borikhamsay, had a harvest of 196,100 tons. Vegetable production increased by 17 percent to 744,450 tons. Most noticeable is the plantations of vegetables , such as cabbage, Chinese cabbage , bananas, potatoes and ginger, on the Boloven Plateau for expor t. Having won popularit y, rubber trees are extensively planted in the Provinces Luang bein g grown in a number of Provinces, particularly ora nge plantations in Luang Pr abang, Sayaboury, Borikhamsay, Vientiane and Vientiane Capital. The move to commercial production is grow ing strongly in the high-potential areas. Prominent among these are the emphasis on the cultivation of rubber in Luang Namtha Province; cashew nuts in Oudomxay and Phongsaly Provinces; vegetables and fruit trees in Vientiane Province and Vientiane Ca pital; seeded-trees for oil extraction and sugarcane in Savannakhet Province; and rice in Vientiane Province. Emphasis is placed on research and the adoption of high-yield/high productivity crops and livestock. Currently, several ne w varieties have been introduced, such as rice, maize, vegetables, beans, coffee, tobacco, tea, fruit trees and a number of domestic animals. By 2005, the farming sector ensured 80 percent of the seed requirements for the rainy season Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 18crop and 100 percent for the dry season crop. Ma ny modern cultivation and animal raising techniques have been introduced. The number of irrigation schemes has cont inued to increase from 19,170 in 2000 to 24,695 by the end of 2004. Irrigated crop areas during th e dry season increased from 197,100 ha in 2000 to 215,000 ha in 2004, while th e irrigated area duri ng the rainy season increased from 296,000 ha to 315,000 ha. Due to the increase in ir rigation and the intr oduction of new crop varieties, rice yield increased from less than 3.06 mt per hectare in 2000 to 3.6 mt per hectare in 2005. Rice production reached 2.65 million mt in 2005, which translates to an average per capita availability of approxima tely 457 kilograms per capita. The livestock and fisheries sectors are developi ng quite rapidly mainly due to the industrial farming systems applied in many localities and because of increased market opportunities and reductions in marketing costs. In 2005, the lives tock numbers rose to 1.09 million buffalos (6 percent increase over 2000), 1.27 million cows ( 15.6 percent increase), 1.82 million pigs (28 percent increase), 19.8 million poultry (51 percen t increase), and 190,000 goats and sheep (56 percent increase). Thanks to such rapid development, meat production in 2005 was projected to reach 96,000 mt (an increase of 17.5 percent over 2000). It is notable that a bout 10.2 percent of the meat production is provided by industrial farms with hi gh technology, which grew at the rate of 9.8 percent in the 2003-2004 period. At the end of 2005, about 10 percent of the cattle and 20 percent of the poultry were raised in the commercial farms. More specificall y, the farms have focused on raising new high quality cattle and p oultry species, with high productivity in the production of swine, chicken, and ducks. Also, fish production rose to 143,000 mt (an in crease of 15 percent), with fish farms accounting for 68.5 percent of the total and ca pture fisheries accounting for the rest (31.5 percent). Fish fingerling production rose to 320 million, which was adequate to meet about 50 percent of the national demand. Fish farms have achieved high productivity in the production of fish raised in baskets. In 2005, both meat and fish production met a large part of the population's consumption demands. Forest conservation and development are given increased attention by line ministries and local authorities compared to the previous pl ans. The forestation movement by the people has regained momentum, especially in the central provinces, such as Vientiane, Borikhamxay, Khammuane and Savannakhet Provinces. More specifically, many areas have combined forestation with the development of high commerci al value industrial tree s, such as 2001 and 2005, about 325 tree nurseries were set up for the germination of tree saplings for afforestation and forest restoration. About 240,000 kg of tree seeds were used for the production of some 119 million tree sap lings. During 2001-2005, afforestation covered Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1991,000 ha, accounting for 91 percent of the target (target of 100,000 ha) while efforts were made on forest restoration on 481,000 ha. According to the data from the forest explor ation in 2002, the area of dense forest, which included forests of high and medium density wi th a canopy of over 20 percent, accounted for 41.5 percent (9,724,700 ha) of the country's to tal land surface. If the brushwood, bamboo forests, degraded forests, and mixed deciduous forests with a canopy of less than 20 percent were combined with the dense forests, the forestry coverage accoun ted for 72 percent (17 million hectares) of the country's land surface. The exploitation of perennial tr ees has reduced signifi cantly in the last five years. In 2001, about 300,000 cubic meters of natural trees were exploited, which declined to 150,000 cubic meters in 2005. Wood exploitati on is currently subject to mo re careful consideration, for example, combining exploitation with the plantation of alternative trees. In the past five years, over 1.09 million ha of arable land and 3.6 million ha of forestry land were allocated to 7,125 villages composed of 419,250 households, to reduce the practice of shifting cultivation while ensuring sedentary highland and lowland cultivation to reduce poverty among the ethnic people. As a result, the shifting cultivation area declined from 118,900 ha in 2001 to 29,400 ha in 2005, mainly in the Northern Provinces (26,800 ha) with the remainder in the Central Region (2,600 ha). Shifting cultivation has ceased completely in the Southern Provinces. The number of farm families practicing shifting cultivation has reduced from 174,036 in 2000 to 32,790 in 2005. The development of agricultura l and rural economies has begun to diversify. A large number of farms have been established and the pr oduction of traditional handicrafts has been resumed. The development of traditional handicrafts has generated additional jobs for the local people and contributed to the changes in the rural economic structure as well as the improvement of the population's living conditi ons. The government has removed barriers to private sector investment and trade in the agricultural sector . At the same time, it has increased the population's purchasing power and contributed to the eradic ation of poverty in rural areas. 2. Industry and Construction Sector Industrial production has grown at a steady and rapid rate, with the sector-wide average growth reaching 11.3 percent per year, exceedi ng the Plan target of 10-11 percent. The mining increased by 33.87 percent; fo otwear 7.57 per cent; and wood processing 1.17 percent. The se ctors receiving foreign inve stment have achieved an impressively rapid growth rate, followed by th e non-state sector, with the domestic private sector growing slowly. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 20In the past five years, the i ndustrial sector has implemented se veral significant activities, such as the exploitation of gold and copper at Sepon; zinc in Vientiane Provi nce; construction of a cement plant in Vangvieng and a steel factory in Vientiane; setting up of a number of motorcycle assembly plants; completion of the Nam Leuk and Nam Mang III hydropower plant and a number of other hydr opower projects, expansion of the installed capacity of the Nam Ngum 1 from 150 MW to 155 MW; completion of a number of high voltage transmission lines; and pilot installation of solar energy production systems. The total installed capacity of power plants by 2005 reached approxima tely 690 MW. The construction of some other major power plants/projects - as part of the five-year Plan has commenced, including the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project. Trade liberalisation, improvements in the enabling environment for business, and reduced logistics and transport costs contributed to increasing incentives for invest ment in industrial production. Most of the industrial products have achie ved higher growth rates compared to 2000, including coal, salt, beer, so ft drinks, tobacco, animal feed, soap, leather shoes, pharmaceutical drugs, plastic products, furniture, ready-made clothing, bricks, cement, manual agricultural instruments, and agricultural machinery. In particul ar, the operation of the Sepon gold mine in Vilabouly District, Sa vannakhet Province, started in 2003 with a production of approximately six mt each in 2003 and 2004, with a projected increase to 6.5 mt in 2005. The mining industry ha s developed rapidly, as illustrated by the investments by 90 companies in mining at the end of 2005, of which 34 are foreign, 56 domestic. The number of handicraft businesses in the country also increased rapi dly in the last five years, especially in Vientiane City and in a number of major ur ban centres. By 2005, there were 26,200 industrial-handicraft units (ris ing from 23,574 units in 2001). Currently, a number of industrial zones have been established in such places as Vientiane and Savannakhet. They include many standard to modern technology zones, attracting investment from many enterprises. The deve lopment of such industrial zones has helped to attract more foreign investment. Industrial development in certain areas and focal economic zones was firmly maintained. Areas with a high proporti on of industries, such as Luang Namtha, Xayaboury, and Savannakhet Provinces, maintained high growth rates. The participation of different economic sect ors (such as domestic and foreign private investors and the State) in the manufacturing i ndustries has facilitated its diversification in terms of manufacturing scale, level of technology, types and quality of products. The industries are thus able to meet the various demands of the market. The industrial sectors were responsible for creating the most jobs. 3. Services Sector The services sector has taken positive steps forward to better meet the requirements of production, trading and daily life. The availabilit y and quality of products and services is higher compared to the beginning of the period. Over the five-year period 2001-2005, the growth in total retail sales a nd revenues from services averag ed at 10 percent per year. The Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 21value added in the services sector grew at an average of 6.7 percent per year over the five years, which exceeds the GDP growth rate, although the growth rate is still less than the Plan target of 8-9 percent per year. A number of services have developed quite effectively, such as trade, transport, telecommunications, tourism, hotels and restau rants. More specifically, several services sectors essential for the development of new economic bases such as finance, banking and insurance have experienced strong growth. An increasing and more diversified number of enterprises are entering the trade and services markets. In 2003, about 61,200 enterprises were registered. Trade infrastructure has be en improved. By the end of 2003, there were 209 large markets, including 11 markets at internat ional border cross-poin ts and 28 markets at local border cross-points. The service sub-sectors are currently being restructured and moved towards the market mechanism under state guidance. The legal framework has clearly defined the direction for market operations. The Business Law, the Invest ment Law, and decrees relating to business operations within the country, export and price regulations, have been put in place with increasing efficiency. The central Government is currently continuing the process of decentralization in order to enhance local owners hip of the regulation of commerce, mainly in such areas as investment licensing, business licensing, issuing certificates of origin and export permits. The tourism sector has also developed ra pidly compared to the 1990s, despite the unfavourable international context during the fi rst three years including the Iraq War and the outbreak of SARS. Since 2004, with more favou rable domestic and international conditions, tourism has regained momentum and resumed strong development. Tourism infrastructure was quite efficiently improved, with the numbe r of hotels and guestho uses increasing from 468 in 2000 to 887 in 2003 and about 1,200 in 2005. The number of hotel rooms increased from 7,333 in 2000 to 20,000 in 2005. A number of new tours, including tours among countries in the Mekong Basi n, have been designed, intr oduced and are attracting a substantial number of international tourists. Th e different types of tourism are growing in a diversified manner, offering more attractive tourism products. By mid-2005, the country had 364 tourism sites to attract domestic and foreign tourists. In the five-year period 2001-2005, about four milli on foreign tourists vi sited the Lao PDR, averaging at about 800,000 tourists per ye ar, with 900,000 in 2004 and about 1.05 million in 2005. Overall, the total number of foreign tour ists to the Lao PDR over the five-year period 2001-2005 increased annually by 9 percent. Th e sector revenues reached over USD 100 million per year. The number of Tourists from wealthy regions and countries, such as the United States, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Ho lland, Norway, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and others is incr easing. Specifically, the proportion of tourists from the European countries increased from 11.7 percent in 2000 to 14.8 percent in 2003 and about 16.5 percent in 2005. The strong growth experienced by the tourism sector in recent years was supported by the Government's increasingly open tourism policy, which upholds tourism as one of the eight Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 22focal economic sectors to be de veloped in the five-year Plan . The Lao PDR has established tourism relationships with many countries around the world with a focus on ASEAN members and countries in the Mekong Sub- Region. By the end of 2005, entry visa requirements were lifted for tourists from se veral countries in the region. 13 land border crossing points were upgraded into internati onal border crossing points to welcome tourists and facilities provided for the issuance of visa s on arrival. Also, par ticipation in different events was ensured to attract tourism from different markets and a multitude of events relating to domestic and international tourism were organized in the Lao PDR. The country hosted an ASEAN Tourism Forum in 2004 (ATF 2004) in Vientiane Capital, which marked a cornerstone in the opening of a new era in t ourism in the Lao PDR. In 2006, Luang Prabang was awarded a gold medal as the most popular town in tourism through the voting by over 100 travel companies of the UK. The transport and freight services have shown quite positive and uniform development, with initial improvements to the quality of services, in spite of the severe impacts of the Iraq War and the SARS outbreak. The freight volume increas ed at an annual averag e rate of about 11 percent and circulation by 15 percent. The pa ssenger volume increased by about 7 percent per year and circulation by 5 percen t per year. In particular, the volume of trans-border shipping increased strongly at an average of over 20 pe rcent per year. The number of deaths due to road accidents was reduced significantly from 19 per 10,000 vehicles in 2001 to 10 in 2005. During the last five years, the transporta tion sector emphasized the implementation of different projects, including the maintenance of existing roads, bridges and the transportation system. Simultaneously, the construction of regi onal roads, national roads, a railway system, airports, bridges and a number of importa nt local roads has continued. Significant achievements include the completion of the cons truction or paving of many roads to ensure smooth year-round transport. A number of im portant projects includi ng new construction, improvement and upgrading of over 1,130 km of ro ads and 39 bridges wi th a total length of 2,611 metres were completed. The number of tran sportation services by land and river has increased by about 10-12 percent per year. At the same time, many ports were built and upgraded, especially along the routes of the Me kong River. The airport system was also built and upgraded, including the improvement of the Wattay International Airport and the upgrading of the Luang Prabang and Pakse airports to international standards. About 14 kilometres of the railway along the Friendship Br idge to Khamsavat village was surveyed and designed. Also, the survey and feasibility stud y of the railway project from Thakhek to Kiumuya was carried out. The telecommunications services have continuously develope d and reached both urban and rural centres, including in mountainous and re mote areas; with the quality of services significantly improved. The number of telephone users has increased, with the landline telephone subscribers reaching 87,500 and mob ile telephone use to 327,000 respectively, by the end of 2004/05. The number of public tele phone booths increased to 404. In general, telephone subscribers of all t ypes reached 415,900 with the aver age coverage of 7.3 lines per 100 people, which exceeded the Plan target of 2.5 lines per 100 people by 2005. There are 2,570 internet shops all ove r the country. By 2005, 80 percent of the districts and 60 percent of the communities will be contactable by tele phone. There will be around 130 post offices in 104 districts and about 23,247 public post boxes. Postal and tel ecommunications services are Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 23being provided to accelerate modernisation. Frei ght, mail and money order (transfer) services in country and internationally have increased at a moderate level. The finance, banking, insurance and other services have also continued to be established and expanded. The insurance market has been establ ished with the particip ation of both domestic and foreign actors. C. Other Macroeconomic Achievements 1. Investment The balance of development funding (investme nt) has steadily improved. The investment funds mobilized showed a rapid increase from 21.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to approximately 29 percent in 2005, and averaged at 27.8 percent for the five-yea r period. Total investment mobilized over the 2 001-2005 period reached 30,623 billion Kip (in current prices), exceeding the Plan target of 27,900 billion Kip. The total investment funds included 14,990 billion kip of state investment, 2,266 billion ki p of investment from the Lao society, and 13,367 billion kip of foreign investment. The proportion of public investment in total investment has decreased sharply from 63.8 percent in 2001 to 35.7 percent in 2005. The same pattern was reported in the Lao people's investment, which dropped from 14.2% to 4.4% during the pe riod. However, the ratio of foreign investment rose dramatically from 22% in 2001 to 59.9% in 2005. Over the five years, public investment accounted for 10.8% of GDP while domestic and foreign private investment accounted for 17% of GDP. During the five-year period (2001-2005), dome stic financing reached 7,571 billion kip, accounting for 27.6% of total investment. The Government budget and official development assistance (ODA) funds concentrat ed on important sectors with urgent requirements, such as agriculture and rural development, poverty eradication, human resources development (HRD), science and technology deve lopments and infrastructure development, in particular. The efforts made to mobilize foreign investment s resulted in positive achievements. The total value of FDI increased rapidly in recent year s, with the total re gistered FDI in 2004/05 expected to reach USD 1,500 million. This total includes some major projects, such as Nam Theun 2 and Sesaman 3 Hydropower projects. Ov er the last 20 years of restructuring (1986- 2005), about USD 8.5 billion of FDI was invested in 1,087 investment projects. The sectors attracting most investment include electricity, mining, agricultural development and services. The countries with the largest investments in the Lao PDR include Australia, Canada, Japan, France, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 242. National Budget Total revenues in the national budget over the five years are exp ected to reach 15,010 billion Kip, at an annual growth rate of 17.2 percent. Budget revenue m obilization tends to remain at the level of 13.6 percent of GDP. By 2005, revenue mobilization reached 14.6 percent of GDP, far below the previous five-year plan targ et of 18 percent of GDP. Government revenue targets were not met, which is one of the major shortcomings for th e last five-year plan. During the five-year period (2001-2005), the av erage fund mobilisation ratio in the state budget stood at 13.6% of GDP. Annual budget revenues increased ra pidly and steadily due to the various measures taken by the Government, including tax policies and meas ures to increase and promote investment, such as the reduction of income tax rates from four (3 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent and 15 percent) to three (3 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent); the reduction of the excise duty applied on tobacco production by 50 percent; and the increase in the income tax exemption threshold from 200,000 Kip per month to 300,000 Kip. Due to the changing structure, particularly the tax revenues collected on domestic production rose quickly and constituted the main part in the state budget revenue, rising from 63% of the total budget revenue in 2001 to 71.5% in 2005. Total budget expenditures over the five year period are expected to reach 22,830 billion Kip, at an average growth rate of 13 percent per year. It accounted for 21.3% of GDP overall and 19.7% in 2005. The proportion of development e xpenditure (investment) in total public expenditure remained at a high and stable leve l of about 49.5 percent. However, the domestic share in total public development expenditure (investment) accounts for only one-third and is decreasing, while the international share ac counts for two-thirds and is increasing. The state budget deficit in the past five years (2001-2005) re ached 7,820 billion kip, averaging around 7.4% of GDP annually, which was a fairly high rate. The deficit was covered mainly by external loans and grants, w ith domestic borrowings covering only a small part. 3. Monetary Management The monetary balance improved positively and si gnificantly and contributed to the control and reduction of inflation. The monetary policy and management has been strengthened during the Plan period. The money supply (bro ad money or M2) grew on average at 20 percent per year, while bank de posits increased by 19.2 percent per year. Both rates are close to the Plan targets. However, the credit (outstanding loans) expanded at a lower rate of 11.4 percent per year, which is far below the Plan target. The Kip's value has been gradually stabilized. The high inflation rate has been reduced. It averaged at 7.8 percent in 2001, 8.9 percent in 2002 and 15.5 percent in 2003. Thereafter, it Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 25showed a downward trend reaching 8 percent in 2004 and 7.7 percent in 2005. Over the five- year period, the inflation rate averaged at 9.6 percent per annum. Greater macro stability has been important in stimulating increased dom estic private investment to Lao PDR. The value of the local currency \"Kip\" was quite stable on both domestic and foreign fronts. The inflation threat was reduced gradually. The average rate of inflation in 2001 was 7.8%, which rose to 8.9% in 2002, further to 15.5% in 2003, but declined to 8% in 2004, and to 7.7% in 2005. The average rate of inflation during the five-year period was 9.6%. The exchange rate between the Lao Kip and th e US dollar increased annually at around 7%, although it increased by only 0.7% in 2004. In 2005, the loca l currency gained strength against the US dollar by 2%. The difference between the official and unofficial (market) rates of exchange was reduced to a quite narrow gap as compared to the early stage of the Plan implementation. Foreign currency reserves increased from 2.6 weeks of imports in 2001 to 12.8 weeks of imports in 2005, which laid a majo r foundation for the control of the exchange rate. D. Structural Changes The various sectors and markets of the economy continued to evolve in a positive direction facilitating the beginnin g of the process of exploitation of national comparative advantages. Some of the notable achievements of econom ic restructuring include the following: 1. Economic Sectors In the past five years, economic sectors have undergone signifi cant restructuring; the shares of industry and service sectors in GDP have increased. Economic restructuring has been more concentrated on production capacities, quality an d efficiency, thus c ontributing to economic growth and initially meeting the requirements for international inte gration. The share of agriculture in GDP decreased from 51.9 percen t in 2000 to 45.4 percent in 2005 as compared to the Plan target of 47 percent. The share of industry and construc tion sectors increased continuously from 22.4 percent in 2000 to 28.2 percent in 2005 against the Plan target of 26 percent. The share of services increased fr om 25.7 percent in 2000 to 26.4 percent in 2005 versus the Plan targ et of 27 percent. The structure of the agricultural economy continued to evolve pos itively, but its share in GDP declined continuously. The manufac turing industries developed in line with the potentials of each sector and each product by strengthening li nkages between production and markets. The share of processing industries in the sector -wide incremental value gradually increased. The processing industries initially ex ploited the potentials in raw materials in domestic production to increase the value added to exports. The structures of services sectors developed positively towards the direction of better meeting the in creasingly diversified n eeds in manufacturing, businesses and living conditions. Some services sectors, such as trade, transport, telecommunications, tourism, hotels and restau rants have been developing quite strongly. More specifically, a number of services showed a high value added ratio to production costs, Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 26such as banking and insurance, with initial gr owth contributing to in creased value added in the services sector and the proporti on of these sectors in the economy. 2. Private Sector The economic structure developed and changed in the state sector, whilst the potentials of the private sector were strengthened in each of the economic sectors. The shares of the domestic private sector and FDI in the economy have in creased. In particular, FDI has facilitated the production of new products and enlarged th e markets including through entry into new markets. Thus, the private sector has become increasingly important in the economy of the Lao PDR. 3. Employment From 2001 to 2005, about 505,000 new jobs were cr eated surpassing the target of 500,000 jobs. Of the total, 343,000 workers were in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors, 58,000 in the industry and construc tion sector, and 104,000 in the tr ade and services sectors. By 2005, the economy of the Lao PDR employed a total of 2,714,000 wo rkers allocated as follows: agriculture, forestry and fish eries sector employing 2,080,000 workers; 210,000 workers in the industry and construction sect or; and 424,000 workers in the services sector. The proportion of labourers enga ged in the sector of agricu lture, forestry and fisheries reduced from 78.6 percent in 2000 to 76.6 percent in 2005; while that in the industry and construction sectors increased from 6.9 percent to 7.7 percent; and in th e trade and services sectors increased from 14.5 per cent to 15.6 percent. However, the proportion of workers engaged in the agriculture, fore stry and fisheries sector rema ins quite high and further strong measures are required to reduce the proportion. The number of unsuccessful job hunters has reduced to 5 percent in 2005. E. Foreign Trade Foreign economic activities developed well. The Lao PDR has been more proactive in regional and global economic integration. It is important that the Lao Government work with potential domestic and foreign investors to ensure that Lao benefits from the liberalisation of trade in agriculture products under AFTA and various bilateral agreements. 1. Exports The aggregate value of exports over the five year s 2001-2005 is expected to reach USD 1.83 billion. Export growth rate averaged at about 7 percent per year, exceeding that achieved in the previous five-year period 1996-2000 (average of 1.6 percen t per year). However, the growth rate was lower than th e Plan target of 8.6 percent pe r year. The average value of Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 27exports per capita was USD 86.7 in 2005; it remains far lower than that in other countries in the region. Until now, a group of key export products have b een developed, including electricity, coffee, wood, handicrafts, garments and minerals, in addition to a number of new emerging products with potential such as tea, rubber, vegetables, fruits, oil plants, fragrant rice, corn, and many types of beans. The share of agriculture, fo restry and fishery produc ts in export revenues shows a decreasing trend. In contrast, the pr oportion of light indus try and small industry products in exports increased significan tly with garments ranking at the top. Conducive foreign policy has allowed the Lao PD R to gradually integrate into the regional and international economies and help to di versify its markets. From the period when traditional markets consisted of Thailand, Vietnam and China to the end of the Plan, exports are now destined to 40 markets, which include the larger markets such as the European Union, USA, Japan and Australia, the United Kingdom, France and Germ any. Border trade too has developed strongly. More prominen tly, during 2001-2005, many FDI enterprises have invested in export-oriented manufacturing activities. In 2005, export revenues reached approximate ly USD 456 million (USD 500 million was planned for 2005) of which agriculture and fore stry exports represented 10.2 percent, heavy industry (electricity, electronics, machinery, etc.) and minera ls covered 42.8 percent, with light industry and handicraft products accounting for the rest (47 percent). The exports accounted for 1.5 percent of GDP. 2. Imports The total value of imports over the past five years amounted to USD 2.86 billion with an average annual increase of 4.9 percent, exceeding that in 1996-2000. But, it remains lower than the Plan target of 8.6 percent per year. The value of imports per capita in 2005 was about USD 122.30. The composition of imports has changed in accordance with the capacity and requirements of the economy. More importantly , the proportion of rice and food products in imports declined significantly from 32.6 pe rcent in 2000 to 9.9 percent in 2002 and approximately 4 percent in 2003. By 2005, the value of imports is expected to reach approximately USD 595 million, with equipm ent, machinery and parts making up 39.2 percent; raw materials and fu el 47 percent; and consumpti on goods 13.8 percent. By 2005, imports accounted for 1.9 percent of GDP. 3. Trade Balance The trade balance (deficit) over the five years amounted to about USD 1.03 million, representing 57 percent of total exports, a nd the annual average trade deficit accounted for 9.4% of the GDP. Outstandingly, the ratio of the trade deficit to GDP fell from 11.1% in 2001 to 8% in 2005. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 28F. Official Development Assistance At the beginning of the new millennium, the gl obal official development assistance (ODA) resources seemed to show a declining trend due to economic difficulties in donor countries. Notwithstanding, ODA committed by donors to the La o PDR during the first four years of the Fifth Plan continued to be relatively stab le, but increased significantly in 2005 due largely to the approval of the projects associated with Nam Theun 2. This reflects the endorsement and support of the international partners of the socio-economic development policies set out by the Party and the Government. The ODA disbursements shown in the budget in the past five years totalled USD 935 million, averaging at USD 187 million per year. The counterpart contributions from the Government equalled USD 115 million. In general, the effectiveness of ODA showed an improving trend, with the implementation of ODA projects making a remarkable contribution to the socio- economic development of the country, but over reliance on ODA though is potentially dangerous. G. Foreign Direct Investment From 2001 to 2005, the Lao PDR has received 585 FDI projects with a total committed capital of USD 2.8 billion. But, only USD 1.07 b illion worth of funds were actually brought in (disbursed) during the peri od. The agriculture sector rece ived 14 percent of the total number of projects accounting for 7 percent of the total inve stment capital; the industry and construction sector received 48 percent of the projects and 79 percent of the investment capital; and the services sector received 38 percent of the projects and 14 percent of the investment capital. In particular in fiscal year (FY) 2004/05, a total of USD 1.3 billion of FDI projects were approved, with USD 449 million brought into the country during the year. In the five year period, FDI disbursements reached USD 933 million of which USD 326 million was received in 2005. Capital injected from abroad reached USD 855 million, accounting for 91.6 percent of the total. Disbursements in industry and construction account for 69 percent; with the services sector at 27 percent and the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors at 4 percent. The proportions of investment in the agricultur e and services se ctors show an increasing trend. Overall, FDI has made a positive contribution to the manufacture of goods, economic growth and the restructuring of the economy. It also helped to develop the private sector. These achievements were attributed to the incentives provided by the Government and other measures, such as the decentralization of foreign investment licensing. From 2005 onwards, provinces have been delegated by the authorities to license foreign investment projects valued up to USD 2 million. This has led to significant increases in FDI compared to the beginning of the Plan period. Annual forums with invest ors and businesses were organized to discuss constraints and explore solutions . At the same time, the infrastructure has been improved rapidly providing better facil ities to attract FDI. In Oc tober 2004, the National Assembly revised the Law on Foreign Investment includi ng the incentives, thereby paving the way for increasing FDI in 2005 and thereafter.

Social Development The Fifth Plan (2001-2005) set the socio-economic development goals such as firmly improving education, training and human re sources development (HRD); generating employment; reducing the number of poor house holds; fighting social evils; maintaining social order and political stability; and preserving national independence, territorial integrity and national security. In order to implement these goals during the la st five years, the Lao Party, the Government and the multi-ethnic peoples have endeavoured to strengthen linkages between economic and social development, to ensu re that the national economic outcomes expand and maximize social development. As a result, the social se ctors have developed si gnificantly, as described in the following: 1. Education, Training and Human Resources Development In the past five years, the Education sector ha s developed both in quant itative and qualitative terms. The kindergarten enrolment rate increas ed from 8 percent in 2000 to 8.2 percent in 2005, and the primary enrolment rate increased from 79 percent to 84.2 percent. The lower secondary enrolment rate increased from 46.6 percent to 54.8 percent, and the upper secondary enrolment rate rose to 34.4 percent in 2005 as compared to 22.6 percent in 2000. By 2005, the adult literacy rate increased to 73 percent and the ratio of students increased to 845 per 100,000 people. According to the human development index in 2005, the Lao PDR was ranked 133 of the 177 countries in the worl d, up from the 141st of the 173 countries in 1993. In late 2005, there were 969 cr\u00e8ches and ki ndergartens, up by 215 over those in 2000, with 136 private schools, up by 49 schools. There were 8,573 primary schools, up by 381. About 85% of the villages had schools of which 42.8% were primary schools. 15 of the 18 provinces built boarding-schools. The number of secondary and higher secondary schools increased by 106 from a total of 926. Efforts are being made to develop primary edu cation at the national level with particular emphasis on isolated areas. Permanent school struct ures are being built in larger districts, and districts with difficult access received perman ent and semi-permanent school structures. Educational campaigns were mounted frequentl y, which helped to incr ease the number of children entering school. In the Vientiane Capita l, special schools for talented students were established. Courses in information technol ogy (IT) and foreign la nguages are becoming popular in Vientiane. Vocational, university and higher education are also being devel oped. In the five-year period (2001-2005), the National University opened two branches: Pakse University in Champasak Province, and Souphanouvong University in Luang Prabang Province, vocational education is being developed and strengthened. A new vocational school was opened in the Bolikhamxay Province, in addition to four technical schools providing c ourses in business management, Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 30administration, agriculture, construction and w ood processing. Vocationa l education was also improved in the Khammuane Province and in Paks e. In 2004, Vietnam help ed to establish an Economics and Planning Training Centre in Vientiane to enhance the in-country capacity to train civil servants. The curricula were improved, and their im plementation monitored and assessed. New curricula on law, medical care and business management were adopted. Strict and efficient supervision and administration were introduced. Short-term training courses were organised for civil servants. The number of in-country and overseas training courses for teachers were increased. An increasing number of civil servants were sent abroad to study. From 2001 to 2003, Vietnam alone received 1,910 civil servants, which are 460 more than that in the period from 1996 to 2000. However, in comparison to othe r countries in the region, the investment in human resources development in the Lao PDR is low. 2. Health The strategic policy of the Lao Party and the Gove rnment in the Health sector is to strongly encourage health care by upholding prevention as a primary task and treatment as an important task to ensure the Lao people's heal th and participation in national socio-economic development. In line with this policy, the heal th care system has developed during the last five years under the Government's guidance with the participation of communities and international cooperation. The health system has improved and gradually expanded to form a complete network from the central level to th e districts and villages . Thus, it became an important factor in extending improved health se rvices including primary health care to the population. In the areas of prevention, attention is given to primary health care with emphasis on high risk groups; child immunization; recommendati ons on the use of safe and sanitized water; management and the control of transmittable di seases, such as diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV/AIDS; and the close monitoring of other diseases caused by drug addiction. Eight hygiene, disease preven tion, and health care cen tres have been built nationwide. So far, there have been six central and provincial laboratories. These establishments have maintained coordination, and made regular or emergency reporting on examination and health care to the Ministry of Public Health. Laos and Vietnam have signed an agreement on the implementation of a border disease prevention system. Initial coordination was made with different agencies, authorities a nd line Ministries in charge of promotion and communications to pr omote hygienic lifestyles and protection from diseases, combat superstitions, a nd encourage infected people to seek treatment at hospitals. Child polio was eradicated in 2000, but Lao PD R still remains in a vulnerable position, as Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 31polio free status is under threat because of the low polio routine coverage. Immunization was expanded to children less than one year old for various diseases such as whooping cough, measles, tetanus, tuberculosis and others. The safe injection plan has been introduced nationwide. Efforts made in the prevention of transmittable diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and HIV/AIDS have shown positive results. Investments were made to upgrade treatment in the central and regiona l hospitals and expand access to medical services. At the same time, traditional treatment systems were improved and developed in cooperation with Vietnam. A bout 57 percent of the pa tient beds at central and provincial hospitals were in use. The private health network has also devel oped since 2001. There are currently 254 private clinics, 108 of which are located in Vientiane, wh ich in turn contribute to the diversification of health care services. In the last five years, the country ha s provided 5,226 drug kits to the villages in the 72 poor provinces identified in the NGPES. Thus, about 94 percent of villages have been provided with drug kits. Thanks to the health system's developm ent, the population's health has improved significantly in the past five y ears. By 2005, the infant mortality rate has been reduced to 70 per 1,000 live births (viable infants), while that of children under five also reduced to 98 per 1,000 (viable children). The maternal mortal ity was also reduced to 405 per 100,000 live births (viable babies). The country has been ab le to meet 48 percent of the local population's demand for medicines from local production; a nd provided drug kits to 95 percent of the villages. In addition, the life expect ancy has increased to 61 years. 3. Labour and Employment During the past five years (2001- 2005), a number of Articles in the Labour Code have been amended and supplemented. The Government's Decree guiding the im plementation of the revised Labour Code, the Civ il Service Law; the Law on Mini mum Wages, and the Law on the Establishment of the Social Welfare and So cial Security Reserves , were promulgated. A vocational training centre was set up in Vientiane. From 2001 to 2005, about 100,000 people have undergone vocational training, laggi ng behind the Plan target of 300,000. A new policy on foreign workers in Laos has been drawn up, especia lly applicable to technical workers in industrial plantations such as rubber, coffee, cashew, and a number of industries such as electricity, coal, cement and agro-processing. Thanks to the policy, thousands of foreign workers (from Vietnam, China and Thailand) pour ed into the country and facilitated technology transfer. At the same time, sister cities and provinces in Vietnam and the Lao PDR have established busine ss networks to exchange experiences. A number of labour centres were set up provi ding opportunities for Lao labourers to go to Japan, Malaysia and Singapore. A Governme nt Decree guiding the movement of Lao labourers overseas was promulga ted. Two state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and some private Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 32enterprises were established for \"Employmen t Promotion.\" Additionally, an Agreement on Labour Cooperation was signed betw een the Lao PDR and Thailand. One of the aims of the Government's policy is to encourage private enterprises to provide technical and vocational training. By the end of 2004/05, there are over 100 private training centres in operation in the country. In particul ar, they provide training for highly profitable and low investment professions, such as English language, computer applications and accounting. The Government also promulgated a policy, which allows foreign workers to open a Human Resources Traini ng centre in the country. 4. Other Social Sectors Handicapped, disabled and orphans : During the five years from 2001 to 2005, the Government has efficiently provided health care services to persons with merits, families of handicapped veterans and national heroes, an d provided other assist ance to handicapped veterans and families of national heroes in accordance with Decree No. 145/PM and set up a national veterans federation. Five orphanages and SOS schools have been established to take care of and help homeless orphans. The Na tional Committee for the Disabled and the Association for Disabled Women and Children were established to facilitate the self- development of disabled persons in their daily lives. Assistance was provided to the poor by distributing food and helping th e poor build irrigation system s, extending credit for the acquisition of livestock, and providing assistance to victims of natural calamities, fires, accidents and others. A policy of a single uniform a ssistance is outlined and develope d in relation to the lump sum rewards to national heroes. Cemeteries of na tional heroes were maintained. Remains of Vietnamese volunteers were sought in coordination with Vietnam for repatriation. In the prevention of ne gative social phenomenon , efficient measures were applied to restrict and eliminate (destroy) opium production in c onjunction with programmes aimed at reducing poverty and promoting socio-economic developmen t by supporting the population's efforts to develop their economy and stabilize their living conditions. Many cultivation techniques were disseminated in different opium growing provi nces to encourage the population to orient towards other types of producti on. Communication facilities, elec tricity, piped water, and education and health infrastruc ture were built. As a result, the opium growing area reduced significantly from 26,387 ha in 1988 to 3,556 ha in 2004 and by the end of 2004/05, the Lao PDR has been able to completely eradicate opium production in advance of the schedule set out in the agreement with the United Nations. Drug addiction has also significantly reduced from 52,613 addicts in 2002 to 28,000 in 2004. Strong measures were introduced in combati ng narcotics, encouraging communications and advocacy to demonstrate the negative effects of drugs. The rehabilitation of drug addicts in rehabilitation centres was organized. In comb ating narcotic producers and transporters, the Lao police, border patrol and customs officers have firmly coordinated with Vietnam and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 33maintained order along the borders, contributi ng to the identification and restriction of offenders. Information and culture areas : The information and culture network has been developed. The system of the mass media has been develope d to localities. Efforts have been made for the preservation of memorial sites and arte facts. Simultaneously, the mass culture has extended. The number of culture-model villages grew from 65 in 2001 to 85 in 2005, while that of culture-model families grew from 6,000 in 2001 to 16,000 in 2005. Sports activities and physical education : The movement has made a big stride over the achievement scored in the previous (Fourth) Five -Year Plan. Some sports trainers have been trained and sport cooperation has been e xpanded with many countries in the region. Outstandingly, Lao sportsmen won three gold me dals in the 23rd SEA Games held in the Philippines. The seventh national games were also organised in Savannakhet Province. The scientific, technical and environmental activities have been progressing. From 2004 to 2005, a number of research institutes were set up. New technology has been applied to businesses such as seedling pr oduction, processing of aloe and extracting vegetable oils. The National Strategy on Environmental Protectio n until 2010, and the 2020 Vision have been formulated and implemented from 2004 onwards. Certification of environmental standards for projects in such areas as hydro-electrici ty, mine exploration a nd construction has been initiated. The public administration reform is being impl emented well, with significant progress in public management and approval processes both at the central and local levels. Strict disciplinary measures were applied to a numbe r of government officials, including high- ranking officials, who lacked re sponsibility and were corrupt, which in turn has affected the credibility of the Government and the Party. The training of officials aims at enhancing political ideology as well as professionalism. Senior officials are being sent for further training in politics. Professionals are encouraged to do further study, and are sent on field trips in and outside the country. A number of short- term courses on politics for leaders of centr al and local organizations were organized 5. Poverty Reduction Poverty reduction is the core task in the socio-economic deve lopment guidelines of the Party and the Government of the Lao PDR. The Prime Minister's Decree No. 10 and other resolutions to implement poverty reduction effo rts, which have progressed significantly during the past five years. Th ese initiatives have been impl emented aggressively by CPI, public organizations and the four priority sectors (Agricu lture and Forestry, Education, Health and Infrastructure), in the localities with the participati on of poor people, especially in the 10 pilot districts selected from the 47 poores t districts. The latter (47 poorest districts) Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 34include 2,935 communities with a populati on of around 1.2 million people in 111,850 poor households, which account for 55.4 percent of total poor households in the country. In 2003/04, CPI issued regulations and mobilized village development funds (including from the budget) for poverty reduction. By 2005, there were 192 village deve lopment funds with 10,925 members. The Government injected an input of 18.3 billion kip into the funds. With a loan of USD 20 million from the World Bank, the Poverty Reduction Fund has implemented 1,212 projects, valued at USD 8 million in 1,913 v illages in 20 districts in five provinces. There are also other poverty eradication projects , including the projects supported through foreign cooperation that made progress and are well-organised. So far, the land-forest allocation program has presented 1.09 million ha of agricultural land and 3.6 million ha of forested land to 419,259 households in 7,125 villages. Areas under slash-and-burn cultivation have been reduced from 118,900 ha in 2001 to 29,400 ha in 2005, fulfilling 75% of the Fifth Plan target. Of this, 72,870 ha have b een put under industrial trees. Shifting cultivation and opium pr oduction have reduced in a mo st noticeable way. Almost 19,000 ha of opium fields were destroyed and n early 30,000 ha of slash and burn fields were converted into industrial tree plantation areas. By the end of 2004/05, ten and one special zone were officially declared to be free from opium production. The Government has designed and implemented economic development projects (in different sectors, including agriculture and forestry, and industry and construction) and invested in the construction of infrastructure, such as roads, schools and electricity grids, as well as in the social sectors such as health, education a nd training, culture and communications with the purpose of reducing poverty. The labour and soci al welfare line author ities actively built and developed forms of model families in the pove rty reduction movement through reorientation from shifting cultivation and opium produc tion to the production of industrial crops, livestock, handicrafts, trade and se rvices in order to gradually uplift the quality of life of the affected populations. In 2000/01, about 38 percent of the population was below the national poverty line (or classified as poor). According to the repor ts from the provinces, there were 304,100 poor households in 2001 and the Plan target was to move some 150,050 households out of poverty. Over the five years from 2001 to 2005, some 137,500 families graduated from poverty, achieving about 90 percent of the Plan target. Model associations of villages and groups were formed and tested for the development of co mmercial production including the establishment of development funds promoting commercial production. Similar models were formed and 1 The definition of poor families is based on the standards specified in the Prime Minister's Instruction No. 10, which includes income and access criteria. However, the number of poor households in 2004/05 will be much larger if the national (income) poverty line from the Second or Third Lao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS II or III) is used. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 35tested for the elimination of shifting cultiv ation and the eradicat ion of opium production. Local potentials have been tapped to generate incomes for the poor. Savings groups were being organized and credit funds establis hed by mobilizing the participation of poor households to assist the households to develop their production and increase their incomes through low interest loans. These funds are closely managed and shared equitably as demonstrated by th e Women's Union Group of Somsavi Village (Saithany District, Vientiane Capital). The achievements scored in the past years are of great and firm significance to the socio- economic development. The targets and achievements of the Fift h Plan are summarised in Table II.1. Five-Year Socio Economic Deve lopment Plan (2001-2005): Targets & Achievements No. Item Target Achievement 1 GDP growth 7-7.5% 6.2% 2 Agriculture-forestry sector 4-5% 3.4% 11.3% 4 Services sector 8-9% 6.7% Sector shares in GDP (2005) 5 Agriculture-forestry sector 47% 45.4% 6 Industrial sector 26% 28.2%, sector 27% 26.4% 8 Exports growth 8.6% 7.0% 9 Imports growth 8.6% 4.9% 10 Trade deficit as % of GDP 6% 9.4% 11 Inflation rate Less than 10% 9.6% 12 Exchange rate Stabilised Kip appreciated by 7% per year against US dollar 13 Budget revenue as % of GDP (2005) 18% 13.6% (5- year average) 14.6% in 2005 14 Budget deficit as % of GDP (2005) 6% 7.4% (excluding Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 36arrears) Total investment as % of GDP 27.8%(5-year average) 15 Public investment as % of GDP (2005) 12-14% 12.3% 16 Private (domestic and foreign) investment as % of GDP 15.5% (5-yr. average) 17 Total GDP (2005 current prices) US$ 2.8 billion 18 GDP per-capita (2005) US$ 500- 550 US$ 491 19 New jobs created each year 100,000 20 Provide vocational training and skill development 350,000 workers 100,000 workers 21 Total population (2005) 5.9 million 5.61 million Population growth rate 2% 22 Poor households (hh) graduating out of poverty (2005) Half of 2000 level of 304,100 hh enrolment of 6-10 year olds (2005) 86% 84.2% 24 Lower secondary school enrolment (2005) 52% 54.8% 25 Upper secondary school enrolment (2005) 24% 34.4% 26 Literacy among people 15 to 40 years old (2005) 85% 78.6% 27 Life expectancy at birth (2005) 61 years 61 years 28 Infant (children under one) mortality (2005) 60 per 1,000 live births 70 29 Child (children under five) mort ality (2005) 98 per 1,000 98 per 1,000 30 Maternal mortality (2005) 350 per 100,000 405 per 100,000 The achievements mentioned above indica te the tremendous efforts made by the Government, the various sectors and local admi nistrations in taking responsibilities with active roles of leadership, and implementation of the socio-economic development plans. This also indicates the creativeness and the high sense of efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and classes, enterpri ses and Lao business people. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 37A. These achievements were attributed to: The judicious policy guidelines set out by the 7th Party Congre ss and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee and the National Assembly; the unified and centralized leadership of the Party, and most of all of the Political Bureau and the Executive Committee of the Party Central Committee; the significan t progress made in guiding a nd administering the activities of the Government, the central line ministries and local administrative authorities; and the enhanced quality and managerial competence of civil servants. People of all ethnic groups have the high sense of efforts and they have used the strong traditions of integrity and hard-work; and the increasingly improved investment, production and business environment, with many enterprises growing gradually within the context of the market economic conditions. The Government is well aware of the market situation and organized production activities to meet the need s of the market demand in appropriate and effective manner. Many projects in which investments were made during the last five years have now begun to be operated effectively. The role of external economic relations has gained constantly increasing recognition for the Lao PDR. Also, the international economy is currently receiving incr easingly strong support from within the country and from the inte rnational community, the ASEAN countries, the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) and beyond. This has improved our strengths. The economic development was efficiently coor dinated with solutions to social issues, thereby building preparedness throughout th e society for national construction and development. Because the Party uses and combines the two st rategies of development and national defence (which are directly instructed by the Party), so cial stability and orderliness were maintained and national defence and security strengthened. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 38III. CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS Although the achievements attained in the fi ve-year period 2001-2005 are highly positive and praiseworthy, a number of constraints and li mitations still remain, which are enumerated briefly in the following: A. Economic Growth The growth of the economy remains unstable, and has not generated adequate investments nor realised its full pote ntial. Although there ha s been progress, the qua lity of growth and the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy remain low and slow. 1. Agriculture Sector In the agriculture sector, small scale and s ubsistence production is still widespread. The production in this sector has not achieved th e planned target and its full potential. The introduction of modern cultivation systems re mains slow. Agriculture production is still concentrated on rice. Animal husbandry needs to be further developed. Crop production, animal husbandry and the quality of agricultural pr oducts, albeit increasing, are still low and seasonal, dependent on the weather. The struct ural modification of agriculture production and the composition of the rural economy are st ill slow and do not yet guarantee stable components. Commercial production in several areas is not linked to processing industries and market demands. Overall food production is sufficient to meet the domestic demand, but about one-third of the district s do not yet have a sufficient production of rice for meet the consumption requirements for the whole year. The most important problems to agriculture development are; weak market institutions; formal and informal barriers to national and regional trade; high transport co sts; and lack of supporting urba n infrastructure and service. The use of inputs in the agriculture sector re mains inefficient, more particularly in the irrigation sub-sector. Although agricultural prod uction has increased significantly, it has not met the economic requirements. Many goods could be produced locally and efficiently, but insufficient efforts for their development resulted in substantial imports of these goods. The sector-wide quality and efficiency remains to be improved further. 2. Industry and Construction Sector The production costs in the industrial sector remain quite high. Very few enterprises use modern technologies and most of these are fore ign-owned. Public invest ment in the industrial sector remains low due to the excessive fo cus on the agriculture sector (particularly irrigation), infrastructure (mainl y roads and ports) and services. Th ere is a lack of incentives Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 39for different economic actors to invest in i ndustrial development; and coordination between line agencies and local authorities to encour age industrial development remains weak. The handicrafts sector is not sufficiently deve loping at the local level. Although advanced techniques are used, its development remains limited. 3. Services Sector The services sector infrastructure is still very limited and is not adequate to meet the socio- economic development requirements. As a result, th e quality of many types of services is still low. Management of services shows several shortcomings, including control on investors, personnel management, and the management of family and private enterprises engaged in the provision of services. The coordination between Government officers and sectors at the local level in planning the development of infrastructure, tourism, and others is still very weak, resulting in low efficiency. 4. Infrastructure Use The application/use of infrastructure in the activities of many sectors is still very low since production is not developed at the same pace as the development of physical infrastructure. Most prominent is the very limite d capacity to make efficient use of irrigation schemes, ports, airports, etc. This results in waste and a reduction in the cost -effectiveness of investments. B. Monetary and Fiscal Management The macroeconomic ratios remain fragile and coul d be easily destabilised by external factors as demonstrated for example, in the following aspects: 1. Savings and Investment The ratios of savings and investment to GDP, although significantly improving, are still low compared to the potentials and the devel opment requirements. The difference between domestic savings and public investment is si gnificantly high and requires the use of foreign funds, mostly in the form of lo ans. The mobilization of savings for investment is still limited since the Government has not yet secured the sources of adequate revenues and the enterprises in different economic sectors have not yet sufficiently developed. Also, there are still no policies and detailed mechanisms to c onvert land and other resources into sources of capital. The mobilized funds for investments are lim ited and are not conc entrated on strongly encouraging structural adjustments for the deve lopment of the potentials of different areas, Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 40developing the skills of the labour force, er adicating hunger (scarcity of rice) and reducing poverty. Investments in infrastr ucture are scattered and the implementation of projects is often delayed. Debts incurred for financing the c onstruction of infrastructure are substantial, and the debt service obligations crea te pressure on the budget and prices. 2. National Budget Budget revenues are low and planned targets ar e not realised consistently. From 2001 to 2005, the monetary and fiscal situation faced numerous difficulties due to slow economic development and an even slower pace of growth in revenues, partly due to the tax incentives extended to investment projects at the start-up stage of their ope rations. At the same time, the legislative texts of the National Assembly a nd decrees on the remittance of duties and taxes by enterprises are not strictly enforced. Furthe rmore, negative phenomenon within the tax and customs administration has entailed a substant ial loss in revenues. Throughout the five-year period, the investment ratio targets of the Plan have not yet been achieved. Excluding grants, this ratio represents only 11- 12 percent of GDP, instead of 18% of the GDP as targeted. Capital investment is the largest line of expe nditure at 50 percent of the total budget, with approximately 70 percent of investments funded from external loans and grants. Given the high investment ratio, current expenditures are li mited and do not meet the requirements, thus affecting the efficiency and outcomes of the publ ic administration of social development and the delivery of health services. Also, low civ il service pay is becoming an issue requiring an urgent solution. Budget expenditures remain heavily subsidized as may be seen in several budget lines, such as cars and fuel, and the uncontrolled recr uitment of additional civil servants, while expenditures for health and edu cation may not yet be ensured. Low revenues that are well unde r planned targets (partially due to exceedingly ambitious Plan targets) effectively undermined the nati onal budget's balance since it was difficult to reduce expenditures, especially recurrent expenditu res, the bulk of which are absorbed in the civil servants' wage bill. In fact, expenditures exceed the Plan target, resulting in confusion in the fiscal sector and imposing difficulties to enterprises. The prolongation of such expenditures for seve ral years and the substantial debts incurred by the Government has pushed the security of the nation to th e threshold of fiscal non- sustainability. As a result, there is a real risk that inflation may return to higher levels and threaten the socio-economic balance. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 413. Financial Sector The administration of financial sector policies has been slow in solving several issues. The monetary policy framework is limited and inco mplete. It is mainly based on the obligation and issuance of bonds of the Bank of Lao PDR while credit and marketing officers may not yet use them. It is for such reasons that the sources of money and cr edit are restricted. The exchange rate management mechanism is not ye t fully consistent with the actual conditions, thereby limiting the efficiency of its impl ementation. The use of foreign currencies in transactions by enterprises and the ge neral population is still widespread. The central bank has not yet been able to set indicative interest rates to guide the market. The administration and the setting of guidelines for ma rket rates still encounter severe difficulties. During the last two years of the Fifth Plan, interest rates on loans extended to economic entities remained substantially high although th e rate of inflation declined significantly, thereby adversely affecting economic growth. The financial market is developing within a lim ited scope. Credit is limited and meets only 15 percent of the requirements. The loan amortizat ion periods are short and there is pressure on the operations of enterp rises and the capacity of the commercial banks to recover loans. The volume of repayments overdue in the banking system is substantial and is concentrated mainly in the domestic commercial banks, which suffer from poor financial capacity and quality of transactions. High non-performing loan s (NPL) are a drag on credit flow and high interest rates remain. 4. Economic Base Until now, the economic base of the country remain s to be relatively small. The total GDP in 2005 amounted to only USD 2.8 billion, with an average GDP per capita of USD 491. These indicators for Lao PDR are among the lowest fo r the countries in the region, and it remains one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy's growth ra te is yet to reach its full potential. With the low economic base, even if the rate of growth of the economy accelerates significantly, the absolute value added to th e GDP would remain m odest. The gap between the GDP per capita of the Lao PDR and other countries in the regi on continues to widen. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 42C. Structural Adjustment of the Economy 1. Structure of the Economy The adjustments in the structure of the economy largely focus on the sectoral composition of GDP, concentrating on the rate of industrializa tion. They do not take into account adequately the goals in structural adjustment in line with the direction of industrialization and modernization, with strong t echnological and technical de velopments. Therefore, the development of domestic industries is charac terised by obsolete technologies, high costs and low efficiencies. This requires high protection/subsidies and reduces the competitiveness of the economic sectors in the long-run in the pro cess of international integration. Structural adjustments in the agriculture sector have only recently been initiated with the conversion of low productivity (and low value) rice cultivation land into industrial plantations. The economic components of the agriculture sector are not strongly linked to the processing industries and markets. The econom ic structure in rural areas is mainly and solely reliant on agriculture, which accounts for 84% of the pe ople's livelihood. The sale of a number of agricultural products is difficu lt due to high production costs and low quality. Many products are not competitive. 2. Geographic (Spatial) Structure The geographic (spatial) structure of the econo my shows considerable disparity, with large variations in the growth rates, with a relati vely low level of devel opment in many Northern and Southern Provinces. The economies in many areas remain unbalanced and the territorial potentials have yet to be strengthened. At the same time, the economic transition still remains slow, and a large share of the land is in agro-forestry. The de velopment gaps between urban and suburban, provinces/territories, economic s ectors, and the ethnic groups are large. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the in trinsic (but concealed) potentials in each province/territory. 3. Labour Force The skill level of the labour force is developi ng slowly compared to the improvements in the economic components in each sector and area. The capacity development of the labour force is characterized by self-improvement, with only occasional opportunities for training, resulting in casual labour. Without proper institutional arrangements and training programmes, it would be difficult to achieve th e objective of appropriately redistributing the labour force and population to meet the require ments of industrializat ion and modernization. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 43D. External Economic Relations 1. Foreign Trade Exports and imports still face se vere constraints. Exports per capita are still extremely low due to constraints in large-scale commercial production and in processing higher quality products. The export of unprocessed and low value added agricultural products accounts for a major proportion (about 50 percent) of the export re venues. Therefore, the value of exports is low and may be reduced easily due to fluctuati ons in price. Moreover, more than half the revenues from Lao exports are generated from products for which markets are unstable (e.g. garments), or the volume has reduced (e.g. wood), or which suffer from price declines (agricultural products). Interestingly, the rate of growth of e xports is not yet stable and is lower than the GDP growth ra te; while the exports of many countries in the world are increasing twice as fast as or faster than the growth in their GDP. The foreign trade management policy framework and measures need to be further developed in detail. The existing framework and measures do not ensure overall co verage and lack long- term vision, affecting their e fficiency. In many cases, they de monstrate a lack of ownership, especially in the management of imports. Coordination between central and local authorities on exports and imports is still w eak and inefficient. There is st ill a widespread shortage of management officers, technical staff a nd workers with high technical skills. Even though substantial imports have significantly contributed to the successful growth of domestic production and exports, th ey are increasing faster than the rate outlined in the Fifth Plan. The management of imports still faces se vere difficulties. There is a general lack of market information and most of the imports ar e concentrated on smaller markets, and many technologies have been imported but obsolescence is still pervasive. 2. Foreign Investment Foreign investment increased at a slow pace. Investments in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors and areas with difficult access are very limited. At the same time, the capacity to attract investments in the industrial sector remains low. The licensing process is time consuming and cumbersome. Foreign in vestors face many difficulties due to the insufficiently open investment environment, inade quate facilities, and the lack of consistency and predictability. The costs of inputs such as fuel, electricity, telecommunications and shipping are much higher than in many othe r countries in the region, restricting the competitiveness of Lao products and services and the attractiveness of the Lao PDR to foreign investors. Also, there ar e very few investors with the capacity to raise large volumes of funds from the regional a nd international economic groups. One of the main causes restricting the growth of foreign investment in the Lao PDR is the insufficiency of skilled labour. Currently, skille d labour represents only 2 percent of the total Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 44labour force and is not able to meet the requirements of foreign enterprises which need highly skilled labour. 3. Official Development Assistance (ODA) The delayed disbursement of ODA negatively affects the mobilizati on of funds and their efficient use. E. Social Development 1. Education and Training In the education and training sector, repetiti on and dropout rates are high and increasing. In 2005, the dropout rate was 8.9 percent at the primar y level, 7.2 percent at the lower secondary level, and 3.2 percent at the upper secondary level. The repetition rates at primary schools, mostly in year 1, stood at 34.1%. Due to the low quality of graduates, few are accepted in the labour market, while the remainder are forced to work in sectors othe r than their areas of training. The issue of insufficient teachers and sub-sta ndard teachers has dragged on for many years, but efficient solutions have still not been applied. By 2005, about 19 per cent of the teachers had not been properly trained. The curriculum is obsolete, while enrolment at the lower and upper secondary levels remains generally hi gh. Current treatment of teachers and the management of the teaching corps are character ized by many inconsistent elements and fail to encourage teachers to undertak e proper training as well as capacity enhancem ent activities. Teachers are paid very low salaries irregular ly. Class-rooms are insufficient to accommodate the rising number of students. This leads to a phenomenon where classes need to be rescheduled in lower and upper se condary schools. The ratio of students per class is high at around 70-80. The literacy rate remains very low. The su rvey data show that in 2005, only about 68.2 percent of the people aged 15 years and over ar e literate, which include the 15-39 years age group with a literacy rate of 78.6 percent. According to a nother review, only about 45.2 percent of the population are literate with a breakdown of 53.7 percent for men and 36.3 percent for women. This review also indicated that only 37.7 percent of the literate have a normal level of application of their literacy sk ills and 30.8 percent are able to make good use of their literacy skills in their activities. The training of personnel, worker s and skilled artisans do not meet the requirements of the labour market and the society. The development of education in isolat ed, ethnic and highland areas is very slow. Illiteracy eradication e fforts are not yet based on strategic plans and detailed procedures, and a substantial por tion of the population is still illiterate. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 45The implementation of scholarship awards is slow. In 2005, only about 7.5 percent of persons with merit have received assistance, representi ng only 30 percent of the Plan target. (The Plan provides for the provision of assistance to 25 percent of st udents through different means.) The education sector suffers from a severe la ck of equipment and tools; foremost among them are textbooks, learning materials and school facilities; and teachi ng fails to meet the requirements. The ratio of schools meeting the standards set by the Government is still very low. The budget allocations made to education ar e very limited and not constant, with a peak of only 10 percent of the total budget expenditures. Within such allocations, up to 80 percent are provided from external grants, and the mobilization of these funds is subject to increasingly difficult conditions. The National Assembly agreed to allocate 12 percent of the budget to the education a nd training sector, but none of the provinces ha ve yet received such an allocation. 2. Health The health sector and the health care services delivery do not fully meet the requirements of the population, either in quantitativ e or qualitative terms. The health system does not yet meet the health requirements of isolated areas, part icularly poor areas with difficult access. The level of competence of health personnel is not consistent with the actual needs. Dispensaries still need the presence of medical doctors. The deployment of health personnel is not in accordance with their training and the pharmaceutic al sub-sector is developing very slowly. Ethnic groups still uphold superst itious beliefs, lead unsanitary li festyles and mainly rely on shamans for cures. 3. Employment The need for new employment opportunities is h uge, but employment generation is slow and there is a high level of unemployment. The allo cation of the labour force is shifting slowly, and has not brought about significant changes in socio-economic development. Subsistence production results in the underemployment of labour and makes the management of social issues more difficult. The lack of external communication results in an inward-looking (insular) economy. The labour cooperation mech anism is not yet open to facilitate labour movement among districts and provinces, as well as other countries in the region. 4. Public Sector Salaries In recent years, the public sector salaries are ve ry low and are not adequate for civil servants to meet their daily requirements. In addition to office work, a second job is sought to support family expenses and the children's schooling an d health care. This has impacted significantly on the quality of work and perf ormance of civil servants. Therefore, the reform of civil Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 46service pay and the increase of salaries for civil servants are currently urgent matters to uplift the quality of performance. 5. Poverty Reduction In poverty reduction efforts, due to insufficiently firm coordination between the relevant agencies and unified guidance from the Governme nt, each agency is left to carry out their sector's activities independently. The overall su pervision, assessment, control and monitoring of poverty reduction activities have not been entrusted to any agency. Clear and specific credit policies need to be out lined to allow public f unds to reach producers when required and proper mechanisms need to be established to mobilize domestic and foreign resources to establish funds that woul d extend credit to the poor for the development of production activit ies and the reduction of poverty. The civil servants including the technical st aff of local administ ration authorities are insufficient in number and have inadequate capacities, and a subs tantial number have minimal qualifications. This is a major constraint to the dissemination of policies and programmes and the implementation of polic y guidelines adopted by the Party and the Government, thereby affecting the effi ciency of poverty reduction efforts. 6. Social Security The establishment of an efficien t social security system for a ll Lao people to alleviate poverty is a long-term objective. Public servants are covered by a comp rehensive range of provisions including pensions and health care financed partly through a six percent deduction from salaries and partly from the state budget. In 1999, the Government adopted a Decree on Social Security System for Enterprise Empl oyees, establishing the f oundation of a National Social Security Scheme. It called for the creation of a Social Securi ty Organisation (SSO) which began operating in June 2001. The SSO admi nisters the Social Security Scheme for enterprise workers in the private and the SOE sectors. The scheme provides protection coverage in respect of a range of con tingencies/risks including the following: Access to health care from an approved health care provider for insured workers and their families; Long-term pensions in case of invalidity or old age and to surviving dependants; Short-term benefits in respect of incapacity to work by virtue of sickness or maternity; and Benefits in case of incapacity to work by virtue of an employment-related injury or sickness. However, a very low proportion of workers are covered under the formal social security systems. Only 4.7 percent of the total labour force, with about 28 percent in Vientiane City, Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 47has social security coverage. In 2005, care and aid were give n to only 7.5% of the total beneficiaries, accounting fo r 30% of the set target. Information and Culture: The creation of fa vourable conditions for cultural exchange between ethnic groups is irregular and discon tinuous and still requires necessary materials. The mass media grows slowly and the quality of the media is not high. Thus, the dissemination of the Party-state policies does not go thoroughly to th ose in remote areas. Efforts of transforming the behaviour and livelihoods of ethnic people in rural areas are slow. The awareness campaign on the struggle ag ainst drugs is not launched thoroughly. National Defence and Public Security: The development of the national defence and public security has not received sufficient attention as it should, which makes the defence and security work insufficiently strong and leaves a gap leading to social evils. The socio- economic development is not closely connected with the improvement of the national defence and public security forces as well as the two strategic duties defined by the Party. Due to the insufficient collaboration between these two task s, investment costs are high but the yields are low. The budget allocation for the armed forces is limited, causing difficulties to them in their operations and liv ing conditions. F. Limitations and Causes 1. Limitations Nevertheless, the economy of Lao PDR n eeds to overcome the following limitations: The economic growth rate remains below the Plan target and has not met its full potential, while ODA is stable and remains significant, covering a major proportion of the national budget's development investments specifically and more generally of the total investments. FDI sources have increased and cover a higher share of the total i nvestment. Funding from enterprises, the domestic private sector and ba nk credit for investment remain low and are characterized by inward-looking self-sufficienc y. Capacities in production, and the quality and efficiency as well as competitiveness are st ill low. The main types of markets are newly set up and less developed, esp ecially the capital market; There is a severe shortfall in revenues, expenditures are ex cessively high a nd the budgetary targets are not firmly maintained. Public de bt - including domestic and foreign debt - incurred by the Government is overwhelming and th e debts of enterprises are also substantial; and Many social issues are problematic, including th e delay in the payment of salaries and very low salary packages for Government official s and people whose main income is from the Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 48Government budget. This fact is likely to resu lt in the low quality of services provided by Government officials. 2. Causes These limitations are a result of the following: The lax implementation of instructions and resolutions issued by the Party and legislation enacted by the Government, which are even disregarded in certain areas; a substantial number of civil servants and Party members have lost their qualities and are engaged in corrupt practices; and coordinati on between ministries, sectoral au thorities and between central and local authorities is still very weak; A new legislative framework is in the proc ess of being establis hed and is currently incomplete. More specifically, there is a slow acceptance of new economic concepts delaying the establishment of a market-o riented economic framework mee ting the socialist directions and obstructing the process of realizing the socio-economic development goals; There is confusion about the timeframe for in ternational economic in tegration. There is no long-term strategy or appropriate policies to attract and use foreign direct investments and ODA funds, which explains the low efficiency in the use of such funds; Slow institutional (re)organization, slow reform of the civil service and public administration means that they fail to meet the requirements . Guidance and supervision in the civil service and reform of public administration does no t ensure high efficiency. Socio-economic information systems suffer from many limitations and are not timely, especially in the case of statistical data, which causes significant constraints in the administration of the economy by the Government and line agencies; and There was a need for substantial funding to implement the Plan, but resource mobilization has not yielded the required resu lts due to the insufficient attr action exerted by the different mechanisms and policies to encourage investment by various economic sectors. Efficiency in using funds is low and the use of such funds is inconsistent, with excessive concentration on infrastructure, while investments in production and skills development are very low. The investments in agriculture and services still do not match w ith the investment in human development. In particular, the development of education and quality health continues to lack capital investment and can not enjoy greater attention. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 49IV. LESSONS LEARNED Based on the actual conditions of completed and ongoing activities during th e past five years, the following lessons of experiences may be drawn: A. Implementation Focus Increased focus on the implementation of the Part y's policy of restructur ing is needed; with the Party's decisions expediti ously translated into detail ed, complete and consistent programmes. This assessment is in accord with the principles and actual conditions in the administration of socio-economic development dur ing the past five ye ars. Concepts, basic approaches, goals, tasks and remedies mentioned in the Ten-Year Strategic Plan (2001-2010) adopted by the 7th Party Congress have importa nt guiding significance, encouraging re- structuring and creating new potentials for the nation. During the past five years, the resolution of the 7th Party Congress and following resolutions of the Party Central Committee we re developed and strictly impl emented in all sectors from the central to the local levels and from the macro level down to the executing levels. The Party's policy of restructuring was develope d into detailed activities through plans and programmes to be performed in each sector and at each level. Mechanisms were institutionalized to administer socio-economic development, ensure strong coordination and unity in supervising such administration and ensuring the enforcement of rules and regulations, and the consistency and accountability of each sector and each level. These are the main reasons for the success gained in the past five years. Nevertheless, in practice, many fundamental matters in different sectors were not pursued at different levels. Due to inconsistent decentralization, approaches to development are not unified. The implementation of detailed activities is conf used and not fully cons istent with the eight priority programmes of the Government (food production, commercial production and others) and hence delayed the execution of a number of policies, such as commercial production, increased budget revenues, th e promotion of foreign inve stments, and international integration. Regulations, policy guidelines a nd laws are not strictly enforced, but are implemented in a discretionary manner or cont radicted voluntarily, thereby re-orienting the purpose of the rules and regulations a nd obstructing the development process. B. Sustainable Development Sound understanding of and commitment to sust ainable development and proper approaches to achieve it are required. Such recognition and approaches are reflected in the macro policies and in detailed matters of socio-economic development. First of all, the less than projected Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 50sustainable development in quantitative growth accompanied by enhanced quality, efficiency and economic competitiveness will limit future de velopment. Further effo rts are required to exploit cross-sector development factors, such as funds, land, resource s, and labour. More specifically factors that increas e the depth of development shoul d be upheld, such as modern technologies, improved management mechanis ms, and enhanced production and marketing capacities. Sustainable development must al ign economic development with social and cultural development, overall human developmen t, democracy and social equity, through the creation of employment, the improvement of liv ing conditions, and the promotion of lawful wealth accumulation that is accompanied by the simultaneous eradication of hunger (scarcity of rice) and the reduction of poverty. Also, the sustainable use of the natural resources and the protection of the environment must be uphe ld from the initial stage of development. C. Resource Mobilization Economic theory and practice in different c ountries have demonstr ated that domestic resources play a critical role in development. Through the growth of domestic resources, external resources may be mobilized and used with increasing efficiency. Strong domestic resources ensure independence, economic ow nership and successful international economic integration. The actual conditions prevailing in the Lao PDR indicate that the mobilization of domestic economic resources is a critical elem ent for national development, stability, firm participation and development. External sour ces of funding are impor tant. The mobilization of such sources of funding in combination with domestic resources would both ensure their full and proper use and create the required c onditions for economic growth. The Government of the Lao PDR has applied many measures to pr omote such sources of funding. It is for such reasons that the domestic sources of funding were more easily exploited. Developing domestic resources involves firs t of all developing human capacities and the resources of the multi-ethnic people in efficiently exploiting and using the country's natural resources. Appropriate policies are required to develop internal resources that play such a critical role, and develop the potentials of the economic s ectors (e.g. Government, private sector and households) firmly pushing fo rward socio-economic development, industrialization and modernizati on. Transparency is important when reporting on results, to ensure greater accountabili ty and more efficient use of limited recourses. Simultaneous with the development of resources , the Government upholds the efficient use of such resources and calls for investing the res ources in re-structuring the economy mainly in the agricultural and rural sector. More specifically, the Government upholds the efficient use of budget funds that are considered as core s ources of funding to attr act funding from other sources to invest in line with the Plan's goals. Protection of private property rights and the development of a supportive enabling enviro nment for business are important ways to increase domestic resource mobilisation. However, the exploitation of funding sources (both domestic and external) remains very weak and limited given the incomplete and und eveloped domestic market that contains high risks. The population's low income, the incomp lete policy framework and other constraints Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 51limit the capacity to attract foreign sources of funding for development. Investment licensing remains a cumbersome and complex process. D. Economic Restructuring Economic restructuring has become an urgent issue and a factor that may no longer be postponed to ensure rapid and stable economic growth and competitiveness. The Government has disseminated this lesson among sectors a nd levels. The proper restructuring of the economy in line with the directives requires macro (global), area and sectoral arrangements consistent with the market-mechanisms and the adoption of innovations in science and technology. A number of policy frameworks were develope d in detail for each type of tree, animal species, and industrial and agricultural products in the previous five-year period, which initially affected the economic restructuring of sectors, area s, groups of products and more particularly the agricu lture and rural sectors. Even though these elements emerged inherently in certain areas, they need to be further st rengthened. Past economic restructuring has built the capacity to realize development and build the springboard for further development in the following years. Economic restructuring must be accompanied by the development of the domestic market to promote the growth of production and realize th e goal of upgrading the living conditions of the population. When the participa tion in the external market is still limited, development of the domestic market will help the population sell their agricult ural products, enhance their purchasing power and continue the programme of eliminating hunger (s carcity of rice) and reducing poverty. It will strongly promote commercial production, thereby making the domestic market more lively and encourag ing production and business. The inevitable increasing share of industry and services in total employment means that there will by increased internal migration, rural- urban migration in particular. E. Integration and Autonomy International integration is an objective requirement over which ownership must be maintained following positive, stable and firm steps forward without excessive rush, carelessness or inadequate preparation. The ex ternal market must be actively opened to strongly promote exports, while ensuring owners hip in opening domestic markets, including service markets to attract financing sources, advanced technologies and know-how in management from the world, enhance efficien cy and economic competitiveness by firmly attracting foreign investments. In the process of market openi ng and international economic in tegration, the Lao PDR needs to develop all its potentials in order to compete with outside. However, actual conditions clearly indicate that to ensure long term de velopment, stability, autonomous capacities and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 52economic ownership, the internal resources must be strengthened urgently including the efficient development of certain sectors as well as essential economic products, the building of comprehensive infrastructure, and increasing foreign exchange reserves. F. Simultaneous Economic and Social Development Economic growth must be linked to social progress (including poverty reduction and gender equality) and equity, cultural development an d environmental conser vation, including the strong development of educati on and training, and scientific and technological capacities. The Government outlined many policies, an d mobilized significant sources of funding, including budgetary funds for social and cultural development, to remedy urgent issues and stabilize the living conditions of the people in flooded areas, concentrating on the elimination of hunger (scarcity of ri ce) and poverty. Although certain targets could not be attained and the economy is struggling with certain difficulties, the social outcomes have been positive. This new development phase requires the deepen ing and overall coverage of the restructuring efforts the Lao PDR. Comprehensive socia list market-oriented economic legislative framework must be urgently established, and th e principles of the market economy must be comprehensively implemented. At the same tim e, as a more firmly orientated market economy is established, social protection must be improved. Employment must be ensured, hunger (scarcity of rice) elimin ated and poverty reduced. Educ ation and culture must be developed for the vulnerable groups in so ciety. The role and accountability of the Government and the society as a whole must be firmly enhanced to meet these requirements. G. Public Administration Reform Continued reform of the public administration, including central and local organizations and the civil service, consistent w ith the country's socio-economic development level is essential. This is a critical element in the developmen t process. Lessons drawn on supervision and guidance were disseminated in the Governme nt's policy programmes and in their further development at sectoral level. More particul arly, progress made by th e local authorities in public administration during the past years has contributed to flexible and efficient socio- economic development. Through close supervisi on and monthly meetings with the aim of eradicating poverty, applying decisive measures , focusing on products and each focal area, firm progress was ensured toward s achieving the Plan's goals. The experience accumulated during the period of restructuring and more particularly during economic crisis, indicates that macro-econo mic indicators risk being affected. The Government and ministries, central and local agencies of the Lao PDR are ready to seek solutions. It is for such reasons that development resources are strengthened, additional resources are joined, obstacles are over come and different goals are achieved. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 53The actual situation indicates that on the ba sis of identical mechanisms, policies and resources, the locality with strong leadership and administration will more efficiently achieve the required outcomes in economic and social development compared to others where the public administration still needs to undergo the pr ocess of reform. In the next five-year plan, the outcomes of reform and socio-economic de velopment efforts will depend significantly on consistent endeavours and the implementation capacity of the sectors which include the human factor (including civil se rvants), and especially key decision-making staff who play a vital role. To ensure efficient implementation, staff deployment must be consistent with the development requirements. Defined tasks and co rresponding rights and re sponsibilities at the institutional and individual leve ls must be clearly identified. At the same time, strong accountability is required from civ il servants and more particular ly from leaders. Whenever a task is not duly performed, delayed or impr operly performed, timely solutions must be sought, including replacements. More specificall y, at the beginning of the forthcoming five- year period, detailed mechanisms will be desi gned to ensure that the performance of civil servants meets these requirements. In addition, pr oper attention is to be paid to the rights and benefits of officials including solving the delays in salary payment and the very low salary level. PART II: SIXTH FIVE-YEAR NATIONAL SOCIO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (2006-2010) Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 55V. OVERALL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY The development of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is based on: (i) the Long-Term Strategy of Socio Economic Development to the Year 2020; (ii) the Strategy on Industrialization and Modernization; (iii) the Nationa l Growth and Poverty Eradicati on Strategy (NGPES); (iv) the Regional Development Strategy; (v) various sector , thematic area and s ub-sector strategies and plans; and (v) the analysis of the international and domestic contexts for the development of the Lao PDR. A. Development Context 1. International Context It is hoped that the general trend of cooperation for de velopment in today's world will continue over the fi ve-year period (2006-2010). The world economy has been recovering and advancing, with the growth rate in the period 2006-2010 likely to be slightly higher than that during the preceding five years (2001-2005). Of ficial development assistance (ODA) has been growing and is expected to rise significantly during the next five years.2 The international financial markets are likely to be more active, with FDI a nd indirect investment flows recovering and expanding. However, the ra pid, sustained and large increases (more than doubling) in petroleum (oil) prices in the past two year s continue to have adverse impacts on the global economy in general, an d particularly the lo w-income oil-importing countries including the Lao PDR, and the lives of the poor people in these countries. The scientific and techno logical revoluti ons, especially in info rmation technology and bio- technology will grow strongly. The economizati on of intellectual property will spread globally, which is a good opportunity for the co untry. Although there are many challenges of integration into the global economy, it is ne cessary to open opportunities to other nations, especially the Lao PDR, to play their role s on the international stage for utilizing the opportunities for their development. The 2005 World Summit in September at the UN H eadquarters in New Yo rk has reiterated the commitment of the community of natio ns to eradicate poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Su mmit also emphasised the need to increase aid to the least developed count ries (LDCs) and assist them in implementing the Brussels Programme of Action for LDCs (2001-2010). Acco rdingly, bilateral and multilateral relations would widen and strengthen among nations, and between nations and international organizations. These developments in the international arena will help the Lao PDR take advantage of increased opportuni ties to push forward with it s development, reduce poverty 2 ODA increased from the low USD 50 billion range in 2001 to USD 79 billion in 2004. The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Econom ic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC), which monitors aid flows, expects the ODA to rise to USD 97 billion in 2006 and USD 128 billion in 2010. However, most of the additional aid has been utilized so far to write off the debts of developing countries including those of Iraq and Nigeria. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 56and successfully implement the industrializati on and modernization strategy, narrowing the gap with neighbouring countries in the region, while improving the country's status in the global community of nations. 2. Domestic Context On the positive side, there has been political and social stability over th e past five years, and this situation is to be strongly maintained. The production capacities a nd abilities of many industries have increased substa ntially, and the economic structure has changed significantly. The enterprises and the national economy have adapted better to the international market and the competitiveness of Lao products has im proved steadily. The eco nomic structure has changed progressively, and the implementati on of the Party's instruction has been implemented methodically in priority projec ts. The market economy structure has been adjusted and progressively improved. The geog raphic location and natu ral resources of the Lao PDR attract tourism and investment. The country has been recognized as the transit center of the region. By the end of the Fifth Plan (2001-2005), the production capacity and ability of many industries increased substantially, and the eco nomic structure changed significantly. The quality of growth in many industries and regions has improved somewhat, with the enterprises and the national economy adapting be tter to the international markets. New and more radical policies introduced in the recent fi ve years had positive impacts; attracting more investment from the society, especially utilizing internal resources for targeted investments, and bringing about structural changes in the economy. The country has been recognized in the region and globally as having a dynamic economy within a stable political situation, and a safe destination for investment and tourism. Socio- political stability is an important foundation and an essential precondition for socio-economic development, which is an advantage that the Lao PDR enjoys now. The full membership of the Lao PDR in the regional and global poli tical, economic and monetary organizations including the WTO will boost the dynamism of the economy and accelerate the country's development. However, the country faces many challe nges in the five-year period 2006-2010. These include the moderate size of the economy and the small-scale of much of the domestic production; low GDP per capita; insufficient domestic income, savings and investment to increase production and accelerate development; and weak financial and monetary systems. Although the economic and social in frastructure has been devel oped for several years, it is still not fully adequate to meet the growing development needs. The t echnological ba se is low and far behind that in other c ountries in the region. The servic es sector is still growing slowly. The skilled human resources and skille d labour force are limited. It is necessary to invest immediately to improve the skills, but there is limitation of the budget, which restricts the ability of the nation's development. The effectiveness of state administration is still limited. Erratic weather and climate changes, wi despread diseases such as SARS and Avian Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 57Influenza (bird flu) are real threats. There are many social problems such as poverty, drug abuse, AIDS, prostitution and low salaries , which need to be solved immediately The ability of Lao enterprises for regional an d international economic integration is still limited. But implementation schedules of commitments under AFTA, WTO and other international agreements will put increased pressures on enterpri ses to adapt. Also, there is likely to be pressure on the stability of the nation's economy, which is inevitable. The competition for development, especially the attraction of foreign investment, free trade in the region and other regions in the world, are intense. At the same time, there are pressures on developing countries resulting from the revi sion of political and economic policies of powerful nations, such as rising oil prices, currency fluctuations, price subsidies and non- tariff trade barriers. B. Overall Development Strategy 1. Background The 7th Party Congress has set out the Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2001-2010) for the country, wh ich includes improving a nd building the economic infrastructure to ensure fast and sustainable economic growth, with emphasis on agricultural production, eliminating forest fires and deforestation, reducing the number of poor households, promoting industrialization and mode rnization. The country 's human resources are to be developed step-by-st ep both in quality a nd quantity to cater to the emerging needs and make the country a regional centre for exch ange of goods and services. The strategy encourages a socialist-oriented industrialization and modern ization with infrastructure development to prepare the nation for gradua tion from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2020 and to achieve improved well-being for all the Lao peoples. The objectives set out in the Strategy support the achievement of the MDGs and the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for L east Developed Countries (2001-2010). The Sixth Five-Year National Socio Economic Development Plan (or Sixth Plan) covering the five-year period 2006-2010 plays a crucial role in implementing the socio-economic development policy guidelines set out by the 7th Party Congre ss. It is the vehicle for facilitating the implementation of the second half of the Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2001-2010) approved by the Congress. T hus, the Sixth Plan in stitutionalizes and concretizes directives and tasks that will be carried out further during the five-year period 2006-2010, to ensure that the overall targets out lined in the Ten-Year Strategy (2001-2010) are achieved. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 582. Development Directions The directions set in the Sixth Plan (2006-201 0) are to achieve the highest outcomes and make general changes along the following lines: (i) Turn from under-development to fast and stable development, producing high value-added goods both in quantity and quali ty step-by-step in order to meet domestic market demand and increase exports; (ii) Increase competitiveness and utilize co mparative advantages to implement effectively international economic commitments in the frameworks of ASEAN and other bilateral and multilateral commitments, including the WTO; (iii) Strengthen links between economic devel opment and social development, and protect natural resources and the environmen t. Social problems should be solved first, with attention paid to such issues as the reduction of poverty, unemployment and social evils, and keep the social and political situation stable: and (iv) Accelerate the building of a comprehens ive socio-economic infrastructure and finalize the establishment of a market-ori ented economy with socialist orientation to form the basis for indust rialization and modernization. Thus, the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) is seen to be a break-through plan for creating a fast but firm and qualitatively enhanced developm ent, with increased capacity for economic competitiveness, lifting the society to new he ights both in material and moral wellbeing, significantly improving the quality of life of all the people and boosting the nation's status in the international arena. 3. Overall Goals of the Plan The 7th Party Congress identified the general goals of the Socio-Economic Development Strategy for the ten-year period 2001-2010 as follows: \" Improve and establish the basis for the economy to progress strongly in firm steps, especially to strongly develop the agriculture sector; en tirely eliminate the slash-and-burn cu ltivation practices; complete the tasks in solving the problem of poverty of people; create the foundation for industry and prepare the quality and quantity of human resources to be ready for industrial development and gradually turn to industrialization; develop our country to become the central point of transit of the region in the future \". The Party Congress identif ied key expectations: GDP in the ten years (2001-2010) to increase on averag e at least 7.5% per annu m; GDP per capita in 2010 to be USD 700-750; the population growth at rate in 2010 to be reduced to about 2% per year. The main goals of the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) are to maintain all target s and views that have been set in the ten-year Strategy (2001-2010). Th erefore, the goals for the Sixth Plan are as follows: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 59 \"Accelerate economic growth and improve the pe ople's quality of life, restructuring the economy and employment in building a market economy, based on the country's rich resources and international integration. Furt her build the market economy with a socialist orientation. Continue to enlarge and develop ef fective external economic relations. Create breakthrough changes in education and training in terms of quality and quantity, utilising the advances in science and technology, protecting the environment, and taking human, scientific and technological players as vehicles for de velopment. Develop culture and society in synchrony with economic growth. Continue pov erty reduction, creating jobs, and eliminating social evils. Continue strengt hening the socio-economic infras tructure as fundamentals for development in the Sixth five-year Plan and for the next (Seventh) five-year plan.

The goals coincide with the MDGs and those in the Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries (2001-2010). C. Plan Targets and Tasks 1. Targets The 7th Party Congress has also set some speci fic targets, including an average annual GDP growth rate of more than 7 percent during the first decade of the new millennium (2001 to 2010), with the population growth rate slowin g down to an annual average of about 2.0 percent by 2010 and GDP per capita reaching USD 700-750 by the end of the decade. The Sixth Plan (2006-2010) will maintain and build on these targets as follows: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 61Economic Targets The total GDP in 2010 should be 1.95 times (or a bout two times) that in 2000. GDP at current prices in 2010 is projec ted to be 59.5 thousand billion Kip, equivalent to USD 4.97 billion. The average GDP per capita will reach USD 827, which will meet and exceed the target set in the Plan (USD 700 - 750). The GDP annual aver age growth rate should reach 7.5-8%, with agriculture and forestry incr easing by 3-3.4%, industry by 13- 14%, and services by 7.5-8%. In particular, the growth rate in industry will be considerably accelerated, as there will be more industrial opportunities, especially hydrop ower dams and cement factories, which will begin operation at the end of the Sixth Plan. Th erefore, the GDP growth rate will accelerate, from approximately 7.2% in 2006 to perhaps 8.2-9% in 2010 (depending on the progress in implementing the large-scale projects meeting prioritized plans, particularly the construction of hydropower dams). By 2010, the agriculture sector is projected to account for about 36% of GDP, with industry about 36.4% and services about 27.6%. The projected annual changes in the st ructure of the economy are shown in Table V.1. Table V-1 Projected Structure of the Economy (2006-2010) 2005-06 2007-08 2008-09 33.0 34.6 36.4 Services 27.0 27.3 27.4 27.6 27.6 GDP 100 100 100 100 100 The total budget revenue in th e five years (2006 -2010) would be 34.6 thousand billion Kip. The ratio of budget revenue to GDP would aver age at 14.8%. The total budget expenditure would reach 49.6 thousand billion Kip, averaging at 21.5% of GDP over th e five years. The budget deficit would reduce from 7.8% of GDP in 2005 to 5.8% in 2010. The total exports in the next five years w ould reach USD 3.48 billion, with annual average growth rate of 18.1%. The total imports in the next five years would reach USD 4.5 billion, with an annual average growth rate of 8.8%. The rate of infl ation (consumption prices) will average at about 6 - 6.5% per year. Social and Environmental Targets \u0083 Complete the establishment of compulsory primary education program nationwide; and to ensure that all children of school age are enrolled in primary schools. The Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 62enrolment rate of students in the middle level vocational schools and long-term study in vocational subjects will increase by 15%; \u0083 By 2010, the population growth rate should be reduced to 1.91% per year, with the absolute number projected at 6,170,000 people. \u0083 About 652,000 new jobs will be created with 20,000 workers sent abroad as labour export. \u0083 Reduce the number of poor households to below 15%; \u0083 Reduce the ratio of malnourished children under 5 years of ag e to less than 30%; \u0083 Reduce the infant mortality (of children under 1) to 55 per 1,000 live births; and the child mortality (of children under 5 years of age) to 75 per 1,000 live births; \u0083 Reduce the maternal mortality rate to 300/100,000 live births; \u0083 The supply of clean water to ru ral communities to cover 70%; \u0083 Maintain the accomplishment of entire er adication of opium cultivation; and \u0083 Raise the ratio of forest cover (all natural forest areas) to higher than 50% of the land area.

The reasons for setting the GDP growth rate to be 7.5-8 % are as follows : (i) The overall development target of Lao PD R by the year 2020 is to graduate from being an undeveloped country meaning th at the GDP per capit a must be higher than USD 1,000 in accordance with the UN standard. The average income per capita by the year 2010 will be higher than USD 700-750; (ii) The disparity in income per capita compared to other countries in the region (Laos USD 491 in 2005 as compared to China: USD1,000; must be resolved; (iii) To maintain the political sustainability and to ensure that the society has increasing resources and to upgrade th e living conditions of the people; (iv) Industrialization and modern ization has the purpose to eradicate poverty, meaning to increase the employment opportunities and increase the income s of the people. In order to quickly achieve these goals, the economic growth must be strongly supported; and (v) The need to uplift the status of our country to gradually become an equal development partner with other ASEAN countries and other countries in the region. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 65The above expected results ar e likely to be met because : (i) We have gained lessons and experien ce in implementing the Socio Economic Development Plans for many years; (ii) The country is rich in natural resource s that can be explored and utilized; (iii) The country is located in the central point providing strong economic linkages; (iv) Our culture and natural environment are facilitating players for development activities, such as tourism, trade and investment; (v) The labour force is plentiful and cheap, and there are abundant resources for power generation that are attractive for investors; (vi) More opportunities are open for our country for regional and global economic integration; and (vii) There is political and social stabili ty that is a favourable condition for development activities. Apart from this, there are fundamental economic sectors with successful outcomes, such as : Agriculture sector : There are high potentials in this sector, with the growth of this sector reaching 3-3.4% per year. More importantly , the value and quantity of production will increase quickly because of the development of processing industries and new export markets. The structure of agricultural production will also be changed by using more productive plant and animal breeds. In cont inuing the fundamental works laid down in the last (Fifth) five-year Plan the production of crops and industrial trees for export and distribution in the country have largely been in creasing, especially the plantation of trees and industrial crops to meet the demand of new ma rkets. This includes th e plantation of corn, tobacco, coffee, beans, rubber, cassava, sugar cane, vegetables, and many types of fruit. Industrial sector : The main products such as electrici ty for export, which is produced from six hydropower dams that are expected to be co nstructed and operated w ithin the Sixth Plan period is calculated at only 70% of the poten tial installed capacity of 3,000 MW. In addition, there are also high potentials of electricity that can be genera ted from about 6 - 8 small dams, which are capable of generating 600 - 800 MW. And the production of cement of one million tons has not yet been added into the total production capacity (Khammouane cement factory first phase with a production capacity of 600,000 tons per year ; Saravan cement factory with a production capacity of 300,000 tons per year; and two small-scale cement factories in Savannakhet province with a production capacity of 400,000 tons per year). The exploitation and processing of minerals of diffe rent types have also increased. Service sector : Tourism shows a rapid growth trend. A ccording to the stat istics on tourists entering the country, the number of tourists is about 1.7 million per year and the average period of their stay is about 5 days. The tour ism infrastructure development and the tourism atmosphere have been improved to facilitate th e tourism sector, encouraging more tourists to visit the country and increase the average stay to 8-10 days. Under the circumstances, the Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 66income from the tourism sector may increas e to a higher level and reach over USD 500 million per year on average. Therefore, these factors justify the GDP gr owth target of 7.5-8% per year, which is potentially achievable. 2. Tasks & Economic Balance The major tasks for achieving the goals a nd targets include achieving and maintaining balance at the macroeconomic level such as, in labour and employment, in investment, in the budget and between exports and imports.: The basic principles of the Sixth Plan (2006 -2010) and the fundamental economic balance are based on the following: \u0083 Development guidelines identified by the re solution of the 7th Party Congress in the ten-year Socio Economic Development Strategy (2001 - 2010); \u0083 Expectation of capabilities of development activi ties in the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) as mentioned above; \u0083 The various abundant development potentials that can be exploited and utilized to support economic balance in the future, such as: (i) the total pr oduction power of the society, especially the private sector both domestic and external; (ii) the strong potentials of the services sectors, such as tourism and other services of higher quality; (iii) the potentials of the labour force that have not yet been fully utilized; (iv) the ability in using advanced technologies and sc ience in development schemes; and (v) the possibilities for expanding potenti al domestic market channels; and \u0083 Economic integration and globalization that is taking place in a rapid and comprehensive manner creating new favourab le conditions for the macro-economic balance. a) Balance in Labour and Employment It is expected that the in the five-year period 2006-2010, the number of people who need employment will be 1,217 million, including ne w entrants to the labour force of 592,000 people, about 144,000 unemployed people remaining from the last five years, and about 485,000 unemployed people during the short peri od of 2005. In the five-year period 2006- 2010, it is expected that new employment opportunitie s will be able to meet the demand of 652,000 people (130,000 people per year), of which approximately 406,000 people will be employed in the agriculture and forestry sector, 102,000 in the industry and construction sector, and 144,000 in the service sector. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 67By 2010, approximately 3,366,000 people will be able to have access to employment opportunities of which approximately 2.486 million people will be employed in the agriculture and forestry s ector, 312,000 in the industry a nd construction sector, and 568,000 in the service sector. The sctoral share of empl oyment in the agriculture and forestry sector will drop from 76.6% in 2005 to 73.9% in 2010; while that in industry and handicrafts sector will increase from 7.7% to 9.3% and in service sector from 15.6% to 16.9%. The unemployment rate will reduce fr om 5% in 2005 to 3.8% in 2010. Each year approximately 5,000 labourers can be sent to work in fore ign countries meaning that in the next five years about 20,000 labourer s will be sent to work outside the country. b) Balancing investment In order to ensure the economic growth of 7.5-8%, a total investment of 73.9 thousand billion Kip is projected to be require d (incremental capita l-output ratio or ICOR equal to 4.2) to support the Sixth Plan (2006-2010). This is equivalent to about 32% of GDP, and the investment would increase at about 19.3% per y ear. The sources of investment include about 23.1 thousand billion Kip from the Governme nt budget accounting for 31.25% of the total investment in the society and equivalent to 10.0% of GDP. The investment from the private sector, both domestic and external, would cover the remaining 50.8 thousand billion Kip accounting for 68.75% of total investment or approximately 22.0% of GDP. As the investment in development schemes is the deciding factor for economic growth, mobilization of funds is therefore very important. In the next five years, it is expected that the ODA will be about USD 357 million per year on average. It is expected that USD 600 million of FDI will be mobilized each year. The mobilization of domestic savings is expected to reach about 51.3%, and the remaining fund of 48.7% will be directly invested by the local people. Therefore, in order to circulate the funds in the society, it is essential to improve the investment climate to be more attractive so as to create confidence and to encourage the people to invest by using their own funds to establish and expand their businesses. Furthermore, the Government will have to pay attention to the following measures: (i) Selling some assets (projects) or priva tize some state enterprises that are not necessary to be operated by the state and use the revenues to invest in other projects that are more necessary; (ii) Utilize private investments in such forms as build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) and build, operate and transfer (BOT) as well as other forms; (iii) Issue government bonds to inve st in large-scale projects in an effective manner. So far, the income from selling governmen t bonds has been used to fill different budget gaps, but in future in come from issuing long-term bonds will have to be used to invest in large-scale projects; (iv) Receiving assistance and soft loans from international sources; and (v) Intensively convert land a nd properties into capital. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 68The investment as a proportion of GDP in the la tter years of the Sixth Plan will increase quickly due to the rapid growth of the constr uction sector and financial liquidity for the investment projects in the industrial sector, especia lly for hydropower, mining, cement production and other projects. The investment will increase from 29% of GDP in 2005 to 34.3% in 2010. The overall resource envelope for th e Sixth Plan is summarized in Table V.3. Table V-3 Sixth Plan Resource Envelope Item Amount (billion Kip) Percent As % of GDP 5-Year Average2005 2010 Total investment Public investment 31.25% 10% Government budget 23.1 billion Kip ODA USD 1,785 million Private investment 50.8 billion Kip 68.75% 22% FDI USD 3,000 million With regard to the distribution of investment by sector, it is expected th at the industry sector will receive 31,000 billion kip accounting for 42 % of the total investment during the five- year period (2006 - 2010). The agriculture se ctor will receive 11,800 billion kip or 16 % of the total; the transport, pos t and construction s ector will receive about 19,200 billion kip (26%); the education and human resource develo pment sector will receive about 2,590 billion kip (3.5 %); the health sector will receive about 2,220 b illion kip (3 %); the science, technology and environment sector will receive about 14,80 billion kip (2%); the culture - information and sports sector will receive about 1,110 billion kip (1.5%), and the remaining sectors will receive about 4,430 billion kip (6%). The projected investment allocations by sectors are presented in Table V.4.

The state budget revenue collection is expected to increase fr om 14% of GDP in 2005 to 16.2% in 2010, or on average at 14.8% of GDP over the five-year period. The sources of the state budget revenue are: 12.500 billion kip (36.3% of the total revenue) from taxes, 10,000 billion kip (29%) from customs duties, 350 billion kip (1%) from land tax, 7,900 billion kip (23%) from real estate, an d 3,700 billion kip (10.8%) from external assistance. The total expenditure for the fi ve-year period will be about 49,600 billion kip, growing at 17.8% per year, which would be a two- fold increase over that in the last five-year period (2001-2005). The total expenditure will be about 21.4% of GDP on average, with the investment by the state at about 10% of GDP. The budget deficit over the Sixt h Plan period will be about 15,000 billion kip or 6.07% of GDP. The budget deficit will decrease gradually from 7.3% in 2004 to 5.8 % in 2010. The budget deficit will be financed mainly th rough foreign concessionary loans and the mobilization of domestic investments to a certain extent. The state budget data are summarized in Table V.5. Table V-5 State Budget during Sixth Plan Period (2006-2010) Item Amount (billion Kip) Percent Growth rate (% per annum) As % of GDP (5-year average) Total budget revenue 34,600 100.0% 19.9% 14.8% Revenue sources Taxes 12.500 36.3% Customs 29% Land tax 350 1% Real estate 7,900 23% 17.8% 21.4% Budget deficit 15,000 6.1% In order to accomplish the goals of the Sixth Pl an, the state budget needs to be balanced in a more positive manner by striving to increase the national revenue as mentioned above. Concurrently, the expenditure lines need also to be reviewed to apply strict controls, especially the expenditure for investment , administrative expenditure needs to be Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 70economized, solving the problem of extravagan t spending, reducing losses, elimination of compensation items, increasing the reserve, a nd more quickly reducing the budget deficit. The main measures to increase the state budget re venue are as follows: (i) Improve and establish the mechanisms of the administration of the various financial sectors, such as: customs, tax, real estate and treasury to be more effective. In the short-term, efforts have to be made to improve the values of political aspects, ethics, honesty, and devotion to duty and the nation among government staff and to upgrade the technical know-how of the staff; (ii) Revise and amend the Budget Law, clea rly identifying the obligations and responsibilities of different sectors and localities in financial administration activities, in order to enable the Govern ment to administer the budget in nationally uniform ways and to be able to allocate th e budgets for expenditure in the priority areas and balancing the budget de ficits of the localities; (iii) Improve the strengths and discipline in financial management , and control the limit of unplanned expenditure and unnecessary spending; (iv) Introduce the measures to keep the rate of increase of expenditure to be smaller than the rate of increase of GDP. Expenditure items must be adjusted appropriately in case the revenue collect ion does not meet the planned target; (v) Solving the fundamental and urgent probl ems, such as government staff salary payment; and (vi) The collection of taxes on natu ral resources must be str ong to increase the national revenue. e) Export-Import Balance The total value of exports in the five-year period (2006-2010) is expected to reach USD 3.48 billion, increasing on average by 18.1% per annum. In 2010, the total value of exports is expected to reach USD 1,046 million, a 2.2 fold increase over that in 2005 and a 3.22 fold increase over that in 2001. Exports per capita would reach about USD 187 by 2005. The total imports in the five -year period (2006-2010) are estimated to reach USD 4.5 billion, increasing on average by 8.8% per annum. In 2010, the imports would reach USD 1.045 million reaching a balance with exports (USD 1,046 million). The trade deficit in the next five-year pe riod (2006-2010) would be about USD 1.02 billion, equivalent to 29.3% of the export value, or 5% of GDP (as compared to 8.4% of GDP in 2005). As indicated earlier under the Overall Goals, the other tasks for the Sixth Plan are to: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 71(i) Restructure the economy and employment and accelerate in the direction of improving effectiveness and bring into pl ay the comparative advantages of goods, sectors and regions. This is to be ac complished through improvements in quality, effectiveness and competitiveness of each commodity and enterprise, and the economy as a whole; (ii) Further develop the multi-faceted economy, with the public sector playing a decisive role in facilitating the development of all businesses, including household businesses and domestic private, foreign an d collective enterprise, to improve the market economic mechanism with a social ist orientation. This will include the creation of a fair, transparent, stable, open and highly competitive environment for private investment and business; (iii) Encourage the development of the networ k of small and medium enterprises to increase domestic resource mobilisa tion, investment, economic output and employment;; (iv) Increase investment in socio-economic development and strengthen accountability mechanisms to ensure more efficient us e of public investment resources. An optimal investment structure will be bu ilt to make the economic mechanism work effectively and be competitive. It is also visualised to improve the infrastructure, investing appropriately in the main economic areas, and providing more investment to distressed areas; (v) Expand and improve foreign trade, with a favourable environment created for the growth of exports, and attract investment and technology from abroad. The country intends to actively integrate into the international economy, on a cautious but effective schedule, implementing bilateral and multilateral commitments at national, local and business levels; (vi) Continue reforms to make the financial and monetary systems healthy, improving the national capacity, financial resources, and economic performance in all areas. The stability of all macro-economic indi cators will be main tained, controlling inflation and the budget defic it, and gradually building and expanding the credit market to meet the socio-economic development needs; (vii) Continue reforms to make basic and co mprehensive changes in education and training, science and technology, to improve the quality of human resources with optimal structure; to provide elementary education for all; and utilize modern technology in the more advanced areas such as economic centres and urban areas; (viii) Develop the economy in harmony with social development and environmental protection; creating jobs, decreasing th e number of unemployed people, solving effectively social issues, including re ducing significantly the number of poor households, caring for credited people, ensuring equitable access to health services, fighting the social evils, and im proving the quality of life and morals of the people; (ix) Speed up administrative reforms in the direction of reforming and improving effectiveness, and making relations w ith residents and businesses public and transparent. Bureaucracy and corruption wi ll be reduced. A fundamental reform of the civil service salaries system will be implemented; and (x) Keep the socio-political situ ation stable to maintain an environment conducive to national defence, security and overall development. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 72VI. MACRO DIRECTIONS A. Introduction The macro directions and aggregates are based on the (a) development di rections set out in the Ten-Year Socioeconomic Developmen t Strategy (2001-2010) and the long-term guidelines and orientation set out by the 7th Party Congress; (b) economic targets for the five years 2006-2010 as indicated above; and (c) fu ller utilization, among others, of the (i) plentiful resources, including especially attract ing investments for development from abroad and from different businesses in the country; (ii) significant potential in the services sector, particularly in tourism and other high-quality se rvices; (iii) substantial (hidden) potential in human resources; (iv) prospects for introducing innovations in science and technology in all sectors and regions, in conjunc tion with the economic integrat ion process that has already started; (v) scope for rapidl y enlarging the market for Lao goods and services; (vi) intensification and deepening of the pace of international integration; a nd (vii) facilitating the implementation of sound macroeconomic manage ment in the direction of improving the socio-economic situation comprehensively, foster ing the active and progressive participation of the country in labour deploymen t and international coordination. B. Monetary Policy The overall objective of monetary policy in the ne xt five years is to control inflation and to ensure the safety of the banking and credit orga nizations, in order to stabilize the investment environment and strengthen economic development. The specific objective is to implement a flexible and cautious monetary policy to stabilize the Kip and keep inflation in single digits per annum during the Sixth Plan period ( 2006-2010). The monetary policy is operated through the regulation of money supply and open market operations to smoothen unduly large fluctuations in the Baht and Dollar flows. In addition, the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) is (to be) given the authority for trading bonds issued by BOL to regulate the amount of money in circulation. The BOL will establish Units in charge of managi ng available capital in order to define and assess market demand, and adjust the purchase of fixed duration bonds and Government bills between BOL and comm ercial banks, through open-market operations. An Open-market Operations Management Board would be established to enable open-market operations to become the adjustment channel for the overall payment means in the economy. The Government will issue relevant regulations to utilize capital repl enishment tools in the early years of the Sixth Plan. Th e tools will include the provisions for capital replenishment, discount, overdraft and deposits. They will help supplement other tools such as the key interest rates of BOL, enabling the BOL to gain strength in moderating the fluctuations in market interest rates. A controlled floating exchange rate regime is being implemented successfully keeping the Kip relatively stable vis-\u00e0-vis other currencies including the Baht and the Dollar. This will be Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 73continued. BOL would promptly assess and decide on the exchange rate for the Kip, to help facilitate payments and minimize expenses for printing and circulation. With relative stability in the exchange rate in recent years, the c onfidence in the Kip has been increasing. This would facilitate the further st rengthening of the position of the Kip in the payment system during the next five years. Simultaneously, it is planned to continue to limit the over-use of the US Dollar in the economy, and strengthen control over the foreign exchange to accumulate more foreign reserves in the BOL. Higher denomination Kip notes (50,000 and 100,000) would be issued to facilitate payments in larger transact ions. The stipulations on foreign exchange management and implementation would be dissem inated to enterprises and the people. The target is to decrease the shar e of foreign currency in the total money supply from 65 percent in 2005 to 30 percent in 2010. 3 It is essential to improve the capabilities of the BOL for developing and analyzing the payment balances, defining the national fore ign exchange reserves, and managing the exchange rate. The target is to continue to accumulate and maintain the foreign exchange reserves to be equal to at l east three months of imports. C. Financial Sector 1. Banking Sector One of the important objectives in the financial sector is to continue to refine the legal framework for the banking sector to better meet the needs of the fast developing economy including its increasing international integrat ion. Laws on Banking and credit organizations would be modified and supplemented to serve as the basis for the deve lopment of the capital markets. The financial capability of commercial banks would continue to be strengthened, with a move towards the full implementation of internationally accepted rules and standards on banking activities. The operations of the commercial banks will be guided toward the provision of improved credit services to the econom y based on the princi ples of safety, efficiency and self- sustainability. Priority would be given to supporting the produ ction, processing and marketing of key products/goods in the agricultu re sector and in rural areas. The commercial banks will be encouraged to expand the provision of credit to profitable and effective projects. 3 The widespread use of the Baht and the Dollar in the Lao economy has significant costs both in terms of the one-time seignorage losses and the recurring interest fore gone on these currencies he ld in the country. Thus, reducing their use over time is beneficial for the economy. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 74The dynamism of the commercial banks will be improved by reducing the interventions by relevant authorities in their operations. Improvements will be achieved in the procedures and practices of commercial banks for the provi sion of loans. Monitoring and adjusting mechanisms in providing loans by commercial banks will be based on asset ownership (collateral). They will be encouraged to diversify monetary and banking services. The development of capital markets and foreign exchange trading among commercial banks will enhance the capacity of the state-owned comm ercial banks (SOCBs) including in lending. The staff skills will be improved to support th e activities of commercial banks and ensure strict monitoring and evaluation of the commercial bank system. The Government will monitor SOCBs and enforce adherence to government agreements. There will be an examination of the accoun ting system to bring it up to international standards. There will be some changes in the classification of debts of the SOCBs based on international standards. Regulations will be enforced widely and these include shark loans, exchanges, guarantees and other co nditions in order to allow creditors to collect their debts, including through confiscation and sale of the debtors' proper ties. There will be improved assessment of the creditworthiness of borrowers and increased monitoring of the loans by the banks to reduce loan losses. Transparency will be taken seriously in evaluating debt amounts accurately. The Government is committed to recapitalise the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) through the provision of about 700 billion Kip in 2006 and 2007. The restructuring and strengthening of the SOCBs will continue, espe cially the three major ones (Banque Pour Le Commerce Exterieur Lao, the Lao Development Bank and the Agricultu re Promotion Bank) building upon the results of the diagnostic financial audits of the institutions. The Government is also exploring the feasibility of partial privatization/joint ownership of the Lao Development Bank. The Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB) will be transformed into a self-sustaining, market- oriented rural financial institution. A variety of micro-finance institutions will be encouraged. The Policy Statement, the Industry Assessme nt and Action Plan developed by the Rural Microfinance Committee were endorsed in ea rly 2004 by the Prime Minister's Office. The Policy and action plan aim to promote a sustaina ble development of micr ofinance industry by encouraging microfinance institutions to have diverse forms and ow nership and discourage subsidized credits. The judicial foundations and re gulations to support the impl ementation of lending by SOCBs will be strengthened based on common policies, in order to eliminate free loans and investments that do not comply with commercial practices. The BOL will continue improving and creating regulations related to, among others, the monitoring of the operations of the commercial banks and their loans based on their capital, Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 75assets, management, earnings and liquidity (C AMELs) ratios.4 There wi ll be a study on the feasibility of initially putting in place an advance warning system, based on the Basel Principles, especially on forecasting the interest and profit trends, prices of services and the growth of loans. Monitoring of the SOCBs will utilize modern technology. It is planned to assess BOL's capacity to pay interest on the mandatory reserves of commercial banks (and other fina ncial intermediaries) deposited with BOL. The assessment is to be based on the revenue resources of BO L, derived through the management of foreign currency funds, and the effectiveness of th e tools in the open-ma rket operations and repayment operations. The Government plans to gradually eliminate pr eferences for State-owne d banks. At the same time, State-owned banks would be required to stop their direct involvement in the business activities of commercial banks. The banking services such as savings and loans will be developed further and the operatio ns will be modernized adopti ng the e-transaction systems. Investments in inter-bank settlement, credit payment mechanisms and the deployment of a number of new services will be increased. The fi nancial services will be diversified and their quality and quantity improved, ther eby increasing their contribution to the value added in the services sector. The communications modalities in the financial and banking systems will be modernised to make the servic es courteous and expeditious. The Government plans to develop and increase the quality of the people's credit system. Regulations on peoples' credit funds (inc luding Village Development Funds) will be announced to suit the special needs of the social economy and the population. Loans will continue to be provided for pe ople to help build independent associations on the basis of volunteerism, self-relian ce and self-motivation. 2. Insurance The registration capital (requirement) for insura nce agencies will be increased, to enhance their financial capacity incl uding reimbursement to busine sses for insured losses. The insurance businesses will be encouraged to study new products and diversify their services; especially those catering to th e agriculture, forestry and fisheries programmes. Professional financial management, including especially risk assessment and information technologies will be modernized to provide better services. The ca pacity of the Government authorities will be strengthened in order to cl osely monitor the implementation of the Law on Insurance, regulate the insurance companies and protect customer rights. 4 The CAMELs ratios comprise the prudential indicators of the adequacy of bank capital, the quality of bank assets, the efficiency of bank management, the robustness of bank earnings, the adequacy of bank liquidity, and the bank's coverage of market risk. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 763. Information and Coordination The monetary and banking information system will be improved to track the movement of money and provide solutions. Government offi cials will receive trai ning to upgrade their skills in analyzing monetary developments, in cluding impacts from interest rate changes, inflation, and economic growth, in order to build the foundati ons for investments, profits from interest, material prices and other financial policies. There will be firm cooperation between ministries and sectors, especially on annual financial and monetary policies, and in implementing the macro policies. The information system will be upgraded in each ministry and sector based on integrating the databases in ministries, sectors and the Government overall, to ensure adequate sources of in formation for the macro- environment. The legal requirements will be comp leted for BOL to coordinate with relevant ministries and sectors in calculating prici ng tables, instalments and other data based on international standards. The Government will pr ovide guidelines to the Ministry of Finance and BOL in order to create fi rm cooperation between annual fiscal policies and monetary policies for further contribution to stabilize the macro economy. 4. Legal Framework The drafting and finalizing of the legal framew ork that better fits the socialist-oriented economy of the Lao PDR and is in line with the commitments on integration and opening markets will be completed. This will help es tablish a base for business development in all economic sectors. It will ensure the systematic implementation of fair, consistent and stable financial sector policies across all economic sect ors and groups. 5. Financial Market Development There will be a comprehensive plan to expand the financial market in the initial years of the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) in accordance with the directions of safety, tight management monitoring and benefit protection for all targ et groups, who invest in the Lao financial market. There will be a focus on developing a financial capital market first by referring to the contribution of resources into business activi ties including monetary, foreign exchange, property and other unique ways of c onversion of resources into capital. The financial markets will be expanded with tr ansparency in short-term capital swapping and trading of currencies. Relationships between monetary and financial markets, policies, accounting management mechanisms and progre ss monitoring will be strengthened. The development of a market for State bonds is still at an initia l stage. Resear ch will be undertaken for improving market strengths through assessing the real returns (benefits). This will help reflect any turbulent changes in the market value of the State bonds. Several tasks will be implemented at the beginning of the Sixth Plan, such as conducting tenders for selling State bonds through Lao banks and targeted purch asers, obtaining approval of the National Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 77Assembly for a clear domestic borrowing (state bond selling) plan with the annual budgets, showing ownership, dividing the bonds into s ub-groups, and informing commercial banks to maintain funds to purchase State bonds at the beginning of the year. Research will help in the experi ment of establishing a stock market in Vientiane Capital City by the end of the final year of the Sixth Plan. D. Fiscal Management 1. Fiscal Management The overall objective is to implement a po licy on sound State Budget striving for higher revenues and prudent expenditures. The fiscal policy will aim at increasing revenue mobilization to reach about 17-18 percent of GDP by 2010. Expenditure will be allocated more appropriately, carrying out measures to revitalize financ e-budget activities, and to cut down the budget deficit to a safe ratio. Budge t revenue collection performance will be increased with concerted efforts to impr ove customs and tax administration. Stronger monitoring mechanisms will be developed to monitor revenue collection and central-local coordination on revenue collection will be improved. The measures to achieve the targets are to first establish a legal framework governing the state budget and finance includi ng the following: (i) the amendm ent of the State Budget Law to enhance the powers and responsibilities of central and local authorities in budget management, with the clear decentralization of financial administration to ensure the decisive role of the central budget, and at the same time promote self-c ontrol at the lo cal level; (ii) implement the revised Tax law and tax policies to ensure State budget revenues; carry out studies to modify tax-exemption policies to f it the current national context; and establish the necessary legal framework to ensure the collecti on of state budget reve nues and create a development environment for the financial and cap ital markets: and (iii) widely disseminate (popularize) the relevant laws/regulations and coordinate closely with all relevant authorities to implement them. The budget administration s hould be considered a responsibility of the entire Government and the people. Second, to firmly implement measures in budget management including the following: (i) on the revenue side, enhance revenue regulation, implement imme diately measures to avoid revenue losses (in terms of both the number of tax-payers and amount of revenue), and definitely abolish arbitrary tax exemptions that do not comply with the law; and definitely terminate the provision of loans from the State budget or the Government underwriting of loans to state-owned enterprise s (SOEs); (ii) on the expenditure side, line ministries and authorities would have to follow the spendi ng plans in the budget approved by the National Assembly, with no entity or individual exer cising the right to decrease budget revenue or increase expenses without jurisdiction; and in case there are ad-hoc expenses, these would be covered by reallocation of spending to ensure budget balance; (iii) on investment capital, continue to implement the approved or to-be- approved foreign-assisted projects; with the Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 78selection and signing of only the priority FDI projects, and allocate sufficient counterpart funds for such projects; and repa y (capital construction) debts; and (iv) on regular (recurrent) spending, review expenditure items and establis h spending criteria th at match the national context and the budget, which will serve as a basis for cutting down subsidized expenses. Improve the salaries of civil se rvants, and prioritise education, training and social activities. Adapt specific measures for savings in expenditu res, especially in administrative expenses. Third, it is agreed that the Ministry of Fina nce will take the lead role in managing foreign debts. Localities (Provinces, Municipalities and Districts) ar e not permitted to borrow from foreign countries. It is essential to promptly settle public debts to revitalize financial and budget activities. Adequate budget w ill be allocated to service foreign debts according to the commitments. Relevant authorities would be proactive in negotiating debt conversion (including write-off), extension of repayment peri od, reduction in interest rate, etc., especially on loans for re-lending. Also, domestic debts will be classified and proper measures will be taken to solve current debts a nd prevent a rise in debts. Fourth, monitoring against the lo ss of State revenues, properti es and expenditures will be strengthened. The enforcement of financial disc ipline will be furthe r enhanced, strictly dealing with cases that break regulations on the management of budget receipts and payments, for example, tax-exemptions not acco rding to jurisdiction, sl ow payments to the Treasury, and spending beyond the manda te of policies and regulations. Fifth, the decentralization mech anism in terms of budget management between central and local authorities will be renovated and refined to improve the State management of finance. The limited State budget resources and a lack of tight financial di scipline require the reorganization of the tax and fee collecting organizations a nd the State budget management organizations (State Treasury) aimed at receiv ing the right and full am ounts of taxes and fees on time. Firstly, Customs and the State Treasury in the Ministry of Finance would be organised systematically from the centre to the localities, with the centre responsible for overall management, including the number of personnel and salaries. The tax collection organizations will be made accountable for th e loss of revenues from taxes. As indicated earlier, the Budget Law will be modified, dece ntralizing the revenue resources between the centre and the localities. Basically, branches of the central tax organization would be in charge of collecting all the tax receipts of the entire centre and those decentralized between the centre and local budgets. Tax offices of the lo calities in the Department of Finance will be in charge of collecting the local tax receip ts. The budget will be managed effectively with adequate controls on the receipt and payment activities of organizati ons and localities. The fiscal sector including Customs and Treasury will be modernized in order to improve the effective management of state budget activities. The training of financial staff will be strengthened as indicated in fiscal budget management for the entire country in the next stage. Domestic resource mobilisation has to be increased. Bottlenecks will be removed to increase domestic investment and to develop a competitive market. The institutions needed to better enforce contracts and other property rights have to be developed. These are essential pre-Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 79requisites for developing an effective financial system. Remittances from overseas Lao Nationals and workers will be encouraged. 2. Some Important Initiatives in 2005/06 a) Measures to Implement Customs and Tax Laws The revised Laws on Tax and Customs have been adopted by the National Assembly (NA) in May 2005. The revision of the Law on Value-Adde d Tax (VAT) has been completed and will be submitted to the National Assembly. Tax Law : The revised Tax Law will be disseminated to businesses, civil servants and all citizens to ensure that every sector fully co mplies with the law. In addition, training and advice will be provided to facilitate compliance. The Tax Department is responsible for accura tely surveying all businesses throughout the country in order to achieve the revenue target effectively. The tax coll ection administration of all businesses will be improve d by using the vouchers/receipt s defined by the Law and the responsibility of tax collection (in transactions) will be transf erred to businesses. All people will be encouraged to obtain accurate receipts of purchases, which will improve tax monitoring. Studies will be conducted to define taxable items and the amount of tax to be placed on imports and exports, in order to dr aw up a tax payment verification paper. All businesses that meet the requirements will be encouraged to keep the necessary accounts according to the Law; and these accounts must be processed as defined in Article 41 of the Tax Law. Coordination will be enhanced with provincial accounting offices to monitor and take action against any enterprise with account s that do not comply with the regulations. The Tax Department, in coordination with other concerned departments, will monitor all companies and projects that have been grante d tax exemptions on imported goods, to ensure that these items are used as intended. All newl y established duty-free shops will be monitored to ensure that they comply with regulations . An investigation committee will be set up to investigate smuggling cases, with the right to ta ke action to solve the cases according to the Law. The Tax Department will study ways to improve the information system to ensure the effective implementation of the revised Tax Law. For example to (i) have a computerized tax declaration system; (ii) supply information on taxable goods; (iii) link all border and provincial offices and departments; and (iv) supply the necessary statistical data to the tax offices. Customs Law : The revised Customs Law will be disseminated nationwide to civil servants, private sector and entrepreneurs, and tr aining and advice will be provided on its implementation. Incentive/bonus will be given to sectors and localities that are able to generate incomes from the coll ection of custom dutie s and taxes (import and export) at 0.5 percent of the collected revenue (except special charge for timb er, electricity, etc.). The Tax Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 80Department will study ways to improve and expand the information system to all border and provincial offices to ensure the effec tive implementation of the revised Law. The Finance Control Department and local Finan ce Control offices in association with other related Departments and Offices will monitor the performance of each Department, Provincial Finance Office, Border Post and enterprise on a regular basis; seek productive lessons learned; look into performance results ; prevent all forms of negative phenomena; and solve anticipated outstanding problems in the fiel d of finance. All newl y established duty-free shops will be monitored to ensure that their op erations comply with re gulations and if these regulations are breached the matter will be presente d to higher authorities. No custom officers or authorities are exempt from customs duties. In cooperation with all concerned sectors, an investigation committee will be set up to inve stigate smuggling cases, such as illegally imported vehicles and goods. This committee will have the right to take action and measures according to the law to comprehensively resolve the cases. b) Public Expenditure Review A review of the public expenditu re has been undertaken to examine the expenditure trends between 2002 and 2005 to support the Governme nt's efforts to establish sound, accountable and transparent financial management prac tices. The public expenditure review (PER) provided inputs to the formulation of the 2006 state budget and th e pilot Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the period 2006-2010. The main objectives of the PER are to: (i) review the macro fiscal performance as well as the intra- and inter sectoral allocation of public spending at the central and local levels for the period 2002-2005; (ii) assess the sustainability of the macr o fiscal framework and budget financing by source for the pe riod 2006-2010; (iii) review the institutional framework for public expenditure management (PEM) to su pport the Government's ongoing efforts to strengthen PEM (see the next sub- section for details); and (iv) conduct intra-sectoral analysis of public resources for NGPES/N SEDP priority sectors by assessing the quality of core public services, the efficiency in their delivery and the budget execution processes in place, especially at the local level. The report is being finalized. The Government intends to implement a rol ling programme of PERs, public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) and analytical work geared to monitoring progress in the implementation of the Public Expenditure Ma nagement Strengthening Programme or PEMSP (see next sub-section) and assessing the improve ments in fiscal management and the impact of public spending in key sectors. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 81c) Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Programme The overall objective of the Public Expend iture Management Strengthening Programme (PEMSP) is to achieve sound financial manageme nt in a transparent and accountable manner. The PEMSP has been formulated in consultation with and assistance from the partners in development. It is supported by the World Bank (IDA) through the Financial Management Capacity Building Credit. The Programme focuses on improvements in five main areas: (i) fiscal planning and budget preparation; (i i) budget execution, accounting and financial reporting; (iii) local government financial management; (iv) fina ncial legislation and regulatory framework; and (v) capacity build ing. The Programme covers the four main Departments - Fiscal Policy, Budget, Treasury a nd Accounting - in the Ministry of Finance and their counterparts at the local level; and it will be implemented during the Sixth Plan period (2006-2010). The Government has operationalised the Progr amme and presented the first Annual Work Plan for FY 2005/06 to partners in de velopment on 22 November 2005. A Steering Committee based in the Ministry of Finance has been established, that is responsible for the management of the Programme. An Implementation Committee and three Thematic Task Forces have been formed to deal with technica l aspects. And to assist in the coordination of the programme, a Secretariat under the leadership of a Programme Director has been set up in the Ministry of Finance. The PEMSP is based on a strategy where all na tional stakeholders in Public Financial Management will be involve d in the formulation of activities through consultative workshops at provincial and centr al levels. The strategy aims at having a national understanding of PEMSP; a national co nsensus on priorities, strategy, outputs and approach; and to ensure that the programme addresses the public financial management (PFM) problems on the ground as they arise. A ll departments in MOF have been consulted during the first months of 2006. Three provincial workshops have been held to allow all provinces and a number of districts to familia rize them with the programme, learn about new developments, exchange experiences in PFM, and discuss their needs for assistance from the programme. All the information on the programme will be shared with development partners through regular meetings in a Consultative Foru m. Based on the provincial workshops and consultations with departments and stakehol ders, a draft programme document has been prepared for discussion and endorsement at the upcoming national workshop. The program document contains short and long-term strategi es and a five-year budge t. A PEMSP pilot will be launched in Xiengkhouang Province in c ooperation with Governance and Public Administration Reform (GPAR) Programme. E. Real Estate (Property) Market Development The legal framework to develop a real estate (p roperty) market that includes land acquisition and home-owners' rights will be completed. Th e conditions for transferring the ownership of land and other property rights wi ll be made more favourable. Opportunities will be opened for citizens and enterprises, who wish to be in volved in the property sector and obtain long-Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 82term rights to utilize land in production and business for improving living conditions. There will be a focus on land for agriculture and on de veloping farms with large or medium-scale parcels in some areas with good conditions. A revision of the records related to land use will be undertaken in order to identify land acquisi tion without benefits or without objectives by state enterprises, state and social organizations. The utilization of land within urban areas will be reviewed and appropriate directives will be issued for enterprises and people to pursue. The dissemination of regulations related to land acquisition for both Lao and foreign persons will be continued to attract funds from various sources, and to meet the demand for accommodation, especially houses for citizens w ho provide excellent achievement for the country, and for families with low incomes. F. Trade Strategies and Re gional and Global Integration The objectives are to (i) accelera te the export of commodities and participation in regional and international economic activ ities, through the development of the export of goods with a high and stable growth, to serve as a driving force for the whole economy; (ii) secure an adequate source of foreign currency to activel y import sufficient materials and equipment for production; (iii) create stable markets for some competitive agricultural and industrial products; (iv) increase the market share in existing markets; a nd (v) improve the accessibility of new markets. 1. Exports a) Export Guidelines The export development guidelines in the Plan period are to support the production and export of important products; a nd to actively develop other pot ential products into new key exports. The exports of high value-added pr oducts, processed products , high-end technology products, and key products which are known in th e world markets will be increased; whilst reducing the share of raw materials/products in total exports. The value of exports in 2010 is projected to be USD 1,046 m illion (about USD 116 per person) or 2.2 times that in 2005. b) Composition of Exports Agriculture, forestry and aquatic products: The growth of exports in this sector is estimated to be 13 percent per annum during 2006-2010. Most agricultural products are prone to wide price fluctuations in the international markets. Therefore, the likely share of the exports from the sector in the total exports wi ll be around 27-28 percent. In the next five years, the products of this sector will be im proved in terms of productivity, quality and value. To achieve this objective, there is a need to invest appropriately in high quality and high yielding seeds and post-harvest technologies to bring about breakthroughs in productivity and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 83quality. Attention would be paid to the genetic, processing, storage/preservation, sanitation, packaging, transport and dist ribution levels; and then to the value added aspects. The prospects for some key export products are discussed briefly in the following: Coffee generates significant export revenue. Its share in total exports would stay at 3-4 percent. Most coffee exported to Western Europe and Japan is in the raw form. Lao coffee is famous for its flavour and taste. Unfortunatel y, the competitive advantage of Lao coffee is still limited due to the lack of investment in post-harvest proce ssing that leads to low quality and a 10 percent price discount in the world markets. Even under the General System of Preference (GSP), Lao coffee is still underdeveloped. It is estimated that the value of coffee exports will grow at a rate of 8 percent per annum. Wood and wood products : At present, many Lao companies are facing a shortage of raw materials due to the new policy th at restricts logging via the a pplication of a quota system. It is estimated that, in the coming years, the expor t of these products will grow at 7-9 percent per annum. Light industry and handicrafts : The most dominant products in this group are textiles and handicrafts. In 2005, the group generated export revenues accounting for more than 26 percent of total exports. It is expected to reach USD 195 million in 2010, with the share declining to 24.4 percen t of the total. Textiles : Textiles exports are labour intensive. But they face sti ff competition in terms of quality, and prices, and especially quotas. The te xtile export markets are mainly in the EU (France, Germany and Great Britain) thanks to GSP. For example, in 2003, exports under GSP comprised more than 90 percent of total ex port turn-over of Lao textiles. However, there is strong competition from other countries, especial ly China. The export turn-over of textiles is projected to increase by 5 percent on average during the next five years. Handicrafts and artefacts : These are mostly costumes made of silk and cotton; and bamboo furniture. The export markets for these products , under GSP, are rather stable, but export turn-over and competitiveness are still limited. Mo st of the products will be exported to the EU, Japan and the USA. Raw Materials, Energy and Minerals : By 2010, this sector will account for 44.6 percent of the total export turn-over, Dominant commod ities are electricity and minerals (gypsum, gold, etc.), which have rather stable export capacit ies and play an important role in Lao exports. The export of electricity plays an important role in the total e xport turn-over. In 2001, it was 28 percent and declined to 26 percent of th e total in 2005. The major export market is Thailand, followed by Vietnam and Cambodia. Electricity export turn- over is planned to grow at a rate of 18-25 percent per annum, esp ecially in the latter years of the Sixth Plan (2006-2010).The mineral sector ex ports are projected to grow by between 18 and 20 percent per annum during 2006-2010. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 84 c) Export Markets One of the main objectives in the developmen t of the export market during 2006-2010 is the expansion and diversification of markets, while strengthening the present position in existing markets. This is also part of the long-term st rategy to utilize all opport unities in the region and the rest of the world to maintain the su stainable development of exports in order to effectively contribute to the socio-economic development of the co untry. The quality of products for export has to be upgraded, in order to increase competitive ability. In the five year period 2006-2010, Asia will conti nue to be a focal market for Lao exports, accounting for between 55 percent a nd 60 percent of the total expo rt turn-over. The share of exports to the EU market would be strengthened to 28-30 percen t; Australia to 10-12 percent; and the USA and Africa to 3-4 percent. The empha sis will be on focal markets, such as the ASEAN; China, Japan, Taiwan and Korea; the EU, Switzerland and Russia in Europe; Australia; the U.S.; and South Africa. 2. Imports a) Guiding Principles The guiding principles are to prioritize impo rts of materials, equipment and advanced technology for industrialization, to enhance the competitiveness of locally produced commodities and increase exports. It is necessary to make full use of locally made materials and equipment to save foreign currency, to im prove production levels; and to limit imports of consumption products. The composition of import s will be shifted towards increasing the share of machinery and industrial equipment; with the share of imports for investment projects increasing from 40.3 percent in 2005 to 44.7 percent in 2010; and that of raw materials and fuel decreasing from 48.4 percent in 2005 to 44.6 percen t in 2010. Import turn- over in the five years is estimated to be US D 4.5 billion, increasing on average at 8.8 percent per annum. The imports would increase fr om USD 686 million in 2005 to USD 1,045 million in 2010. b) Market Sources A secure supply of machinery, equipment, spare parts, raw materials a nd fuel is required to best respond to the needs of the basic economic infrastructure, local production including for export, and consumer demand. Accordingly, th e selection of the import sources (markets) must ensure quality, applicability an d diversification to reduce risk. In the five-year period 2006-2010, the share of im ports from the Asian market would reduce from 80 percent to 75 percent, while that of th e EU markets should incr ease to 18-20 percent; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) the USA market share at 2-3 percent; a nd Oceania and African market share at around 2- 3 percent. In Asia, the focal markets are th e ASEAN countries (par ticularly Thailand and Vietnam), China, Japan and Korea. Trade relati ons with the EU as well as non-EU countries in Europe (Norway, Switzerland and Russia) should be further developed. Other major import markets are Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa. 3. Trade Balance The trade deficit in the five-year period 2006-2010 is projected to be about USD 1.02 billion, which is equivalent to 29.3 percent of to tal export turn-over, or 5 percent of GDP. 4. Trade Development Strategies The Government will formulate and implement programmes and projects on the development of key exports. The export volume of commodi ties, especially locally produced ones, which already have established export markets, will be increased. M easures will be applied to improve the quality of exports to meet market demand. Mechanisms to promote exports such as export credit, export awards, trade prom otion, and border market development will be formulated and implemented. The Government has been formulating an ex port development strategy, covering among others, tourism, garments, medicinal herbs, or ganic (agricultural) pr oducts, silk, handicrafts and wood products. This is being undertaken in parallel with a Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study under the Integrated (Trade) Framework (IF-DTIS). A draft matrix of follow-up actions has been formulated to implement se veral trade facilitation activities with support from the partners in development including under the Integrated Trade Framework. Increased efforts will be made in acquiring information on developments in the world markets as well as the timely dissemination of information to exporters. Advice would be provided to factories so that they can deploy market promo tion, market expansion, and the development of brand names. Efforts will be made to convince all businessmen to be involved in promoting the exports of highl y processed and high technology products. The export management mechanism will continue to be refined in line with regional and international economic activitie s, to facilitate the successful management of trade. The competitiveness of commodities, services, enterprises and the overall economy will be raised. The avenues will be explored to continue to reduce the production costs of products, and increase the quality and competitiveness of exports. It will promote investment in new technology; increase the value and quality of processed produc ts; and reduce the volume of products sold through middle agents. Enhanced efforts will be made to control smuggling, illegal trading, and th e production and sale of counterfeits. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 86The tax and fee collection systems will be review ed in order to solve any issues in a timely manner. It will create a favourable environmen t through implementing the rules and laws for import-export enterprises. The policy on import duties will be implemented to comply with the processes of participa tion in regional and internat ional economic activities. The international trade activities will continue to be promoted, firstly with countries in the region. An overall plan and a road map will be formulated with proper time lines, which are suitable to the development stag e of the Lao PDR and compatible with the requirements of international organizations in which the country participates. It will promote the implementation of CEPT/AFTA and actively nego tiate to gain accession to WTO during the Plan period. 5. Regional and Global Integration The Government will continue to implement tran sitional policies by cooperating with partner countries. It will extend bila teral and multi-lateral agreemen ts; formulate and improve the draft laws with respect to mutual deve lopment; maintain friendship and long term relationships with the parties to the contracts in order to effectively contribute to the socio- economic development. With regards to international integration, the Sixth Plan (2 006-2010) objective is to fully implement the integration roadmap and commitme nts for the country to become a prestigious member of international organizations (including WTO) and in multilateral relationships such as AFTA and GMS. The trade and cooperation a rrangements that generate more benefits will be explored, minimizing the constraints that impede socio-economic development. AFTA tariff reductions will be implemented on time. The institutions and capacities of staff will be adjusted and strengthened to meet the modernization requirements and to comply with the WTO regul ations. Enterprises will be advised to find ways to reduce the cost of their products; increase the quality and competitiveness of each product; and create bra nd names to compete effectively as the protection barriers are removed. G. Labour and Employment 1. Labour Force and Employment Various measures will be impl emented to upgrade the quality and productivity of the labour force; and mobilize all potential workers fo r national development during the Sixth Plan period (2006-2010). The target is to provide additional employment for 652,000 people during the next five years, with an annual average of more than 130,000. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 87 Efforts will be made to continue to reduce the proportion of labour in agriculture, forestry and fisheries to below 73.9 percent, increase the labour in industry a nd construction to at least 9.3 percent, and that in the serv ices to 16.9 percent by 2010. The focus will be on providing additional em ployment and developing human resources, through the formulation of additional polices to promote the economic sectors to increase investment to develop professiona l skills, in particular for th e light industry and industrial processing, which are labour-int ensive. The mechanisms for the promotion of vocational training for workers to increase employability will be announced, and the domestic and foreign private sector will be encouraged to take part in vocational training. Funds will be mobilized from different sources including the Government, othe r domestic sources, foreign aid and FDI, to solve the unemployment problem s. The funds will be utilised to promote employment in industry and rural areas. A policy on the employment of youth in rural areas and minority groups will be formulated. The employment network and technical skills will be improved. The development of the skills of the rural youth and the employment of young people will be supported. The training centres in the Northern, Central and Southern regions will be developed to help the provinces to increase the employability of people. Market testing work will be carried out for some occupations in the local areas particularly in Vientiane and Champasak, the labour markets will be developed linking them to general pl anning. The mobility of rural populations is increasing through commuting, and temporary and permanent migration to urban areas. This will help reduce income variability by providing employment during the off-season in agriculture. Immigrants also gain disposable incomes, skills and knowledge which can be used to develop new businesses. The labour force will be developed to support socio-economic development and upgrade the standard of living. The ground work will be prep ared to address the employment issues and formulate policies for opening up the labour markets. 2. Exports of Labour The exports of labour will be supported, with a ta rget of about five thousand workers working abroad each year during the next five years. Th e project for labour export will be prepared to widen participation in the econom ic sectors and upgrade the skills of the workers to take part in labour markets with high wages. The procedures for labour exports will be adjusted to be compatible with the laws, culture, attitudes a nd traditions of the receiving countries. The learning of foreign languages by the worker s will be encouraged. The cooperation with receiving countries will be strengthened and the information ba se for Lao labour exports will be improved. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 883. Labour Imports A policy on the use of foreign labour will be fo rmulated to motivate the foreign markets to work with line agencies and provide professiona l skills that are not available in the Lao PDR. At the same time, the Government will continue to address the problem of foreign labourers who work in the country without permission. 4. Labour Market Development The smooth matching of workers with jobs in economic sectors will be ensured. The economic sectors will be encouraged to create jobs, disseminate information about occupations, dispatch the workforce to overseas, and adopt policies that attract highly skilled labour from local and international markets. Wo rkers will be supported to create jobs on their own (self-employment) and be able to reach inte rnational markets. There will be an effort to promote the local workforce in international markets. Regulations on business services provided fo r employment and labour exports will be improved in order to offer preferable conditions for local service providers and increase the state's capacity in monitoring. Social security, especially unemployment insu rance, will be implemented. This will provide equal opportunities to workers in all economic sectors. There will be reasonable benefits for both employees and employers. H. Role of the State in the Market Economy In the five-year period 2006-2010, it is necessary to ensure that the Government agencies effectively implement the tasks, such as the establishment of the market economic mechanism that clearly shows the Government's role in m onitoring the market and the society and in the provision of se rvices to the people. The Government's role is to strengthen the effective coordination between the market economic mechanisms and the macroeconomic management. This is to be done through th e process of reform and improvement of concerned sectors such as taxes, banking a nd the promotion of investment, following the direction of the promotion of the market's role. The socialist state, through the role of macro management, should effectively use the economic tools and coordinate with the management and legal tools, especially the tools for prioritization of the national planning and programming, the formulation of mid-term and long-term development strategies, and the development of the growth potential of th e economic system, in order to guide the development of the market economy management. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 89The economic laws should ensure transparency a nd firm enforcement. The principle that the people can run all kinds of businesses, which are not prohibited by law, is to be followed. In addition, all the regulations, whic h are inappropriate and not pr omoting the businesses, such as the slow process of consideration and gran t of investment permission, should be gradually improved. The Government will intervene only when the market economy creates adverse impacts on the society. All the Government inte rventions will be clearly stated in the legal documents and should be ensured through the en forcement of those legal documents. In addition, the legal documents on business audit should be improved to avoid duplication in auditing, thus avoiding complicat ions to the enterprises. In order to implement the above-mentioned task s, in the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the Government will pay attention to the following tasks: 1) Focus on the stabilization of macro economy; formulate effective management and legal systems; and provide adequate strength to support a competitive multi-sectoral economic development, including the private sector . The management system should include necessary regulations in orde r to encourage the efficiency of the market economy along with the expansion of the ex isting comparative advantages. The Government should ensure the implementation of the comprehensive laws. 2) Continue the improvement of th e state regulation of the econo mic mechanism. This is a key direction focusing on the developm ent of comprehensive macro economic management by the Government. It will include the following: a) Reform operational mechanism : The roles, tasks and responsibilities of the Government (the ministries, agencies, non-governmental organizations and local authorities at all leve ls) should be improved to meet th e needs of the state regulation of the market economy. First, the Government should focus on the formulation, supervision, monitoring and implementation of the programme and the policy on macro management; and the division of authorities and responsibilities among the ministries, sectors (public, pr ivate, community and voluntary) and local authorities. Enhance the participation of civil society, NGOs and other enterprises in the delivery of social services that do not require direct control by the Government. A clear regulation on the division of the areas fo r control between the central and local government levels should be formulated. Th is regulation should also be appropriate to the needs of the current and emerging conditions and be relevant to the economic reform. Improve the forms of regulation and working pattern of administrative agencies at all levels; b) Firmly reform document administration to ensure the law enforcement efficiency, transparency and equity. Eliminate th e documents that duplicate and lead to corruption and complications to the peopl e. Abolish unnecessary processes in granting investment permissions. Implement the sound \"one door\" mechanism. Train the officials to be self-disciplined, and in crease public servants' morals and ethics in serving the people; and c) Increase the quality, knowle dge and capacity of civil servants in management following the \"market-orientation\" direc tion. Conduct regular st udy on the public servants and improve the division of the level of staff management by local authorities. Review and evaluate the issues of staff training a nd upgrading along with the development of a staff training plan on market economic management. Increase Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 90the transparency in official movement, partic ularly the issues related to the people in the financial and budget areas. Enhance the anti-corruption cam paign within the government organizations; 3) Consider planning to be an important tool for the Government in the effective implementation of economic management. Redire ct the planning to be integrated to the market economy. Increase the scientific knowle dge and practice to th e actual situation of planning. Reform the characteristics, contents and methodologies in basic planning in order to utilize the plan as a tool against the \"irregularity\" of funds th at often occur in the market economic system. This will ensure the sustainability of national development; 4) The Government should play the role and re sponsibility of economic management along with the role of investor, as necessary, in the \"transition\" process. The presence of the state economy is still necessary for the eff ective exploration and u tilization of natural resources, funds, and national assets. There is also a need for the use of the comparative advantage that the Government has in orga nizational strength, uni ty and experience in economic management for about 20 years of transition. In order to implement the participation in investment and effec tive economic action, the Government should implement the following tasks: a) Explore the appropriate methods for solvi ng the problem of the ineffective state- owned enterprises that sti ll play important roles in many sectors of the basic economy; and b) The legal bodies should implement their ro le in the formulation of the national economic policy and the socio-economic de velopment plan, focusing on the changes in the economic structure into an industrial and modern one; 5) Along with the economic goals, integrate the so cial role such as education, health, job creation, poverty reduction, and social, cultur al and environmental protection, which will strengthen the social and political stability and the complementarity, and will provide a solid base for economic development. Thus, based on the socialist market economy in our country, the Government should play various roles. Together with the developmen t and management of the market economy, the Government should improve the macro-economic environment and bus iness environment; and intervene in basic economy aiming at allevia ting the constraints in the market system. The Government should also play an important role in business develo pment and ensure the people's living standards. These are very challenging tasks becau se of the absence of the all- inclusive regulation on management to meet the needs of rapid development in all economic sectors including the state, private and other sectors in the society. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 91VII. THEMATIC AND CROSS-CUTTING AREAS A. Poverty Reduction 1. Poverty Situation Poverty is multidimensional and manifests itself in different forms. It is more than a problem of inadequate income. It includes a lack of access to basic social and essential economic services and life choices, including opportunities to particip ate in economic, social and political processes. Also, different groups such as men and women, rural and urban dwellers, ethnic and cultural groups, may experience poverty in different ways. Inequality in the ownership of land, the distribution of wealth and income, access to economic and social goods and services as well as remunerative jobs, participation in social and political processes, and other life choi ces, contribute to poverty. Quantitative data on the incidence of expenditure, consumption or income poverty (henceforth referred to as income poverty) in the Lao PDR are compiled through the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Surveys (LECS) conducted in 1992/93, 1997/98 and 2002/03. The incidence of income pove rty (headcount index) has declined from 46.0 percent in 1992/93 to 39.1 percent in 1997/98. Results from the Third Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey (LECS III) show that the in cidence of income poverty declined further to 33.5 percent in 2002/03. 5 This impressive declining tr end in poverty incidence, if continued, would enable the coun try to achieve the MDG target of reducing the proportion of people below the poverty line by half by 2015 (as compared to that in 1990). Like income poverty, other dimensions of pove rty have shown considerable improvements. Life expectancy has exceeded 60 years as co mpared to 50 years in 1990. Infant mortality declined from 120 in 1990 to 82 per 1,000 live bi rths; under-five mortality from 163 to 115; and maternal mortality from 650 per 100,000 live bi rths in 1990 to 350. Adult literacy rose from 43 percent to 53 percent, with both me n and women sharing in the improvement. The net enrolment in primary education has incr eased from 61 percent to about 81 percent. Access to health services, safe water and road s has improved modestly during the past fifteen years.6 In terms of the MDGs , the country seems to be on tr ack to achieve the target on under-five mortality, but may have difficulty in m eeting the target on maternal mortality if the past trend continues. The effects of poverty on the poor families are degrading. The consequences of poverty are also detrimental to economic advancement, social harmony and political stability. The development of the produ ctive potentials of the poor, women and other vulnerable groups, would contribute to rapid ec onomic growth and sustainable development. 5 Source: Lao PDR Committee for Planning and Investment, National Statistics Centre and World Bank, Lao PDR Poverty Trends, 1992/3 - 2002/3, Draft Report, prepared by Kaspar Richter, Roy van der Weide and Phonesaly Souksavth, March 2005. 6 Sources: World Bank, World Development Indicators, and National MDG Report. While there has been considerable progress, the social indicators in the Lao PDR are still well below the averages for the East Asia and Pacific Region. Some of them ar e even lower than the corresponding averages for Sub-Saharan Africa. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 92It would reduce the negative ex ternalities such as crime, the spread of diseases and environmental degradation. Poverty reduction is to be addressed through policies and programmes that help redistribute the growing opportunities, incomes, services and choices to the poor in the multi-ethnic population of the Lao PDR. Therefore, poverty reduction is seen to be economically sound, socia lly just and politically worthy. The vision for poverty reduction is reflected well in the Na tional Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), which is the re sult of a highly participatory process that started in 1996 when the 6th Party Congress defined the long term objective as freeing the country from the status of least developmen t by 2020 (the 2020 goal). In March 2001, the 7th Party Congress specified poverty reduction ta rgets for 2005, 2010 and 2020 and highlighted modernization and industrialization as important means to achieve the targets within the overall framework of the 2020 goal. Graduatin g from the ranks of the least developed countries (LDCs) requires the eradication of poverty in a sustainable manner. The Government is committed to poverty eradication and the promotion of equity among different groups of the Lao multi-ethnic population within a rapid and sustainable economic growth framework. 2. Poverty Reduction Strategy The overall strategy is to assist the poor to help them selves to fully util ise their labour and other modest resources, improve their situati on and exit poverty. The Government will help enlarge the economic opportunities, enable the provision of basic so cial and essential economic services, ensure securi ty and facilitate the particip ation and empowerment of the poor in economic, social, political and other arenas. Only a sma ll fraction of the poor that can not take advantage of the opportuni ties to help themselves due to age and other factors would require direct financial support. The Government has to continue to provide pensions to people with disabilities and those elderly individu als who did good deeds for the nation. The NGPES presented the strategic medium term framework for fighting poverty with the participation of the people through human resource development and rural development.7 The different components of the poverty eradication strategy are presented briefly in the following: a) Expansion of Economic Opportunities Based on the experiences of ma ny developing countries including those of the Lao PDR and its neighbours, it is recognized that rapid economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty on a sustainable basis. The people - including farmers, workers, traders, and micro, small, medium and large entrepreneurs - are the main agents that generate economic growth through their efforts and innovations. The Govern ment is primarily a facilitator in this process. The assets and efforts of all the people including the poor are necessary for the country to maintain rapid economic growth, reduce poverty and sustain development. This is 7 Government of the Lao PDR, Fighting Poverty through Human Reso urce Development, Rural Development and People's Participation, Vientiane, November 2000. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 93all the more significant, since the poor constitute about a th ird of the population of the Lao PDR. The successful countries in East and Sout heast Asia mobilised the efforts of all their peoples - rich and poor, men and women, skilled and unskilled - in order to generate and sustain rapid economic growth, reduce poverty and achieve the st atus of newly industrialised countries (NICs). They treated their people as their most valuable resource. More than three-quarters of the population of the Lao PDR live in rural areas and a large majority of these depend on ag riculture for their main means of livelihood. As in many other countries, poverty in the Lao PDR is predominan tly rural and is more severe in the remote highlands. 8 Experience during the past fifteen year s has shown that increasing agricultural productivity and improving market access through ro ad infrastructure have been instrumental in reducing poverty in the lowlands. Thus, the incidence of poverty in the accessible rural lowlands is significantly lower than that in othe r rural areas. The lesson is that increasing the productivity in agriculture and auxiliary occupations in the rural areas and improving the access to markets are critical for achieving further significant re ductions in poverty over the medium term. The Government recognizes this to be a high pr iority. Proposed initia tives within the Plan include the rehabilitation and c onstruction of irrigation system s and their improved operation; introduction and wider distribution of improve d seeds of crops, fruits and vegetables; protection of livestock; and sust ainable management of forest s and other natural resources, through community participation. Improvements in marketing and infrastructure are also planned. Provision of support services including agricultural and livestock extension and the supply of production and investment credit are planned by the Government. At the same time, private initiatives including those by foreign investors and trader s from neighbouring countries to promote contract farming, especially in horticu lture and tree crops are being encouraged. The informal sector comprising mostly micro and small enterprises has been an important contributor to growth in the Asian NICs, especially during the early stages. Apart from agriculture, a large proporti on of the full and part-time employed in the Lao PDR are dependent on the informal sector (in mainly tr ade and services) in both the urban centres and the rural areas. It is quite lik ely that a significant proportion of these are poor. Consequently, increasing opportunities and im proving the productivity in th is sector are crucial for enhancing the country's economic performance and reducing poverty. Initiatives proposed in the Plan include the promotion of micro, small and medium enterprises, enlarging access to appropriate technologies, and pr ovision of other support servi ces including the supply of credit (both through formal institutions and informal ones including user groups) and training. A third important area is the formal private sector including agro-processing/manufacturing, mining, construction, tourism, wholesale and reta il trade, transport, and other services. Legislation and regulations have been put in place to improve the enabling environment, and to encourage both domestic and foreign priv ate investments in the country. Private 8 As indicated earlier, the incidence of poverty was highest in the rural uplands and other rural areas without road access. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 94investments are vital catalysts for technological advances. Th ey are also the engines of growth of higher productivity (remunerative) jo bs, which are important vehicles for poverty reduction. A fourth area is the provision of infrastruc ture - including roads and bridges, river landings/jetties, electricity, telecommunications and postal services. These are critical for the movement of people and goods, flow of essential information in a timely manner, and orderly and efficient functioning of mark ets including labour markets. A fifth area relates to macroeconomic policie s and the management of public finances, including public expenditure allocation. The Government has begun to pay increased attention to pro-poor macroeconomic and public expenditure policies and these will be implemented with increased vigour during 2006-2010. Funds will be increased for poverty reduction to support the extension of credit to the poor to support the development of thei r production and business operati ons. Efforts will be focussed on increasing the incomes of the poor and reducing the gap betw een the rich and the poor to create a social balance. The Government will support the opening up of development and training opportunities for the poor to increase their skills and abil ities for production and business including marketing; reduce the risks for poor households from accession to the AFTA and WTO; revise and supplement the po licies to be completed; and step-up and implement the policies to support the poor. b) Social Services The provision and effective use of basic social services (e.g. primary, lower secondary and adult education, basic healthcare, safe water and sanitation) is an important means to break the poverty cycle. Enhanced access to and use of basic social services is an urgent need especially in the remote highlands. The Gove rnment faces the dilemma of how to fund the high cost of providing basic social services to a small and wide ly scattered population that is difficult to reach. While bringing services to the people is th e preferred option, bringing the people to accessible service centres and providi ng the services may be more practical and affordable at the present stage of developm ent of the country. The Government has been testing this approach in select ed difficult to reach areas. The challenges faced and the lessons learned will guide the further development of these areas. Education and literacy are prerequisites fo r the introduction and adoption of modern productivity enhancing technologies and for comp eting in both domestic and world markets. Implementation of the Education for All Programme is the key plank within the Government's Education Sector Strategy and the main means for promoting primary and lower secondary education, and adult and non -formal education. More primary, secondary and pre-schools will be built and supplied with qualified teachers and the necessary equipment, to improve the population's access to education, particularly those in remote areas. The Plan also incorporates programmes to improve school participation and completion rates, and the qual ity of teaching and learning. Evidence from various countries Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 95in the region including the Lao PDR, shows that the education of girls and women has multiple benefits, affecting their welfare, and that of their children (the future generation) and families. The access of the poor to basic hea lth care is constrained by not only the availability of the services but also the ability of the poor to pay the service fees and purchase the recommended medicines. While the present system does provi de for exemption of payment of the service fees by the poor, its application in practice has pr oven quite difficult. Also, most of the health facilities depend on service fees to cover their operating costs. The Government is exploring various options to improve the access of the p oor to public health services at affordable terms. The immediate priorities in the health sector are to (i) increase people's access to quality health care services, (ii) stop the spread of communicable diseases , and (iii) decrease maternal and child mortality rates. To do th is, the Government is building and upgrading health centres and hospitals, and raising the capacity of health care professionals. Attention is to be given to the preparation and use of the policy on health monitori ng and treatment for the poor. The access to safe water and sanitation is relati vely low as compared to the regional averages. The costs of the water supply schemes are quite high due to the high standards stipulated. It is necessary to explore less costly and more appropriate technologies and adopt them to the Lao situation to expand coverage of safe water more rapidly. The Government's approach has been to address the provision of the water supply services on a cost recovery basis. In the rural areas, community ownership and operation are being trie d on a pilot scale under various projects. c) Security The third component is security including en suring the security of people and property against violence, destructi on, theft and unexploded ordnanc e (UXO), food insecurity, and protection against unforeseen calamities such as natural disasters. The security situation has improved consistently over the past decade, tha nks to the efforts of the communities with assistance from both the local and central governments. Unexploded ordnance or UXO is one of the ma jor security challe nges facing the poor communities in terms of access to land and markets. It is also a major risk, especially for children. There appears to be a significant co rrelation between the presence of UXO and the prevalence of poverty. The Government with sup port from a number of development partners is addressing the clearance of UXO and the rehabilitation of the cleared areas. The UXO/Mine Risk Education (MRE) teams will visit and deliver MRE training to all communities in the country. All agricultural areas considered to be \"high priority\" will be cleared, as well as a sizeable portion of othe r areas identified as \"medium priority.\" A national database on Mine/UXO accidents will be developed and updated regularly, to feed into the prioritisation of UXO clearance and MRE tasks. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 96 The elimination of opium cultivation and use has been another major security challenge. The country has been successful in eliminating the cultivation of the crop. However, it has been more difficult to find alternative crops or othe r livelihood activities that generate adequate incomes to improve the economic status of the former poppy growers and lift them out of poverty in a sustained way. This is a festering problem that would need continued attention in the various development programmes including the targeted interventions. Food (rice) security is a pressing concern for the population in general, and for the poor in particular. Geographic and seasonal pockets of rice scarcity persist, and many communities still lack adequate coping mech anisms. Availability of adequa te quantities of rice throughout the year is the key component of food security. There have b een considerable improvements in national food security in recent years re sulting from substantial increases in rice production. However, food security may be still a significant concern for the poorest households. The constraints include limited distribution capacity, increasing population pressure on available lands and the prevalence of natural disasters. Security from natural disasters such as floods and droughts is a furthe r dimension that needs to be addressed. The stress is on the im portance of community involvement and the strengthening of community resilience, in additi on to material help from the Government and the partners in development including NGOs. The Government will develop and implement the programmes for the prevention of and protecti on from natural disaster s; regularly monitor the situation including seasonal ri ce scarcity and weat her changes; and find methods to solve the damage and provide timely support to the victims. d) Participation and Empowerment The fourth category encompasse s the participation of the poor in making decisions about their future and the future of their communities, on economic, social, cultural and political issues. It includes the availabil ity of avenues for the poor to \"voice\" their concerns and be heard on the key issues affecting them. These are essential for their empowerment. People's participation has been one of the important pillars in nation buildi ng over the past three decades. The Prime Minister's Decree (no. 001) s tipulates the provinces as the strategic units, the districts as the planning and fiscal units , with the villages (communities) as the implementing units. Both the public administra tion and the Party machinery encourage the active participation of the pe ople in local decisi on-making. Measures to strengthen the capacities of the communities incl uding the poor in articulating their priorities, implementing the programmes and monitoring the pr ogress are included in the Plan. Decentralisation is an important means to ensure the sustained participation of the people, including the poor and women, in local affairs. The Lao PDR has been fortunate in this regard, as the State Administration has been built on a decentralized system, with numerous authorities and respons ibilities shared between the Cent re and the Provinces. While the system has worked reasonably well in the last quarter of the 20 th Century, it has become increasingly apparent that a comprehensive review of th e existing distribution of the authorities and responsibilities between the Cent re and Provinces is necessary to make the public administration respond better to the emer ging opportunities and challenges in the first Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 97quarter of the 21st Century. The Government has alread y initiated steps to review the arrangements and the process of adjustment will continue duri ng the Plan period. Informed participation of the people includi ng the poor requires improvements in the two- way (top-down and bottom-up) flow of info rmation and communication and education. The mass media including newspapers, radio and televisions as well as telephones (landlines and mobile) are important means. The people will be provided with more information through the media and other channels to increase their ability to participate in the socio-economic development of the country. The people's knowle dge about their rights and obligations will be improved. e) Development of the Poorest Areas The NGPES has identified 47 poorest and 25 poor districts. The Commit tee for Planning and Investment (CPI) together with the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Education, Health and Communication, Transport, Post and Constr uction and jointly with the local communities and authorities has facilitated the preparation of focal area development plans for some 33 kum bans (groups of villages) in pilot districts among the 47 poorest districts identified in the NGPES. Most of the programmes are in the areas of agricu lture and rural development (sustainable liveli hoods), education, health and transport/infrastructure. The targeted interventions include such activities as focal areas development, Village Development Funds and the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF). The Government plans to (i) diversify funds for resettlement, stop forest destruction, and eliminate opium growing areas; (ii) increase the incomes of the people in th e rural and remote areas and minority ethnic people; (iii) encourage people to escape from poverty and become rich to help others who are still poor and abolish hu nger (rice scarcity) and poverty; (i v) integrate the poverty reduction action plan into regional socio-economic de velopment; (v) prepare priority projects in particular areas such as s upport for land zoning conditions for production and housing; (vi) support the campaign and upgrade the knowledge a nd responsibilities of people involved in poverty reduction at different levels in line ag encies and the poor people; (vii) evaluate and publicize the types, models a nd effective methods which are suitable to each part and locality; (viii) develop and increase staffing; and (ix) promote agriculture, forestry and fisheries as the ways to reduce poverty. It will organize the pilot project to dispatch youth to work in the poor districts and villages, and prepare suitable policies for the youth to build confidence and volunteer for long term work in difficult areas. Boarding schools have been developed to provide opportunities for schooling for ethnic minorities in remote villages. The Government will facilitate the migration of pe ople from remote areas to help find wage employment and better access to services. The emphasis is on increasing investment and implementing transparent policies for poverty reduction. The priority projects in the PIP put forward devel opment of the difficult areas, especially in the 47 poorest distri cts to get out of the poor status as planned. At the same time, grant aid needs to be attracted for infras tructure development in these areas. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 98Attention would be paid to economic deve lopment of the border economy, focusing on development of border checkpoints, along roads especially the important ones and economic corridors. Special attention would be directed to animal rearing, planting industrial trees and forestry for raw materials in the mountainous and flat terrains. Poverty re duction projects will be implemented in association with the proj ects for reducing slash and burn practices and turning to permanent paddy cultivation, and healthcar e projects. Priority is to be given to the development of the skills of local labour. Significant investment in upgrading and improving education and healthcare development will be considered in the first instance. Key measures: \u0083 Continue work on poverty reduction in the 47 poorest districts, with focus on rapidly reducing the number of poor households by 2010. The new national standard of poverty will be set based on the internati onal standards. Deve lop national strategy aiming at solving problems encountered with absolute poverty re duction and establish the mechanism and the structures for proj ect management. In addition, strengthen staff capacity to be adequate for the implementation of th e poverty reduction strategies and projects. Closely monitor the implementa tion at local level. Priority will be given to assist the remote areas w ith special difficulties. Estimate the costs and prioritize the poverty reduction projects in focal development areas to be supported by resources to be mobilized fr om both domestic and foreign sources. Thus, at the beginning of the Si xth five-year Plan, there is an urgent need to set up the national advisory committee on poverty reduction. Set up model development villages and conduct regular exchange of views on poverty reduction; \u0083 Urgently complete the development of pro-poor policies. Pay special attention to the development and enforcement of the polic y on health care for poor people and the special policy on access to school of child ren from poor families. Develop the investment policy; expand the schools in ru ral areas, particularly in the remote and difficult areas. Gain the support and as sistance from the World Bank and other international agencies in the nati onal poverty reduction efforts; \u0083 Priority should be given to the difficult areas, such as the assistance on land use, production conditions and housing. Support th e advocacy and increase awareness and sense of responsibility on poverty reduction at all levels . Analyse and propagate effective formats, models and methods on poverty reduction, appropriate to each region and locality. Develop and increase staff for promotion of agriculture and forestry related to poverty reduction and en sure close sectoral coordination. Conduct pilot project on sending junior staff to poor districts a nd villages with appropriate incentive policies to encourag e their active performance. \u0083 Undertake social mobilization for impleme ntation of the national poverty reduction strategy. Organize the intr oduction of poverty reduction among mass organizations, business persons and local authorities in orde r to assist the poor areas, and introduce the action plan of the strategy in each period; \u0083 Coordinate in the development of key ec onom ic sectors related to poverty reduction such as the development of eco -tourism, tours to historical and cultural sites in poor districts and areas in order to generate mo re income for poor people, and at the same time to preserve cultural heritage and histor ical areas and protect the environment; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 99\u0083 Review the strengths of the development fo rmat in the implementation of the Fifth five-year Plan (2001-2005) to strengthen fu rther in the implementation of the Sixth five-year Plan (2006-2010); \u0083 Increase the funds for poverty reduction, wi th a focus on the promotion of credit schemes for poor people in order to e xpand their production and small-scale businesses, setting appropriate interest ra te and repayment periods. In addition, technical assistance and information on ma rkets will be provided to poor people. Guarantee the price of agri culture production through Funds and continue to expand the village development fund, job opportuni ties and supplementary professions. The investment will be concentrated on the infras tructure in some focal development areas with high poverty incidence. Increase income of the poor in order to close the gap between the poor and the rich in the society; \u0083 Raise the capacity of poor people for goods production and small-scale businesses. Endorse the policy on the assistance to the poor people on produc tion and marketing the products. Reduce the adve rse effects (risks) for the poor households from the country's membership in AFTA and WTO. Improve and continue the implementation of the pro-poor policies with focus on the curative and preventive health care, education, housing and access to low interest credit schemes or grants; \u0083 Establish information system as the basi s (ground) for monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy from the central to the local levels; \u0083 Continue the management, social mobiliza tion and international cooperation in the implementation of the NGPES priorities in corporated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan (2006-2010). Make poverty reduction a public responsibility and a priority of the Government; \u0083 Conduct advocacy for raising awareness am ong ethnic groups. Implement the policy on care for the disabled, orphans and disa dvantaged people in the society; and \u0083 Develop and implement the strategy on pr evention and protecti on from disasters; regularly observe the famines that occur in mid-season and the natural changes in order to solve the problems and provide help in time. Guidelines for remote village develo pment in the five-year period 2006-2010: Develop and implement the socio economic developm ent plan in remote, ethnic areas. Strive to supply necessary infrastructure for these villa ges. Develop infrastructure for the village groups; and reorganize the village groups to f acilitate the development of agro-forestry development. Reduce the disparity of the living conditions among di fferent ethnic groups. Implement the land-forest allocation to local people and build capacity for ethnic groups and highland people, especially the families of ethnic minorities with a focus on effective production and, at the same time, increas e the awareness on national security. Encourage and promote permanent settlement to ensure the production. Upgrade the people's living conditions in accordance with thei r traditions and based on the focus village Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 100arrangement. In addition, study and consid er the conditions for the development of infrastructure for these community groups such as roads, water supply, electricity, information and markets. Explore the potential of the land and labour force; and encourage forestation and plantation of i ndustrial trees and fruit trees. Traditional handicrafts of the ethnic groups and high land people need to be promoted. Introduce the methods for earning a living. Promote agriculture, transfer of t echnology, and provide information focusing on active goods production. Provide capacity building and tr aining of staff from ethnic groups and utilize them for long- term services in their locality. Grant special auth ority to the older persons in the villages (the Lao National Front) and the Lao Women's Union to strengthen the solidarity among ethnic groups. Improve and expand the program of education, h ealth care, culture and information for ethnic groups. Increase people's awaren ess on preservation and promo tion of cultural values and traditions of all ethnic groups. Sustain and develop spoken languages and written characters/alphabets. Teach et hnic dialects in schools wher e ethnic characters/alphabets already exist. 3. Targets The target for poverty reduction is to improve th e quality and living sta ndards of the people, particularly in poor and remote areas. Pr omote employment in rural areas, developing income generation activities while respecting the laws. Increase the access of the poor households to the services in e ducation, health, credit, etc., so that they can improve their family situation. In addition, promote those households who have overcome poverty to help other poor families. The specific targets include the following: \u0083 Implement the objective of poverty reduction to bring down the ratio of poor families to below 15 percent in 2010 co mpared with that in 2000; \u0083 By 2010, abolish completely seasonal hunger (rice scarcity) at the household level; \u0083 Reduce the ratio of malnourished childr en under five to below 30 percent; \u0083 Accomplish the programme of Education for All; \u0083 Provide clean water to 65 percen t of the population in rural areas; \u0083 Lower the population growth rate to 1.91 percent; \u0083 Raise the ratio of green areas to a bove 50 percent of a ll natural areas. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 101B. Poverty Focussed National Programmes 1. Drug Control As a party to the three international conventio ns on narcotic drugs, the Lao PDR is committed to eliminating illicit opium poppy cultivation in the country. Acti ons towards this end include the approval of significant policies and the enactment of laws that provide the legal framework for opium elimination and the control of illicit substances. The 7th Party Congress has identified the elimination of opium and pove rty as national priorities. Opium elimination in the Lao PDR is directly linked to the erad ication of poverty and hunge r, which is the first MDG. Recent data shows that the Lao PDR has reached its goal of eliminating opium cultivation in the country.9 Many farmers have adapted or are adapting to livelihoods without opium poppy. The main activities adopted by farmers to make a living immediately after ending opium cultivation are: growing more rice and other crops, selling their livestock and collecting non-timber forest products. Some earn mo re now than they used to from opium. In some areas, however, opium elimination has not been matched by the provision of alternative livelihoods. Some of the coping strategies adopted by the farmer s may not be sustainable in the long-term. It is necessary to provide appropriate and adequa te assistance to the groups to prevent them from reverting back to opium cultivation. There are 18,500 opium addicts in the eight Northern Provinces covered by the 2005 Opium Survey, 10 which is a decrease of 32 percent si nce 2003. Although the majority of opium addicts are men, a recent study on the coping strategies of form er opium farmers indicates that women also gain much from the elimina tion of opium cultivati on and use. Women have more time to be with the family, work closer to home and are better able to tend livestock, grow vegetables and go to markets. When an addicted family member stops using opium, domestic abuse drops and labour capacity rises, result ing in increased pro ductivity and family income. 9 According to unofficial estimates, the area under op ium poppy cultivation in the country for the 2005 season ranged between 900 ha and 2,900 ha with a mean value of 1,800 ha, which is a decrease of 73 percent compared to the 2004 estimate of 6,600 ha. (Much of the remaining opium cultivation may be in small gardens for self- consumption by the remaining opium addicts estimated to number about 18,500.) The cumulative decline of 26,600 ha since 1998 is quite impressive. The traditio nal opium poppy growers are semi-subsistence farmers from the ethnic minorities living in the highland areas where access is difficult. The op ium growers are generally poorer than those living in lowland areas due to poor road access a nd the lack of social infrastructure such as schools and health centres. Given the easy ava ilability, recreational and medicinal use of opium has led to widespread addiction among farmers. Addiction leads to negative outcomes in health and productivity and, in turn, increases poverty. More than two-thirds of the 47 poorest districts had opium poppy growing villages. 10 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Laos Opium Survey 2005, June 2005. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 102In order to sustain opium eradication, the national strategy for the post-opium scenario called \"The Balanced Approach to Sustaining Op ium Elimination in the Lao PDR (2006-2009)\"11 was developed. The goal is to stabilize the s ituation in the immediat e post-opium scenario and to provide assistance to areas not covered so far. This is a holistic approach which addresses all issues such as capacity building, improving hou sehold incomes and livelihoods, road access, provision of economic and social se rvices, ethnic divers ity, male and female migration, and the sustainable management of natural resources and the environment. The strategy is comprised of four main components: (i) development of alternative livelihoods to replace the socio-economic incentive to produce opium poppy, by providing sustainable assistance to improve existing livelihood strate gies and increasing access to micro-credit, markets and skills training; (ii) reduction of demand for opium, which aims to eliminate the need of remaining addicts for opium by improving the capacity of communities to resolve their own drug problems, providing treatment to all remaining addicts to prevent relapse and new addictions to other illicit substances, and providing treatment to ol d addicts, especially those with severe diseases; (i ii) increased law enforcement to stop both opium production and trafficking, by supporting capacity enhancement a nd the strengthening of provincial, district, village and community based drug control bodies; and (iv) enhancing civic awareness, which will ensure that the relevant communities ar e mobilized in community drug control and prevention. National and local campaigns for civi c awareness of drug related issues will be promoted, including the dissemination of appropriate public information material for dissemination through the media. Since the launch of the Opium Elimination Programme, the trafficking and abuse of Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS) have incr eased dramatically. In creased availability may be linked to freer movement across the country's borders. Similarly, a reduction in opium availability may be tied to the emergen ce of a market for alternative drugs. ATS use and dependency greatly increas es vulnerability to negative economic, social and health outcomes. Drug injecting behaviour is also linked to the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Government has formulated a Drug Demand Reduc tion Strategy that includes ATS. The next step is to establish the law enforcement strategy for dealing with drug trafficking. The Government in cooperation with the partners in development intends to address the task of preventing the spread of ATS and minimizing th e risk of opium demand being replaced by ATS demand. 2. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) The UXO continues to threaten the physical safet y, livelihoods and food se curity of people in more than 25 percent of villages in the Lao PD R. Two-thirds of the land area is contaminated with UXO, and many of the most highly contam inated villages are in remote, difficult to reach areas of the country. High incidence of po verty in rural communities is often correlated with high levels of UXO contamination. Such large-scale UXO contam ination has rendered vast areas of the land unsafe for agriculture, in frastructure or other human activity. Many of the poor and vulnerable groups in remote rural communities are faced with the dilemma of 11 Lao National Commission for Drug Control & Supervision and UNODC, The National Programme Strategy for the Post opium Scenario: \"The Ba lanced Approach to Sustaining Opium Elimination in the Lao PDR (2006- 2009),\" First draft, 15 January 2005. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 103tampering with UXO and risking limb and life, or continuing in imp overished conditions. Recent statistics indicate that ch ildren are increasingly at risk. The number of UXO accidents increased steadil y from 60 accidents in 2003 to 90 in 2004, and 89 so far in 2005.12 While children represented 45% of victims in 2003, that proportion currently stands at roughly 60%. UXO Lao estimates that one of the main causes of this increase in accidents is rela ted to the introduction, in 2002-2 003, of low-cost, low-technology metal detectors manufactured in neighbouring countries, and a very steep rise in the trade in scrap metal. This would mean that children are one of the main collectors of scrap metal, and thus fall among the principal \"victims\" of this trade. UXO contamination poses an ongoing development challenge to the Lao PDR. The Government estimates that it will take no less th an ten years of concerted efforts to clear the UXO from the most highly impacted priority agricultural and development sites in the country. Community education, victim assistan ce and UXO survey and clearance operations are priority activities for the Government. Since 1975, UXO accidents have resulted in over 13,000 casualties, with about one-third of the victims dying from their wounds. Many of the survivors suffer severe impairment because they cannot reach the nearest hospital. The average cost of treatment for survivors can be as much as half the annual income of a rural family. Also, children with disa bilities are often denied access to education due to lack of special facilities and trained teachers, tr apping them in a cycle of poverty. The UXO Lao Programme13 has been the main vehicle for the implementation of the Government's ten-year National Strategic Plan or the Safe Path Forward. The Plan outlines an annual build up process through which th e UXO Lao Programme would more than double its output over a period of five years, whil e targeting its operations more closely on the objectives defined in the NGPES/NSEDP VI. The UXO Lao Programme launched an ambitious plan of internal reforms aimed at strengthening its capacity to deliver on the requirements of the Strategic Plan. This \"Cla iming the Future\" initiative represents a combination of measures, at bo th technical and management levels, that are intended to ensure the optimal use of resources and assets at the disposal of UXO Lao. The Programme is also making dedicated efforts to take advantage of the recent technological advances, and draw on the lessons learned and the best practices developed in similar programmes in other countries, which should increase productivity and efficiency. By the end of 2005, UXO Lao expects to have cleared over 1,500 ha of land, an increase of nearly 100% in the last three years. Other pilot initiatives currently under way, such as testing the introduction of new technologies and methodologies, sh ould generate yet greater increases from the second half of 2006. The foundations of the \"Nationa l Regulatory Authority\" (NRA ) for the UXO sector in the Lao PDR were established, and the Government ha s appointed its National Director and staff. 12 It is important to highlight that accident statistic s compiled by UXO Lao accou nt only for accidents that happened in the forty-odd districts (roughly 1/3 of all districts nationally) where it operates. Further, UXO Lao does not have the capacity to map out provinces and \"seek\" reports on accidents. It collects information on accidents that come to its attention in the context of its activities. A study on UXO victims conducted in early 2004 by Handicap International esti mated that UXO Lao statistics may acco unt for no more than 50% of all victims nationally. 13 The Programme operates in Plan (2006-2010) 104The first two new humanitarian UXO clearance ope rators were accredited in the second half of 2005 and have begun operations in the Sout hern provinces, with funding support from the European Union. However, as new operators en ter the sector, the need for coordination and regulation increases correspondingly. On the financial side, in February 2005, the Government approved a budget of USD 5.1 million for the UXO Lao Programme. By September 2005, the UXO Lao secured USD 3.6 million, which is the minimum funding required to maintain full operations. The NRA also operates at a reduced level of funding.14 The sect or requires significantly more resources and mobilization of adequate resources to continue the implementation of the Programme as planned is a high priority. 3. HIV/AIDS The Lao PDR is in a relatively fortunate si tuation of low prevalence of HIV/AIDS as compared to that in the ne ighbouring countries. At the e nd of 2004, the estimate of the cumulative number of people identified with HIV was 1,470, of which 835 were known to be living with AIDS. 15 Around 556 of the infected have die d. About 62 percent of the reported HIV cases were male and 38 percent female. Th e HIV prevalence rate for persons between 15 and 49 years is less than 0.05 percent (estimate of UNAIDS). More than 50 percent of those infected are between the ages of 20 and 39 years. Awareness of HIV/AIDS is limited as is the access to the means of gaining information. More than 83 percent of HIV infections result from unprotected hetero sexual intercourse. Low levels of awareness and limited access to prevention and protecti on (including condoms) heighten the risk of rising pr evalence of HIV/AIDS in the c ountry. Other factors such as the low socio-economic status of women, high leve ls of poverty and a widening generation gap compound the risk of the spread of the diseas e. Increased population mobility, internal and external labour migration and changes in lifestyles and sexual behaviour are all important ingredients for an accelerated spread of the epidemic. In recent years, the use of recreational drugs has rapidly expanded in the Lao PDR. An alarming number of sex workers are thought to be injecting drugs. International evid ence shows that intravenous drug use may substantially accelerate the spre ad of the HIV epidemic. This means that the country could face either a small or large epidemic unless action is taken to contain and reverse the trend soon. 14 While this may be sufficient at the present time as the NRA begins operations, current funds available will be insufficient for the year 2006, as the NRA recruits more personnel in order to fully assume it's regulatory and coordination functions. The estimated funding required by the NRA in 2006 will be in the range of USD 800,000 (including an initiative to develop a na tional database on UXO accidents), while UXO Lao's requirements will be approximately USD 4.9 million. 15 Source: Case Reports, Ministry of Health Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 105The achievements to date include:16 \u0083 Awareness and open discussion on HIV/AIDS a nd other sensitive i ssues has increased among politicians and the general public; \u0083 A second round of the National Surv eillance has been carried out; \u0083 A Capacity and Needs Assessment ha s been done in all provinces; \u0083 Improvements in managing HIV/AIDS case reporting ha ve taken place; \u0083 More comprehensive programmes on sexually transmitted diseases (STI) prevention and treatment have been carried out in Savannakhet, been expanded, in cluding a pilot project on 100 percent Condom Use Programme or CUP in Sava nnakhet, Oudomxay and Khammouan Provinces; \u0083 Various interventions such as awareness campaigns, peer education, life skills training in schools, community based interv entions, information, education and communication (IEC), mass media campaigns and other measures have reached some vulnerable groups and the general population; \u0083 Treatment of Opportunistic Infections has been implemented in Mahosot, Setthathirat, and Savannakhet Provincial Hospitals; \u0083 A pilot project for anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment was implemented in Savannakhet; \u0083 Home Based Care programmes have been implemented in Savannakhet, Vientiane Capital, Champasak and Bokeo; \u0083 There are six functional (people living with HIV/AIDS) PLWHA self-help groups, and The Lao Network of Positive People (LNP+) has been established; \u0083 Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMCT) pilot projects have been implemented in big hospitals in Vien tiane infrastructure development projects; \u0083 Authorities from the Lao PDR and the neighbouring countries have initiated cooperation and cross- border activities; \u0083 The number of multi-sectoral national partners has increased, and coordination forums met more regularly; \u0083 Several high-level advocacy initiatives and works hops have taken place; \u0083 The HIV/AIDS Policy and Strategic Plan ha s been disseminated to all provinces and they have been translated into real action; \u0083 Several sectors have mainstreamed HIV/AIDS into their sectoral development plans; \u0083 The National Committee for the Control of AI DS (NCCA) has been restructured and the new NCCA has held three meetings, with the Prime Minister attending one of the meetings; and 16 Source: National Committee for the Control of AIDS, National Strategic and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/STI, 2006-2010, Vientiane, July 2005. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 106\u0083 An increased number of nationwide and provi ncial trainings have been carried out, in such areas as programme management, monitoring and evaluation and IEC production; and capacity buildi ng in all programme priority areas has taken place. The main challenges that remain include the following: \u0083 Most of the prevention, care and treatment programmes are pilot initiatives and reach only a small portion of target populations; \u0083 Comprehensive interventions reach only a fraction of the population in need; \u0083 There are limited interventions for certai n vulnerable groups, such as migrant labour, drug users and men who have sex with men; \u0083 Implementation capacity remains low at all levels; \u0083 Research information is not effectively sh ared and applied by different partners; \u0083 Involvement of the civil society and pr ivate sector is still very limited; \u0083 Coordination needs \u0083 Lack of skilled personnel, frequent turnove r and heavy workload prevent many people who have been trained from implementing a nd utilizing what they have learned; \u0083 Follow-up of benefits of trainings is weak; \u0083 There is no functioning M&E system for the National Response; and \u0083 Both human and financial resources are inadequate to tackle the epidemic. To address the challenges, the Government ha s formulated the National Strategy and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/STI for 2006-2010, with the ove rall goal of maintain ing the present low level of HIV/AIDS in the general population, ensuring that HIV seroprevalence among vulnerable groups is lower than five percent, and scaling up the national response in order to prevent in a timely manner and minimize the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on social and economic development in the country. The National Strategy and Action Plan (2006- 2010) defines a reach of 90 percent as full c overage, with the creation of an enabling environment for an expanded response at all levels , an increased availability of data, capacity building and effective management as the ne cessary means to prevent an epidemic. In order to maximize the use of limited resources and to ensure the coverage needed to impact on the epidemic, a vulnerability assessment was carried out. The assessment identified heterosexual transmission primarily through client s of sex workers as the main determinant of the spread of the epidemic. By 2010, the objective is to have 80 percent of sex workers using condoms with a \"no condom, no sex\" policy to be encouraged in entertainment venues, especially in priority provinces. The main prior ity is to maintain HIV seroprevalence in sex workers at less than 5 percent. The awareness of other vulnerable groups will be increased, for example, 40 percent of ethnic groups and 90 percent of the military and police in prioritized locations will be informed about HIV/AIDS/STI. Additi onally, a blood safety programme is currently being implemented in Vientiane and eight other Provinces. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 107 The vulnerability assessment identified th e most vulnerable groups and provinces. The vulnerable groups include sex workers and their clients, vulnerable youth (especially in rural areas and from ethnic minorities), men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users. Addressing vulnerability requires facilitating better access to condoms, changing beliefs and attitudes, improving access to primary healthcare and tackli ng sex worker-client relations. The success of interventions is also depe ndent on organizational change. Programme managers, decision makers and implementing orga nizations will have to review and adapt their approach at every level. With support from the development partners, th e Government will increase home based care, and support services. The anti-retoviral therapy will be made available in three priority provinces with at least 700 treatment slots for ad ults and children. In order to strengthen the link between prevention and care, the Government intends to explore the feasibility of making available more treatment options for pe ople infected with HIV/AIDS, such as self- help groups. It is estimated that about USD 26 million is needed to implement the five-year strategy and action plan. The Global Fund to Fight HIV/ AIDS, TB and Malaria has approved the continued participation of the Lao PDR. It is important to rapidly scale-up well prioritized and targeted interventions focusing on the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. Simultaneously, it is necessary to establish an effective system to track the epidemic, and monitor and evaluate the respons es and impacts of the interv entions. It would require the establishment of an effective national coordina tion mechanism, improveme nt of the quality of interventions and the building of capacities at all levels. The Government appreciates the potential risks, but is constrained by limited reso urces and skilled personne l, in addition to the socio-cultural factors. C. Gender Equality The long-term vision is to achieve gender equality in all spheres, including business, politics, culture, society and within the family. Women co mprise half of the La o population; and they are important economic actors, stewards of households, care givers to both children and adults, key supporters of the education, health and welfare of the me mbers of the household and community, and crucial promoters of th e cultural, moral and spiritual aspects. 1. Overall Strategy The Government recognises that it will not be able to realis e the goals of reducing poverty and improving national education, health and population indicators without the active participation of all women, and particularly poor and ethnic minority women. Therefore, the Government is taking concrete steps in all key economic sectors and through national programmes to: (i) support poor women's economi c activities; (ii) im prove their access to Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 108basic services such as education and health and productive resources, such as extension services; (iii) involve them in local decisi on-making; and (iv) generally increase their involvement and take their needs into account when developing policies and plans. Under the guidance of the Lao National Commission for Advancement of Wome n (NCAW) which has strengthened its own capacity, it is expected th at all ministries will develop strategies and action plans to promote gender equality at nati onal, provincial, distri ct and village levels. The Government have begun to mainstream gender concerns through, for example: \u0083 A number of workshops were held during 2005 to develop the National Strategy for the Advancement of Women (NSAW), and th e NCAW is in the final stages of completing the drafting of the NSAW. The NSAW strives to achieve equal access for women to education and health facilities, to participate more in decision-making and to be knowledgeable and active in achieving the NGPES objectives; \u0083 Developing a set of Guidelines for a Natio nal Gender Action Plan to integrate the gender strategies and action plans of ministries, agenci es and mass organisations; \u0083 Collecting data on implementation of the C onvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW ) in two provinces, Luang Prabang and Champasak, and holding workshops on the CEDAW; \u0083 Establishing high-level gender working groups; \u0083 Developing manuals on gender mainstream ing in agriculture, industry and trade sectors and on sex-disaggregated statistic s by the Gender Resource Information and Development Centre (GRID); \u0083 Developing a gender profile which highlights key gender issues in various sectors; \u0083 GRID carrying out a gender assessment on gende r issues in legal education and a field study to find out the working contexts for legal staff; \u0083 GRID in coordination with the concerne d sectors organising workshops on gender mainstreaming and sex-disaggregated statisti cs for sectors such as the Law Faculty, the Central Party Committee Board Organizat ion and Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials; \u0083 The Lao Women's Union (LWU ) holding a number of mee tings and workshops on vocational skills for women, to disseminate the Law on the Development and Protection of Women, and to disse minate the CEDAW Convention; \u0083 Implementing micro-credit and savings programmes for women and conducting an international workshop on savings ac tivities for poverty reduction; \u0083 Implementing a study on gender and ICT; \u0083 Carrying out a study on international trade, women and family; \u0083 Developing a gender strategy a nd action plan, identifying issu es or problems related to women's participation in the sectors and actions to redress them; \u0083 Providing gender training and capacity-building to staff; \u0083 Improving the gender and ethnic bala nce of staff at all lev els; \u0083 Screening all new policies, programmes and projects from a gende r perspective; and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 109\u0083 Consulting local women in the design of new projects for poverty reduction, and ensuring that they participat e in project activities, incl uding extension services and training. 2. Specific Strategies Agriculture Sector : Gender concerns will be integrated in specific programmes and projects through a number of measures. Research and project planning will include: \u0083 Gender-related data and needs assessments; \u0083 The inclusion of women in project activities; \u0083 The application of gender equity in extension and training services; \u0083 The use of gender-related indi cators to monitor projects; \u0083 Affirmative action concerning the staffing of provincial and distri ct staff, including extension workers; \u0083 The promotion and enhancement of small a nd medium enterprises (SME) especially those owned by women; \u0083 Mobilization of gender focal points in villages to promote improved agricultural practices; \u0083 Taking into account women's tr aditional rights in land rea llocation, land titling and the resolution of land disputes; and \u0083 Assistance to women in accessing rural savings and credit schemes. Education sector : Gender gaps in literacy, school enrolment and completion rates, particularly among ethnic minority groups, will be addressed. This is critical both to achieving the Government's education and literacy goals and the goal of poverty reduction. Accordingly, emphasis will be placed on increas ing the availability, quality and relevance of primary and secondary education for girls, particularly poor and ethnic minority girls; ensuring that vocational and technical school programmes are accessible to women, particularly poor and ethnic mi nority women; and approaches to non-formal education that are highly benefi cial to women. Lessons will be drawn from past and curren t projects for increasing the number of ethnic minority teachers, improving the relevance of primary school materials and providing incentives for girls to attend school. Provinces and districts will be en couraged to develop locally appropriate materials to supplement th e core curriculum, and to schedule primary and secondary school classes to encourage school attendance. Dormitories will be built for female students who live long di stances from schools. Other approach es include distance learning and \"bridging\" courses to enable students (p articularly women) to enter vocational and technical schools. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 110Health Sector: The Government has set targets for improvements in several key health indicators, in particular substantial reductions in maternal and infant mortality rates. Improving mother and child health services and women's access to primary health care, particularly reproductive health services will be essential fo r achieving key health goals. Further, women particularly thos e in poor villages and districts, must be involved to ensure the successful implementation of immunisa tion, clean water and other public health programmes. Therefore, gender concerns will be addressed through all major health care initiatives. Specific measures will include: \u0083 Training of ethnic minority women for all aspects of health services; \u0083 Designation of a gender focal point in each provincial and district primary health centre; \u0083 Gender and ethnic balance in village health committees; \u0083 Gender and ethnic balance in all in-service and specialised training for health staff and health care providers; \u0083 Incentive packages for health care workers a ssigned to remote districts and villages; \u0083 Use of radio and other media to promote health education to men and young people, particularly relating to birth spacing and the prevention of STI/HIV/AIDS infection; and \u0083 Expanding access to reproductive health se rvices, especially for ethnic minority women. Transport Sector : The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs and concerns of women are properly taken into account in planning and implementing road and other transport-related infrastructure. Therefore, local communities, including women, will be consulted in the design of transport and other infrastructure projects . The environmental and social assessments of new road construction a nd other infrastructure projects will include analysis of gender-related benefits and impacts. The community development projects will be designed to ensure that rural communities benefit from roads and other infrastructure projects. Gender disaggregated data will be collect ed to monitor the impacts of these projects. Women representatives will participate in the administration of community road maintenance funds. Other Initiatives : Under the NCAW, it is expected that all relevant ministries will mainstream gender concerns in their policies, planning and activities. This will ensure that women as well as men can participate fully in the country's economic development. Gender issues are also being addressed through national programmes dealing with the prevention of HIV/AIDS, trafficking in women and children and illegal drug use, in addition to national programmes dealing with population policy and UXO. In the public service, women represent about one-third of all government employees, but not many women are in leadership positions at the na tional, provincial, distri ct or village levels. Ethnic minority women are not well represented, particularly in the ranks of extension workers, health care workers and teachers. A plan will be developed to train and upgrade female staff and also to incr ease the number of women studying abroad, to raise their ability Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 111to acquire decision-making and leadership positions. Policies and rules will be revised in order to combat problems in recruiting and promoting female staff. In the area of legal awareness and rights, the Lao Women's Union w ill continue to work with the Ministry of Justice, other ministries and external agen cies to promote women's legal awareness and access to justice. Women have the right to rais e issues with concerned organisations in the case where an individual or organisation stops or infringes the equality and rights of women in politics, business, culture, society and within the family. The Government is committed to correcting these imbalances and village leaders and committees will be encouraged to include more women in local decision-making. 3. Targets \u0083 Increase the number of women labourers at tending training in production techniques; \u0083 Increase the number of wo men attending agriculture and forestry production techniques training mainly in pl antations and animal husbandry; \u0083 Expand women's participation in the village development funds; \u0083 Increase job opportunities for women; \u0083 Promote SMEs of women; \u0083 Gradually, increase the opportunities for girls in every level to be equal with boys (according to the strategy of the Ministry of Education) to reach 89 percent for primary, 63.4 percent for lower secondary, 35.5 percent for upper secondary, and 40 percent for university levels; \u0083 Increase literacy among women ag ed 15-40 to 88 percent by 2010; \u0083 Increase the number of women in Govern ment organisations and public service organisations from the central to the local levels; \u0083 Create opportunities for female Government officials to upgrade their knowledge of politics and management; \u0083 Provide skills training for women in ma ny areas such as development planning, finance, banking, business services, law, science and technology and foreign languages; \u0083 Increase the number of women in manageme nt levels in education, public health, society and businesses: \u0083 Increase the number of female National A ssembly Members in the Sixth Plan period by 30 percent; \u0083 Reduce the maternal mortality rate to 300 per 100,000 live births; \u0083 Increase the rate of medical service use during childbirth including traditional medicine, to 35 percent; \u0083 Increase women's life expectancy to 66 years; \u0083 Expand the fertility project and HIV/AIDs prevention project and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) to cover the 47 poorest districts; \u0083 Develop the capacities of th e Lao NCAW and LWU; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 112\u0083 Improve the knowledge on gender for the leaders of the Lao NCAW and local organisations about gender; and \u0083 Expand networking among the Lao NCAW and the LWU at every level. D. Governance The Government intends to build an effective, efficient, well-traine d, honest and ethical public service that is able to meet the needs of the multi-ethnic Lao people. It will ensure that all Lao people are given the opportunity to be associated in all areas of decision-making so that they can fully enjoy their constitutional rights and that they are educated and well- informed to be able to express their opinions on Government policy. It is vital that a coherent, credible and predictable legal framework is established in a transparent and participatory manner, providing efficient, effective, equita ble and accessible justice and law enforcement institutions and systems. Additionally, account able and transparent financial management practices are necessary to achieve macro-econo mic stability and sustainable growth, which will provide a sound basis for eradicating poverty. Improving governance will involve changing mindsets at all levels. 1. Governance Strategies The Governance Programme comprises among othe rs reforms in four main areas: public service improvement, people's participation, ru le of law and sound financial management. These are described briefly in the following: a) Public Service Improvement Public administration reform is one of the main priority components of the governance programme. Medium and long term training strategies have to be developed for each of the priority areas of governance. A number of laws were passed, such as the Law on the Government, the Law on Local Administratio n and the Law on Anti-corruption. These represent steps forward in further refining the broad framework for the organisation, administration and management of the civil service and therefore have to be fully implemented. The collection of national data and the updating of the national civil service database will continue. The recent development of job descriptions has identified the need to increase the number of civil servants, particularly at the local level. In order to develop a professiona l civil service, more service-orientated civil service training programmes will be carried out to create competent, pr ofessional personnel officers. Administrative and internal management staff will also be trained further. Public sector institutions will be better coordinated for e nhanced productivity and more efficient use of funds. Recruitment procedures will become mo re effective, objective and transparent to enhance the professionalism of the staff. Exampl es of good customer service, creativity and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 113innovation in the civil service will be promoted. New salary scales for civil servants will be introduced, with appropriate increases in their levels. Measures against corruption will be increased and laws and regulations will be en forced. The tasks within administrative bodies will be monitored closely and the level of respons ibility and effectiveness in the utilisation of the National Budget will be enhanced. A code of ethics will be developed and ethical conduct will be rewarded. Monitoring mechanisms would be improved, particularly the tax collection system across the country. Judiciary, customs, national tax, national treasury and national audit or national inspection services will f unction under the full control of the concerned central ministries. It is necessary to extend th e telecommunications network th roughout the country and improve the existing structures, by gradually devel oping and expanding Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) for the Govern ment intranet system. An ICT development strategy has to be finalised, a pproved and disseminated. More small ICT units have to be established in the ministries. ICT training will be given to the staff in the priority ministries and expanded gradually to other ministries. A legal framework ha s to be developed to support ICT development and use. The public will have broader access to the perf ormance reports of government organisations. Manuals and information brochures on the organisation and mandates of government organisations will be increasingly produced and di stributed, while at the same time providing information for the people on procedures and fees for public services. Forums will be created for a participatory debate on a transp arent and accountable Government. In the next five years, a core task in the public serv ice reform is to increase the cooperation of ministries, central sectors and localities, because there are still some limitations regarding cooperation in the present management, and the e ffectiveness of management is rather low. Immediate action is required to review the role s and responsibilities of each ministry and central sector, in order to seek improvement s (synergies) and minimize the duplication of responsibilities. The major measures to be implemented include the following: \u0083 Appropriately adopt the role of public management among ministries, local and central sectors and all regions followi ng the guidance to e nhance the central management; and unify the Government at th e central level, beginning with the areas of revenue collection and expenditure management; \u0083 Develop the roles and responsibilities of all ministries and sectors in accordance with the macro-management; together with stabilizing the mechanisms and staffs in order to effectively manage the task and achieve a higher level of success. The realignment of some ministries/agencies in 2006 is an important step in this direction's. \u0083 Upgrade the competency of management m echanisms to a higher level, and expand the level of responsibility and the transpar ency of offices, organizations, authorities and jurisdictions; \u0083 Modernise the fundamental administration to become modern, a lter the methods of management, and integrate improved techno logies into the activities of public management; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 114\u0083 Upgrade the level of profe ssionalism, morality and th e rationales of staff and Government officials. Enhance education, monitoring and inspec tion and the strict compliance of the staff and Govern ment officials who lack knowledge; \u0083 Continue to ensure the payment of salaries to civil servants. Assess the salary system to find the advantages and disadvantages, and evolve approaches for solving the disadvantages. Examine the ways to change the salaries and a ssess and select the basic minimum salary of workers to pay tax; \u0083 Implement the policy on salaries and suppor t the provision of incentive payments to the staff who work in remote areas; \u0083 Examine the social insurance system by pa rticular fields suitable to the market mechanism managed by the Government. Urgen tly establish the social insurance fund and system from the central to the local leve ls; and ensure the long term sustainability of the fund to implement th e social security policy; \u0083 Create the mechanism to manage the sy stem of revenue generation, strictly implementing the declaration of the assets and personal income of the staffs, and Government officials, especially those higher up in the hierarchy; \u0083 Continue enhancing the m easures against corruption and unreasonable expenses; implement rational spending; ensure the tr ansparency of management; encourage the conclusion-appraisal of the tasks within the administrative bodies; enhance the levels of responsibilities and effectiveness in the utilization of the National Budget; and encourage economical practices and combat unreasonable expenditures; \u0083 Upgrade the technical knowledge of the offi cials at all levels through short-term and long-term training. Cooperate with domestic and foreign construction. Select the candidates, who have the solid political attitude, solid status, suitable qualifications and are ready to follow the new policy of the Party and the Government; and \u0083 Resolve the issue of reluctan ce, non-braveness and negative at titudes of some officials in the macro-management and create the mechanisms and policies to set it right. Strictly comply with the regulations, regi me and the national law. Punish the ones who violate and infringe on the national law and regulations. b) People's Participation In order to ensure the broad-based particip ation of the people in the processes for the development of government policies and strate gies, the Government has to improve human security, ensure a stable and peaceful society, and increase the knowledge of the population on laws, regulations and government policies and programmes. The staff of mass media organisations will continue to be trained and provided with more specialised equipment, so that they can disseminate more up-to-date and accurate information on the Government developments to the public. The Government will ensure the regular supply of information by sources in relation to the services, policies and development plans for the people, and create conducive conditions for all the people to access information without any difficulties. A legal framework for Civil Soci ety Associations (CSA) will be developed. The participation of women in national and local governance wi ll b e encouraged and the Lao youth will be given more opportunities to express thei r concerns, expectations and ideas. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 115The objective of bringing service delivery closer to the people will continue to be strengthened through the ongoing refinement of the Government's Decentralisation Policy and the further development of staff planning cap acities at the local level. This will ensure greater input by the communities to the planni ng, monitoring and evaluation of development activities. The CPI will continue to improve the planning capacity of key planning staff at local levels to promote and utilise broader and more effec tive participation tech niques. Human capacities would be strengthened at the local level so that the provinces will be able to collect accurate data and statistics and hence formulate their own socio-economic plans. The data collection and analysis capability of the National Statisti cs Centre (NSC) is be ing strengthened to improve the accuracy and amount of information provided. Intranet and telephone communications between the centr al and local government agenci es will be increased, and regular coordination meetings between the two will be organised. The National Assembly members have to be better motivated, equipped, supported and informed in fulfilling their tasks and responsibil ities. The capacity of the National Assembly will be strengthened in drafting, revising, amen ding and adopting draft of laws. The National Assembly's ability to oversee the activities of the Governme nt and the Courts would be improved. Information on the activities of the National Assembly will be increasingly disseminated. Laws targeted at the local administration and population will be further disseminated and implemented. People's particip ation in defining natio nal priorities through their elected representatives in the National Assembly will be enhanced. c) Rule of Law The domestic legal framework will continue to be harmonised with international law, and agencies responsible for the application of international commitments will be improved. Laws on Government, People's Courts, Public Prosecutor and Judgement Enforcement will be reviewed and amended. Priority bills stimulating socio-economic growth and implementing guidelines will be drafted. The comprehensive compilation and regular updating and dissemination of le gislation through the Legal Re search Centre will be continued. It is important th at the public's access to the legal services is increased. The personnel of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) need to become more effi cient and effective, which will require, among others, the streamlini ng of activities and procedures in all areas. There is a need to work with key stakeholde rs and the public in formulating national laws. The legal procedures will be rationalized a nd improved with declaration, enforcement, dissemination and serious studies. There will be research done to adjust, improve and add some details to the existing legal system, esp ecially in the areas of commerce, bankruptcy, enterprise, labour, credit, state budget and land acquisition, to suit the objectives of implementing the socio-economic strategy and pa rticipating in the international economy. New laws will be formulated to suit the developm ent objectives and facilitate participation in the international arena. The Government w ill emphasize the structuring of transparent authorities and relating laws and enc ourage the enforcement of the laws. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 116 It is important that the public's confidence in the court system is increased. This will entail speeding up the case resolution and decision making processes, establishi ng courts of appeal, judges, lawyers and prosecutors, updating equipm ent and establishing intranet connections for justice offices at the central and local leve ls. The publication of the official Gazette will be resumed. Legal literacy programmes will be expanded through the mass media. Legal training and awareness campaigns will be conduc ted in all schools and villages to increase people's knowledge of the laws and the role of the legal sector. The publication of law books and manuals will be increased and these will be supplied to facilitie s across the country. A legal basis will be created for the progressive circulation of court decisions and judgements, beginning with the People's Supreme Court. Me chanisms will be created for the public to obtain easy access to them. The Lao Bar Associ ation and Village me diation units will continue to be strengthened. Laws and regulations governing th e organisation, role and respons ibilities of the Office of the Supreme Public Prosecutor and the courts at central and local levels will be revised. The training of trainers will be undertaken in the fiel ds of legal affairs, legal dissemination and the drafting of legislation and ot her legal documents. The knowledge of public prosecutors will be upgraded, improving the monitoring and contro l of law enforcement from the central to the local levels. The reporting system of the Central Office of the Supreme Public Prosecutor will be improved through the computerisation of data collection and statistical information. The understanding of the different organisations involved in law enforcement and penalty adjustment, particularly among prosecutors, th e police, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence will be upgraded. Prosecutors at the central and provincial levels will be trained further, particularly to improve the sk ills of specialised prosecutor's investigators. A computerised data/statistical information system for prisons will be set up. The buildings for legal institutions will be co mpleted and further training will be carried out to develop human capacities, particularly in ma nagement and record keeping. The capacity of the Faculty of Law of the Nationa l University of Laos and the J udicial Training Institute will be raised, by acquiring a strong team of st aff and ensuring the provision of vehicles, equipment and materials. The Government wi shes to increase bila teral cooperation with ASEAN and neighbouring countries in the area of judicial training. The Lao Bar Association will continually be stre ngthened, to enable it to better provide legal services to disadvantaged groups. The office resp onsible for providing le gal advice to women will undergo renovation and restructuring. These developments will improve the implementation of the Law on the Development and the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women. Awareness at all levels of the Govern ment and the community will be raised, about the special needs and vul nerability of women. The Government has prepared a dr aft road map/master plan for the legal sector to implement the various measures, which was discussed w ith stakeholders incl uding the partners in Development in May 2006. The road ma p/master plan is being finalised. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 117d) Sound Financial Management On tax administration, emphasis has been placed on introducing new procedures for ensuring the effective registration of taxpayers, simplification of methods used for the filing and payment of taxes, introduction of new procedures for detec ting under-reported incomes, and training of tax officials in th e introduction of Information Te chnology solutions to support the collection process. The Governme nt will make preparations to convert the turnover tax into a fully fledged value-added tax (VAT). Income, prof it, personal and excise tax rates have been revised and strengthened. GATT va luation will be adopted for controlling the undervaluation of imports which has led to revenue leakage. With regard to customs administration, the Government has taken preliminary steps towa rds the establishment of a National Customs Administration by allowing the Customs Department headquarters to have more control over the seven major international checkpoints. Prel iminary steps have been taken for preparing a reorganisation of the Customs Department Headquarters and field offices. The Government will continue with the reduction of customs tariffs in line with the AFTA agreement. On the expenditure side, the Government pl ans to make the budgetary framework more supportive of private sector growth and investme nt. Also, it will support the long term policy of increasing the share of the budget expenditure allocated to the priority areas of education, health, rural infrastructure and environmental conservation. A training plan will be developed to strengthen the capacity for budget preparatio n and execution. Steps to prevent expenditure arrears are being taken and a reporting syst em on arrears will be established. Revenue projection will be improved basing the futu re budgets on actual performance. A cash management system between the central and ke y provincial treasuries will be developed. The State accounting system regulations and proce dures are planned to be extended to all provinces. Measures will be taken to increase the number of businesses maintaining proper accounting records. Efforts are being made to pr ovide more stability an d clarity in the legal and regulatory framework by drafting new and amending current legislation to encourage investment from the private sector. All laws and regulations with re gard to investment activities need to be translated into English and distributed. It is necessary to create a sound and competitive banking sector capable of supporting private sector led growth and extending rural outreach. The reform of the banking sector has been underway with the support of the ADB and the World Bank and achieved positive results. The development of performance targets for th e State banks, in consultation with ADB and World Bank, will continue to be undertaken. (See also the section on Banking Sector in the previous Chapter.) To ensure the accountable and transparent manage ment of ODA, there is a need to strengthen the Government's ownership of ODA, beyond th e Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Agencies responsible for the sectoral coordination need support to guide them through more effective planning, management, evaluation and reporting of ODA. It is important to have enhanced coordination of monitoring and evaluation capac ity across CPI, the line ministries and the provinces. Project documentation, accounting, procurement and reporting needs to be harmonised. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 118In order for the State audit or ganisation to adopt more mode rn audit methodologies, systems and procedures, the Government is review ing the reform roadmap, identified in the \"Accounting and Auditing in the Lao PDR - A Diagnostic Assessment of Current Practices and a Roadmap to International Standards.\" The structure for possible dr aft legislation would be developed further through draf ting, distribution, comment and am endment so that it can be submitted to the National Assembly and approved to provide the legal framework for the new systems and procedures. Institutional strengthe ning of the audit and inspection bodies will be continued as outlined in the five-year a udit plan for the fiscal years 2005-2009. 2. Targets a) Public Service Improvement \u0083 Develop a cost effective and peopl e centred public administration; \u0083 Modernise the civil service personnel management, including the use of Information and Communication Te chnologies (ICT); \u0083 Develop a productive and highly motivated public service; \u0083 Develop an honest and ethical public service; \u0083 Eradicate corruption; \u0083 Enhance professionalism in the public se rvice through training and development; \u0083 Improve Information and Communication T echnology (ICT) to enhance transparency and productivity; b) People's Participation \u0083 Ensure a stable and peaceful soci ety and improve human security; \u0083 Strengthen the National Assembly; \u0083 Promote a dynamic and participatory society; \u0083 Promote a more open and transparent society; \u0083 Redefine central-local re lations, bringing services closer to the people; c) Rule of Law and Access to Justice \u0083 Establish a complete, clear a nd coherent legal framework; \u0083 Strengthen the informal and formal mechanisms for dispute resolution; \u0083 Ensure predictable and transparent mechanisms for legal enforcement; \u0083 Take initiatives to strengthen the Ministry of Justice; \u0083 Take priority initiatives for the National Assembly; \u0083 Take priority initiatives for th e People's Supreme Court (PSC); \u0083 Take priority initiatives for the Office of the Supreme Public Prosecutor (OSPP); \u0083 Improve the ability of all the peoples of the Lao PDR to access the justice system; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 119d) Sound Financial Management \u0083 Develop a sound fiscal policy; \u0083 Develop transparent and accountable practices for the implementation of efficient and equitable revenue collection policies; \u0083 Develop transparent and accountable pr actices for and management; \u0083 Modernise the accounting system; \u0083 Develop a banking sector capable of supporting private sector led growth and extending rural outreach; \u0083 Ensure accountable and transp arent management of ODA; \u0083 Strengthen the capacities of th e audit and insp ection bodies; \u0083 Improve the efficiency in land ma nagement and administration; and \u0083 Improve the environment for private sector development. E. Natural Resources and the Environment The overall objective of the draft Natio nal Environment reso urces and protect and conserve the environment to ensure the sustainable development of the country while reducing poverty and enhancing the quality of life and health of the Lao people.\" 1. Overall Strategy The overall strategy include s improving environmental management, plans, policies and laws; increasing environmental education and awareness; establishing financial mechanisms and promoting investment; and improving intern ational coordination and cooperation. This will include the development and implementation of strategies, action plans, laws and regulations related to environm ental protection, such as the National Environmental Strategy, provincial environmental strategies, the Envi ronment Education and Awareness Strategy and Action Plan, Forest Action Plan on Biodive rsity, and strategies and action plans on agriculture and water resources. Currently, the Lao PDR does not have many envir onmental problems, but in the future this will change as the country develops socio-eco nomically, natural resources will reduce and waste will increase. It is therefore important th at the country takes early action in maintaining and protecting its environment. In the coming years, environmental problems should be solved in the big cities and some rural areas . The national strategic plan on the environment will be prepared and implemented; policies fo r environmental management will be drawn up and effectively used in development projects for the prevention of environmental damage; and environmental protection methods publicised and people's participa tion in environmental protection will be upgraded. Mobilizing the p opulation to preserve the environment and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 120prevent damage is an important measure and it is expected that this will increase investment in environmental protection methods. 2. Specific Measures Three main strategies have been identified to achieve the objectives: a) Improving the management of natural resour ces by means of increased participation and protection through: \u0083 Strengthening participation, especially by the poor, in the preparation and implementation of national and local plans, policies and strategies; \u0083 Jointly managing environmental services and resources with the poor through strengthening community manageme nt of environmental resources; \u0083 Protecting access to the critical resource s, which the poor already have (e.g. entitlements to land, water, trees, pastures and fishing grounds); \u0083 Expanding the natural asset base of the poor (e.g. community forest rights); \u0083 Reducing subsidies for environmental serv ices that benefit the less-poor; and \u0083 Undertaking ecological zoning of the Lao PDR. b) Improving the institutional framework and it s capacity by means of strengthening it and raising public awareness and political commitment through: \u0083 Developing a sound legisla tive and legal framework fo r property rights, water resources, forestry, land management and bio-diversity; \u0083 Using market-based instruments as much as possible; \u0083 Building capacity for more effective environmental management; \u0083 Deepening public awareness and political commitment; \u0083 Improving public access to e nvironmental information; \u0083 Introducing environmental education as a standard part of the curriculum; and \u0083 Integrating environmental c oncerns into private sector decision-making, including promoting industry-wide codes of conduct and environmental auditing. c) Improving the environmental management in industrial and construction sectors through: \u0083 Promoting environmental infrastructure and technology that be nefit the poor; and \u0083 Promoting the development of environment-fr iendly private sector products such as eco-tourism and technologies that are energy efficient and clean. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 121The Government plans to finalize and im plement the national strategic plan on the environment; develop policies for environmenta l management and effectively use them in development projects for the prevention of environmental damage; and publicize environmental protection methods and upgrade people's participation in environmental protection. At the same time, it will mobilize th e population to preserve the environment and prevent damage. The Policy on Sustainable Development of Natural Resources will be implemented. The natural resources will be managed and utilised in a reasonable and sustainable manner to ensure high benefit from the use of land, wate r, forest, mineral resources and biodiversity. Master plans on the management and utilisation of land, agricultural, industrial, urban, cultural, historical and natural sites will be developed. This includes developing master plans on water resources, forests, mineral resources, biodiversity and bio- safe technology, and on the prevention and control of adverse impact s from natural phenomena. Additionally, it is necessary to develop policy, strategy, laws and regulations on land, forests and water resources use. The Government's environmental sector wi ll be upgraded and the staff will be given appropriate training. Provincial environmenta l committees will be established in all provinces. A national environmental training prog ramme and kit needs to be developed. More environmental laboratories need to be built . A report on the state of the environment at national and provincial levels w ill be developed and disseminated. The National Strategy and Action Plan on Environmental Education and Awareness n eeds to be developed and implemented. A national plan on environmental sc ientific and technologi cal research will be developed. National, sectoral and provincial environmental protection funds will be developed. Financial mechanisms will be developed, in order to promote and enable individuals, businesses and legal entities to contribute to the National Environment Protection Fund (NEPF). A specific government budget for environmental management has to be allocated. The policies on the environment in particular the policies on taxes and expenditure and the funds for environment will be declared. Public participation in environmental protecti on processes will be encouraged. Environmental studies will be integrated into formal and non-formal education, including vocational training. More environmental protection meth ods will be publicised and the quality of broadcasting on weather disasters, early warnin g and prevention plans for natural disasters will be improved. Plans will be prepared to so lve the problems of natural disasters including flooding and the problems of environmental damage along the rivers, streams and lakes. The capacity of provincial and district disaster control committees will be raised. The study of agricultu ral systems which are appropriate to the livelihood practices of highland and flat land people will be promot ed. Local genetic resources and traditional species have to be preserved and an inventory wi ll be drawn up of plants, animals, insects and organisms with a focus on species that can be us ed in agriculture and he rbal medicine. It is important to develop and encourage the use of traditional knowledge a nd practices in using Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 122natural resources. Organic production and market s for organic products will be encouraged. The use of trade marks such as 'organic product' to guarantee the quality and uniqueness of the goods in the international markets will be encouraged. It is necessary to continue to solve problems by conducting surveys and data collection by line ministries and local administration to improve their plans and the Sixth Plan implementation. Priority is to be given to the su rvey of the land for minerals and forestry; the execution of surveys on wind energy by location and livelihoods; the pr omotion of surveys for basic data on natural conditions and resources; and, the expansion of surveys to collect social data on culture, ethnic origin and re ligion of the mountainou s and ethnic peoples. Environmental assessments will be undertaken on the impacts of development projects and operations on agricultural land. Surveys, assessm ents and evaluations will be carried out on the impacts of UXOs and yellow rain from the Indochina war, on human health and soil quality. The use of environment-friendly technologies and production processes, and systematic environmental inspection for urban and infrastructural developmen t projects, including industrial manufacturing and medium and larg e scale projects will be encouraged. The environment and social assessment regulations of infrastructure and environment quality and emission standards have to be developed and enforced. The procedures for managing the social and en vironmental impacts in hydroelectricity and mining development will be streamlined. The National Policy on the Social and Environmental Sustainability of the Hydr opower will be implemented. The industry and mining sectors will be encouraged to redu ce and minimize pollution, and toxic and hazardous wastes.

The use of renewable energy based on local and regional conditions has to be promoted. The business sector's involvement in envir onmental protection, restoration and the sustainable use of natural resources needs to be promoted. Regional and international environmental cooperation especial ly with neighbouring countries, ASEAN members, Mekong region countr ies and international organisations has to improve, in order to ensure good cooperation to deal with trans-border environmental issues and the protection of the environment. The st rategic plan on the development of special economic zones and free trade areas has to be implemented. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1233. Targets \u0083 Ensure the balance between socio-ec onomic development and environmental protection, so that all citizens live in a clean and nice environment; \u0083 Develop and manage land resources exploi tation and natural resources (water and minerals) in better ways; \u0083 Coordinate policies on economics and pr eventive policies; develop the natural resources and the environment; ensure th e proper and effectiv e use of natural resources; ensure the activities for industr ialization and modernization through saving and reducing the use of non-renewable natu ral resources; support the implementation of the policies on the use of land and other natu ral resources to generate funds for economic development; \u0083 Focus on solving the problems of environmen tal damage in the industrial areas and densely populated areas; \u0083 Efficiently check pollution levels and methods of environmental protection; \u0083 Raise the ratio of green areas to abov e 50 percent of all natural areas; \u0083 Aim to plant 25,000-30,000 ha of forest to increa se the ratio of forest cover to more than 50 percent in 2010; and increase fore st plantation in national parks, inter- provinces and national routes; \u0083 Reorient forestry administration including clarifying forest ar eas, giving land to households and communities, increasing me thods for protecting and developing forests and preventing forest fires; \u0083 Plant trees to cover logged areas and bare hills, particularly the areas along the Mekong, while at the same time preserving the natural view; \u0083 Develop areas for industrial trees, producing large volumes of goods such as rubber, fruit trees and special trees; \u0083 Increase the usage of quality control sy stems, modern environmental management (ISO 9000, ISO 14000), as well as paying at tention to produc t standards; \u0083 Increase the number usi ng environment-friendly technologies and production processes; \u0083 Support basic production entities that have just been established to use clean technologies and equipmen t to reduce pollution; \u0083 Ensure that waste disposal meets envir onmental standards, with 20 percent of production units to get certific ates on compliance with en vironmental standards or certificates; the production areas should have drainage systems for waste disposal as the standard to preserve the environm ent; and complete the basic level of improvement and upgrade the rain (storm) drainage systems in the cities as well as in the industrial and production areas; \u0083 Provide for the needs of environmental prot ec tion linked with international economies and reduce the constraints to export to the international markets, and link the economies through the mobilization of community participation; \u0083 Aim to clear UXO from all high prio rity agricultural areas by 2013; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 124\u0083 Put an end to slash-and-burn cultivation by 2010; \u0083 Reduce the proportion of the popul ation using solid fuels; \u0083 Reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all sources; \u0083 Reduce the consumption of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons; by improv ing NBCA management (FS/NBSAP); \u0083 Conserve threatened and endangered species in their habitat (NBSAP); \u0083 Controlling Wildlife Trade (FS/NBSAP); and \u0083 Biodiversity Management and ecologically sustainable agriculture and forestry (NBSAP). F. Private Sector Development The vision is to make the private sector an increasingly important driving force for accelerating economic growth, generating high-pa ying jobs, and reducing poverty. Increased private investment will provide new income generating opportunities including many new jobs during the next five years. Private sector investment will also play a pivotal role in increasing the competitiveness of the Lao econo my in regional and international markets during the period. 1. Overall Strategy The overall strategy is to create a more favourable environm ent to promote th e private sector and to attract foreign direct i nvestment (FDI). Existing regulati ons, laws and procedures will be changed to accelerate the process of setting up a business. Th e rate of growth of foreign investment into various projects will be accel erated. Investment activities will be varied due to an open environment for attracting foreign investments from the private sector or Lao people living overseas to be involved in commodity production for domestic and/or international markets. There will be measures for developing market types, science and technology services, intellectual products and business consultancies. There is a need to maintain the recent improvements in economic st ability and sustaining social stability as private investors want stab ility and predictability. 2. Specific Strategies Some of the main areas contributing to the enhancement of the business environment have been identified: a) enabling policies, regulations and practices, b) improvements in the legal framework, c) information and consultatio n, d) a more favourable macroeconomic environment, and e) improved coordination a nd management capacity. These are discussed briefly in the following: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 125a) Policies, Regulations and Practices Policies will be drafted and issued aiming at f acilitating the rapid development of the private sector, including businesses of all types and sizes. The private econo mic sector will be supported via an equal and fair business enviro nment for both private and state enterprises. The business law has to be finalised, implem ented and enforced. There will be immediate action on the promulgation of the law agai nst monopolies and barriers that confront enterprises. Private enterprises do not have to obtain any further permission certificates when there is equality in operation based on rule s and decrees regarding a list of permission certificates. Procedures of app lication and other unnecessary rest rictions will be limited to build connections among state organizations and to increase outside en terprises entering the markets (e.g. enterprise registrati on, procedures for obtaining offi cial stamps, tax registration, leasing land for operating business and conditions for applying for loans). The administrative application system for busine ss activities of enterprises within the private economic sector will be reformed. There will be a reform of the procedures such as monitoring, calculation and enterp rise accounting in order to facilitate activities and increase the effectiveness of monitoring. The Governme nt will continue the public administration reform related to business operation, improving the efficiency of monitoring and evaluation works toward creating more favourable conditions for all types of businesses. Policy makers need to respond quickly in taking concrete measures to reduce barriers to business investment. Government administration and organizations will be disciplined to prevent the rejection of business applications. There will be an experiment to transfer the application processes to business associations and capable sectors. Re gulations of the three business coordinating organizations will be announced. Regulations on such aspects as business registration, official stamp management and customs will be disseminated. Information on enterprises will be supplied to banks as a reference for gran ting loans. There will be an experiment on enterprise services to assist banks issuing limits on their loans. There will be campaigns on collecting funds for growing investment thro ugh selling enterprise, state and Vientiane (municipal) bonds. The priority is to reform th e regulations and admini strative constraints that give rise to monopolies, such as expandi ng the number of tourist operators permitted to establish in a province, lifti ng restrictions on movements of goods between provinces and not limiting provincial contracts to local firms. Relevant Governme nt agencies should be charged with studying and taking action to increase compet ition in priority areas, such as transport, logistics and freight handling. Discrimination betw een the state and the private sectors will be eliminated. The Government will complete the granting of land-use certificates and ensure land-use-related rights to businesses. It will review and revise the credit and banking policies with a view to expanding the target group an d simplifying loan pr ovision and allocation procedures. The overall business information system will be established and strengthened to support business operations as well as assist Go vernment authorities in terms of monitoring and evaluation. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will recei ve special attention and appropriate legal frameworks will be put in place at least by the end of the Sixth Plan (2010). The Prime Minister's Decree on the Promotion and Development of Small and Medium Sized Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 126Enterprises (No. 42/PM) issu ed on 20 April 2004, provides the overall framework for defining the directions and policies, es tablishment of SME support fund and support organizations, and regulations, practices and m easures to promote and develop SMEs in the country. The Decree identified six priority po licy areas for SME promotion and development: (i) creating an enabling regulatory and ad ministrative environment; (ii) enhancing competitiveness; (iii) expanding domestic and in ternational markets; (iv) improving access to finance; (v) encouraging and creating favorable conditions for establishment of business organizations; and (vi) enhancing entrepreneuria l attitudes and characteristics within society. Support to SMEs will be strengthened. Trad itional handicrafts will be developed and handicraft villages will be built to create jobs, generate income and develop the non- agricultural sectors in rural areas. b) Legal Framework Improvement The Government will promote the drafting and fi nalizing of the legal framework that better fits the socialist-oriented economy of the Lao PDR. This will help establish a base for business development in all economic sectors. The country will have a comprehensive legal system, which is a factor for effectiveness in a market-oriented economy. Legal procedures will be rationalized and improved with declaration, enforcement, dissemination and serious studies. There will be research done to adjust, improve or add some details to the existing legal system, especially in the areas of comm erce, bankruptcy, enterpri se, labour, credit, state budget and land acquisition, to suit the objectives of implementing the socio-economic strategy and of participating in the international economy. New laws will be formulated to suit the development objectives and facilitate participation in the international arena. The judicial system will be based on equality for facilitating foreign and domestic investments, in relation to building a stable environment and equity in business-production. The regulations and policies on investments will be implemented to suit each objective. Judicial documents will be impr oved in order to prevent documents that are against overall regulations. There will be transparency in th e application procedures , and administrative mechanisms will be based on a one-stop corridor window at the central and local levels for foreign investments. The law related to competition will be ann ounced in order to encourage state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to receive fair competition. For monopolistic enterprises, the Government will have rules to monitor pricing and benefits. The establishment of a central register of all legal documents and instruments related to private sector development is a high priority. A Registry of Secured Transactions has been established in the Ministry of Finance a nd will require technical support for making it functional. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 127c) Information and Consultation The following steps will be taken: (i) acceleration of the publication of E nglish versions of all laws and regulations with regard to investment; and publication of a newsmagazine on investment activities; (ii) re gular publication of important economic documents such as the national budget; and (iii) organization of regul ar meeting forums by the central and local Governments with the business sectors, domestic investors and potential economic partners in neighbouring countries to facilitate their operations and reso lve difficulties that may arise, and address the barriers to the further development of cross-border production networks. d) Macroeconomic Environment The measures will include a review of the ceilings on tax-deductible investment expenditures and the approval system for imports and exports. As indicated in an earlier section, the focus of the macroeconomic reforms will be on the re structuring of the financial sector. Improved credit risk management is a priority. Comp lementary measures presently under study include the enforcement of the Secured Transactions Law, and amendments to the Decree on Commercial Banks. e) Coordination and Management Capacity The coordination and management capacities will be improved in such areas as the enforcement of the laws concerning bankruptcy, secured lending, disput e resolution and debt recovery; and enforcement of the Tax Law. Th e tax officials will be trained and strict penalties will be applied to businesses and indivi duals that do not comply with the Tax Law. The quality and professionalism of the public service provision will be raised and corruption reduced; and also it will be easier for businesse s to comply with regulations, to pay customs duties and taxes. Management and analytical capaci ties have to be developed in order for the Government to be able to evaluate what is working and what is not; and also to respond to lessons from experience and changing circumstan ces. Relevant senior o fficials at central and provincial levels must take imme diate actions to resolve the constraints that can effectively be resolved by Government actions. They should be held accountable for progress in increasing business investment. The Government needs to regularly consult with the local authorities, civil society and th e business community to identif y major constraints, and to develop actions to address these constraints. Th e Government needs to prepare, distribute and discuss periodic reports on progress with pl an implementation, emerging bottlenecks and actions taken to address these bottlenecks. 3. Foreign-Invested Sectors A favourable environment will be created to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), especially from the main companie s in Asia. It is necessary to be aware that FDI is an organic part of the economy and will be further deve loped in parallel with the country's socio- economic development process. The present situ ation of the Lao PDR i ndicates that foreign Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 128investments have played a key role in developing the country' s economy and they will be major factors for development in the next decades. Despite the abundance of natural resources in the country, the di scovery and utilization of such resources has not been made due to the lack of funds, skil led labour and management capac ity. If the country manages to explore and utilize these resources, it will strengthen commodity production. In general, there are limitations in attracting fo reign direct investment due to the lack of a domestic workforce with technical capacity. Human resources development requires an extended period of time. A solution at the initia l stage may be to import international labour required to support projects receiving foreign direct investments. Clear er labour policies will be issued to promote the priv ate sector and foreign investor s to invest more capital in developing the industries. Foreigners working for enterprises investing in the country have to contribute to commodity production. Employees an d technical workers ar e urged to prepare for meeting the needs of foreign investments. Thus , there is an urgent need to train technical workers. The Sixth Plan (2006-2010) wi ll translate programmes into actions and methods for economic development that incorporate foreig n investments. There will be an immediate materialization of laws related to foreign i nvestments. The 5th National Assembly already made some changes to the mechanisms, policy, plans, procedures fo r granting investment permits, etc. These will be monitored regularly for further improvement and to enlarge the investment environment. This will create fast investment procedures, which will become simpler. Based on occupation types and regional specialty, a development plan will be determined in order to attract foreign invest ment. For example, foreign investment will be attracted in hydro-electricity, mining, food proce ssing, cattle rearing a nd export industries. A list of projects that require foreign investme nt will be compiled within each period of the five-years in relation to the granting of fo reign investment permits. A supporting committee will be assigned to inform potential investor s in capable countries to attract foreign investment. Major cities should set up meetings for discussion and report on the foreign investments that suit the capacities, strengths an d priorities of the local people as well as the country. Senior Government l eaders should arrange meetings with local and international investors/enterprises to receive feedback, in order to improve the public investment environment. The difficulties that confront th e enterprises should be addressed and solved immediately in order to encourage and fac ilitate production and business operations. Regular budgets will be injected into enterprise act ivities to enhance integration, discussion and assistance, solving difficulties that confront foreign investors. The Government will conduct regular assessments of enterprise business operations for every economic sector (e.g. private and state sectors), and has policies to reward people with great achievements with medals. Regulations and services will be improved and disseminated in order to simplify investment, and shorten th e time for granting investment permits. The effectiveness of investment promotion will be improved and there will be a new method to gain awareness about investme nts with ownership and suitab ility for local conditions and types of enterprises. The policies on investme nt priorities will be reviewed, including the regulations on granting investme nt permits, especially land ac quisition fees, transportation and telecommunications service charges and others, to build a more favourable investment Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 129environment in the Lao PDR. Projects with permission can be implemented immediately and new project registration will be speeded-up. Directions on minimizing service costs will be extended in order to obtain equal returns from both domestic and international investments. Land acquisition fees and some previous exemptions will be reviewed. Procedures and administrative permits relevant to foreign investments will be improved and the time involved for granting permits will be shortened. There will be open registration for investments and a limitation on certificates that are barriers to foreign investments. 4. Targets \u0083 Reform the laws and regulations involved in setting up enterprises and streamline the process; \u0083 Finalisation, implementation and enforcemen t of the implementing regulations for the Business Law; \u0083 Improve the quality and professionali sm of public service provision; \u0083 Increasing transparency; \u0083 Hold regular meetings between the central and local level Government and the private sector; \u0083 Reform regulations and administrative cons traints that give rise to monopolies such as: lift restrictions on the movement of goods between provinces; and abolish limitations on restricting provinc ial contracts to local firms; \u0083 Lift some restrictions on foreign workers; \u0083 Reform the tax system, setting up proper monitoring agencies; \u0083 Increase foreign investment; \u0083 Continue to develop regulations and business operation laws and improve the business licensing processes; reduce unnecessa ry procedures; and increase fast and convenient services to busi nesses and entrepreneurs; \u0083 Promote the establishment of enterprises, cooperatives and family businesses in all areas permitted by the Government; Increase people's access to financing. G. Science and Technology The long-term objective is to make the Lao PDR a technologically advanced nation, with highly skilled people and enterp rises able to compete effec tively in regi onal and global markets; and contribute and benefit from su ch participation. The technology of Lao PDR needs to rapidly catch up with the rest of the region, by identifying, transferring and adapting existing appropriate technologies from neighbouring and other countries. Increased FDI will contribute to this process. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1301. Overall Strategy The overall strategy is to facilitate interna tional integration on science and technology and methods to reduce the disparities in scien ce and technology between the Lao PDR and the regional and global levels; and promote international cooperat ion. The strategy and master plan on socio-economic development would aim at strengthening the fields of natural sciences to support industrialization and modernization a nd the overall socio-economic development of the country. Impor tance is to be given to rese arch in basic sciences for technological development, the exploitation of natural resources, and the protection of the environment. In addition to the selection of basic technology, there will be increased focus on the transfer of new technology, which has the decisive role to upgrade sectoral technologies effectively for economic development. Also, it is necessary to develop standards to evaluate technology levels in the produc tion and services sectors. 2. Specific Strategies The outcomes of science and technology policie s implemented in the Fifth Plan (2001-2005) will be evaluated to identify successes and le ssons learned to be selected and used for production and business plans in the Sixth Plan period (2006 -2010). The adoption of new technologies and best practi ces from science and technology for daily production and livelihoods will be supported. The science and technology research will be coordinated with teaching and practical production based on the tr ansformation of the present basic science research institutions and through new rese arch institutions for the schools and the universities. The Government will focus on the establishmen t and development of national science and technology; increase knowledge, mastering and quality; custom ize modern technology from foreign countries to the local conditions of production, service and in frastructure areas in order to reduce the time for technology transfer and adoption to accelerate its use. It plans to improve research on science and technology; exam ine and use best practices in science and technology for production and businesses; upgrade the technologies in the main production and services sectors, focusing on increasing the effectiveness and competitiveness of economic sectors; and increase the contribution of science a nd technology to the growth of each sector, each product, each area and the economy of each region of the country. The capacities of domestic science and technology will be improved including the ability to learn and apply the regional and global in novations in scienc e and technology. The Government will provide funds for national re search projects for use in socio-economic development. It will develop modern science and technology, first in some focal sites and in the fields needed for high technical qualificatio ns. The science and technology activities will be socialized to support their wider developmen t. The development of human resources in the fields of science and technology will be continued; the creative ideas and best practices in science and technology will be promoted; the best researchers and scientists will be encouraged and recognized; the opp ortunities for selection, lear ning and exploitation will be Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 131increased; and the technologies gained from foreign countries will be developed for appropriate application in the Lao PDR. The adoption of new technologies including the upgrading of technologies in the production and service sectors will be suppor ted; with particular attenti on given to the production sector, in accordance with the AFTA agreement, wh ich aims to upgrade labour efficiency and productivity, and improve economic competitiveness. Importance is to be given to enhancing the access of the rural, remote and difficult areas to the techniques and outcomes of science and technology. In the five-year period 2006-2010, priority is to be given to the development of science and technology to serve agricultural production and natural wetland resources, support research, select and use improved varieties of seeds a nd animals that provide high yields and high value, to serve the needs of the agricultural economies and the rural areas. Modern technologies for integrated farming will be used, expanding employment opportunities, producing the consumer products and exports, providing the raw materials to the processing industries and upgrading the capacity for economic competition. In agriculture, the focus will be on (i) resear ch and application of the high productivity and high value crop and animal varieties and (ii) research and application of post-harvest and agro-processing technologies. The Government will support the testing and adoption of improved rice production and livestock rearin g methods. Also, the development of bio- technology will be initiated and promising re sults applied in production. In industry and construction fields, the focus will be on research and application of modern technologies to increase the competitiveness of goods and services. Modern methods of science and technology will be harnessed to predict the weather and other natural phenomena; and disseminate the information widely to the public to reduce the damages from natural disasters. Research centres will be esta blished and the production of impr oved varieties of rice, corn, industrial trees, animal species, poultry and fi sh will be promoted in the provinces of Vientiane, Luang Namtha and Champasak. The number of staff in science areas will be increased based on the needs of the sectors in each region. First, the research centre and laboratories for the universities in Vientiane will be established, with focus on research in the key sectors such as electricity , minerals processing including iron, agriculture and forestry, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer and animal s feeds. The centre would coordinate with the ministries and projects to develop te chnical staff and focus on key sectors. The Government will continue to research the changes in mechanisms to manage science and technology aiming to mobilize the funds for the formation and improvement of professional skills; empower domestic labour to quickly adapt to the rapidly changing and stronger mechanisms in science and technology management; upgrade the quality and capacities for trade in technology products; se lect and widely use the tender procedures on science and technology to ensure competition, equality an d openness; operate the mechanisms for self- mastering and self-responsibil ities for the public agencies for scie nce and technology; organize and research the use and developmen t of technology for the activities in suitable Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 132forms of business mechanisms; enhance the science and technology of business units; and declare the law on intellectual property rights preservation and the law on the transfer of technology. During the Sixth Plan period ( 2006-2010), it is necessary to promote and prepare policies on the transfer of new technology, encourage in novations and upgrade the technologies in production and services in the economic s ectors; and ensure the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy for better economic integration. The investment in scientific research will be increased; researchers and highly qualified scientific staff will be developed; and the data (information) on science and technology will be upgraded. The Lao PDR will widely cooperate in scie ntific research and train researcher s in the science and technology of regional countries and the world. First, in coop eration with the neighb ouring countries, the Government will motivate the Lao peoples to develop the use of science and technology. It will improve the organization of people and attract foreigners to invest in the development of science and technology in the coun try. It will motivate th e expatriate experts, particularly the excellent Lao experts who permanently live abroad to return to teach and organize activities on science and technology. Research will focus on health, environmental impacts on health, infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS prevention. The research results will be used for the effective examination of the outcomes of natural resources utilization a nd environmental protection. The use of new technologies for monitoring and solving enviro nmental pollution will be promoted. Domestic and foreign technologies will be assessed for use in food processing, upgrading the health of the general population, and protecting biodiversity and the environment. 3. Technology Market Development It may be necessary to review and revise the drafts of new legal documents on intellectual property, technology transfer an d contracting to ensure intellectual property rights, declaration, and the transfer of research results. The G overnment intends to simplify procedures, and if deemed nece ssary, reduce tax, especially pe rsonal income tax imposed on qualified domestic or foreign experts working in the country. It will apply measures to reduce the transaction costs for technology transfer to the Lao PDR. An information system for science and technology will be established domestically and internationally to facilitate access to eligible persons and enterprises. Basi c information about intellectual property rights and copyright registration will be disseminated fo r people and organizations to register their science-technology products for industrial (patent) rights. There will be preferred conditions for building consulting organizatio ns, technology services for all economic sectors, market fairs for 'technology', and regula r seminars to introduce new outcomes of Lao and foreign technologies to mass customers. This will help enlarge the outcomes from science and technology, and contribute to the foundations of the techno logy market development. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 133VIII. SECTORAL AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT A. General Guidelines Based on requirements and development views set out for the Sixth Plan, the development of sectors, regions and economic players (sector s) in the five-year period should directly strengthen the nation's advantages and utili ze every natural resource, human resource, and knowledge of the Lao people. This process should also combine the advantages of international integration and favourable cond itions for trade with other countries to implement industrialization and modernization in a better fashion. Sectors and regions need to follow the general development rules and ma ke quantum jumps in a number of areas in order to catch up with global developments. Therefore, the development guidelines for sectors, regions and economic players of th e Lao PDR share common as well as unique characteristics with other countries. The sector-specific development guidelines for the five-year period 2006-2010 are based on the above reasons, and are as follows: (i) Develop sectors using more labour because the Lao PDR has an advantage in terms of human resources compared to othe r countries; with focus on sectors such as textiles, footwear, tourism and tourism services; and machinery and electronic products; (ii) Develop the core industri al sector products such as hydropower and mineral exploitation; (iii) Develop a number of tropical industrial trees and trees plants and animals with high economic efficiency and good consumer market; and on that basis, continue to develop the agro-processing industry; and (iv) Continue to bring the economic sectors to a new level of development through wide use of global developments in sc ience and tec hnology, especially paying attention to developments in Info rmation Technology and Bio-Technology. With regard to the public economic sectors, ge neral directions have to be followed. Economic systems should include many types of ownership and many forms of production and business organizations in which the state sector and th e private sector in cooperation with local communities must be established and improved in order to create the main economic pillars to be operated along with other sub-economic sect ors in parallel with the participation and uplifting of the roles of the private sector in development activities, with the aims to strengthen the fundamental national economic structures and to be strong enough for integration with the regional and global economies. The general orientations for de veloping types of businesses are to: (i) continue developing the state sector step-by-step, making it a decisive sector in the economy and an important force Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 134and tool for the State's macro economic regulation, especially w ith the state sector playing a key role in developing socio-economic infrastructure, ensuring the delivery of basic public services to all the pe ople, and developing key industries; (ii) develop collective businesses with many types of cooperation, with cooperativ es playing a key role, to accelerate the universal power of many individuals, specia lly to produce a large quantity of goods for export and for meeting the needs of society; (iii) develop individual private businesses in urban and rural areas, which will be satellites fo r enterprises and cooperatives; (iv) develop a variety of state capitalism in the form of jo int ventures, linking the Lao state sector with domestic and foreign private sectors; and (v ) make a break-through in foreign-invested enterprises, especially in key sectors and key regions. For the development of economic players/areas, the general guidelines are to uphold the roles of the main economic players/areas that have a high capacity of cap ital accumulation and growth. At the same time, opportunities shou ld be given for the development of other players/areas on the basis of their own advantag es. Special importance will be given to socio- economic development in parallel with defen ce and security in mountainous areas and ethnic areas, with priority for border areas. The detailed directions for development of the sectors and regions are provid ed in the following: B. Agriculture Development 1. Objectives The objectives include: (i) the development of commodity production to meet local demand and to increase exports, (ii) increase the number of agricultural products for export, with the continued shift in the structur e of the agriculture and rura l economy towards promotion of commercial agriculture, (iii) introduce and increase the application of new technology including IT in production, preservation and pro cessing, (iv) develop sk ills training in the rural areas on many aspects, (v) diversify the rural economies, especial ly to increase the value-added through links to othe r sectors to improve the people' s living standards, and (vi) build new agricultural development infrastructure. a) Development Guidelines First, we should continue to implement the prior ity plans of the Government as laid out in the Sixth Five-Year Plan for rice production to reach 3.2 - 3.3 million tons by 2010, especially in the seven plains areas with existing agricultu ral facilities and infrastructure. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to diversity the agricultural and forestry products to meet the existing market demand; and focus on the plantation of certain industrial crops based on the potential of each region to increase the export volumes . The latter includes th e plantation of such commercial crops as coffee, rubber, tea, cas hew, maize, cassava, beans, tobacco and sugarcane. Attention should be pa id to raising cattle with focused efforts, such as: cows and buffalos for export; and goats, pigs and fish to meet the increasing domestic market demand. It is necessary to continue to develop and establish focal areas for production in many Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 135locations and uplift the produc tion capacity by applying new technology. Also, there should be a focus on processing industries to add value to the agricultural pr oducts for export. Over the five-year period 2006-2010, the areas of slash-and-burn rice cultivation should be reduced by introducing new livelihood alternatives, such as industrial tree plantations and commercial crops, livestock rearing, and other permanent livelihood alternatives. It is necessary to establish and implement afforestation projects and water-shed protection areas, with the tree plantations reaching 25,000-30,000 hectares and increa se the forest areas to 50% of the total land territory. b) Development Guidelines for Some Sub-sectors Food crops and vegetables : The production volumes of food crops should continue to be increased to adequate levels to ensure food security and mainte nance of food reserves. Rice production in 2010 should reach about 3.2 -3.3 million tons, with the volume of all food crops production reaching 3.8 - 4 million tons, pr oviding for an average food availability of 450-500 kilograms per capita. Corn production should be promoted by increasing the planted area to 28,000 - 30,000 hectares, with a tota l production capacity of 135,000 - 140,000 tons. The low productivity land areas should be transformed for plan tation of other types of tree crops. Intensive agriculture should be promoted in order to increase the productivity of this sector. The agricultural focal ar eas should be developed with specialization of plantations, vegetables, and fruits with special Lao characteristics (e.g. organic fruits). Industrial trees : The general guideline for the five-year period 20062006-2010 is to establish various special plantation areas for certain types of trees in order to secure the quantity of supply to domestic/lo cal processing industries and fo r export. The plantation of industrial trees should be coor dinated with the establishment of the infrastructure for processing industries. The focal and central investments should be organized to apply advanced technology, and new improved varieties of higher quality so as to increase the volume of exports. The plantation of such crops as rubber, coffee, tea, tobacco, cotton and cashew, should continue to be expanded in areas suitable for these types of crops. Livestock : First, it is necessary to strive to ensu re the supply of a sufficient amount of meat to domestic markets. Animal ra ising activities on farms should be promoted, with priority to large animal raising programs, especially big animals a nd poultry, through new effective breeding of high quality animals. Animal feeding should be ensured to enable the export of a larger quantity of animals. The efforts to in crease the livestock should be intensified; especially big animals and poul try, with the grow th reaching about 4- 5% per annum. By 2010, the livestock sector should account for appr oximately 42 - 45 % of the total value of production of agricultural-forestry products. Fish Production : The production of aquatic animals of high commercial value should be increased, especially fish raising in the Me kong and its tributaries. The fish processing industry should be improved and expanded to increase the value-adde d in this sector. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 136Forestry : The administration and exploitation of timber and non-timber forest products should be improved and reformed, with controls on the exploitation of timber. At the same time, tree plantation and forest protection should be promoted. The categorization of different types of forests, including the identificatio n of ownership types (such as state-owned, collective, community and other forms of ownership) should be accomplished. The exploitation (use) of forest areas in the watersheds should be reduced by organizing strong management by the state units and increasing th e forest cover. The investments should be focused on plantation in order to ensure the supp ly of raw materials to processing industries, such as paper and plywood mills. The efforts on forestry plantation should be intensified to reach the level of 25,000 - 30,000 hectares. The forest cover should be increased to above 50 per cent of the total land area of the country by 2010, including through mobilization of tree plantation in public places and alongside the roads. By 2020, the forest areas should reach about 17 million hectares covering 70% of the total land area or the same level as in 1940. Effo rts should continue to reduce the damage to forests in rural areas; especially the damage caused by slash and burn cultivation practices. At the same time, clear policies need to be develo ped to create job opportun ities for local people in order to implement such guidelines. The implementation of permanent livelihood programs, such as the allocation of land a nd/or forests to be administered by local communities, long-term land titling programs, and tax exemptions on land use, should be continued to ensure stable livelihoods for the people. Therefore, it is essential to provide financial assistance and some production equipm ent to the local peop le. Poor households should be provided access to credit (loans); and vocational training on plantation techniques and related areas should be orga nized as a long-term approach. The efforts should be focused to support strongly the agriculture promotion activ ities with the aim to diversify the forms of production by local communities including in many sectors - agriculture, tourism and other services sectors - aiming at the eradic ation of poverty of the local people. In order to achieve the above mentioned object ives in the five-year period 2006-2010, efforts should be made to invest about 11.8 thousand billion kip in the agriculture and forestry sector, which would account for 16% of the total investment. c) Implementation Measures It is necessary to organize to establish develo pment regions, such as tree plantation regions and livestock production region s (rice and corn production areas have already been allocated), with special supporting policies in accordance with large-scale production guidelines by starting the implementation in ar eas where favourable conditions exists as a first step. In future, the line ministries and sectors and local administration authorities must urgently produce the lists of main types of trees (commercia l crops) and animals with high economic value that are effective and favourable for the conditions in their areas to be included in the lists of their investment priorities. By doing so, each district should select 2 or 3 main items to be the prioritized items for development based on the local potentials. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 137 The agricultural production should be continued, especially the production of vegetables and livestock in the plains of Vientiane, Bo likhamsay, Khammoune, Se don, Champasak, Attapeu and in the North, with special focus on the planta tion of rice, corn, and ve getables for export. Food production should be promoted in some mountainous areas to meet the consumption needs of the local communities. The development of the regions with raw materi als should be encouraged in order to sustain the supply of quality raw materials to the pr ocessing industry. Mechanisms and special policies should be identified to attract domesti c and foreign investment in the seven plains and in other areas where raw materials are pr oduced by reducing the cost of leasing land (rental), extending (prolonging) the lease (rental) period, and promoting the employment of domestic workers and skilled foreign labour. The development of rural infrastructure should be continued, preventing and reducing natural disasters. It is necessary to invest in aqu aculture, prioritize the investment in science and technology, and upgrade the capacity to compete in national and international markets. The society should be encouraged to invest increasingly in agricultur e, forestry and aquaculture to reduce the level of reliance on the state budget. It is necessary to invest in th e construction of basic infrastructu re for the agriculture and rural development sectors to more quickly increase their effectiveness and capacity, for example, through increased investment in the development of breed ing, fertilizers, agriculture extension and other technical areas. Investments in the construction of irrigation f acilities in agriculture production areas should continue; with the supply of materials, breeding, fertilizers and pesticid es to the agriculture sector ensured. Measures to increase productivity and support the development of vocational training should be introduced. The monitoring activities should be continued and the environmental protection approaches improved. The potentials of aquaculture should be explored and the practice safe aquaculture should be promoted to avoid the out break of disease. Land policy : The efforts on land management should be enhanced, because land is the basic requirement for agricultural production. Therefor e, focus has to be placed on planning and managing the land use in various provinces and local areas. The program of long-term land allocation to local communities should be implemented to support their production activities and to sustain the forestry development in the long-run. The people should be entitled to the ownership of land to be used for agriculture, for operating businesses and for supplying of products, within the right of land use and management. The owner has five types of right s over the land: develop/use, transfer, lease (offer for rental), inherit and use as collatera l. The Government allows organizations and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 138foreign individuals to lease (rent) land for speci fic (definite) periods at reasonable prices for the purpose of farming, and large- scale agriculture projects. The Government must develop mechanisms and policies to administer the land use, because land will be the biggest investment capital in the future. The allocation of the ri ght of land ownership must be do ne step by step, e.g. allowing for rental and collect the rental f ee at reasonable rates, with in crements according to the local context. The rental period should be on a l ong-term basis (e.g. 50 year for seasonal crop plantation or 70 years for long-term crops) to ensure confidence among land users and to be attractive for investment. The work to allocate the land and/or forest should be enhanced and land titling programs for agriculture purposes should be supported to promote land use in the most effective ways. Apart from this, with regard to the effectiveness of land use, surveys should take place to identify the special purposes of land use in different sectors, su ch as agriculture, industry and tourism (cultural attractions). In the implementation of these measures, consideration should be given to not invest in all programs at on ce due to insufficient f unds, and the Government may invest in prioritized focal areas first. Credit Policies : Favourable conditions and facilitating pl ayers should be created so that local people can have easier access to credit (the loan s) from the banks and to ensure that all people have equal access to the loans. The commercial banks, especially the Agriculture Promotion Bank, should be allowed to release th e loans with collatera l in an appropriate, transparent and quick manner to suit the actual conditions of local communities. In future, loans should be made available for different durations (short-term, me dium-term, long-term) according to the nature and seasons of activitie s such as tree plantation and animal raising. The financial resources should be ensured for distribution within the agriculture sector and for the rural development schemes. In additi on to the Government f unds and resources from the financial institutions in the form of loan s, funds should be mobilized from communities, and social organizations from within and outside the country to enlarge the investment funds in the agriculture sector. The implementation of the activities of (m oney) savings groups should be continued, organizing different forms of funds including village development funds, which have been initiated by the Government and implemented since the fiscal year 2003/04. It is necessary to review and share the lessons le arned to improve the works related to the administration of micro-finance, to follow the same guidelines a nd policies to promote agriculture and create income generation activities for local communities in parallel with th e promotion of savings groups or other forms of funds. The latter should be administered in a sustainable manner and regulated in uniform ways. Investment : The proportion of investment from the budget to the agriculture and rural development sectors should be increased, with investments in the construction of key Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 139infrastructure so that local communities are able to transform their agriculture structures and open opportunities for other business activities. The export-oriented agricultu re production (e.g. coffee, te a and rubber) must have mechanisms that can draw the attention of investors to i nvest in the construction of agriculture infrastructures. At the same time, credit mechanisms should be in place to reach rural communities with certain forms of financia l movement in order to contribute the funds to agriculture activities in rural areas. The policy of providing loans with variable interest to the various ec onomic sectors should be implemented. Commercial banks and credit institutions should set the interest rates for each target group and each economic region at appropr iate terms to ensure financial liquidity between the supply and demand side s based on the principle of mu tual benefit to the lenders and borrowers. Borrowers operating their businesses in areas with difficulties and poor families who plant trees or raise animals in lin e with the Government's promotional policies should receive priority to access the loans w ith special interest rates, below 20 - 30% compared to regular interest rates for the same types of lo an. The budgets should be made available to compensate the commercial banks fo r the subsidized rates. In parallel with the regular loan interests, loan policies should be revised to consider special loans for tree planting and livestock rearing a nd the difference between the inte rest rates should be clearly identified for each type of loan. The agriculture extension units should contin ue to be improved and expanded all over the country, promoting various forms of agricultur e extension activities su ch as the extension activities provided voluntarily by the private do mestic and foreign organizations operating their businesses in the Lao PDR, respecting the laws of the c ountry, so as to assist local people to commercialize thei r agricultural production and to support rural development activities. The research programs should be enhanced a nd the results of scientific research and technology should be utilized increasingly to provide inputs to the agriculture sector. It is necessary to invest in agricultural rese arch and development (R & D) by introducing appropriate policies to support research in ag riculture products that can maximize economic effectiveness. Science and technology should be introduced increasingly in farming communities by providing training and encouragi ng local farmers to learn new knowledge in production and marketing. Policies should be introduced to support the people who have knowledge and qualifications in agriculture and cr eate opportunities for them so that they can do the field work to directly support the farm ers. It is necessary to review development programs; create favourable conditions to encour age the farmers to operate their agriculture activities; open up busine ss opportunities; and create models of production. The state-owned enterprises oper ating in the fields of agricu lture and forestry should be reorganized; dissolving or cons olidating the enterprises that are not profitable; and not operating their business in an effective manner. The allocation of land/forests to families and collective groups should be conti nued; while increasing the meas ures to prevent damage to the forests; supporting the development of forests; and preventing forest fires. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 140 Enhance the measures for distributing agri culture products by actively looking for opportunities and promoting markets for such products. Support the development of markets in rural areas while opening up the opportunities for export market s. Establish the policy for product distribution by issuing sales contracts between produ cers, processors, brokers and farmers. Introduce strong mechan isms to reach the four target groups: farmers, scientists, business people (including commercial baking persons) and government officials to support the development of agriculture and distribution of products. Develop markets in rural areas by reorganizi ng the production and dist ribution processes in the agriculture sector in such a way to ensure the supply of adequate qu antity of products of good quality to consumers. Use measures to support the distribution of agriculture products, identifying products with potentials to compete. Improve breeding varieties and processing technologies. Establish technical infrastruc ture for collective ag riculture and open up commercial activities in ag riculture production areas. Implement the agriculture production policies suitable to the domestic contexts based on the reality between supply and demand. The state w ill not intervene in the areas of pricing of agriculture products, but will take the responsibili ty to adjust the prices in case of serious fluctuations by introducing appropriate instructions. Increase the consumption of goods and increase the purchasing (buying) power of rural communities by creating job opportunities in non-agriculture sectors. Implement credit policies in rural areas by introducing paymen t on instalment to buy machinery, equipment, production tools and other goods. Pay attention to the implementa tion of measures to prevent na tural disasters such as drought, and strengthen preparedness to fight fl oods that can cause damage to production. Promote and create facilitating conditions for lo cal people to sell their products including the efforts to find export markets. Actively develo p markets in rural areas and large urbanized areas. Provide market information and advice to local people and enterprises dealing with export, especially exports to Vietnam, Th ailand, China and other ASEAN countries. Enforce strict measures related to forest pr eservation and introduce strict measure to deal with officials or individuals involved in issu es relating to exploita tion of forests with inappropriate practices. The intention of rural infrastructure development is to attract investment by considering different forms of privileges, such as the exemption of land tax for the areas used for infrastructure development and for development of public service facilities in rural areas. With regard to the policies relating to the non- agriculture sector in rural areas, the state should take the responsibility to consider a nd develop master plans for the development of non-agriculture sectors, which can be operate d and progressed in a sustainable manner. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 141Organize villages with specific occupations, development villages, and small-scale industrial groups in specific regions. Support the villages that specialize in certai n occupations in areas of vocational skill training and knowledge in marketing. Support information dissemination activities and protection of goods produced in rural areas. Create policies to support the development of services for local communities, such as trade services, product brand development, and promotion of several vari eties of goods. Support fa rm-based production, collective farming, and business units in rural areas by providing loans, technology and training. C. Rural Development The objective is to reduce the disparities between rural areas and urban centres, enhance the transport and communications networks and improve the living conditions of the rural people, especially those in m ountainous and remote areas. 1. Overall Strategy In the Lao PDR, rural poverty is directly linke d to access to resource s and social services. The resources include the availability and assured tenure of land, access to forest and non- forest timber resources, securi ty of livestock, and access to agricultural inputs, credit, irrigation services and markets. The social se rvices include education and health services, clean water and safe sanitation. The Government's rural development strategy is intended to address the essential development constraints that include: (i) in adequate infrastructure, (ii) limited and poorly developed human resources, (i ii) poor health conditions, (iv) inadequate potable water and sanitation facilities; (iv) weak agricultural support and delivery services; (v) limited access to inputs and markets; and (v i) lack of access to short and medium term credit. The overall strategy is to devel op the agriculture sector as we ll as non-agricultu re sectors in rural areas to create employm ent, increase incomes and rest ructure rural economies; while simultaneously improving the access of the rural pe ople, particularly the poor, to basic social services. Investment assistance is to be provided for social and economic infrastructure in rural areas. Poverty alleviation will be continued, firstly for mountainous, remote, and minority areas. Industry and ag riculture will be synergized to increase the value of agricultural produce, especially that for expor t. Private sector development, particularly the development of the domestic private sector, will be critical to successful rural development, rural non-farm employment creation and poverty reduction. The existing strong linkages of many rural areas with markets in neig hbouring countries wi ll be developed. A strong community-based approach through a highl y participatory proce ss will continue to be encouraged and facilitated. The Government's main task is to enhance the conditions that enable the people to take charge of their destinies. The rural development strategy incorporates the improved access to essential factors of development in a comprehensive, poverty-focused planning process at the district level to en sure that all development initiatives are self-sustaining and compleme ntary. The people's access to (i) production inputs and sustainable natural resource manage ment technologies; (ii) national and regional Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 142markets through physical (roads and trade facilita tion) and institutional linkages; (iii) human resources and community instituti onal development; (iv) social services; and (v) rural finance will be improved. 2. Specific Strategies a) Off-Farm Employment Village groups will be established to provide employment and construct new rural industries, with the central aim of transferring professional skills. The development of small scale industries, handicrafts and arts will be empha sized, with support to other non-agricultural activities. The target is to shift 15-20 percen t of agricultural labour to small-scale industry, the production of handicrafts, and to the manage ment of forestry development and forest businesses. It will be necessa ry to develop forestry work s, employment, particularly supporting the production and upgrading the life-st yles of the ethnic populations. Disaster prevention methods will be implemented, such as methods of preventing drought for rice and other grains as well as making preparations to prevent floods. Temp orary migration is an important off-farm employment for rural people a nd hence barriers to internal migration should be removed. b) Industry Industrial centres in thre e areas will be developed to achieve results based on the concept of a nuclear city with modern infrastructure and se rvices. The focus will be on the value-added in the larger-scale sectors such as electricity, rice, food processing, wood processing, fertilizers, textiles, mining (such as gold, manganese, ir on, and bauxite), construction materials, machinery, electrical wares and high quality consumption goods, through the development of the production area and the indus try groups, and empowering the economies of the areas. At the same time, the adjacent areas with advant ages for supplying raw materials as well as markets for certain produc ts will be supported. The orientation of industrial development in the coming years is to give priority to developing the electricity a nd processing industries catering to domestic consumption and export, while continuing to promote mining; and developing selec tively some industries producing inputs (e.g. fertilize r) and industries serving agri cultural and rural economic development (such as machinery manufacture, electronics, garments, footwear and food processing). c) Services Investments will be made in the development of the border economic zones such as Xiengkhuang (Lao PDR - Myanmar), Boten (Lao PDR - China), Nam Kan (Lao PDR - Vietnam) and other check points (Lao PDR - Tha iland). The main activities of the zones are Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 143to provide services for import-export, touris m and border transport, generating additional employment opportunities for the rura l people in the surrounding areas. d) Infrastructure Development The investments for infrastructure development for each area will be increased in order to modernize the overall infrastructure system. Elect ricity and infrastructure will be provided for education and health facilities in the rural areas. Urban infrastructure in rural towns needs to be improved to attract investments and generate off-farm employment. e) Education In order to improve the education of the whol e population it is necessary to concentrate on equitable access, quality, releva nce and management of education. Increasing primary school attendance and literacy rates particularly for people in under-served areas, such as ethnic peoples, children with special n eeds and girls, is an importa nt foundation step. More schools will be built especially in rural areas, which w ill be supplied with th e necessary equipment, supplies and qualified teachers. Accessibility to quality secondary education has to be improved to raise the number of students en tering and completing secondary school and hence going on to third level education. f) Health The expansion of the rural health service netw ork is the single largest health programme, utilizing about 33 percent of the total inve stment over the five-year period 2006-2010. This includes curative services, stre ngthening primary healthcare (P HC) with an emphasis on the 47 poor districts, expanding the PHC to remote areas with 150 new health centres, three regional hospitals, 13 provincial hospitals and ten type A District Hospitals (ADH) and 46 District Hospitals (DH) in poor districts, and to promote the role of women in the PHC. Increased attention is to be given to PH C with emphasis on high risk groups; child immunization; recommendations on the use of safe water, sanitation, the management; control of transmittable diseases, such as diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV/AIDS; and clos e monitoring of other diseas es caused by drug addiction. Prevention and health care centres were built in eight areas throughout the country. g) Food Insecurity Food insecurity must be addressed as a first pr iority, especially for the 47 poorest districts. Without food security for themselves, households have neither the time nor the inclination to engage in other activities lead ing to longer-term improvement of their livelihoods. This concern will be addressed through the comprehe nsive district development planning system, which, together with improved accessibility, is at the core of the Government's rural development strategy. It favours a pro-active focal development area approach. Various development activities and initiatives that take place at the district or village levels will Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 144become much better integrated, enabling mo re effective use of limited resources and maximising benefits. Priority programmes in focal development areas or kum bans - one each in 23 districts among the 47 poorest distri cts - have been prepared. The focal area development plans will be completed and implemented in all kum bans in the 47 poorest districts during the Sixth Plan period (2006-2010). These will include activities a nd initiatives under the village development f unds, private sector initiatives and projects such as the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF). The activities and initia tives under other national programmes (e.g. UXO decontamination and sust aining opium eradication) will be better coordinated. It is necessary to develop the various occupa tions and promote local wisdom and knowledge in rural areas to create job opportunities, promote income generation, and transform the economic structures in accordance with the de velopment guidelines in the agriculture sector through comprehensive and systematic approaches . The investment ac tivities in rural and remote areas should be mobilized by attracting all economic pl ayers (sectors) including the state and domestic and foreign private invest ors. The investment efforts in economic and social infrastructure in rural areas should be continued, exploring all potentials and resources to solve the problem of poverty with primary focus on the 47 poorest districts in mountainous, remote, and ethnic group areas. D. Education Education is a crucial priority and one of th e four pillars of the poverty reduction strategy. This includes building a workforce that is knowledgeable and competent in implementing development policies and programmes and has the capability to apply the results of modern science and technologies for the benefit of the Lao society. One of the main goals of the education policy is to develop quality human resources to meet the needs of the socio-economic development of the nation and thus contribute to poverty reduction. In order to improve the education of the whole population, it is necessary to concentrate on equitable access, quality, relevanc e and management of the education system. Disparities in income/poverty, physical access, residence (rura l/urban), gender and language all affect educational attain ment. Increasing primary school attendance and literacy rates particularly for people in under-served areas, su ch as ethnic peoples, girls and children with special needs, is an important foundation step. It is necessary for the Lao PDR to (i) strengthe n the education system as the cornerstone of a human resource development st rategy focussed on poverty allevi ation and enhancing labour productivity, and (ii) implement the principl e of compulsory primary education as an important means of poverty reduc tion, with the development of education facilities at all levels (at the centre and in the provinces, district s and villages), paying particular attention to the ethnic areas and th e disadvantaged groups. The measures to achieve the education objectives include the following: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 145\u0083 Universal compulsory education at primary level and continue to increase participation at lower secondary level, ensu ring that all people have the opportunity to apply their education to serve the socio-economic development programme; \u0083 Strive to completely abolish illiteracy among the population; \u0083 Expand vocational, technical and higher e ducation to meet the needs of the new labour market and to improve the economic rates of return; \u0083 Train skilled workers, technicians, prof essionals and intellectuals to have the capability to apply modern science and technology to serve the needs of socio- economic development; \u0083 Raise national education standards gradually to be closer to the international standards; \u0083 Take education as the core of human res ource development and invest appropriately in education; and \u0083 Make education a duty of a ll the people in the society. 1. Overall Strategy The overall strategy in the Education sector includes: \u0083 Adapting literacy and skills training to local needs; \u0083 Expanding ethnic education; \u0083 Expanding cluster schools; \u0083 Coordinating literacy in remote areas w ith armed forces social activities; \u0083 Reforming the education system; \u0083 Using modern methods for science, languages and technology \u0083 Developing better curriculum and textbooks; \u0083 Promoting distance education; \u0083 Providing teachers; \u0083 Strengthening teaching; \u0083 Establishing \u0083 Strengthening institutional infrastructure; \u0083 Improving administration and manageme nt, and decentralising management. \u0083 Improving the policy and planning capacity; \u0083 investment in education; \u0083 Mobilisation and \u0083 Strengthening Party and local leadership; \u0083 Promote the potential for cross- border cooperation in education. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 146The Education for All programme is seen to be the main vehicle for expanding access to primary and lower secondary education and adult literacy. Also, acce ssibility to quality secondary education has to be improved to raise the number of students entering and completing secondary school and hence going on to tertiary education. The educational standards in the Universities and the number of vocational and technical colleges have to increase. More emphasis needs to be placed on scientific and techno logical research. The college facilities have to be improved, particular ly laboratories, libraries and research centers. Additionally, teaching and lecturin g standards have to be raised in territory education, in order to achieve regional and international rec ognition. All of these measures aim to increase the amount of semi-skilled, skilled and profe ssional workers entering the workforce, which will increase foreign investment and socio-economic development. 2. Sub-Sector Strategies a) Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) ECCE programmes aim to reach an enrolment rate of 11 percent for three and four-year olds in 2010 and 17 percent in 2015, and reach an enrolm ent rate of 30 percent for five-year olds in 2010 and 55 percent in 2015. The proposed strategy to achieve th ese targets is to selectively increase and provide equitable ac cess by: promoting coordination between the Government, community and the private sector, mobilizing communities in favour of pre- school education, promoting the developmen t of community pre-school centres and promoting access of five-year olds to pre-school education, by establishing a special primary school class to prepare five-y ear old children for Grade 1. b) Primary Education The most important target is achieving universal quality primary education by 2015, with equitable access and completion as medium-t erm objectives. There are strong disparities between gender, ethnic minorities, poor and non-poor, and urban, rural and remote areas. Low enrolment and completion rates are concentrat ed amongst children in rural, remote and ethnic minority children in poor districts. The main targets are to: \u0083 Convert 80 percent of incomplete prim ary schools to complete schools by 2010; \u0083 Provide access to a primary school to child ren from all under-served villages by 2010; \u0083 Gross Enrolment Rate to reach 95.8 percent (girls), 97.8 percent (boys), and 96.8 percent (total) in 2010; \u0083 Net Enrolment Rate to reach 89.7 percen t (girls), 91.4 percent (boys), 90.6 percent (total) in 2010; \u0083 Reduce Repetition Rates in Grade 1 to 5 percent for both girls and boys in 2010; \u0083 Reduce Dropout Rate in Grade 1 to 5 pe rcent for both girls and boys in 2010; \u0083 Reduce Dropout Rates in Grade 5 to 1 pe rcent for both girls and boys in 2010; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 147\u0083 Increase the Primary School completion Ra te to 75.4 percent (g irls), 79.5 percent (boys), and 77.4 percent (total) in 2010; and \u0083 Pupil-Teacher Ratio to be kept constant and not to exceed 31:1. c) Lower and Higher Secondary Education Secondary schools coverage is highest in urba n areas and economically developed areas and lowest in rural, remote and ethnic minority ar eas and poor districts which contribute to a widening gap in learning opportunities. High enrolm ent rates, lack of classrooms and lack of teachers result in high pupil/teacher ratios in urban areas; whereas low enrolment rates and surplus classrooms, equate to low pupil/teacher ratios in rural areas. Gender disparity manifests itself more prominently in rural, re mote and ethnic minority areas, while the gender disparity is reducing in urban areas. The main targets are to: \u0083 Achieve parity between girls and boys in access to lower secondary education, particularly in ethnic minority and poor areas; \u0083 Reach a national transition rate from Grad e 5 to Grade 6 of 82.5 percent in 2010 and 85 percent in 2015; \u0083 Achieve an attendance rate of 68.4 per cent for lower secondary schools; and \u0083 Achieve an attendance rate of 40 pe rcent for higher secondary schools. d) Non-Formal Education (NFE) Only 45.2 percent of the adult pop ulation are currently considered to be literate at a basic level. A significant challenge is to achieve ove r 98 percent reported adult literacy rate and 61 percent tested basic adult lite racy rate by 2015. The purpose of the NFE programme is to increase learning opportunities for children not enrolled in school, school dropouts and young adults, thus increasing the adult li teracy rate and reducing poverty. The Ministry of Education's (MOE's) strategy is to concentrate its actions on three main disadvantaged target groups: \u0083 Children and young adults aged 6-14 who did not have a chance to be admitted into primary school and are willing to follow lite racy and continuing education courses; \u0083 Adults aged 15-40 who are illiterate and ar e willing to participate in literacy and continuing education courses; and \u0083 Young adults and adults aged 15-24 who do not have definite vocations and are willing to participate in basic vocational training. The targets are to: Annually en rol 20 percent of the primary dropouts in non formal primary courses; and 2 percent of the illiterate adults in adult literacy programmes. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 148e) General Developments for Pre-School s, Primary and Secondary Schools More kindergarten, primary, secondary and voca tional schools need to be built, equipped with the necessary facilities and qualified t eachers. Existing schools need to be renovated. Access to schools can also be improved by gr ouping schools and establishing self-sufficient dormitories for teachers and students. School faci lities in rural remote areas in general are mostly temporary facilities lacking play and learning materials as well as basic sanitation facilities. Kindergarten teachers need to be properly trai ned and a curriculum should be developed with toys and aids. Improving teachers' conditions and salaries is ex tremely important to support the objectives of teacher training, recruitm ent, deployment and especially motivation. Working and living conditions of teachers worki ng in rural and remote areas have to be improved in order to attract teachers to those areas. The Government will gradually improve the quality of teachers and ensure that they re ceive appropriate training. It will reform the teaching and learning methodologies; establish a comprehensive and uniform curriculum and text-books; upgrade the training infrastructure; mobilise the creative and free ideas for the learners and students; and implement the syst em of monitoring and evaluation to ensure education quality. The Government will implement the policies of exemption, reduce the tuition fees and provide scholarships to the poo r students, other students in th e target groups and the best students. It will create favourable conditions for education's regional and international integration; and promote decentr alisation in fund util isation and education management. It is necessary to reform and improve the Govern ment's capacities in education management; improve the Government agencies to implement the development plans; establish a legal framework for education on monitoring and evaluatio n; and clearly define the responsibilities of the central and local authori ties in education management. f) Tertiary Education In the Sixth Plan (2006-2010) period, a master plan for the development of universities, colleges, high schools and vocatio nal training networks will be established. A university in Luang Prabang and a technical college in Luang Namtha will be constructed, where technical and managerial training such as mineral expl oration and processing, ag ro-forestry processing and tourism will be provided. The capacities of the teachers and professors in the universities in Vientiane, Savannakhet and Luang Namtha have to be upgraded. The three national-level Universities have to be upgraded with bett er libraries and laboratories. The National University has to be improved so that it reac hes regional and intern ational standards. The bachelor's degree curriculum has to be improved and the master's degree curriculum has to be developed. High-level technical schools for each area of industry, middle-level technical schools for agriculture, and two or three teacher colleges should be established. Vocational schools need to be expanded and improved, by mobilising funds from all economic sectors, to enable them to receive the students who gra duate from secondary schools. A policy will be established to encourage households to send th eir children to study abro ad and then return and serve the country. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 149 Investment in scientific research needs to be in creased. The first task is to establish research centres and laboratories for the universities, wi th focus on research in key sectors such as electricity, minerals processing, agriculture and forestry, seeds, chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizers and animal feeds. In addition, the centres should coordi nate with the ministries and projects to develop technical staff and focus on key sectors. The curriculum and teaching methods should be reformed to train high-quality workers, in particular workers to serve key economic sectors. The scientific and technological researchers should be trained in line with regional standards. Promote vocational training for workers to in crease their employability and encourage the domestic and foreign sector to take part in vocational training areas. Develop vocational high schools in Xiengkhouang, Huaphanh and Oudomxay. Curricula need to be developed for vocational and technical education that is releva nt to the needs of the domestic and regional labour markets. These schools have to be s upplied with proper textbooks, workbooks and other instructional materials. Additionally, businesses should be encouraged to upgrade the quality of the professional skills of business people, particularly in the fields of business administration and management, techni cal knowledge and foreign languages. 3. Targets The main targets for 2010 in the education sector are to continue to increase the level of training to achieve the ratio of 1,140 stude nts per 100,000 people; and increase the proportion of well-trained workers at different leve ls to 10 percent by 2010. Gradually popularize primary and secondary education; initially th is should be done in urban areas. Attention should be given to ensuring by 2010 net enrolm ent rates of 16 percent for kindergarten, 90.6 percent primary, 68.4 percent for lower-s econdary and 40 percent for upper-secondary schools; and 90 percent of the those between 15-39 years old should be literate. Other targets include the following: \u0083 Reduce repetition and drop-out rate s by 2-3 per annum; \u0083 Develop teaching/learning aids for Lao langua ge teaching to ethnic minority children and distribute Lao language teacher guides; \u0083 Develop primary and lower secondary cluster schools; \u0083 Reach international standards in quality of education at all levels of education; \u0083 Provide pedagogical assistan ts and in-service training for teachers and upgrade untrained teachers to achieve basic qualifications; \u0083 Improve the central and regional manageme nt and administration of the education sector through, among others improving the regulations and raising the level of inspections, strengthening the planning capacity (including EMIS) acro ss all levels of education delivery, appointing well trained ad ministrators and school directors for the management of schools and institutions, and providing management and administrative training courses; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 150\u0083 Promote community participation in schools, by promoting the establishment of pupil-parent associations at all levels of education; \u0083 Establish an education development fund a nd improve the flow of funds to schools and institutions; and \u0083 Improve the financial management of th e Provincial Education System (PES) and District Education Board (DEB) offices. Other targets in the Education sector include the following: \u0083 HIV/AIDS: This pandemic needs to be treated as a social issue, not just as a health issue. MOE will develop instructional and reading materials on life skills for preventing the spread of the disease; \u0083 Drug Control: In collaboration with MOH and other ministries, MOE will develop awareness programmes to help eradicate drug use among students; \u0083 Information and Communicati ons Technology (ICT): The G overnment will encourage investment in computer technology and facilitate the use of the internet, particularly in remote and poor areas. Education and training in ICT will be promoted; \u0083 Distance Education: The Government is planni ng to create a distance education centre at the National University of the Lao PDR; \u0083 Unexploded Ordinances (UXO) teaching School Feeding Programme: MOE promotes primary school particip ation of poor and vulnerable children, especially girls, in food-insecure areas through a school feeding programme; \u0083 Population: MOE is strengthening its research and instru ctional capacity to support the Government's policy of population growth and socio-economic development; \u0083 Health Education: MOE aims to integrate health education and promotion into the primary and secondary curriculum, and to expand school sanitation; \u0083 Gender Equity: MOE mainstreams gender equity into virtually all its activities; and it also has a number of specific \"pro-girls\" activities; and \u0083 Children with Special Needs: For children with special needs, MOE focuses on inclusive education. E. Health The Government is committed to improving the hea lth status of the citizens as part of its over-arching goal of leaving the status of a least develope d country by the year 2020. Some of the tasks to improve the health status of the population of the Lao PDR include reducing urban-rural health differentials, lowering mother and child mortality rates, raising life expectancy and reducing the spre ad of communicable diseases. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1511. Current Situation Prevention is one of the main priorities for th e country. Therefore, in itial coordination was made with different agencies, lo cal authorities and line ministries in charge of cultivation and communications to promote hygienic lifestyl es and protection from diseases, combat superstitions and encourage infected people to seek treatment at hospitals. Child polio was eradicated in 2000. Immunization was expanded to infants for various diseases such as cough, measles, tetanus, tuberculos is and others. Efforts aimed at protecting the people from easily transmittable diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and HIV/AIDS gave quite good results. Another major aim is to increase treatment. I nvestments were made to upgrade treatment in the central and regional hospitals and expand access to medical services. At the same time, traditional (medicine) treatment systems were improved and developed. The bed occupancy at central and provincial hospitals was about 80 percent. Since 2001, the private health network was also developed. There are currentl y 484 private clinics, of which 244 are located in Vientiane and 240 are in the localities, whic h contribute to the diversification of health care services. 2. Overall Strategy The overarching goals for the health sector are to (i) develop a nation-wide health delivery service that is fair and equal according to ge nder, age, social rank, tradition, religion, ethnicity, and geographic location; (ii) provide basic health services that respond to the peoples' needs and expectations and that gain the peoples' trust; and (iii) achieve substantial improvement in the peoples' health st atus, especially of the poor people. The overall efficiency of the health system has to be increased, along with improving donor coordination, reviewing the relative amounts of recurrent and investment expenditures, selecting priorities, and resource mobilization. Improving the quality of the data is also required. Private investment will be encour aged in all areas of health provision. It is necessary to strongly en courage health care by upholding prevention as a primary task and treatment as an important task to ensure the Lao people's health. The objectives are to reduce the incidence of diseases including communi cable diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, lepr osy and HIV/AIDS; reduce maternal and child mortality rates; and provide health care services and enable people to access high qual ity medical services. All the people should be able to live in a healthy and sound phys ical environment. Priority is to be given to primary health care with em phasis on high risk groups, maternal health and family planning, child immunization, education on th e use of safe water, sanitation, and the management and control of transmittable diseases , such as diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV/ AIDS, and close monitoring of other diseases caused by drug addiction. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1523. Population Development Policy In line with the Program me of Action adopted by the Inte rnational Confer ence on Population and Development (Cairo, 1994), the Government has formulated a National Population and Development Policy (NPDP), adopted in 1999. The main policy goals of the NPDP are to: Support measures to achieve a rate of population growth compatible with socioeconomic development and employme nt opportunities avai lable within the country; Ensure safe motherhood and enable couples to responsibly decide the number and spacing of their children; Improve the status of women and the mu lti-ethnic populations by improving access to education, health, social welfar e and socio-economic development; Promote a balanced distribution of popula tion between rural and urban areas and between different parts of the country; and Incorporate population factors and concerns into all soci al and economic policies, plans and programmes. Two main programmes have been at the fore front of the Government's population policy: Reproductive Health and Population and Development. The purposes of the Reproductive Health Pr ogramme include: (i) increasing the use of reproductive health services and informati on leading to responsible and safe sexual behaviour, and (ii) creating an enabling enviro nment for the provision of quality, integrated services and counselling on reproductive hea lth. Activities under this programme include special focus on ethnic groups and institutional strengthening and training. The 'Population and Developm ent' Programme focuses on the following inter-related outputs: (i) strengthened advocacy capacity of key organisations (e.g., the National Coordinating Committee for Population and Development or NCCPD) for the implementation of the NPDP and its Acti on Plan, and support to key population/gender issues; (ii) strengthen ed capacity of CPI and other agenci es for data collection, analysis, training, research and dissemination of inform ation on gender and population issues; and (iii) strengthened capacity of NCCPD, CPI and ot her organisations for the coordination and implementation of the national population programme. The objectives are to improve the quality of the population, ba lancing population growth with socio-economic growth and the capacity to meet the labour force and employment needs; and ensure equal population distribution between urba n and rural areas, while ensuring that the population movement is well planned. The target for 2010 is that the population gr owth will reduce to 1.85%, with the average growth in the five-year peri od at 1.91% (as compared to 2.12% during 2001-2005). Reduce the fertility rate from 4.5 in 2005 to 3.9 per woman in reproductive age in 2010. Reduce maternal mortality from 405 to 300 per 100,000 live births. Reduce infant mortality below one year (IMR1) from 70 to 55 per 1,000 live bi rths; reduce IMR5 from 98 to 75 per 1,000 live births; and increase average life expectan cy from 61 years to 63.5 years during the five- year period. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1534. Priority Programmes and Strategies Primary health care is the main priority aimed at increasing the standards and availability of health care in the country. The co mponents include the following: (i) Information, Education and Communication (IEC) including the reorganisation of the IEC, the preparation of campaigns and the translation and dissemination of information about hygiene and proper lifesty les (the '3 cleans' of preventative healthcare: drinking boiled water, eati ng cooked food, and washing hands before eating and after using the to ilet) in ethnic languages; (ii) Expansion of the Rural H ealth Service Network incl uding curative services, strengthening primary hea lth care (PHC) with an emphasis on the 47 poor districts, expanding PHC to reach more than 80 percent of villages, enabling remote and poor villages to have access to basic health care and referral services to hospitals, the construction of 150 new health centres, three regional hospitals, 13 provincial hospitals, and 10 type A dist rict hospitals and 46 Type B district hospitals in poor districts, and promote the role of women in PHC. This is the single largest programme account ing for about a third of the total expenditure in the sector' (iii) Upgrading the Capacity of Health Workers, with priority to increase the number of health personnel working at the village and district levels and emphasis on the 47 poorest districts. Special efforts will be made to increase the good behaviour, morale and capacity of the health personnel at the district and village levels in parallel with the provision of essential drugs and necessary medical equipment to the district hospitals, the Health Centre s, and the drug re volving funds at the village level; (iv) Maternal and Child Health (MCH) prom otion through the MCH Centre of the Ministry of Health and its facilities in provinces. Many of the interventions, such as essential obstetric care require upgraded health faci lities with delivery and operating theatres which are financed under Strategic Programme (ii) above or are subsumed under the strengthening of the MCH network; (v) Immunisation as the cornerstone of primary health care as it is one of the most efficient and cost-effective methods of improving health; (vi) Water Supply and Environmental Health co mprising primarily efforts to increase access to safe water through various methods and access to latrines both at schools and in households; (vii) Control of Communicable Diseases such as malaria, dengue, chol era, tuberculosis and helminth, through among others the Global Fund (for funding the malaria and TB programmes); (viii) HIV/AIDS/STI Control th rough surveillance, preven tion, care, support and treatment; and (ix) Development of Village Drug Revolving Funds as a major mechanism to provide at least some curative services for those li ving in remote areas so that they do not have to depend completely on unsupervised itinerant drug sellers or travel excessively long distances to access simple care; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 154The above components absorb the lion's share of resources in the health sector. The other supporting programmes in the sector include food and drug safety and the promotion of collaboration/complementarity between traditi onal and modern medicines. Also, it is necessary to improve the health management a nd health financing stru ctures of the country, through among others, the introduction of health insurance and health equity funds, both of which have considerable impact on the fi nancing of health services for the poor. 5. Targets The Health sector targets by th e end of the Sixth Plan (2006- 2010) include the following: \u0083 Life expectancy at birth will rise to 63.5 years; \u0083 Infant mortality to reduce to 55 per 1,000 live births; \u0083 Mortality of children under five years (c hild mortality) to reduce to 75/1,000; \u0083 Maternal mortality to reduce to 3300 per 100,000 live births; \u0083 Number of people catching tuberculosis to reduce to 72 cases per 100,000 people; \u0083 Child vaccination covera ge to reach 85 percent; \u0083 Vaccination programme to eliminate dange rous epidemics to reach 100 percent; \u0083 Ratio of malnourished children under five to reduce to below 30 percent; \u0083 Access to basic health care services to reach 100 percent; \u0083 Access to safe water to increase to 75 percent of the people overall; \u0083 Access to safe water in rural areas to increase to 70 percent of the people; \u0083 Coverage of toilet facilities meeting sa nitary standards to rise to 60 percent; \u0083 Proportion of schools having segregated san itary facilities to rise to 35 percent; \u0083 For the 72 poor districts, the Ministry of Health has set the following targets for 2010: 100 percent of the population in all the 72 poor districts will have access to PHC; and 75 percent will have access to clean water; and 55 percent to will have access safe sanitation. F. Industry and Minerals The long-term objective is to de velop the industry and minerals sector as a key part of the industrialization and modernization process, contributing to achieving the 2020 goal. The industrialization would be base d on the natural resource endowments and the comparative advantages that the Lao PDR enjoys. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1551. Overall Strategy The orientation of industrial development in the coming years is to give priority to developing the electricity a nd processing industries catering to domestic consumption and exports, while continuing to promote mining and developing selectively some industries serving agricultural and rural economic de velopment (such as fertilizer, machinery manufacture, electronics, garm ents, footwear and food processing). Also, it is planned to develop some industrial by-products to increa se the proportion of home-made electronic products, automobiles, motorcycles and materi als for garment and footwear manufacture. The Government will continue either correctin g or issuing clearer policies to promote the private sector and encourage foreign investor s to invest more capital in developing the industries. The Government will implemen t development policies for industries using domestic materials in order to increase the value-added and promote potential strengths for economic development. It will establish an investment promotion policy for regional industrial development in regions with difficulties and mountainous regions. Government will speed up the arrangements for the revitalization and development of state- owned sectors to increase the pr oduction and trade effici ency of SOEs. Unfa ir regulations for production and trading among economic components need to be adjust ed. The Government will formulate and implement supporting pr ogrammes for small and medium sized enterprises. It will carry out the instructions of the Prime Minister on banning the export of logs and timber; together with promoting forestation. It will work out solutions to encourage the production of high value furniture, including through the distribution of logging permits for manufacturers of furniture sold in domestic and international markets. The Government will encourage technological transfer in production to improve the competitive ability of products, beginning with garments, leather and shoes, processing industries, handicrafts and art, to satisfy the export demand. The usage of quality control systems, and modern environmental manage ment (ISO 9000, ISO 14000) will be increased, as well as paying attention to the product standards, packaging, and habits and traditions of each region so as to penetrate and enlarge markets. The Government will fight against smuggled goods, imitation products, and products with imitated labels. It will simplify customs forma lities and procedures for the export and import of production materials, star ting with industrial production. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1562. Sub-Sector Strategies a) Electricity In the coming five years, attempts will be made to bring some new power stations into operation to boost the electricity exports and to meet the steadily growing need of domestic production and consumption. The list of hydro projects for granting foreign investment permits will be consistent with the Powe r System Development Plan. The Government envisages the projects to be integrated into the emerging regional electricity market. In parallel with the development of hydroelectric plants, the electricity loading system will be constructed to decrease electricity transmission losses; the capital and operating costs will be reduced, with focus on the two big projects approved by the Government; electricity transmission lines and transformer stations will be constructed in the Northern and Southern Regions with 2,860 km of high-tension lines to transmit electricity from the Lao PDR to Thailand and Vietnam. The country will activel y cooperate internationally and within the region to develop the electricit y system and exchange power with other countries in the region through trading electricity and connecting the electricity grid with China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. b) Coal Industry The focus will be on exploiting fully all discover ed and potential coal mines to balance the domestic supply and demand. Th e production of anthracite co al should reach about 50-60 thousand mt per year. c) Mining and Metallurgy More investments will be encouraged in exploiti ng minerals such as gold, tin and copper. The production of copper is projected to reach 45,000-50,000 mt per year, tin 2,000-2,500 mt per year, gypsum 300-400 mt per year, and gold 10-13 mt per year. The proposed growth of the total mining industry is 15 percent per y ear during the Sixth Plan period (2006-2010). d) Cement Industry In cement production, attempts will be made to reach a growth rate of over 20 percent per year; with cement production reaching 1.3 million mt by 2010. To reach the above goal, it is necessary to continue to sp eed-up investments in cement projects implemented during 2004- 2005, as well as to seek capital to carry out new projects. The Government will undertake research to increase production and improve the quality in some existing plants by replacing blast furnace technology with reverter furnaces. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 157e) Machinery The focus is to concentrate on the manufactur e of products with market advantages and competitive abilities, especia lly products serving agricultur al and rural areas. Machinery serving construction, production lines and ship building, manufacture of machine-tools, and the automobile and motor cycle industries w ill be developed. Production lines in the cement industry, paper, electricity, and the chemical fertilizer industry will be redesigned and improved by gradually replacing imported equipment. The focu s will be on the depth of investment, renovation of equipment and techno logy, and modernization of some key phases in production. Advanced mechanical consumer products like refrigerators, air conditioners and civil electronic facilities will be developed through the mobilization of foreign investment. The assembly of automobiles and motor cycles will be developed to help manufacture automobiles of all kinds, part icularly coaches and high quality taxis. f) Electronics, Information Techno logy and Telecommunications The development of electroni c assembly, information technology, software serving administration, education and tr aining, services to develop e- commerce, including managing finance and banking will be conti nued. Initially the focus will be on the manufacture of some electronic components. The idea is to con centrate on investing in depth, innovating technology, modernizing former manufacturin g foundations, building new ones to meet domestic needs, reducing imports, and gradually increasing exports. The attraction of foreign investment into this field will be promoted. g) Chemical Industry Efforts will be made to try to speed up fertili zer production, especially for ensuring initiatives in balancing the availability of fertilizer for agricultura l production. The market and efficiency for investing in manufacturing pl ants exploiting potash (rock salts) will be researched. There are plans to develop some i ndustrial chemical products such as phosphates, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid for the fe rtilizer industry, and fo r the production of pesticides and rubber manufacture. An overall research on comparative advantages, demand and capital availabilities fo r producing some medicines for the domestic market will be carried out in order to gradually cut down imports. h) Textile Industry A basic change in the structure of garment produc ts will be tried, increa sing the share of high value products, to gradually meet the requirem ents of the fashion in dustry, increasing the domestic value added in the exports. The domestic market will continue to be enlarged and exports will be promoted. The Government w ill cooperate with experienced Vietnamese enterprises to gradually participate in the gl obal distribution networ ks of trans-national Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 158i) Footwear Industry Emphasis will be placed on modernising some phases of the manufacturing process in the shoe industry; paying attention to developing the sour ces of all kinds of leather and increasing the use of domestic raw materials an d additional materials in order to increase the value of exports. In order to reach the above goals in the next five years, the leather and shoe industry would emphasise investments to increase product quantity and quality by introducing software into the design and sewi ng of shoes, diversifying products and designs, and changing from assembly to producing materials and selling products. The sources of leather will continue to be developed by strongly developing the herds of cattle and importing modern processing technologies. The system of purchasing leather will be well organized and the proportion of gathering pelt will be increa sed. Ranchers and leather suppliers will be encouraged to invest in leather tanning factories. j) Beverage Industry Investments in developing factories manufac turing juices and mineral water will be prioritized. New beer factorie s will be developed and the enlargement of existing beer factories will be continued to rapidly increase productivity to meet the domestic demand and to export. The total growth rate is to be about 10 percent per year. k) Tobacco Industry It is planned to continue inve sting in the renewal of equipment and technologies to improve product quality, and maintain an annual growth rate of 3-4 percent, while promoting exports. Main developments will focus on products wi th filters, and products of middle and high quality to both increase value and quality and decrease the negative impacts of cigarettes. l) Cooking Oil Industry The plan is to achieve an annual growth rate of 13 percent, concentrating on exploiting the domestic market to meet the domestic dema nd, while simultaneously continuing to promote exports. The cultivation of specialized areas for oil-bearing crops will be built up step-by-step to reduce the dependence on imported raw materials. m) Dairy Industry The emphasis will be on investment to develo p cow herds to increase the domestic capacity of milk supply. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 159n) Plastics Industry It is necessary to attract economic actors to invest in this branch of producing high quality plastic products such as computer cases, tele visions, and automobile and motorcycle spare parts, in order to meet the needs of consum ers and plastic wrappers for industry. By 2010, it is expected that the production of plastic products will reach 8,500 mt. 3.

G. Infrastructure The long-term goal is to provide the necessary in frastructure to sustain a modern nation state, where people in all parts of the country c ould easily communicate and participate in development activities in the country and inte ract with the people and markets outside the country. 1. Overall Strategy The main objective for infrastructure developm ent in the Sixth Plan period (2006-2010) is to continue to maintain, improve, and develop the socio-economic infrastructure with focus on such areas as inland, internati onal, river, and air transport, telecommunications, schools and Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 161health centres, to create favourable conditions for deve lopment. The basic demand for urban infrastructure will be met, paying attention to waste water treatment and environmental sanitation to improve and protect the environm ent, in the service of social and economic development, national defence and security. New infrastructure will be allocated for some areas and actions to mitigate hunger (rice scarcity) and poverty, with emphasis on maintaining the existing infrastructure to facilitate socio-economic development. 2. Sub-Sector Strategies a) Inland Transportation In the next five years, a numb er of prioritized infrastructure development projects will open up opportunities for the development of the different regions and the whole economy. The projects include inland roads and bridges ove r the Mekong River connecting the Lao PDR to other countries in the Mekong regi on, and highways between Vientiane Capital to other cities and provinces. Integrated inland infrastructure will be further developed, with particular emphasis on major roads and roads connectin g economic centres, including those being developed in remote areas, and roads for na tional defence and secu rity. More paved or concrete roads will be provided. Bridges along the main roads will be constructed. The development of inland and waterway checkpo ints, with connecting bridges to foreign countries and international markets, will be developed. The national roads connecting the Lao PDR to neighbouring countries will be upgraded to standard roads. Priority will be given to highways and roads stretching to borders such as some sections of the North-South road to Bokeo, Luang Namtha; some sections of the East-West road to Savannakhet; roads to provinces within the Lao-Vietnam-Cam bodia economic triangle (Attapeu, Sekong and Saravane); and the provinces within Lao-Thailand-Cambodia Economic Triangle (Saravane and Champasak). There will be an appropriate allocation of invest ments to assist inaccessible areas, to open up economic exchanges and border trade, to provide a conducive environment for underdeveloped areas to earn better income , reduce disparities, promote economic development in the least developed provinc es, and implement the tasks of economic development as well as protection of national sovereignty. Roads will be constructed to inaccessible villages and villages without roads for big vehicles; especially villages in remote rural areas. Accessibility during bo th the wet and dry seasons will be secured with a focus on constructing concrete roads. The Governme nt will ensure good rural communications systems and maintain and improve the conditions of existing roads. Effo rts will continue the increases of domestic funds through the Road Maintenance Fund for road maintenance. At present, there are only three main roads that have not been paved. These are roads to the central part of Xayaboury province (90 km), Bokeo and Xaysomboun. It is planned to construct and upgrade Thai-Lao-T eiching (Road No.2) from the Ngeun district to Pak Baeng to Epak (Thailand) and from Kua district to Teuychang (China); con tinue to upgrade road no. 8 from Ban Lao to KeoNeua through ODA from Sweden; road No.12 from Thakheak and Hydropower oject and from Ngommalad to PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 162Kiumouya (Km 8) utilizing the funds from th e Nam Ngum Hydropower Project II; upgrade and restore Road No.13 from Nateuy in O udomxay to Pakbeang with ODA from China; Road No.18B from Attapeu to Ban Had, Cont um province, Vietnam; Road No.15 border; Road No. 1B from Ban Muang to Road No. 2 to Phongsaly; Road no. 14 in Xaysomboun (13 km) and from Xayaboury to Paklai; Road No. 1D connecting Attapeu to Northern parts of Cambodia; Road No.4A conn ecting the central part of Xayaboury to Luang Prabang and to the Mekong Rive r; and Road No.1 from Vientia ne Capital to Kao Leo folk road and to the Friendship Bridge. In addition, a study on roads along bo rder lines would also be c onducted in order to use them for both developing the economies and securing nati onal security and defence - such as Road No. 11 through Sanakham to Xayaboury; Road no. 14A from Pakse along the border line to Cambodia; Road No. 14B from Angkham Phond aeng to the southern triangle boundary; and Road No. 5 from Huaymo to Xays omboun and from Xaysomboun to Thavieng. b) Air Transport Some essential airports will be upgraded and constructed; and more investment will be provided for training Lao aviation staff. The airports such as Pakse, Savannakhet and Luang Prabang will be to ensure air tran sportation between the Lao PDR and other Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) countries. The need to construct some new stations and airports in economic centres will be studi ed. Airports will be constructed to accommodate up to 2-2.5 million passengers per annum; with priority given to Wattay International Airport to accommodate big airplanes and serve about 1-1.5 million passengers per annum.

The Government will develop a Land Fund through various forms of capital sources, especially in major cities and concentrated industrial areas. More sour ces of funds will be mobilised, such as from Land Projects and the Lottery. Funds from fiscal budgets to some major projects will be increased and mechanisms will be created that can attract funds to develop urban infrastructure. The Lao society will be turned into an investing society to invest in some areas such as water supply, dr ainage and residential houses. Some targeted funds such as urban development funds and resettlement funds will be established, beginning initially in the big towns and in collective industrial zones. The Government will increase the distribution of sanitized water to the population in urban and suburban areas. It will solv e the issue of waste water and solid waste in the provincial capitals, industrial centres and hospitals. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 164More schools, regional technical colleges and universities have to be built and the existing ones upgraded. In the next five years, all children would have access to a primary school. More health centres and hospitals will be built and upgraded around the country.

The Government will construct a cable line and telecommunications network from the North to the South and the East to the West linking the country with all of Asia. h) Sports Facilities More sports facilities, such as stadiums, sports centers and tracks will be upgraded and constructed. 3. Training In order to provide an enabling environment to construct and maintain the infrastructure, the continuation of training of the staff of the De partments of Communicati ons, Transport, Post and Construction, as well as of contractors and consultants, is required in the following areas: \u0083 Working in a competitive bidding environment; \u0083 Understanding contractual c onditions and obligations; \u0083 Understanding technical specifications required; and financial management; \u0083 The of operational costs; management; and safe working practises; \u0083 Contract management; and \u0083 Environmental impact assessment and mitigation. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 165To create an enabling business environment for the further development of the national road construction capacity, eight prio rities have been identified: \u0083 Further development of the regulatory framework; \u0083 Management system development; \u0083 National Transport Safety Strategy \u0083 Capacity development of central MCTPC level institutions; development of of sustainable fina ncing mechanisms (e.g. Road Maintenance Fund). 4. Investment Allocation The overall draft plan for infrastructure will be reviewed and the investment allocation will be adjusted to suit the realized conditions and pr iorities for investment projects. Resources for social investment will be mobilised and prioriti zed with a view to using these resources to carry out infrastructure development with a st ructural shift towards economic effectiveness. The build operate and transfer (BOT) projects will be publicised and domestic and foreign private investors and other economic actors will be called upon to unde rtake the projects. Emphasis in public investment would be on form ulating large-scale infr astructure projects such as national highways, river ports, airp orts, and modern and large-scale transport systems. Special priority will be given to sectors investing in water supply, drainage, environmental sanitation, expressways, big towns, inland transport, municipal roads, railways, airports, and river ports. The Govern ment will encourage other economic sectors (e.g. private sector) to invest in infrastructure. It will allow more foreign companies to invest in infrastructure including in water supply, the new mega city, and urban communications. The Government will invest in the constr uction of high quality health facilities. 5. Investment Management The Government will research and propose mechan isms to separate and upgrade the roles of the Government at each process of the manage ment of investment in the construction of infrastructure. Decentralization of management at the actual implementation phase would be considered. Independent consulting groups will be increasingly used during the implementation of projects, especially big projects; promoting c onsulting organizations, construction bidders, and independent monitori ng agencies. The Government will draw up a road map to eliminate collusion in construction investment. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1666.

Complete and submit applicati ons to UNESCO to recognize Chum field and Khon Pha Pheng waterfall as world heritage sites. I. Regional Development 1. Targets for Regional Socio Economic Development The efforts for each area should aim to develop the general target for the area and economic sector, create the strength of each area as clos e as possible to the economic structure catering to the needs of the domestic and foreign markets. Then, support the level of economic expansion and develop the society in each of the areas to be strong, while simultaneously upgrading the quality of life of the people. Develop the five-year plan for each region, with the average economic growth target of 6- 6.5% for the Northern provinces, 8.5-9% for the Central provinces, and 6.5-7% for the Southern provinces. The average income of people would in crease at 5% per year. By 2010, the per capita income in the Northern re gion would be USD 610, USD 1,000 in the Central region, and USD 930-950 in the Southern region of the Lao PDR. The economic structure of the regions should be di rected towards sharp increase in the shares of industry and services sectors in the regional GDPs. 2. General Develop ment Guidelines The overall development guideline is to push th e implementation of th e strategic plan in focused areas, and build up some focal points wh ere the big cities would have the ability to cooperate with advanced countries in the region. Build up the development capacity of each area and all economic players (sectors), wh ich would become the driving force for development. This process adheres to the fuller exploitation of existing potentials such as natural resources and the labour force to incr ease productivity and value-adde d in production, and service capacity. Also, appropriate investments to support the socio-economic development of the least developed areas should be pr epared. First, target to develop the infrastructure such as Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 173rural communications, irrigation, electricity, schools and primar y health care to provide the facilities for economic development a nd upgrade the living standards. Build up the potentials of each region in coordination and collaboration in the five-year period (2006-2010). Special attention would be gi ven to decentralization of authority between central and provincial authorities and within the local authorities themselves, especially with regard to national and regional construction projects, in order to allocate resources - funds and labour - in the implementation of th e projects, avoiding the overlapping of responsibilities. a) Agriculture and Rural Development Establish large agriculture processing areas, w ith appropriate exploitation and sustainable development of the forestry resources to be raw materials for processing industries, particularly for export. Take advantage of the comparative advantages of natural resources and labour force of each area, and focus on high yield rice production, special ri ce species, short-te rm industrial trees and organic vegetables, aquatic cultivation, and ra ising of big animals to meet the demands of domestic and foreign markets. Improve fish eries performance in the rivers and conduct fish farming approaches. Village groups will be established as the base for community development, employment generation, and creation of new ru ral livelihoods, with the cent ral aim of developing small- scale industries, handicrafts and arts; and s upporting the use of i ndigenous knowledge. The target is to shift 15-20 per cent of the agricultural labour to small-scale industry and the production of handicrafts. Carry out implementation of forest management and accomplish the forest and land allocation with provision of permanent livelihoods and cultivation of rice paddy. Encourage people to cultivate cash crops in order to increase their living standards. b) Industry Develop industrial centers in three areas to bring about bi g-bang results on the basis of nuclear cities with modern infrastructure and se rvices. Investment in the industry should be focused on value-added, large-scale industrial sectors such as electr icity, food processing, wood processing, fertilizers, clothing and mining (such as gold, iron and bauxite), construction materials, machinery, electric wa res and consumption goods of high quality. It should be achieved through the development of the industry groups in the area, to be the driving force of the region's economic developm ent. At the same time, the support of the nearby areas with advantages for supplying the raw materials as well as markets for certain products need to be considered. c) Services Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 174Develop and expand domestic and foreign market s to increase the market base and sales. Develop and transform the multi-style of services. Create service centers in the regions or countrywide. Establish the financ ial service units, construction agencies, the health services, and national and regional re search for science in an effective manner. Develop telecommunication and postal networks. Increas e efforts to promote tourism aiming at exploiting the unique potentials of each region. Develop the border economic zones such as; Xieng Kouk (Laos- Myanmar), Boten (Laos- China), Nam Kan (Laos- Vietnam) and other check points (Laos Thailand). The focus will be to improve and develop the infrastructure complex for each area, first of all for the cities in the region such as airport, main routes connecting Vientiane and other focal cities, international border and sa tellite cities, tourism sites, populous cities, etc. Connect the electricity transmission lines to districts, with priority given to the border areas and the special economic zones (areas). Develop th e water supply in the urban areas. The main concern should be the provision of electricity infrastructure fo r education and health in the rural areas. d) Urban Development: Allocate and develop the four leading cities to be socio-economic development centers of the regions namely: Namtha (Luang Namtha) in the Northern region, the capital of Vientiane, Khaanthabouly (Savannakhet) in the Central region, and Pakse (Champasak) in the Southern region, which will take the leading roles for econ omic expansion and be in the front line for industrialization and modernizati on. Encourage the development of industry and services to respond to and take part in th e regional and global economic integration. The main leading cities, besides taking their role s as the centers for political , economic, cultural-science and technological affairs, should also take the intermediating role to ensure coordination within and between the areas. e) Poverty Reduction Increase investment and implement transparent policies. The Government 's priority projects should put forward development in the difficult areas, especially the 47 poorest districts to get out of the poor status as planned. At the sa me time, grant aid needs to be attracted for infrastructure development in these areas. Attention would be paid to economic deve lopment of the border economy, focusing on development of border checkpoints, particular ly along major border crossings and economic corridors. Special attention would be directed to animal rearing, planting industrial trees and forestry for raw materials in the mountainous and flat terrains. Poverty re duction projects will be implemented in association with the proj ects for reducing slash and burn practices and turning to permanent paddy cultivation, and healthcar e projects. The priority is to be given to the development of the skills of local labour. Significant investment in upgrading and improving education and healthcare development w ill be considered in the first instance. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1753. Development Strategies for Specific Regions a) The Northern Region Overall development guidelines : the Northern region is the most difficult compared to other regions due to inadequate infrastructure, lowe r level of education of the people, and limited and out-dated information. However, this region ha s certain potentials in agriculture, forestry, hydropower, mining and tourism. Also, it has a unique location in terms of proximity (economic relations with) to four countries (China, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar). Therefore, to promote the potentials of th e region in the five-year period (2006-2010), the development of infrastructure should be emphasi zed. At the same time, participation in the regional/international economies through promotion of tradable goods is necessary, resulting in a change in the economic structure. The development policy should emphasize surplus generation through: hydropower exploitation, mineral pro cessing, forestry, organic agricultural products an d eco-tourism. Thus the specific ma jor targets areas are hydropower, mining and tourism. So, the Government has to continue investments in the socio-economic infrastructures, create facilities for th e people for goods production, and reduce poverty. Increase the share of non-agricultural sectors in the regional GDP fr om 45.3 percent in 2005 to 51 percent in 2010, with the industry and construction sector accounting for 32.1 percent and the services sector 18.9 per cent. The attention will be on the improvement of some big cities in this region in order to transform them into provincial capitals (such as Luang Prabang City of Luang Prabang province). a. Development Guidelines for specific sectors Agriculture : The plans are to use the land and forest resources, change the forest structure, prepare the areas for commercia l trees and fruit trees, livesto ck and industrial processing, develop farming methods for the area to be able to plant trees for food, invest in small-scale irrigation, and select suitable seed s for food production at the sites. The planting of trees that are suitable to the so il and climatic conditions of each area are to be encouraged, to supply raw materials for pro cessing industries. Se cure lands for rice production and ensure the rice production of 550,000 mt per year. Expand the areas for planting corn in Luang Namtha, Luang Pr abang, Xiengkhouang, Bokeo and Phongsaly, with the output to reach 120,000 mt pe r year for animal feed and as raw material to processing plants for export. Develop short-term commercial crops such as soybeans, beans, tobacco and sugar to cater for the local market and to supply to the markets in the Central region such as those in the Vientiane capital, and for expor t to neighbouring countries like China and Thailand. The farm economy will be developed strongly, with the promotion of animal husbandry in favourable areas where there is good grassland to increase the number of cattle and buffaloes to 7,500,000 heads by 2010. This would ensure adequate production of meat and milk to meet Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 176the needs of the provinces in the Central region, and supply the raw materials to produce canned food for export. The previous exporting of logs will be cha nged by supporting the Government's guidelines on wood processing, by encourag ing furniture for export. Develop new forests for supply of raw materials and cover empty spaces and bare h ills with trees. Continue implementation of land and forests allocation in line with th e stabilization of shifting cultivation and resettlement of people in the mountainous and remote areas, so that they have stable production and livelihoods. Draft the projects and programs to develop infrastructure such as communication, electricity and water supply, to reach village development cl usters, especially thos e established to stop slash and burn cultivation and opium growing, to have new stable occupations. Encourage agriculture extension work, re forestation based on improved pr ovision of technical advice, and change the out-dated methods of production to new modern ones. In the five-year period (2006-2010), contin ue to strengthen the implementation of Government programs on goods production and poverty reduction. Ultimately stop slash and burn cultivation by 2007. Develop cultivation and livestock in the focal districts, through the plantation of rubber, maize, tea and sugar, and the rearing of livestock and poultry. Support the production of food, vegetables and processed agricultural products to meet the needs of the markets in the border areas in the Northern Provinces such as Xayaboury, Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Houaphanh, Phongsaly and Xiengkhouang. The Government is to support and provide in vestment for the development of tourism infrastructure, allowing various economic players (elements) to take part in organizing and providing effective eco-tourism. Promote traditional handicrafts with their leg acy and unique characteristics such as traditional weaving, bamboo weaving and other artefacts, which use local raw materials and skills such as w ood carving, sculpture, gold and silversmith. Persuade business units and households in each village to get involved in the production movement, establishing village funds to help and support initial investments in their business activities aiming at diverting from opium and upland cultivation by providing new employment activities. Support domestic and foreign enterprises to es tablish processing of agriculture produce to meet domestic consumption needs and export to neighbouring countries. Stabilize resettlement of the people engage d in opium and slash and burn cultivation by establishing effective stable upland rice and rice paddy cultivation in order to improve their livelihoods. Industry: Priority is to be given to the Luang Namtha Development Centre focusing on all leading and important sectors such as the mi ning industry (coal, anti mony, salt and copper), Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 177and tree exploitation and processing. Local a nd foreign enterprises will be promoted and provided facilities to increase investments in exploitation of gold and iron in Xiengkhouang and Bokeo, coal in Xiengkhouang and Phongsaly, iron sheets and bauxite in Phongsaly, and sapphires in Bokeo. The capacity of the cement plant in Oudomxay will be expanded to 80,000 mt per year, and the with completion of Namkha hydropower project in Luang Namtha and hydropower in Nam Luang Pr the electricity supply in Oudomxay. The Luang Namtha Industrial Zone will be constructed on 200 ha for the extraction and production of gem stones, micro-bi o fertilizers, canned products, textiles and animal feed. In addition, the small-scale industry groups in th e districts and villages would be promoted. In the Northern region, industr ies such as wood processing, c onstruction materials, mineral exploration and processing, and large-scale hydr opower will be developed. At the same time, small-scale hydropower construction will be developed in order to provide electricity to the remote rural areas. Develop small-scale i ndustries and handicraf ts for supplying the consumers in the rural areas and the cities. Services sector: Local commerce will be developed, establishing rural and mountainous market systems and border markets. Commodity exchanges and border area tourism will be facilitated especially in Houay Xai and NaMeo The plan is to invest and develop high qua lity services in Luang Prabang and Xiengkhouang. Machinery service and equipment maintenance a nd other services are to be encouraged. Service centres dedicated to service, commerce and tourism will be set up in border areas (Luang Namtha province). This is also aimed at building strong border economic areas and ensuring national defence and security. The de velopment of a specia lty production area to export to neighbouring countries will be encouraged. The feasibili ty of constructing a free trade area in Botem and Xieng Koc will be looked into. Priority is to be given to telecommunications and financial, commercia l and tourism services. Also, agro-forestry technical services, toge ther with advertisement and information dissemination on tourism, culture and health are to be encouraged. The Government will create economic and service centres in Luang Prabang to attract and increase the number of tourists into the Northern region to around 700-800 thousand tourists, which would generate an income of US 20-25 million per year. All provin ces are encouraged to put forward tourism. Tours will be divers ified to border areas, economic zones and cross- border tourism. This will serve as a basis for Lao tourism to integrate into the Mekong sub-region tours. All provinces are encouraged to put forward eco- tourism, culture and history; support investment in tourism infrastructure; pr omote the economic sectors to invest in eco- tourism; and develop the tradit ional products such as handicraf ts and weaving with local raw materials. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 178b. Infrastructure development Investments will be mobilized to upgrad e national highways and roads linking to international borders, and river transportation lines and ports so as to facilitate commercial activities and tourism exchanges, while mainta ining order and security along the borders. Attention will be given to trad ing activities and co mmunications in a bid to encourage export of products to neighbouring countries. Improve service in border check points to attract tourists and tourism activities aiming at deve loping eco-tourism as well as historical and cultural tourism in the Northern region. Basic infrastructure and other encompassed act ivities such as water supply, electricity and healthcare will be developed and enhanced in the Northern main cities such as Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, Xayaboury, Bokeo with a hope to balance the development between cities and rural areas. In the near future transit service and touris m would take place between the Yunnan Province of China through highway R3, which is currently being constructed. Therefore, development activities along this route have to be paid attention to and encouraged. The plans are to upgrade an airport in Luang Namtha, rehabilitate the Luang Prabang airport to reach a sub-regional leve l to expand flights to all GMS countries, Hong Kong and Singapore; deploy and complete co nstruction projects on a number of routes such as R3 ; R2 . The Government will look for capital to carry ou t construction projects for R.4; R13; R.4A, and R.4B. Electricity network linking to diffe rent areas will be constructed to facilitate tourism routes and mining explorations. Cooperate with China to study and construct a hydropower project with a capacity of 640 MW in Nam Ou in Phongsaly province. Social development: Priority will be given to human resources development, with attention paid to the welfare of those that have dedicated themselves for the country. Complete the building of Souphanouvong University in Luang Pr abang and some other vocational colleges. An adequate proportion of investment capital wi ll be allocated for upgrading existing primary and secondary schools and constructing new ones. Upgrade and provide medical equipment to provincial and village hospitals. People will be vaccinated, against dangerous epidemics and infectious diseases. Stop slash and burn pr actices and eradicate opium growing in line with the provision of re-employment opportunitie s. Accomplish the pover ty reduction target by 2010. Upgrade the capacity of provincial broa dcasting and open posta l network into all district towns. Construct and upgrade infrastructure and develop the economy at a high rate. Take lead in re gional integration. b) The Central Region Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 179 Overall Development Guidelines: The central region of the Lao PDR has plenty of natural resources, skilled labour, and a relatively co mplete set of infrastr ucture. Communications with the domestic and international routes is qu icker than for other prov inces. Therefore, this region could be developed faster than others. Also, there are many flat terrains suitable for developing crop cultivation and livestock rearing. The region is endowed with more irrigation networks that reach focal de velopment sites. A significant jump in economic growth and expansion of the country could be driven by this region. In the next five-year period (2006-2010), the Central region will play a comprehensive and central role in the developmen t of the country. Modernize the structure of the economy, generating large commodity production volume. Pu t efforts to achieve economic growth at a rate of 8.5-9% per year based on the developmen t of effective industria l sectors, especially labour-intensive processing industries aiming at increasing the proportion of labour in non- agriculture by 40-50%. Put efforts to increase th e share of the Central region in the country's GDP to reach 49-54% by 2010. Attention will be given to the improvement of some big cities of this region in order to transform them into provincial capitals, such as Khanthaboury district renamed to Kaysone district of Savanknakhet. a. Development Guidelines for Sectors Agriculture : The plans are to enhance the potential of the fertile plains to produce high quality agricultural produce for export, such as beans, sesame, tobacco, sugar, pepper, Phala rubber, coffee and cashews, which are suitable to the soil and cl imatic conditions, especially in Bolikhamxay, Savannakhet, Khammouan and Vientiane Provinces. The areas for special and good quality rice an d vegetables production will be expanded; as well as cattle husbandry, the rearing of buffa loes, poultry and fishery in the Vientiane prefecture, Vientiane Province, Bolikhamxay and Khammouan will be increased. These will become the sources of raw materials for pro cessing industries. The planting area of Phala rubber, sugar, Mai Ketsanan trees and fru it tree production in the hills in Bolikhamxay, Savannakhet and Vientiane Prefecture will be expanded. The farm economy will be developed strongly, with the promotion of animal husbandry in favourable areas where there is good grassland to increase the number of cattle and buffaloes to 7,500,000 heads by 2010. This would ensure the adequate production of meat and milk to meet the needs of the Central Provinces, and to supply raw materials to produce canned food for export. The sector will be developed to pr ovide raw materials for industrial processing; and preserve rice field areas to be stable and balanced and ensure the volume of rice production to achieve 550,000 mt per year. The la nd will be used to plant short-term crops such as yellow beans, beans, tobacco, sugar and vegetables for local markets, in such areas as Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 180Vientiane capital, Vientiane province, the spec ial zone of Xaysomboun and tourism sites, and for export to China, Thailand and so on. Wood exploitation will be considered with a natural balance so as to provide ecological safety. The Government will continue to protect and regenera te forest resources such as planting new trees in spacing area s. It will continue to prov ide land and forest allocations concurrently with the promoti on of agriculture and provision of new plantation techniques and animal raising in order to (change) improve the livelihoods of the people. Industry: In the five-year period (2006-2010), the focus will be on development of electricity, exploitation and pr ocessing of minerals to increase export products and enhance the budgetary revenues to be used for the deve lopment of infrastructure and implement the comprehensive poverty reduction strategy. The plans are to continue to enhance the industrial sector with high technology for export, such as the electronics industry, consumer products industry, industrial processing of non- timber forest products, construction materi als industry and the ch emical industry. Key industrial areas will be established gradua lly along the main comm unication routes. The villages will be developed for traditional produc tion with an aim to increase employment and exports. Priority will be given to the development of hydropower plants, expl oitation of gold, copper and iron, production of cement and paper, agri culture processing, tourism and high quality services. The investment will be mobilized for improving the infrastructure of the two big cities in the region, the Vientiane Capital and Khanthaboury district of Savannakhet province. Investment and the modernization of the infrastr ucture of satellite cities in the Central region including Phone Hong (Vientiane Province) a nd Tha Khec (Khammouan), and other district towns will be supported so that they could lin k the cities and rural areas. The conditions necessary to develop cities along the East-West corridor of Savannakhet such as Outhoomphone, Atsaphangthong, Thapalanaxay, Phine and Sephone will be created linking provinces [suc be for Nam Theun 2 and Nam Ngum 2 hydropower projects, and other small and medium-scale hydropower projects, such as Sebanghiang and others. A favourable investment environment will be created to mo tivate investment for exploitation of gold, copper, iron and coal. Construc tion of the Vientiane II ceme nt factory (wit h a production capacity of 200,000 mt per year), and Savannakhet cement factory (100,000 mt per year) will be completed to meet the local needs of construction. The plans are to urgently construc t three focal areas for industry: 1. Vientiane Industry 1 with a total area of 150 ha for non-forestry products and good quality timber production for export, tailoring, handicrafts, machinery and small tools for agricultural production and electric wares; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 1812. Vientiane Industry 2 with a total area of 250 ha for food exports, tailoring, animal feed, vegetables, fertilizers, pharm aceuticals and consumer goods; and 3. Savannakhet Industry with a total area of 200 ha for construction materials, mining, canned food, juices and animal feed. In addition, industrial areas would be constructe d along national roads, with the extension of handicrafts to paper production villages, oil crops, weaving, and natural dyeing to provide employment and create income fo r the people in the rural areas. Services : The plans are to implement the trade policy with many sectors to open services in internal trading network areas to meet regional and interna tional economic integration, by using the ITEC Centre and the Singapore Trading Centre (under construction) in Vientiane as focal points to display Lao goods and products. Complete constructi on of infrastructure in the provincial and district munici palities concurrently with go ods production for new domestic markets and export. The goods distribution in th e provincial joint border areas will be opened widely, with a focus on investment in Savan- Seno special economic zone (Savannakhet) and other areas which link the La o PDR with Vietnam and Thailand. The Government will support exports and the management of importe d goods in the industry area in Denesavanh, and publicize the wood products, or ganic products, and market information to the local and foreign investors. Financial services such as banking will be improved. The goods distribution in the border areas will be opened widely, wi th a focus on investment for Savannakhet special economic zone and the dut y free shop at Seno (Savannakhet), which link the Lao PDR with Vietnam, and other provinces with Vietnam and Thailand. Attention will be paid to the activities for marketing, firstly via the East-West economic corridor. Exports will be encouraged by advertisement, and open access to market information for domestic and fore ign investors and businessmen The plan is to effectively exploit the potential s for tourism in the Ce ntral Region, focusing on the development of the tourism centre in Vientiane; completing the roads linking tourism within and between the provinces, firstly the roads to the South; and supporting the road links to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, China and Myanmar. The Central Region, with Vientiane capital, will be developed to be the transit route for international exchange. Savannakhet will be th e gateway and the country's economic bridge. The Wattay airport is to be upgr aded and modernized, increasing its status and enabling it to meet the demand for air service of the Central region. Continue to develop other sectors such as te lecommunications, financial service, banking and other kinds of service. Infrastructure : Priority is to be given to the Vientiane Municipality, particularly the roads within the Municipality and the roads linking it with other provinces. The rail road from Vientiane to Nong Khai will be constructed. The roads No. 8 and No. 12 (section Thakek Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 182Gnommalat) to the sea port in the central part of Vietnam will be rehabilitated and Road No.11 will be constructed. In addition, ade quate funds will be allocated for road rehabilitation, mainly the provinc ial roads, bridges, and irriga tion head-works to assure 80-90 percent usage of the irrigated areas. The public health and education infrastructure such as Savannakhet agriculture and forestry schools will be constructed and improved, as will be the agricultural research centre (seed varieties) in Vientiane Province to provide saplings to the central part and support the other provinces as well. The telecommunications and post office networks will be developed. The water supply will be upgraded. The housing and activities for the rem oval and disposal of waste materials in the cities and municipalities will be developed, and the quality of the envi ronment in the cities will be improved. Social development and poverty reduction : The plans are to enhance the role of the central facilities for public health, education, science an d technology and activities for social affairs; comprehensive development of the school and uni versity systems, voca tional schools, skill training centres (including for carpenters); and improve and incr ease status of the provincial and district hospitals. Implement the supportive policy and mobilize investment in the poor remote, rural and border areas. By 2010, overall sl ash and burn cultivation will be generally stopped. The resources will be mobilized to improve rural road s, electricity network, small-scale irrigations and water supply for people. Land for plantations and production will be allocated to the people along the provision of cultivation techni ques and saplings. These improvements will contribute to the redu ction of poverty by 2010. c) The Southern Region Overall Development Guideline : The Southern region is lo cated in the two-triangle development areas - Laos - Vietnam - Cambod ia triangle and Laos - Thailand - Cambodia triangle. At the same time, it is located on the East - West economy road (East-West Corridor) connecting Kuangnya-Champasack-O udone-Bangkok. There are various natural resource potentials in the Southe rn provinces, particularly good soils in the plains that are very vast and fertile, wa ter and mining resources. In the five-year period (2006-2010), the Southern re gion will play its role and exert efforts to achieve economic growth at an average rate of 6.5-7 % per y ear contributing 21-23 % of the country's GDP, with a per capita income of USD 930. Attention will be given to the improvement of some big cities of this regi on in order to transform them into provincial capitals such as Pakse city of Champasak province. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 183a. Development guidelines for Sectors Agriculture : In the Southern Region, the focal areas for development over the next five years are the production of food stuffs, large animals ( cattle, buffalo and pigs), and the plantation of Phala rubber, coffee and pepper for export. Th e Government will con tinue to construct infrastructure, including roads for transportation and agricultur al production, and develop the rural economies. The focus will be to push forward intens ive cultivation of high-yielding rice on 190,000- 195,000 ha, with the plains of Champasak accomm odating high quality rice for export. Intend to increase the rice output to 630,000-650,000 mt of which 250,000-300,000 mt are for export. The cultivation of beans, corn, vegetabl es and fruit trees are to be encouraged in suitable areas, as appropriate. For plantations, the focus will be on using sh ort-gestation industria l trees, enlarging the farms. The markets for produce such as Phala rubber, coffee, tea, mangoes, cashew nuts and Mai Ketsana will be increased, initially in the more favourable provinces such as Champasak, Saravane and Sekong. Traditional farming methods w ill be integrated with the new more productive techniques, extending the number of animals, and promoting cultivation along with animal farms, livestock poultry and fisherie s. Increase the numbers of cattle and buffaloes to 550,000- 570,000 head, and the number of pigs, sheep and goats to 380,000-400,000 head by 2010. The exploitation of forests would be done conc urrently with environm ental preservation and rehabilitation of forests; allocating land and forest to communities, and promoting permanent employment for the mountainous people. The Government will deliver agriculture and forestry technical advice, a nd help stop slash and burn cultivation and opium growing by 2007. It will develop new rural communities as groups of villages and community groups; and support organizations and investment in in frastructure for the rural communities. The thrust will be to reduce the number of poor households in general by 2010. The forest cover will be increased and s ecured by paying attentio n to reforestation, maintaining natural eco-balance along with ma nagement and preservation of forests. Industry: The main priorities are the development of the electricity industry, agro-processing and mineral exploitation. The Government will urgently prepare to construct the Xexet 2 (in Saravane) and Sekong 3, Sekong 4 and Sekong 5 hydro power projects; and implement the projects for copper, bauxite, charcoal, a nd gold exploitation and processing (in Sekong, Saravane and Champasak). The focus will be on the development of some i ndustrial and processing sectors such as paper mill, coffee, tea processing for export and rubbe r processing; with priority measures to Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 184provide improved production of good quality w ood in Attapeu; and construction of the processing plant in Sekong to pr ovide high quality wood products. Attention is to be given to i nvestment promotion and incentive s to build a canaries plant to produce high quality canned foods (tea, coffee, canned meat and fruit juice), ensure exports from Champasak; and construct chemical fertili zer plants in Attapeu and Saravane to supply the Southern markets. The Government will ensure that raw mate rials are available for the Saravane and Champasak cement factories to operate at full capacity. Investment f unds will be attracted and mobilized for the exploitation of big projects such as: hydropower projects, bauxite mining and the production of aluminium and othe r mineral products; and to establish a focal site for industry. Also, attention will be given to the developmen t of traditional handic rafts such as weaving, silk, cardamom, rice by products, processed corn for domestic and export markets, and tourism. The necessary resources will be f ound to invest in the infrastructure for the industrial site at Pakse with an area of 250 ha , to support the production of cons truction materials, beverages, canned goods, tailoring, animal feed, machinery components and spare parts for agricultural tools. Help will be provided to set up groups for industry and small-scale handicrafts along the North-South and East-West roads and in the cities in the two economic triangle areas of Vietnam-Laos-Cambodia and Laos-Thailand-Cambodia. Also, assistance will be provided to mobilize production capacity to secure efficient production of agricultural products, including through provision of agricultural se rvices to the rural communities. Services : The Government will invest in the construction of the Southern Trading Centre at Pakse and central markets in the provinces to be the links for goods delivery within the region and supply goods on a larger-scale to the border. Attention is to be given to the development of border markets particularly those borderi ng Vietnam and Cambodia, developing tourism within and between the areas.

The Government should separate the management of the projects and th e project evaluators, particularly in some sectors that use huge amounts of capital such as the communications sector, irrigation and accommodation construction, in order to lead to an independent audit agency. Continue to implement Decrees Nos. 35/PM and 58/PM on management and enhance effectiveness of state investment. Ministries, sectors and local authorities must ac tively establish their plans in compliance with the said Decrees and submit th em to the State Committee for Planning and Investment to summarize and report to the Government. b) Foreign Direct Investment It is necessary to have (high) consensus at th e highest level on the (subjective) necessity for and the significant role of foreign investme nts that contribute to industrialization and modernization, aiming at making the performance of all sectors and every level, from central to local levels, to unanimously attract and eff ectively utilize foreign direct investment (FDI) because the FDI is an important component of the economic base and will grow as the process of integration with regional and international ar enas continues. The attraction of FDI plays an important role for the economi c development of our country and it is one of the main factor s to create a major step for ra pid development in the coming years, because there are plenty of natura l resources but not enough (lacking of) capital, skilled workforces and modern management. Thus , it is not possible to explore all the natural resources and the existing poten tials of our country, while ex tending the size of the economy and accelerating the speed of commodity production with high capacity. In reality, the attraction of FDI is still limited because of the in sufficient local workforce with high technical knowledge and skills. Therefore, it is necessary to use imported labour that is connected with the FDI projects by stipulating that the foreign worker have to contribute to economic development in parallel with human resources development. In the Sixth five-year Plan period (2006-2010), it is necessary to focu s on implementing measures and methods to develop the economic sectors where there are foreign investments. Urgently disseminate and implement the laws on foreign investment that have been amended and adopted by the Fifth National Assembly. At the same time, the Government should (it has to) re-examine the policies, mechanisms a nd processes of foreign investment admission to have a favourable atmosphere, convenience a nd timeliness, and create a more favourable impression than that of ot her countries in the region. Consider the formulation of a master plan for sectoral and regional development to propose to foreign investors, such as hydro electric pow er, mining, processing industries, livestock breeding and other strategi c industries aiming to further increase exports. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 201Nominate groups to encourage and mobilize cap ital with capable countries that have the potential for investment capital. Organize seminars and disseminate priority projects to attract foreign investors. It is necessary to issue regulat ions to manage foreigners wo rking in the Lao PDR. Permits should be issued on a case-by-cas e basis in each period in accor dance with the terms of the projects and in compliance with the needs of practical workforce, with the stipulation that the investor/project should have a plan to substitute the fo reign workers by Lao workers. The Prime Minister, the President of the Comm ittee for Planning and Investment, the Finance Minister, the Governors and th e Mayor should organize conf erences to meet with both domestic and foreign investors to listen to their comments and id eas on the investment environment. Thus, the Government is to suppo rt and facilitate the business operations and production of domestic and foreign investor s to be more convenient and effective. The Government should monitor, examine and ev aluate the systems of business operations of enterprises of all economic players (sectors) a nd must have a policy consistent with the mobilization of capital and a ppropriate methods for rewarding (praising) the good deeds and punishing the violators. c) Loans and Grants from Foreign Countries Under the constraining high debt situation, the loans from foreign countries aimed at investing in commodity production projects will be one factor to be taken into account. The loans should be considered caref ully based on the effectiveness of the investments, especially the loans at commercial interest rates. Otherwise, it will be difficult to recoup (regain) such capital, leading to a long-term deficit that wi ll result in creating a h eavy burden on the state budget. In order to increase the mob ilization and utilization of loan s and grant aid from foreign countries, it is necessary to establish a master plan for each sector and clearly stipulate measures for utilization. Also, it is necessary to mobilize sufficient additional counterpart funds (capital) to the grant aid projects within the Ce ntral region as well as the local regions aiming at ensuring the implementation of the pr ojects in accordance with the agreements, particularly those projects th at could be completed in time and contribute to the production. In order to ensure the effective utilization of grant aid and loan s, ministries, sectors and local authorities should guide the pe rsons responsible for the proj ects. Consider implementing relevant measures to promote timely project implementation su ch as bidding, establish plan for mobilizing counterpart funds, and with all relevant sectors. Fight against delays, poor preparation, low project assignment, decentral ized bidding or bidding in a nutshell manner. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 2023. Fiscal Management: Implement state policies in a transparent manner, strive for increasing income and effectively utilize budget by lowering expenditure. The financial policy has to concentrate on incr easing revenue to about 17 percent of GDP by 2010, to ensure adequate resources for reasonab le expenditure plans in the administrative budget and state investment. At the same tim e, the expenditure components need to be reformed appropriately. Stric tly observe the financial-budget ary regulations; and minimize the budgetary deficit to a safe level of finance. To implement the targets above, it is necessa ry to proceed with the measures below: a) Formulate and Improve th e State Budget Law by: \u0083 Modifying and improving the current Budget Law, along with disseminating and introducing some other laws such as the Tax Law and the Customs Law, which need to be enforced and observed in soci ety. The management of finance and budget should be considered as a responsibility of the whole Party and the people; and \u0083 Improving the organization system and reform ing the financial o fficers, who are the main actors in enhancing eff ective performance and solvin g the sectors' difficulties, including those concerning the budget. Increa se the training and mobilize the party's ideology and policy concerning financial work to officials within the financial sector aiming at making them clearly understand the important significance of finance towards national construction and protecti on. Create facilities to support business production and construct socio-economic infr astructure. Try to educate and mobilize financial officials to have th e characteristics of patriotism and firmly fight against the abuse of power for personal benefit. b) Firmly Implement measures in budget management and administration Budget revenue : Improve mechanisms of collecting revenue and at the same time make efforts to fight against revenue leakages. Firmly abolish arbitrary activities in tax exemption or minimization of revenues or illegal balancing of accounts. Reform the tax collection system and national treasury system to be compliant with the needs of decentralization of financia l administration to ensure the implementation of centralized guidance and have the consensus at the central level. This is the basic condition to ensure the completion of revenue collection in a timely manne r. Apart from this, th e Government has to effectively manage revenues-expenditures of depa rtments and local authorities, which is the main duty and should be immediately implemente d during the initial stage of the Sixth five- year Plan. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 203Improve the management mechanism of stat e-enterprises aiming at promoting high (financial) productivity in operating their busin esses. Continue to im prove and reform the state-enterprises; promote the conversion of state-enterprises to partnership, or sell or lease them. Implement financial management regula tions in an equal ma nner with all economic sectors. Terminate the practice of borrowing from the budget or Government guarantee for state-enterprises to borrow money from foreign countries. For the budget expenditures : Ministries and local author ities have to ensure the management of their expenditures to be in line with the plan adopted by the National Assembly. No entity or department should be allowed to arbitrarily issue agreement on decreasing budget revenue or in creasing budget expenditures. In case there are new expenditures, it is necessary to promote the in creasing of revenue collection to meet such expenses. If it is not possible to do so, it is necessary to real locate (rearrange) the expenditures to ensure balance be tween revenue and expenditure. As for investment, efforts should be made to ensure the counterpart funds for the projects agreed with foreign partner. For new loan projects, the sele ction should be done focusing on the most essential projects before making ag reements with foreign partners. Domestic investment should concentrate on the projects that can yield quick economic results. Besides this, there should be an effective debt clearance met hod for the investment projects that have not been completed on time. The regular expenditure has to be re-audited. Create suitable expenditure regulations in line with the real situation and the availability of the budget as the basic fundamental for the gradual reduction of such a kind of supplementary expenditure. Improve the salary system in order to sustain basic living standards. Prio rity is to be given to human resources development expenditure and other social activities. Detailed procedures on the implementation of economic polic y have to be indicated, su ch as the expenditure on administration. The Ministry of Finance has the following duties during the five-y ear period (2006-2010): (i) Act as the central controller of the una nimous foreign debts, and do not allow local authorities to borrow funds from foreign countries. Clear the budget debt as soon as possible in order to guarant ee financial security and budget flow. For the Foreign Debt : It is necessary to strictly allocate budget for debt clearance in accordance with the agreements. Negot iate with the creditors to reverse the debt, clear the debt, reduce in terest, and especially to prolong the loan repayment period. (ii) Improve the auditing process in order to a void the loss of income and assets, and avoid luxury expenditure. Increase the awar eness of financial re gulations. Strictly Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 204resolve the inappropriate actions that do not comply with the budget revenue and expenditure management such as free cu stoms duty reduction or exception, delays in the handover of revenues (budgets) with reference to time and central to local management system, etc. (iii) Indicate the clear boundary and responsibility of each level in the revenue- expenditure management of the budget. Publicize and utilize the economic policy of the Government and put the into prac tice. Restructure customs and national treasury as soon as possible. The local authorities have to facilitate these organizations in the implementation pro cess in order to guarantee the efficient outcomes. The tax organization structure has to be maintained. However, the tax collection strategy has to be improved by allocating the levels of responsibility between central and local areas based on the taxa tion rate and not ba sed on the size of enterprises. The taxation bodies from centr al to local areas mu st collect 100% of the revenue quota (ration) for th e central level and also th e revenue that has to be divided between the central and local budgets. At the local level, there will be an organization within the finance section that is in charge of collecting 100% of the local revenue. The finance agency has to be further modernized. Initially the customs and treasury divisions have to be effec tive in state budget management. More emphasis has to be placed on the financial human resource development in response to the needs of budget management throughout the country. 4. Monetary Management: Implement the currency policy with flexibility and carefulness to support commercial based production while maintaining infl ation at a manageable level The overall goals for the future monetary polic y are to control infla tion and guarantee the security of the banking system; set up the credit system and financial regulations in order to protect the investment environment; and take part in promoting the development of the economy. Make a firm connection between the monetary policy and the annual fiscal policy in order to stabilize the value of the Kip and direct the macro economy, promote the state enterprises and people's savings habit, and inve st in increasing the production and businesses. Therefore, special care is to be taken in the implementation of the monetary policy along with applying appropriate tactics aiming at providing stability for the Kip, with particular focus on the following points: \u0083 Continuously improve the legislation for the operation of the banking system in accordance with the needs of the situation in the new era. Consider, improve, and adapt the Banking law and the law related to the creation of the credit system. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 205Furthermore, the other necessary laws have to be drafted (written) as the basis for the creation and development of the financial-monetary market. \u0083 Upgrade the monetary policy handling and strongly improve the tools of monetary policy. \u0083 Create and implement the monetary policy by following the market mechanism leading to the international standard management of the banking system. Operate the monetary policy on the basis of modifying th e amount of money in circulation; and at the same time gradually provide essential c onditions to operate th e monetary policy in accordance with the interest modifying method. Indeed, set up the base (basic) interest margins and main interest rate for the banks in order to guide and manage the setting up of the market interest rate. \u0083 Consider and create the maximum level of interest rate for th e Bank of Lao PDR in order to direct and modify the basic inte rest rate of the ec onomy and use the open market operations (policy) in monetary mana gement. This is the basic principle for the Bank of Lao PDR as the main organizer in modifying the monetary situation with free interest rate movement. \u0083 Upgrade the capability of the Bank of Lao PD R in terms of interest payment for the compulsory reserve deposits in order to strengthen the financial status of the commercial banks; and apply the effective ope n market operations (tools) as well as the re-supply of new capital for the co mmercial banks, drawing (based) on the revenue sources of the Bank of Lao PDR through the effective foreign currency management and the use of open market operations (tools). \u0083 Form the responsible body to manage the usab le funds in order to meet (indicate) the market demands. Under the supervision of such a body, the Government should allow the buying and selling of fixed Government bonds, and the bonds between the Bank of Lao PDR and commercial banks, in order to create the foundation for the development of an open market. \u0083 The regulations have to be quickly put in practice in order to br ing tools to supply new capital in the financial sector in the early stage of the Sixth five-year Plan. The tools for supplying new capital should include the re-supply of capital, credit, payment assistance and deposits. The implementation of such techniques will allow us to include the additional tools in the guided interest system of the Bank of Lao PDR and to assist it to be in a better positi on for controlling the movement of interest rates in the market. \u0083 The Bank of Lao PDR has the role of pur chasing and selling of Government bonds aiming at modifying the volume of money in circulation. The Bank of Lao PDR is in urgent need of re-building th e value of the Lao Kip notes, with their value reflecting the overall picture of the new price in the past five years, in order to facilitate the debt clearance. At the same time, the printing and delivery costs of new Kip currency (notes) have to be reduced. Initially the 50.000 kip and the 100.000 Kip bank notes have to be printed. \u0083 Continue to upgrade the ex change management mechanism by following the wide range of variation in acco rdance with the monetary open market level under the process of international link age and the cont rol of the Bank of Lao PDR. This action aims at implementing the exchange mechanism called \"controlled floatation.\" Maintain the stable exchange rate, guaranteei ng that the official exchange rate stays close to the actual exchange rate. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 206\u0083 Keep on maintaining the limit of the economic situation that is heavily based on the Dollar currency. Seriously control the fo reign currency exchange rates aiming at centralizing the maximum amount of forei gn currency into the Bank of Lao PDR. Propagate widely the law in managing the foreign cu rrency exchange rate to enterprises and the general population and clos ely observe the real situation. Try to reduce the foreign currency share in the broad money supply (M2) from 52% in 2005 to 30% in 2010. \u0083 Upgrade the quality of planning and th e balance clearance research, which are important for indicating and setting up the national foreign currency balance and the exchange rate. \u0083 Keep on increasing the official foreign currency in the Government reserve to be equal to at least 3 months of imports. Operation of the Commercial Banking System : Upgrade the business potential of the commercial banking system in order to be able to supply sufficient credit facilities for the basic economy of the country. Supply a variety of various credit facilit ies for the basic economy based on its own responsibility, security approval and business effici ency. Priority is to be given to the main and potential goods production, agriculture and the rural areas. Promote the commercial banks in increasing the loan faci lities to profitable and high performance projects. Try to reach the peak of annual growth in lending of about 20-22% in order to guarantee the capital for the growth of the economy. Provide autonomy for the state-owned commercial banks in business operations by lessening the control of public commercial banking authorities at all levels in the loan decision making process. Reconsider and adapt the loan mechanism or new mortgage mechanism by following the self-reliance and self-responsibility in loan approvals by commercial banks. Promote the commercial banking system by provi ng a wide range of monetary and service activities; and promote the new and up- to-date monetary business activities Create additional alternatives c oncerning the registered capital of the state-owned commercial banks to be able to resolve the viability (floatation) problem whenever the business banks have reached the specified criteria. It is estimated that in two years' time 2006-2007, the supply of additional registered capital for th e state-owned commercial (public business) banks will be about 700 billion kip Firmly continue to upgrade the commercia l banks in accordance with the specified restructuring guidelines, particul arly in upgrading th e three state-owned commercial banks. Continue to restructure the corporate ba nks on the basis of financial evaluation. Continue to resolve the cons traints (obstructions) in th e banking system by upgrading the quality of the credit system and making a transparent financia l system. Clear the over due Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 207debt gradually, except in special circum stances, which are approved openly by the Government. In 2006, there is an urgent need to set up a public agency for the implementation of the economic development policy and provide assistance to the poor people in the remote areas Improve again the criteria for debt classificati on and provisions (reservation) in the security bank in accordance to the international standard s. Increase the effectiveness of regulation concerning the pawning, mortgage and guarantee, and provide the facilities for the creditors to collect and clear the debts. Set up th e debt and asset buying-selling company for enterprises. Increase the on-the-spot audi ting, and apply the bank evaluation techniques based on its risk possibility in the credit business. Further develop the monitoring of business operations and auditing regulations for the banking and crediting business by following the CAMELS asset and debt management system. At the same time, the central bank ha s to consider and finally apply the BASEL I auditing principles in the management of co mmercial banks. Improve the risk forecasting and distance auditing system, particularly in the fast forecasting of interest and exchange rate movements as well as the growth of the cred it system by relying on the use of modern mass media equipment and technology. Expand and upgrade the quality of the population credit system : Publicize and apply the suitable population credit regulations in the management of such programs based on the socio-economic specialty and population distribution pattern in the country. Continuously improve the population credit patt ern in order for them to be self-reliant and independent credit organizations based on the voluntary and se lf-responsible principles in their operations. Provide suitable opportunities for the general p opulation and enterprise s in approaching the banking services and facilities ; and on that basis, widen th e non-cash clearance methods and the quick clearance system through the banks. Improve the capability of the staff so as to strengthen the monitoring and auditing of the business operations of the commercial banks Completely clear the matured loans of the Bank of Lao PDR and the banking system. The treasury has to stop the prac tice of debt clearance on the public loan investment projects by issuing the bank bonds to the commercial banks. In order to clear such loans, the Government should issue the bonds for purchase by the citizens, or provide Government bond auctions through the Bank of Lao DDR (selling them to th e commercial banks and other large enterprises). In doing so, the treasury as well as the commercial banks will be in a better position to manage their ow n resources; and as a result th e Bank of Lao PDR is able to control the monetary policy bett er. The bonds with non-financial security have to be solved in a similar way. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 208Apply the amount of loan clearance for the en terprises in the Bank of Lao PDR by using the bank notes issued in past years, in order to keep a balanced and transparent monetary situation. This action may not affect inflation as such clearance methods do not increase the supply of money in circulation. The remaining un-cleared debts without secur ity of the state-owned commercial banks, the non-existing debtors, or the un-recoverable loans (whether they are not possible to recover) have to be cancelled by using the bank notes issued in past years. The Government should test the successful resolution of the unclear debts among the Government, enterprises and the banks at th e beginning of the Sixth five-year Plan (2006- 2010). News and staff affairs : Keep on improving the monetary ne ws within the banking system so as to collect the up-to-date monetary movement and take suitable actions promptly. Improve the news network in every sector within each ministry, in order to be secure in providing prompt and sufficient information for the mana gement at the macro level. Build up the legislation foundation for providing such news and assign the Bank of Lao PDR as the main body to link with the ministries and other relate d sectors in developing the balance sheet of periodic and annual payments w ith international organizations. The Government acts as the supervisor for th e steady cooperation in combining a better and firm cooperation of the financial budget and th e monetary policies between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Lao PDR, so as to provide the same (similar) direction to the two interrelated policies and take part in providing stability in the macro the economy. 5. Improve Effectiveness of State Organizations: Promote the firm improvement of State Mana gement, strengthen the State Organizational Structure and bring its operation into effect. a) Improvement in public administration: The core function in state management improveme nt in the five-year period (2006-2010) is in gearing at upgrading the cooperation mechanis m between ministries, central organizations and local authorities by re-examining their roles, duties, an d responsibilities, as these were identified to be the main weaknesses in th e past management process that led to the overlapping in performance, low quality of work and outcomes. The following are certain critical tools for better operation: Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 209\u0083 Re-allocate the roles, duties and organizationa l structures at all levels [Government, ministries, (ministry equivalent) organi zations, Government organizations and different levels of local authorities], to re spond to the needs of the new era of social management by observing strictly the roles of the Legislature, the Government and the Judiciary, as indicated in the Constituti on. Upgrade the roles and responsibilities of mass organizations in educating and preserving the citizens' rights. \u0083 At the Government level, more emphasis has to be placed on legislation, policy guidelines and macro planning in the ar ea of public administration and socio- economic development. Provide assistance and supervision on the implementation of orders, notes and suggestions. \u0083 The authorities at the local levels have to operate the Governme nt plan, resolutions and orders. Put these into practice responsib ly by converting them into detailed plans and action plans, and specifying implementation tools. It is also possible at the same time for the local authorities either to as k for permission in providing a coincident specific regulation in compliance with the or der and resolution of related ministries and professional organizations, or to ask them for specific regulation assistance. Specify clearly the tasks in which local aut horities can freely decide; the tasks where they have to ask for recommendations; and th e tasks that have to comply with the central decision making authority. The administ ration level is classified in relation to finance, organization and staff. \u0083 Specify in detail the regulations on ma naging, work routine, roles, duties and responsibilities of each managerial level. Indeed, specify in detail the roles, duties and responsibilities of the h eads in each organization. \u0083 Improve the effectiveness of the management structure to the higher level by relying on the responsibility an d transparency of the organi zation, the Government and the Legislature. Provide a re gular and assured (guarantee) information concerning the management, policy and the development plan for the citizens, making sure that all the citizens have easy and convenient access to the information resources. \u0083 Eliminate the complicated and overlappi ng paperwork processing system, which provides opportunities for corruption and the creation of difficulties for the people at large. \u0083 Apply severe punishment for corruption, l uxury and non-transparen t activities in the public budget management. Pay emphasis to educating, monitoring and punishing the staff and officials who break the rules and re gulations. The focus has to be placed on the law enforcement organization in order to keep the staff transparent while on duty. Encourage the law enforcement, monito ring, evaluation and auditing of the organization within the Government organi zations aiming at increasing the high level of responsibility and effec tiveness in budget expenditure. \u0083 Reform the salary and bonus systems in orde r to encourage the staff and officials in performing promising, quality, efficient and e ffective work; and make every effort to make their salary their main income. Appl y the other incentive programs for the hard working and outstanding staff and officials. \u0083 Ensure the s trict regulation enforcement in the public works administration in order to create the open official duty activities, es pecially in the area of work with direct relation to the citizens, such as in income, property and land taxation. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 210\u0083 Further develop the professional ability of st aff at different levels by attending short- and long-term training courses either in th e country or abroad. Select the most suitable staff that are well qualified, possess the right political and social class attitude, and have a common point view on the new changes of the Party's guideline to be recruited in the key positions of the state and party organizations. \u0083 Strengthen the Party's leadership responsibility at all levels in maintaining guidelines, and monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Party's direction on socio-economic development. \u0083 Strongly specify the roles and duties of the ministri es and the other macro management bodies. Stabilize the organizatio nal structure; and pr ovide security for the staff in managerial tasks for a hi gh work performance. Modernize the organizational structure, and change the managerial working methods and the state administration by applying the up-to-date technology. Critical Tools Against Corruption : It is necessary to urgently enforce the law against corruption, the economic decrees and the decr ee against luxury. At the same time, a monitoring body in the National Asse mbly needs to be set up to monitor the implementation of such enforcement. A report on the implementation of the above mentioned enforcement should be prepared every six months. The Nati onal Assembly is responsible for evaluating the implementation of such an enforcement process by the Government. Upgrade the working capacity of the auditing agency by transferring it to the National Assembly. The head of the national auditing agency is to be appointed directly by the National Assembly. Compile the law concerni ng the auditing. Conduct an auditing trial in certain ministries, local areas and enterprises, by inviting the international auditors to work with the national ones at the final stage of the Sixth five-year Plan. The Responsibilities of the Government : It is necessary to upgrade the status of the state auditing agency to be equivalent to a ministry , and provide the supplementary roles, rights and staff for the agency. Assign the Deputy Prim e Minister to act as the head of the state auditing agency in order to be the main assist ant for the Government in the struggle against corruption and luxury, and in applying the national economical policy. Apply the educating tools and severe punishment for those w ho break the rules. Make a \"four should nots\" slogan campaign: should not do, should not want, should not be able to do and should not dare to corrupt; and communicate them to the sta ff and the officials and then put them into practice. b) Enhance public administration in the ex ecution of the socio-economic plans of the various sectors at different levels In order to reach the goals of the Sixth five -year National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) and gain satisfactory success, all th e ministers, the heads of the Government organizations, the provincial governors and the Vientiane Capital City mayor have to be more Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 211responsible in providing guidelin es for their subordinate sector s to be successful in their allocated duties. They have to provide direct guidance on problem so lving, confronting the obstacles as well as providing recommendations or solutions for the sugg ested situations and difficulties from the grass-roots level. The management regulations have to be simplified. The success and the effectiveness of the production and business activities and the existence of socio-economic security and safety can be used as the means to evaluate the success in every district and province. The Committee for Planning and Investment ha s to play a key role in coordinating the cooperation between the Ministry of Finance and the BOL in directing the operational management and expansion of the goods produc tion, the direct investment in accordance to the harmonious and balanced fiscal and m onetary policies and guarantee the continuous macroeconomic stability. The national statistics system has to be effe ctive, consisting of skilled staff in data collection and supplying the essential data fo r analysis as needed for the allocation of socio-economic development policy. There should also be statistic units in every ministry and locality. The central national socio-economic information has to be maintained by within the National Statistics Centre. The Committee for Planning and Investment is assigned to be the as sisting body for the Government in coordinating with the ministri es, other sectors and local authorities, in monitoring the socio-economic development of the country, and from time to time write a report for the Government meeting. The G overnment meeting decides on the production, import and investment plans and resolves th e existing obstacles. The Government then assigns the concerned minister to put into operat ion and report back to the Government meeting from time to time. C. Other Implementation Actions All the sectors and localities have to be unite d and comply with the Party's guidance in the implementation of the indicated duties and achie ve the objectives in the Sixth five-year National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010). Based on such a policy, the Government has to draft the action plan imme diately, aiming at achieving the objectives by stimulating the ideas and insights of all Pa rty members, army officers and citizens. In order to achieve the objectives and the duties as indicated in the Sixth Five-Year National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006- 2010), commencing from October 2005, the Government has to draft the following thre e documents and seek their approval by the National Assembly: 1. A report on the focus priority goods production in the period 2006-2010 and the vision from now on to the year 2010, consis ting of the list and the amount of focus priority goods together with the assigned production task for the concerned sectors and the locations of production. Besides, it is also necessary to allocate the general and specific operational mechanisms as well as the necessary capital; Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 2122. A report on the overall investment plan compri sing of the list of pr ojects in different sectors and localities, expected locations and time allocation together with the capital resources; and 3. A report on the mechanisms, policies and detailed action plans, with the plan to be communicated periodically duri ng 2006-2010, including the following: a. Mechanisms and policies : Operational law of the plan should be written and approved by the National Assembly. The Government should indicate the policies and mechanisms. At the same time, ministries and concerned sectors should indicate their act ual operational programs; b. Improve the organizational structure and allocate the level of responsibility : Draft (write) the quality improvement project, work effectiveness, and the st rictness of the government organization, different sectors and localities. There should also be a detailed allocation of responsibilities between centr al and local areas, and between different sectors. In addition, clear operationa l time limits should be indicated as well; and c. Staff development : Indicate the staff quality improvement and efficiency programs. Indeed, the clear allocation of responsibilities should be indicated in order to achieve the given objectives. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 213X. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements A. Introduction Monitoring and evaluation are integral elements of the National Socio Economic Development Plans as they are essential to assess progress, learn lessons and improve implementation on the one hand and planning on the other. All levels of the Government from the centre to the lo calities (provinces, districts and vi llages) have been and are involved in the monitoring and evaluation process. Progress in achieving the goals and targets of the Plans including those in the MDGs and th e Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries is gauged through the monitoring and evaluation processes. Monitoring can be seen at two broad levels: (i) the monitoring of inputs and outputs or implementation monitoring, and (ii) the monitoring of outcomes and impacts or impact monitoring. The State has more control over the allocation of inputs (e.g. public expenditures including foreign aid and pers onnel) and the generation of outputs (e.g. number of ha irrigated, amount of improved seeds distribute d, number of improved livestock distributed, number of improved tree sapl ings distributed, and number of schools, health clinics and standpipes/wells for safe water, and kilometres of roads built); whereas the outcomes [e.g. production of food, livestock and other agricultu ral products, forest replanting/restocking, usage of schools (including gross and ne t enrolment, dropout, repetition and /progression/graduation rates), he alth facilities, water supply and roads] and their impacts (e.g. educational attainment in cluding literacy, health status and economic advancement) depend not only (albeit importantly) on the outputs but also on a host of other factors that determine the utilisation of the outputs by the people. The Government has been undertaking the monitoring and evaluation of both the implementation of the Plans and their impacts. An important purpose of monitoring implementati on is to utilise the information to improve future implementation. Therefore, the main implementing entities - central Ministries/Agencies and localities (provinces, di stricts and villages) - compile information on implementation progress (monitor) identifying the flow of funds (by current and capital expenditures and from central and provincial and domestic and extern al partner sources), allocation of personnel, achievements and rema ining challenges. They should utilise the information to overcome the constraints through appropriate assistance from the stakeholders. For example, the issue of a delay in releas e of funds from the Province, the central Government or a partner in development could be addressed to the re spective stakeholder. B. Existing Arrangements The Committee for Planning and Investment (CPI), in cooperation with the central ministries and agencies and the localities, is responsible for the coordination and formulation of the National Socio-Economic Development Plans (NSEDPs) and the Public Investment Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 214Programmes (PIPs). The Government will incr ease cooperation among ministries, sectors, localities and the political authori ties, in socio-economic manageme nt. It is necessary to have balance and stability in each major part of the fundamental economy. The CPI is assigned as the focal point to coordinate the activities am ong the ministries and sectors to prepare the monthly, periodic and annual progress reports on the implementation of the Plan, which will continue to be presented to the m onthly meetings of the Government. The Prime Minister regulates the production fr amework, importation and investment, etc., in order to assign to the ministers accordingly. In each Governmental meeting, ministers and governors of each province appraise and report on the implementation in each ministry, sector and locality; together with the enha ncement of the existing capacity, solving mechanisms, the policy of the socio-economic management as a whole, and the sectoral management in particular. The CPI will be manda ted to be responsible as the chairman to allocate the tasks to each ministry, sector, an d locality and then ge neralize, conclude and report to the Prime Minister. Even though there are capacity lim itations and the areas to be managed are vast, the meetings of the Government officials in accordance with the assignments will assist the Prime Minister to have a better understanding of the situation. This will enable the quality of leadership and upgrade development management. This forum w ill also assist the ministries, sectors and localities to prioritise and appraise the im plementation of the Plan regularly and more rigorously. Based on the circumstances in each period and year, the assignment and allocation of tasks through the annual meeting of the Government can be organized in th e Vientiane Capital. More frequent working level meetings may be organized in each province in order to reduce the amount of travel, with the CPI assigning th e delegation to participate in the meetings. C. Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation The CPI through its Department of Genera l Planning (DGP) has been undertaking the monitoring and evaluation of the progress on the implementation of the plans. The Department relies on periodic reports (monthl y, quarterly, semi-annual and annual) from the line ministries, agencies and loca lities (provinces, districts and villages) to gather information on progress on plan implementation. Drawing upon these, the CPI compiles summary reports for submission to the Government and the National Assembly. The present system of implementation monitori ng is faced with a number of challenges. The provision of information (reports) by the line ministries, agenci es and localities is patchy. The coverage of the reports and the quality of the information vary widely. The bulk of the information, which is often incomplete, is descriptive. Capacity limitations are significant at all levels. The communications systems too need improvement. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 215The Government is taking steps to build upon th e existing system, strengthening the links and capacities (both skills a nd equipment including communications and computer facilities) at the CPI, in the line ministries, ministries, agencies and the localit ies. The UNDP has been assisting and will continue to assist the DGP of CPI on this exercise covering most of the ministries and selected provinces. It is nece ssary to mobilize support from other partners to cover the rest of the provinces and central agencies. The results of the exercise will feed into the Monitoring and Evaluation System for the Sixth Plan (2006-2010). D. Impact Monitoring and Evaluation The National Statistics Ce ntre (NSC) in the CPI undertakes the monitoring and evaluation of the outcomes and impacts of the plans. The NSC has begun to take steps to establish a uniform and consistent national database on ec onomic, social and governance indicators. In consultation with relevant Government agencies, it has facilitated the preparation of a list of about 100 core indicators that could be utilised to monitor the impacts of the NSEDPs, MDGs and the Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries (2001-2010). Many of these indicators are incorporated in the LaoI nfo 4.1,17 which has been launched in December 2005. The system allows for the decentralization of the inputting of information to the ministry, agency and province levels; and provides database access to all users. The NSC compiles information on the indica tors drawing upon the administrative data provided by ministries, agencies and localities as well as that colle cted through periodic surveys (such as the Demogra phic and Health Survey, the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey or LECS, and other surveys) and the decennial Census. The NSC has been receiving technical assistance from SIDA, UNDP and other developmen t partners to improve its operations and establish a uniform and consistent national database on development indicators. A list of the localized MDG indicat ors and targets to asse ss progress is provided in Annex 2. Simultaneously, work on the compilation of th e National Accounts usin g the 1993 Standard National Accounts (1993 SNA) System is c ontinuing, with the benchmark national accounts 17 The LaoInfo v.4.1 is a user-friendly common indicator database system providing access to national data across sectors. It is a key statistical tool for monitoring the progress on the indicators and targets of the MDGs, the NGPES, and the NSEDPs. The common indicator databa se system is integrated within the Microsoft\u00ae Office Professional for presentations of development data in tables, graphs and maps. It includes data from national census, surveys, and the Government reporting systems by Ministries and Agencies. The tool provides easy access to key development indicat ors organized by sectors, goals, themes, sources, institutions and international covenants/conventions. The LaoInfo v.4.1 has been adapted from DevInfo (see http://www.devinfo.org for more information) technology to the specific requirements of the Lao PDR by the NSC, with the assistance of UNDP, UNICEF and UN FPA. The database system provides easier access to quantitative data across sectors to inform and promote dialogue and discussion among stakeholders on the development of the country. The data can be used for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation at national and sub-national levels. The current version 4.1 of the LaoInfo provides data on national MDG indicators for Lao PDR as of September 2005. Further enlarged databases providing more information on other monitoring frameworks will be released, as soon as they become available. Please visit http://www.nsc.gov.la for updates and downloads. An upgrade to LaoInfo v.5.1 is expected to be released in 2006 in both Lao and English languages. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 216for FY2002/03 completed. Extension of the system to more recent years and ultimately as the regular system to provide timely informa tion on the national ac counts would require substantial further technical assistance/support. E. Strengthening the Statistical System Building upon the existing institutions and m echanisms, the Government will create a strong statistical system to collect and provide the necessary information for the formulation of policies, strategies and plans, monitor and assess progress, and outco mes and impacts. At each step, appropriate equipment, accessories a nd training will be provided to analyze the information and feed the results into the ma nagement of socio-economic development by the Government under the guidance of the Party. The Government will increase the number of stat istical researchers to a sufficient level to facilitate the collection, compilation and analysis of the information to meet the current and emerging needs. It is planned to establish a st atistics centre in each ministry, sector and region as well as organizing the information syst em in relation to the national socio-economic information in accordance with the NSC. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 217XI. Plan Formulation Process The NGPES has been prepared in a highly participatory manner with the involvement of the localities (provinces, districts a nd villages), central ministries and agencies, the partners in development and other stakeholders. Building upon the momentum, the formulation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) commen ced in February 2004, beginning with consultations with the locali ties on progress on implementation of the Fifth Plan (2001-2005), lessons learned and priorities for the Sixt h Plan. A consultation workshop with line Ministries, Lao researchers a nd mass organizations was held in September 2004 to discuss the framework for the Sixth Plan. Simultaneous ly, work on priority programmes for poverty reduction in focal development ar eas in ten pilot districts am ong the 47 poorest districts has been undertaken jointly with the communities through a participatory planning process. In addition, the Government explored and facilita ted the formulation of other poverty reduction initiatives including through the new village development funds, the Kum Ban approach and the Poverty Reduction Fund. At the same time, th e central Ministries in the four priority sectors undertook to cost the priority progra mmes in the NGPES (and the NSEDP) for the five-year period 2006-2010. Mi ssions from the CPI to the line ministries and agencies and the provinces were undertaken in Ja nuary 2005 to assist in the form ulation of the Sixth Plan. In March 2005, a consultative workshop on the resear ch topics was organized that fed into the Plan formulation. The emerging priorities and suggestions formed the basis for preparation of the preliminary draft of the Sixth Plan. In mid-June 2005, the Government shared (fo r the first time) the main ideas in the preliminary draft with the part ners in development, domestic and foreign private investors and Lao researchers and mass organizations in a one-day workshop for each group. The feedback from the workshops has been valuable. During August 2005, the Government undertook a second round of consultations with th e localities on the main elements of the Plan and the Annual Plan for 2005/06. The four pr iority sector Ministri es continued the work on the refinement of the costs for the priority programmes taking into account the focal area development programmes identified for the ten pilot districts. The results have been shared with the Central Committee of the Party in September 2005 and their guidance has been duly incorporated. The draft Plan has been subm itted to the National Assembly in October 2005, who commended the approach and provided a number of valuable suggestions. In January 2006, the draft Sixth Plan (work in progress) incorporating the guidance from the Party and National Assembly and the feedback fr om the localities, has been shared with the partners in development, domestic and foreig n private investors a nd Lao researchers and mass organizations; and discussed at the A nnual Round Table Process Information Meeting on 29 January 2006. Their feedback has been incorporated as appropriate. The revised draft has been considered and endor sed by the Party at the Eighth Congress in March 2006. The Party emphasized, among others, the need for improved implementation and a clarification on the roles of the State (Government) and the Private sector in the market economy. The final draft incorporating the directions of the Pa rty has been considered and approved by the Sixth National Assembly at its inaugura l session in June - July2006. A listing of some of the steps in the consultation process is provided in Annex 3. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 218It is recognised that the planning work will c ontinue to be refined improving the quality and capacities for participatory planning in the mi nistries, agencies and localities, linking planning to budgets and developmen ts in the markets. There is need for substa ntial technical support for improving the required skills in the mini stries, agencies and especially localities. The Government will promote increasingly the d ecentralization of the planning functions to local authorities, as their capac ities improve. It will establish a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for planning works and strengthen the cooperation and c oordination of all the relevant authorities in planning. The enterprise programmes will include steps th at support people's participation and other organizations in accordance with the needs of infrastructure construction programmes at the grassroots, for basic democracy expansion, and to meet the people's needs. The Sixth Plan will be disseminated nationwide to build th e foundations for sector programmes, for each level of authority and the produc tion of business plans for enterp rises. An information system will be created successfully to improve the cap acity in forecasting, the conversion of tasks into programmes, implementation schedules, etc. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 219XII. The Situation in 2010 By 2010, the successful implementation of the Sixth five-year Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) will bring a bout changes in the quality a nd quantity of our basic socio- economic situation, which will create the stro ng foundation for Laos to move towards the industrial and modern state ther eafter. The following are some of the special situations of Laos after the implementation of th e Sixth five-year Plan (2006-2010): A. The Economy Basically, the economy will be free from the un stable and slow paced development situation that prevailed during the past decades. It will be on the one hand moving towards the fast growing pace and stable situatio n; and on the other hand, it is ab le to maintain its growth of about 7.5-8% annually or may be higher if it co ntinues to grow sharply in the long-run up to 2020. Even though in some years, the socio-economic development faced certain obstacles, the economic growth may be more than 7% an nually. The same situation has happened in many countries at the beginning of their de velopment such as Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand. The production structure and the quality of product s will have changed on the basis of market production principles, and industrial and modern oriented production. There are key products in agriculture, industry and services, which are considered as the basic foundation for the expansion of the economy and the collection of national revenue. Th e production is closely linked to the needs of the society with certain efficiency. Changes will have been made in the production structure and ther e are many outstanding outcomes in the local economic situation, especially in those areas which have potential capability. The economic structure has been changed according to the local streng th, which provides the basic foundation for the potential localities in accelerating their soci o-economic conditions. However, in the areas where there are a lot of obstacles, more and more links to the basic economy have been made and finally it is possible for them to devel op by themselves intensively after 2010. The basic foundation of the economy has been continua lly expanded due to the participation and cooperation of all economic and ownership se ctors. Even though ther e are an increasing number of foreign investments, the state wi ll have maintained the key economy of the country and continues to play a key role in the basic foundation of the national economy. Basically, the macro economy is in a stable condition, with the macro economic balance able to respond to the needs of econo mic expansion. However, certain balances may not be stable. There is security in the rela tionship between saving and the c onsumption, which is able to back up the investment, as well as provide bett er living conditions for the people. The per capita consumption increases at about 5-6% an nually. It is then a good basic foundation for selling domestic goods within the internal market. The moneta ry and currency situation and the national budget have been basically impr oved. The monetary policy has also been improved in order to fit the market mechanism. It is in a stable condition and able to keep the Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 220budget deficit at a certain level. The investment rate in comp arison with the GDP is at the normal level and continues to grow to a higher level. The investment structure has been changed according to the quality improvement and product competitive direction, which create a strong basic foundation for socio-ec onomic development. The construction of infrastructure and the mega-production projec ts have been completed and commissioned (used). As a result, they are able to increa se the capability of production businesses and the socio-economic growth as well as laying the basic foundation for the economic expansion in the post-2010 period. The international economic link has been expand ed and changed in a better way, leading to the improvement of Lao PDR's role in the international setting. The international cooperation has been widely developed, with La os taking part in both the multi-political and the multi-socio economic cooperation regionally and internationally. The country is now moving to the implementation of the interna tional contracts and multi-party and bilateral treaties. Such cooperation provides good effects on the fast growing economic development. After 2010, there will be increased gross nationa l exports, investments, and international grants and loans. B. The Society The education system has been changed, and created a good development pace for the period after 2010. The quality of human resources development has been improved to a higher level. It can reduce the gaps (differences) in the current situation of the quality of human resources and the demand for human resources in the process of moving towards industrialization and modernizatio n. It is therefore able to provide security in human resources in order to achieve a better pace in socio-economi c improvement during the period after 2010. The people's knowledge and under standing concerning education has been changed, with education becoming a matter of public interest, which provides the foundation for the continuous development of education. It starts from the objective, action plan, project, methodology and operational mechanism and the type of school. The education management after 2010 aims at upgrading the education in the Lao PDR along with the changes towards industrialization and modernization by 2020. There will be basic changes in the social scie nces and humanities, and natural sciences and technology. The social sciences and humanitie s will focus on issues applying in political guidelines, policy, and socio economic developm ent plan and promoting the ethnic groups' cultures. The natural sciences will lead to th e research survey, evaluate the hidden potentials in the natural resources, to create and preserve the bio-diversity and to prevent the natural disasters. Initially, the focus w ill be on research development in certain areas. The science and technology will focus on research in certain ar eas in order to use them (put into practice) in socio-economic development. Gradually provide more and more budget allocation for research on science and technology. The effec tiveness of science and technology will be a strong foundation and they will continue to be promoted. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 221Public health, culture and society will be strongly expanded, creating more social activities in the society aiming at creating more jobs. Upgrade the quality of the citizens and human resources; reduce poverty in all as pects; develop the culture, pub lic health, soci al assistance, propaganda and sports; and prevent social misbehaviour. All of the mentioned areas have been changed and upgraded, which provide stea dy facilities for soci o-economic development in the post-2010 period. There is a close c onnection between socio- economic development and the resolution of social constraints clearly in all activities. The financial capability is suitable for the cultural-social ac tivities and able to respond wide ly to the needs of different groups of people. There is political and social stability. The national defence a nd public security have been improved, which provide steady facilities for so cio-economic development. Compared to the first stage of the Sixth five-year Plan, ther e is evident progress in the improvement and effectiveness of the public administration, and the quality of work has also been improved. We can basically resolve the di fficulties and backward activities as well as corruption. The political security and social order have been secured. The anti-terrorism action has been put in the national law. C. The Roles of Lao PDR in the international setting The level of economic development : There are currently no evident criteria for evaluation of the economic development of any country. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission has used certain criteria in the socio-economic development evaluation, with three criteria used for the least developed count ries: (i) national income per head of less than 900 USD; (ii) the level of human resource development (lack of nutrition, reproductive health, education level); and (iii) the economic risks (the level of agricultural development, the irregular export of goods and services, the roles of non-traditional economic sectors, the level of centralized export, ot her disadvantaged players). According to the three criteria, it seems that th e Lao PDR will be in a fast growing process in the next five years in relation to other count ies in the world. Based on the UN development index, the development of Lao PDR will be at a better grade. In any case, the Lao PDR is not yet out of the list of the least developed counties due to the fact that national income per head is less than 900USD. In comparison with the other countries in the region, the income per head of the Lao people in 2010 is equal to th e income per head in Vietnam in 2008, Indonesia in 2003, China and Philippines between the ye ars 1997-1998, Malaysia and Thailand in the 1980s, and South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. The economic structure : In 2010, the labour for ce structure and the GDP structure of Laos is equal to that in Vietnam at the beginning of the 1990s, China at the beginning of the 1980s and the other developed countri es in Asia in the 1970s. Lao PDR: National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) 222The remaining economic problems : After 2010, in general the development of the Lao PDR is still at the development le vel of Vietnam in the year 19 90s and below the development level of other countries in the region by 2-3 decades. The main problems are that the economic foundation is not high, lo w competitive capacity, low leve l of the financial system, high level of internal and exte rnal debts, dependence on fore ign capital, and the role of internal private bus iness is not high. The level of social development: In general, the social development target figures in 2010 are still low as compared to those internationally and regionally in such areas as the life expectancy at birth, other targets in public health, education and the quality of work force, the proportion of poor households, and the proportion of people that have access to the radio and TV services. D. Conclusion After the accomplishment of the implementati on of the Sixth five-year Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-2010), according to the UN human development index, the Lao PDR will be ranked at a higher level by the en d of 2010. In spite of progress on different aspects, the development level is still low, and there exist various backward situations.
