Believed to help skin issues, heart disease, and more, it also poses risks By Lana Barhum Updated on May 26, 2021 Medically reviewed by Emily Dashiell, ND Print Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak Table of Contents View All Table of Contents What Is Bloodroot Used For? Possible Side Effects Selection, Preparation, and Storage Common Questions Bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) is a flowering plant native to the eastern part of the United States and Canada. The root and budding rootstalk (called the rhizome) secrete a red fluid when cut, giving the plant its name. During the fall months, the root and rhizome are routinely harvested by herbalists for use in medicines. Bloodroot has long been used by Native Americans to induce vomiting in a practice intended to cleanse the body of harmful toxins. Healthcare providers of alternative medicine contend that it can treat a wide array of medical conditions. In western herbal medicine, the plant is used most often used as an expectorant and antimicrobial in respiratory infection, and as a debriding agent in oral health. Verywell / Brianna BloodwortCanada What Is Bloodroot Used For? Bloodroot is often used in alternative medicine as a topical or oral antibacterial agent. When used internally, bloodroot is believed to relax smooth muscles, particularly in the heart and lungs. Doing so may improve cardiovascular and respiratory health. But, at present, there is little clinical evidence that bloodroot can treat any medical condition when taken internally. While it may offer benefits when used topically (on the skin), much of the current research is inconclusive. Dental Health There is some evidence suggesting that bloodroot can reduce dental plaque and prevent or treat gingivitis and other gum diseases. A 2012 study described in Phytotherapy Research found that toothpaste and mouthwashes infused with S. canadensis exert antibacterial properties that are beneficial to oral health. When used for this purpose, S. canadensis is generally regarded as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With that said, bloodroot extracts are less commonly used today after studies revealed they may cause precancerous lesions (oral leukoplakia) if overused. Skin Problems Bloodroot is often used in topical skincare products due to its high antioxidant content. It is considered a treatment for skin conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis and to debride (reduce) skin growths such as warts, moles, and benign tumors. Despite these purported benefits, a 2009 study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology concluded that the excessive use of topical bloodroot can lead to injury and death (cutaneous necrosis) of the tissue. The risk appears greatest in those who apply undiluted bloodroot salves (known as black salve) directly to the skin. However, even diluted compounds are known to cause skin irritation. It is unclear at what concentration topical bloodroot may be safe and effective. Respiratory Health Bloodroot is used to treat flu, common colds, sinus infections, and lung infections. It is believed to act as an expectorant, eliminating phlegm and mucus in the airways. Research also suggests that S. canadensis may have inotropic effects, meaning that it strengthens the contraction of the heart muscle. Doing so may improve oxygen delivery to the tissues. Despite its popular use as a respiratory health supplement, there is no evidence that bloodroot can prevent or treat any viral or bacterial infection when taken internally. Natural Remedies for Colds and Flu Heart Health Proponents of alternative medicine believe that bloodroot has positive effects in people with cardiovascular disease. A chemical unique to bloodroot, called sanguinarine, is said to reduce blood pressure while preventing the buildup of plaque that can lead to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Clinical studies investigating these claims typically fall short. High doses have been linked to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmia and, in rare cases, coma. The overuse of bloodroot can also lead to hypotension (a drop in blood pressure). Cancer A chemical compound in bloodroot, called berberine, has shown promise in triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death) in prostate, breast, and skin cancer cells in test tube studies. Apoptosis is a normal biological process in which older cells die so that they can be replaced with new ones. With cancer cells, the lack of apoptosis allows tumors to grow unchecked. As significant as this finding may seem, there are many compounds known to induce apoptosis in a test tube, but few can do so in animals or humans without causing toxicity or injury. Claims that bloodroot has anti-cancer effects are largely exaggerated. In fact, the FDA lists S. canadensis as one of 187 cancer \"cures\" consumers should actively avoid. 10 Lifestyle Changes to Prevent Cancer Possible Side Effects Bloodroot is generally safe when taken as a short-term dietary supplement, although some people may experience stomach upset. The topical use of bloodroot may cause skin irritation, including redness, itching, and swelling. Bloodroot is not intended for long-term use. The compound sanguinarine is a potent toxin known to cause serious harm if used in excess. Symptoms of sanguinarine poisoning include: Dizziness Blurry vision Vomiting Nausea Bradycardia (abnormally slow heartbeat) Fainting Dilated pupils Diarrhea Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek medical attention right away. Warnings and Contraindications Due to the lack of safety research, bloodroot should not be used during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children. Moreover, it should never be used by people who have low blood pressure or heart rhythm disorders. Interactions Bloodroot may interact with anti-hypertensive drugs used to treat high blood pressure, amplifying their effects and leading to a potentially serious hypotensive event. It can interact with anti-arrhythmic drugs, leading to bradycardia and other heartbeat irregularities. Bloodroot may also slow blood-clotting and intensify the effects of anticoagulants (blood thinners) like warfarin, causing easy bruising and bleeding. To avoid interactions, let your healthcare provider know if you are using bloodroot or any other herb or supplement in any form, as well as any prescription or non-prescription drugs. Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak Selection, Preparation, and Storage Bloodroot is commonly sold as a supplement in powder, extract, or capsule form. You may find it at various health food stores and online. There are also suppliers of dried \"wild-crafted\" roots, which can be used to make teas and decoctions. Because herbal products are not strictly regulated in the United States, it can be hard to know which are safe and/or ethically produced. This is especially true of wild-crafted bloodroot, which is sometimes exposed to pesticides, heavy metals, and other toxins. To reduce the risk of contamination, only buy products that have been certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Such products contain the USDA seal on their labels. Another sign of quality is certification by an independent testing authority like the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), NSF International, or ConsumerLab. Certification does not mean that the product is safe or effective; it simply indicates that it contains the listed ingredients in the correct amounts without any contaminants or impurities. There are no guidelines for the appropriate use of bloodroot in any form. As a rule of thumb, never exceed the dose listed on the product label. Black salve, sometimes marketed a black draw salve, should be avoided given the potential for disfiguring skin damage. This includes veterinary formulations intended for use on horses. Most bloodroot supplements can be stored safely at room temperature in a cool, dry room. Never use a supplement past its expiration date or if there is evidence of moisture damage, mold, or mildew. Common Questions How can I make bloodroot tea? Bloodroot is best used under the guidance of an herbalist. Making bloodroot tea with dried whole root or rhizome can be tricky, since you can't always control the concentration of the tea. This should not be a casual drinking tea.
