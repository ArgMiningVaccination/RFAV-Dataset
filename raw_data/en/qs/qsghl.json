Abstract In today's era use of immunomodulators has tremendously increased to treat various human and animal diseases like viral diseases,cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammantary conditions etc. Immunity is the body's natural ability to identify and resist various infectious disease and disorders. Immunomodulators are biological or synthetic substances that can stimulate suppress or modulate any aspect of immunity including adaptive as well as innate immunity. Various factors such as balanced diet,environmental temperature,stress, pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria,proper exercise affect the immunity. Natural drugs are used since ancient times for treatment of various diseases because of minimal side effects. Natural compounds are also used enormously as immunomodulators. There are about 1000 natural compounds having immunomodulatory effect they either affect the immune cells or affect the antibody secretion and influence the immune response. Here in this review we have discussed in detail definition of immunity,concept of immunomodulators,classification of immunomodulators,correlation between immunomodulators and Ayurveda and Ayurvedic plants having immunomodulatory activity. The main purpose of this review is to highlight efficacy of available literature on Ayurvedic plants as immunomodulators. Keywords: Ayurvedic on 05 January, 2022 Introduction Since a long time, the traditional medicinal plants have been in the treatment regimen for healthcare of people, to cure variety of diseases. [1] Herbal medicines(drugs) have immunomodulatory property because they stimulate both specific and nonspecific immunity. [2] Usually India is known for its traditional healthcare system Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani.Ayurveda is probably one of the best known and it is believed to have originated over 6 thousand years ago. Ayu-Life,Veda-Knowledge of life.[3] Ayurvedic herbal medications are widely used for modulation of immune response.[4] Immunnomodulation of immune response come up with a substitute for a variety of disease conditions and with immunodeficiency and also the herbal immunostimulants getting more importance and visibility.[2,5] Modulation of immune system refers to any change in immune response such as suppression, expression, agumentation of immune system.[6] The review has focused on plants having Immunomodulatory Activity.[7] Immunity is the body's natural ability to identify and resist various infectious disease and disorders.[8] Immunity comprises of both specific and non- specific components.[9] As the infant grows his immune system continues to develop.[10] Immunomodulators are biological or synthetic substances that can stimulate, suppress or modulate any aspect of immunity including adaptive as well as innate immunity.[11-13] Immunity Immunity refers to the state of protection against infectious disease.[14] In Ayurveda immunity has been explained byAcharya Chakrapani in terms of Vyadhikhamatva. Basic pathway of immunity .[10] Immune System The immune system is designed to defend host from invading pathogens and to eliminate disease, it also maintains homeostasis within the body of healthy organism.[15,16] The structure of immune system is multilayered, with defenses on several level. First barrier against infection is skin Second one is physiological, where conditions like the temperature and pH of body provide unsuitable conditions for foreign organisms.[8] The immune system has been categorized into innate (non- specific) and adaptive immunity (specific).[17] The innate immune system- Innate immunity consist of a series of host defenses including barrier function, cytokines, phagocytes, natural killer cells(NK)cells and gamma delta (gd) T cells to provide the initial (nonspecific) response to a pathogen or injury.[13] The adaptive immune system- Adaptive immunity is called as acquired immunity. The adaptive immune system differs from the innate response as it is specific, has an element of memory and is unique to vertebrates.[18]Research Article https://www.alliedacademies.org/journal-of-rna-and-genomics J RNA Genom 2022 Volume S05 Issue 007 11 1 1 1 1 1 1Concept of Immunomodulators Immunomodulators arebiological or synthetic entities which can influence any component or function of the immune system in a specific or nonspecific method.[19,20] Immunomodulators shows their activity in the following manner. Administration of immunomodulators activates macrophage and granulocytes increasing phagocytosis.[21] In other words immunomodulators can be called as an active agent of immunotherapy.[22] Classification of Immunomodulators a) Immunoadjuvants: Immunoadjuvants are used to enhance efficacy of vaccines therefore considered as specific and true immunomodulators of immune system.[11,23] b) Immunostimulants: Immunostimulants are also known as immunomodulators.[15] The substance (drug and nutrient) which stimulate immune system by inducing activation or increasing activity of any organ.[21] They can act through innate as well as adaptive immune response.[25] Immunostimulants can act as immunotherapeutic agent, in those who have an immune impairement.[26] In normal healthy individuals, they are expected to serve as prophylactic and promoter agents i.e. as immunopotentiators.[25,27] c)Immunosupressants: Immunosupressants are structurally and functionally heterogeneous group of drugs which are often administered in combination regimens to suppress the immune response and to treat various type of organ transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases.[28,44] Correlation between Immunomodulators and Ayurveda Now a day's Ayurvedic immunomodulators are widely used in the management of health and disease[24]. Ayurveda is a most ancient and currently most important tradition practiced widely in India and other countries[8]. The basic concept of immunomodulation is existed in Ayurveda as well as is being practiced by the Ayurvedist for centuries. In Ayurvedic practice immunity can be enhanced by using Rasayana, Lehan and Ojovardhaka remedies. Immunomodulatorsare becoming a central part of 21st medicine [29]. The detailed description of over 700 herbs is given in the Atharvaveda (around 1200BC), Charak Samhita and Sushrut Samhita [8].

V C Kulkarni/ V S Kakade/ M D Khemnar RNA n, NB-2 peptido glycan Future Prospects From ancient times plant derived medicines and folklore medicines have been used for the drug design and development of therapeutic agents.[1,30] Herbal and traditional botanical products are good alternatives to conventional chemotherapy. [31] Presently researchers are fascinated towards plant derived therapeutics and the research is based on investigation for some plant biochemical in the form of the single compound as lead molecule concerned with particular target linked with disease.[1,30] Numerous plant derived compounds have been identified over the years which possess immunomodulatory characteristics but the systematic, proper and multidisciplinary approach is required for picking out active constituents from different medicinal plants and their different medicinal effects using modern techniques.[16,32] Two approaches can be followed for developing successful drugs from medicinal plants. First one is the phytochemical approach, which depends on identifying the active principle and developing pure phytochemicals as drugs. Yet this type of drug discovery is costly and also time consuming. The second approach is a phytotherapeutic approach wherein standardized crude drug preparations can be used as drugs with modern standards of safety and efficacy. As far as the Indian medicinal plants are concerned, the second approach could be followed.[33] Conclusions Herbal plants or extracts having immunomodulatory activity and when co-administered with vaccines may be helpful in obtaining higher protective antibodies against different infections caused by viruses, bacteria etc. Natural immunomodulators are used widely because of high efficacy, low toxicity, low cost.
