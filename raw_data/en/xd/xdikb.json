That makes things simple! Not everyone likes to take a handful of pills, but taking a multivitamin supplement makes a lot of sense. It's basic and beneficial, specifically in terms of getting B vitamins which are reported to assist with cognitive decline and memory in older adults. [Nutrition is important](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Sitka/the-treatment-plan/nutrition). Arctic Chiropractic, Sitka encourages our Sitka chiropractic patients to show us their daily multivitamin to be sure it has all the right minerals and vitamins! MULTIVITAMIN BENEFIT Multivitamin supplementation may be quite minimal and easy as well as quite effective. A recent systematic review of research literature on the effects of high-dose, B-complex multivitamin supplementation resulted in support for the advantage of such supplementation in healthy and at-risk participants in terms of mental (like sensed stress, concentration, general mental health, reduced anxiety), physical, and energy outcomes. [(1)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Sitka/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) Daily multivitamin use compared with placebo boosted the memory in older adults. At one-year follow-up, older multivitamin users showed significantly improved immediate recall. The researchers estimated that this multivitamin use enhanced memory performance by the equivalent of 3.1 years of aged-related memory change. That's a valuable change! Further, the researchers recorded that participants still used the multivitamins routinely: 94.4% at 6 months and 91.8% at 1 year. Not bad! It's important to take the multivitamin on a daily basis to get the most benefit. Blood samples that were obtained from a subset of participants found rises in folate, vitamin B12 and serum 25(OH) vitamin D. One of the study's co-authors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said that \"multivitamin supplementation holds promise as a safe, accessible, and affordable approach to protecting cognitive health in older adults.\" Outcomes for participants with a history of cardiovascular disease were higher than those who didn't. [(2)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Sitka/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) Another study showed similar results that taking a multivitamin for 3 years enhanced episodic memory, global cognition, and executive function in older adults. Those with cardiovascular disease seemed to benefit more than those who didn't have that. [(3)](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-Sitka/chiropractic-resources/references-for-chiropractic-articles#vit61423) This is promising for those with cardiovascular disease to make a daily routine of taking a multivitamin with B vitamins! Arctic Chiropractic, Sitka and you will have a talk at your next Sitka chiropractic appointment about your cognition, your age, your multivitamin supplement routine, your multivitamin quality, and the gains of multivitamin supplementation for you! WHY B VITAMINS? The body utilizes B vitamins to make new cells, especially red blood cells. B9 is folate, the natural form of B9 (in contrast to the synthetic version referred to as folic acid) the body can use in circulation. Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is a water-soluble type of natural B9 folate. Look for these. A good multivitamin with the B vitamins may be your friend! We can talk about yours.
