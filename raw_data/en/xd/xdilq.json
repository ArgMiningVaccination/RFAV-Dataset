Non-Toxic ABSOLUTE CLEAR Treatment Spray $32.99 Description O.C.'s Hair Police confidently uses Non-Toxic ABSOLUTE CLEAR proprietary enzymes to kill lice and remove nits. Non-Toxic ABSOLUTE CLEAR is comprised of a multi-enzyme based, non-toxic, non-abrasive, hypoallergenic mix. These naturally sourced materials are combined with surfactants and other biologically stimulating ingredients to offer a healthier alternative to eliminating head lice! The enzymes in Non-Toxic ABSOLUTE CLEAR destroy the exoskeleton of the louse resulting in their eradication. In addition, the enzymes are successful in loosening the glue that attaches the nits to the hair shaft thereby, allowing for their movement away from the scalp. The nit must be within 1/2 inch of the head so that they may receive the necessary heat from the scalp in order to incubate. The nit becomes non-viable once it is not able to incubate. Additionally, nit removal is made much easier when the glue has been compromised. This lice removal product is especially important for those children attending a school, camp, daycare, and/or children organization that maintains a \"No Nit Policy.\" Our lice removal spray is critical for eliminating lice and their nits. If you are interested in lice removal products, we recommend purchasing this lice removal spray as well as our shampoo. Contact us for "}
