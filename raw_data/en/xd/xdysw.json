According to a review in a 2016 issue of Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, [carvacrol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206475/) effectively keeps food-borne pathogens like E.coli at bay. However, the benefits don't stop there. \"Oregano oil's antibacterial properties can be effective against types of bacteria that can inhabit the digestive, upper respiratory and [urinary tracts](https://www.thehealthy.com/uti/urinary-tract-infection-symptoms/), to help fight infection,\" Frick says.

Therefore, speak to your doctor about essential oil therapies before using them. Oregano oil reduces pain If you're experiencing [muscle pain or stiffness](https://www.thehealthy.com/pain/back-pain/back-pain-arthritis/), oregano oil may be your new best friend.
