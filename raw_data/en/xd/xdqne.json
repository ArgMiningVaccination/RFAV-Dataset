Students will examine health, wellness, and illness from a holistic perspective. This approach involves comparing, connecting, and integrating conventional, alternative, and complementary approaches to promote health and wellness to prioritize prevention, well-being, and healing. The program begins by introducing students to the cultural belief systems of patients and practitioners while exploring diverse allopathic, complementary, and alternative healing practices and protocols for achieving optimal health and wellness. Students will explore the five major types of complementary and alternative medicine including alternative medical, mind-body, biology-based treatments, manipulative and body-based methods, and energy therapies. This program provides a map to assessing and creating protocols for a whole-person approach in the promotion of wellness or the management of chronic illness. Structure Students will take a total of 12 credits (4 courses). Each course is 8 weeks long. All students will take IHI500, IHI501, and IHI502. Students will then choose between IHI503 or IHI504 as their fourth and final course. Program Outcomes - Evaluate the fundamental principles and trends in the field of integrative health. - Develop a solid knowledge base of the five major types of complementary and alternative medicine: alternative medical, mind-body, biology-based treatments, manipulative and body-based methods, and energy therapies . - Examine the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit of the human system. - Explain the complex role of nutrition in human biochemistry, physiology, illness, and health. - Assess the impact of ecological, agricultural, dietary, and cultural practices as it relates to health and nutrition. - Explore body-based techniques such as chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, massage, reflexology, Rolfing, Alexander technique, craniosacral therapy, and other bodywork including health outcomes and research evidence. - Discuss the principles and practices of energy therapies and whole-body systems. Course Descriptions and Course Learning Outcomes IHI500 Foundations of Integrative Health and Healing - 3 credits This course introduces students to the diversity of health and healing philosophies and traditions and explores their historical context, foundational principles, and practices. Students gain an understanding of the ancient healing arts, conventional/allopathic medicine model, evidence-based medicine, naturopathic and functional medicine, and holistic healing modalities through presentations that engage in reflective learning and dialogue. This course allows for the exploration and integration of diverse perspectives on the body, health, and wellness and explores a holistic, systems-based philosophical framework in the context of health and healing. Learning Outcomes - Explore the historical context, fundamental principles, philosophies, and traditions of integrative health and healing - Compare and contrast the differences and similarities between the ancient healing arts, conventional/allopathic medicine model, evidence-based medicine, naturopathic and functional medicine, and holistic healing modalities. - Describe the broad categories of complementary and integrative healthcare including energy healing, movement and body manipulation therapies, holistic healing systems, mind body connections, and biologically based therapies - Evaluate emerging trends, issues, and complexities around current holistic healthcare models. IHI501 Mind-Body Medicine - 3 credits Mind-body medicine recognizes that the human mind and body are interconnected. In this course, students explore the biological basis of the mind-body connection through the lens of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), which provides evidence of the effects of complementary and alternative medicine modalities. Students will develop a functional understanding of integrative healing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, biofeedback, breathing, guided imagery, hypnosis, journaling, art, music, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), and emotional freedom technique (EFT). Learning Outcomes - Define the biological basis of the mind-body connection: the autonomic nervous system (ANS), psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), and the relationship of ANS and PNI to other body systems. - Describe physiological and psychological responses to stress, stress management techniques, and complementary and alternative medicine modalities. - Interpret how emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual factors can directly affect health and wellness. - Examine integrative healing techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, biofeedback, breathing, guided imagery, journaling, art, music, hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), and emotional freedom technique (EFT). - Create a personal mind-body plan, selecting complementary, alternative, and integrative strategies to incorporate for self-care. IHI502 Integrative Nutrition - 3 credits Nutrition is integral to an integrative health model and is extended into the Hippocratic principle of food as medicine. Holistic health also evolves within a broader context of ecological and cultural practices that do not separate individual health from the health of the whole system. In this course, students explore this \"whole systems\" model, examining the impact of ecological, agricultural, dietary, and cultural practices as it relates to health and nutrition. A whole system's approach to diet and nutrition includes understanding environmental impacts on water purity, air quality, food acquisition, and quality and the interconnected network of food, environment, and health. In this course, students will immerse themselves in a whole-food approach to nutrition and learn about the diverse lenses with which to view diets and nutrition and individual dietary needs. Students will also be exposed to evidence-based therapeutic diets and their origins and impact on health and disease. Learning Outcomes - Explain the complex role of nutrition in human biochemistry, physiology, illness, and health. - Examine the impact of ecological, agricultural, dietary, and cultural practices as it relates to health and nutrition - Discuss the environmental impacts on water purity, air quality, food acquisition and quality, and the interconnected network of food, environment, and health. - Explain a whole food approach to nutrition and learn about the diverse lenses with which to view diets and nutrition and individual dietary needs. - Evaluate evidence-based therapeutic diets and their origins and impact on health and disease. - Create a self-care dietary plan incorporating food choices and strategies. IHI503 Manipulative and Body-Based Healing - 3 credits Body-based healing is based on the idea that the nervous system and body are interconnected in such a way that illness or injury in one area can affect all parts of the body. In this course, manipulative and body-based techniques such as chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, massage, reflexology, Rolfing, Alexander technique, craniosacral therapy, and other bodywork are examined considering their physical, psychological, and emotional effects on health and healing. Students will also discover the connection between body and mind with movement therapies such as Tai Chi and Yoga. Learning Outcomes - Explore body-based techniques such as chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation, massage, reflexology, Rolfing, Alexander technique, craniosacral therapy, and other bodywork including health outcomes and research evidence. - Consider the physical and psychological effects of body-based techniques on health and healing. - Determine the disorders and states of wellness for which selected manipulative and body-based practices may offer meaningful benefits. - Discover the connection between body and mind with movement therapies such as Tai Chi and Yoga. - Review the requirements in education and licensing for each of these techniques. IHI504 Energy-Based Therapeutic Healing - 3 credits Energy-based therapeutic procedures are increasingly included within mainstream integrative healthcare (IHC) services. This course examines the principles and practices of energy therapies including acupuncture, magnets, Reiki, and Therapeutic touch. Students will discover the philosophy and practice of whole-body systems such as Ayurveda, homeopathy, naturopathy, aromatherapy, and Chinese/oriental medicine.
