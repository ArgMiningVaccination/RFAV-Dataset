(Head Office: Osaka, Japan; President and CEO: Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D.; hereafter \"Shionogi\") today announced that our universal antigen vaccine research effort has been adopted into the vaccine / new modality research and development pr oject , as part of a public solicit ation by the Advanced Research and Development Strategy Center (SCARDA) SCARDA is an organization established within the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) in March 2022. Based on the \"Vaccine Develo pment / Production System Strengthening Strategy\" decided by the Cabinet in June 2021, it was organized for the purpose of strengthening the R&D / production system during normal times so it wil be ready in times of pandemic emergency . SCARDA will work with the government to s trategically fund research towards the practical development of vaccines. Our application was for \"Universal Sa rvecovirus Vaccine Research\" as part of \"Development of Vaccin es for Severe Infectious Diseases\" . This research and development effort is focused on creating a universal Corona virus antigen design technology that is less susceptible to viral mutations, and was accepted as a research subject by SCARDA on June 29, 2022. The corona virus universal antigen vaccine is expected to help to prepare for future potential COVID- 19 (SARS -CoV-2) mutations and new pandemics. Since September 2021, we have been working on universal antigen design research in collaboration with KOTAI Biotechnologies, Inc .. From now on, we will proceed this research in collaboration with KOTAI [Collaborat or of Research and Development Coordinator: Kazuo Yamashita , Ph.D., CEO ] and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases [Collaborator of Research and Development Coordinator : Yoshi masa Takahashi , Ph.D., Director of Research Center for Drug and and Vaccine Development ] to create a universal c orona virus vaccine that selectively induces neutralizing antibodies against regions where viral mutations are unlikely to occur. Not only would such a vaccine be expected to be highly effective and safe, but would also be projected to be not easily affected by viral mutations. Shionogi is committed to \"Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\" as our key focus. We are working towards total care for infectious diseases, through building awa reness, epidemiological surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, and addressing exacerbations, as well as treating the infection itself. As a leading infectious disease company, we will focus on research and development of a corona virus universal antigen vaccine with the support of SCARDA, and to rapidly providing vaccines to protect the health of patients around the world.
