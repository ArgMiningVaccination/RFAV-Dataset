Open Access Research | First Published: November 18, 2015 Tooth extraction is often preferred to obtain a satisfying functional and esthetic result in orthodontic treatment and its effects on dentofacial structures has been searched for years. Until the late 50's the term extraction almost meant the removal of all four first premolars. Later, alternative extraction sequences such as upper and lower second premolars or second premolars from one arch and first premolars from the other were accepted.... Open Access BENTO Gabriela, HADDAD Marcela Filie and Mariano Ronaldo Celio Article Type: Case Report | First Published: November 25, 2015 Nowadays, implant-supported prostheses has been evidenced and shown to have excellent results. One of the reasons for dental treatments is to maintain natural healthy functional teeth throughout the lifespan. However, when this is not possible, dental autotransplantation can be an option. This method has some advantages when compared with other ways of oral rehabilitation such as avoiding jaw development changes, representing a conservative treatment. It could be called \"biological prosthesis\".....

Open Access Henri Kazuo Nakamura, Guilherme Piragine Contador, Research Article | First Published: September 16, 2015 Among the factors that should be considered for the rehabilitation of atrophic jaws is mainly the anatomy of edentulous jaw, which offers trouble installing fixtures in view of the proximity to the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity. There are several possibilities to rehabilitate atrophic arcs, autogenous grafts, distraction osteogenesis, angled and short implants have been widely used in clinical practice. Thus, advanced surgical techniques are disclosed in the literature, such as the all-on-fou... Open Access V. Tamara Perchyonok, Research Article | First Published: September 12, 2015 In the last few decades, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising multidisciplinary approach for the repair and regeneration of damaged bone tissue.

Such diseases result from complex interactions between periodontal pathogens and the host immune response. Owing to the high prevalence, scientists have been attracted to research aimed to treat periodontal diseases; however, treatments are always challenging. Conventional treatment of periodontitis focused on reducing the pathogens by standard scali...

Open Access Luis Miguel Gonzalez-Perez, Pedro Infante-Cossio, Marta Sanchez-Sanchez, Carlos Valdivieso-del-Pueblo Type: Case Report | First Published: August 07, 2015 The existence of two mandibular impacted molars with confronted occlusal surfaces is extremely rare. When the two mandibular molars are surrounded by a single dental follicle, an entity called 'kissing molars' (KM) is formed. After the first description of KM by Van Hoof in 1973, very few cases have been reported in the literature. Therefore, knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnostic and therapeutic options for KM is limited. The present study is based on a literatu...
