began in earnest and the federal government provided vaccines to the states States each individually developed their own distribution and allocation plans. This framework for vaccine prioritization was intended to support local and tribal health departments to get their communities vaccinated. Vaccine distribution and access challenges State run distribution centers: Maricopa County -State Farm Stadium | Arizona State's Phoenix Municipal Stadium Pima County -University of Arizona Main Campus and South Campus Challenges with using online system for registration Insufficient and inconsistent vaccine supply Confusing eligibility criteria Rigid storage requirements, and a short period between vaccine preparation and expirationMethods = to identify and compare challenges and opport unit ies des cribed by FCH Q clinics during vaccine roll out Design : Cross -sectional study used structured telephonic interviews and electronic surveys. Subjects : Vaccine coordinators from FQHCs Measures : Data was collected using a 24 item questionnaire / semi -structured interview. The questionnaire/guide was separated into 4 sections; general, challenges, effective strategies, and future recommendations Analysis : The themes seen among rural and urban FQHCs were compared by: Reviewing the written transcripts and identified codes within the responses Comparing themes across investigators for consistency and congruence Categorizing themes and calculated the number of participants that fall in each theme.Results -Five overarching themes (1) the lack of public health communication channels (83%) (2) vaccine hesitancy and misinformation (83%) (3) workflow and staffing difficulties (100%) (4) ineffective state distribution and management (67%), and (5) problems with inventory and the storage of vaccines (83%)Results Challenges Rural Clinic 1: Partnering with county, use of volunteers, help from different departments within the clinic Urban Clinic 1: Using previous workflow strategies, drive -thru flu vaccine, which became drive -thru COVID -19 testing and vaccines Rural Clinic 2: Developing efficient vaccine administration workflows, public announcements via social media platforms, opening to both Chiricahua patients and non -Chiricahua patients, allowing walk -in vaccinations Rural Clinic 3: Vaccine cards and drive -thru vaccine clinics Urban Clinic 2: Scheduling doses in pairs (Moderna and Pfizer); one way flow in the clinic (entered, get vaccinated, be observed,exit in a one way flow manner) Rural Clinic 4: Created a COVID -19 team where they have staff dedicated to performing all COVID -19 duties (vaccinations or swabbing). Having scheduled times to perform the duties as well has helped keep the program organized.Clinic identified effective strategiesMost of the challenges experienced during the COVID -1 9 vaccine rollout between urban and rural Federally Qualified Health Centers in A rizona were different. M any of the rural clinics came across issues with ordering the vaccines, administering the vaccines to the public in rural areas, and finding the staff, whereas the urban clinic reported trouble with storing, minimizing waste, and reporting. T here were several similarities seen between the rural and urban clinics when it came to strategies used for the vaccine rollout, which included using previous vaccine workflows and attending webinars and training sessions held by the state and vaccine manufacturers.
