I venture into my tenth year of practicing chiropractic and every day I am renewed in my passion to spread this vitally important message. The message of true heath! How to be truly healthy now and in the future! I have found that there is a large gap in the education given to people on how to take care of their bodies to last a long time. My mission is to fill that education gap for adults and children. I find great pleasure in educating people of all ages about the benefits of chiropractic. Please ask at the front desk if you're interested in having an educational talk or workshop at your school, event, meeting or work place on a variety of topics. Chiropractic as a lifestyle choice produces long term health with long term benefits for your mind and body. Prevention is one of our favorite words- why wait till you are in pain and broken? Preventing injury and illness is much easier than correcting a painful or dysfunctional condition.
