Wright, Ph.D. Abstract: Despite increasing prevalence of asthma among American Indians and/or Alaska Natives, little is known about their use of traditional healing in its management. A convenience sample of 24 Navajo families with asthmatic members (n=35) was interviewed between June 1997 and September 1998. While 46% of families had previously used traditional healing, only 29% sought traditional healing for asthma. Use of traditional healing was unrelated to use of biomedical therapies, hospitalizations, or emergency services. Practical factors and questions about the nature and origins of asthma were the primary considerations determining use of traditional medicine. Little conflict between traditional healing and biomedical treatment was reported. The use of traditional healing for asthma is influenced by beliefs about the disease and factors specific to the individual, including their local social, economic, and cultural context. As evidence has accumulated that effective self-management reduces frequency of asthma exacerbations and costs of medical care(National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP], 1997) asthmapatients and their families have assumed an increasingly important andindependent role in their own treatment. At the same time, the use ofcomplementary or alternative medicine (CAM) has become widespread andmore accepted, particularly for chronic conditions such as asthma (Andrewset al., 1998; Davis, Gold, Hackman, Stern, & Gershwin, 1998; Eisenberg etal., 1993; Elder, Gilchrist, & Minz, 1997; Hackman, Stern, & Gershwin, 1996).This trend has raised questions about the concurrent use of multiple medicalsystems and the extent to which they constitute competing alternatives tobiomedical therapies. A lack of qualitative accounts, however, has limited2 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 the extent to which patterns of use and any potential conflicts can be understood in their local social, cultural, and economic context. In addition, the use oftraditional healing for asthma in populations characterized by the presenceof both biomedicine and indigenous healing systems has been little studied. This study examines use of traditional or indigenous medicine among a population of American Indian asthmatics. In the United States, asthma-related morbidity and mortality is increasing most rapidly among minoritypopulations (Mannino et al., 1998). Although early studies found a lowprevalence of asthma among American Indians and/or Alaska Natives, recentfigures suggest that asthma is increasing among these populations as well.For example, asthma-related hospitalizations among the Navajo increasedbetween 1979 and 1989, particularly in children aged 1-4 (Hisnanick,Coddington, & Gergen, 1994). Despite its growing importance in thispopulation, little is known about how Navajos select among possible treatmentoptions, and how the use of traditional healing impacts medication use andasthma management. This is of particular interest given the wide range ofalternative healing systems available to the Navajo, including the NativeAmerican Church, Christian faith healing, and Navajo traditional healing, aswell as biomedical care provided by the Indian Health Service (Csordas,1999; Csordas, 2000; Levy, 1983; Lewton & Bydone, 2000; Milne Howard,2000). This study focused on the use of Navajo traditional healing, which has been extensively described in both the anthropological and Kluckhohn, 1938). Briefly, traditionalhealing addresses the afflictions resulting from a loss of harmony broughtabout by \"general etiologies,\" such as spiritual violations or unfortunate eventsor encounters (Porvaznik, 1967). The concept of general etiologies is usedto suggest that an etiological agent does not necessarily lead to thedevelopment of the same disease in each individual or each instance. Diseasesare traditionally identified with reference to their causes rather than theirsymptoms, and are thought to follow a personal, rather than a natural, history(Levy, 1983; Milne & Howard, 2000). Traditional treatment usually beginswith a visit to a diagnostician, such as a hand-trembler, to determine thecause of the illness (Milne & Howard, 2000; Wyman, 1936). With the guidanceof a medicine man or singer, the individual and his or her family workbackwards to identify the contaminating event or behavior causing the illness,and attempt to restore harmony through ceremonies (Milne & Howard, 2000;Wyman, 1936). By removing obstacles to healing, traditional ceremoniesallow the body to recover on its own, returning to its natural state of harmonyand health (Coulehan, 1980). In a cross-sectional study of 300 Navajo adultspresenting to an IHS facility, approximately two-thirds had consulted atraditional healer at least once in their lifetime, and 39% had used a Nativehealer during the last year (Kim & Kwok, 1998). Rates of use of traditionalhealing for Navajo children are unknown.TRADITIONAL HEALING 3 Although previous studies have examined barriers to seeking traditional healing among the Navajo (Kim & Kwok, 1998), little research hasexamined qualitatively the factors Navajo and their families consider whendeciding whether or not to consult a traditional healer. Kim and Kwok (1998)report that while the type of complaint significantly impacted the decision touse a Native traditional healer, neither satisfaction with biomedical care, norpatient ratings of their own compliance, correlated with use of Native healers(Kim & Kwok, 1998). This study explores in detail the factors influential inthe decision to use traditional healing when biomedical alternatives exist,including the decision not to use traditional medicine. In addition, this studyhighlights the importance of patient expectations of their various health careproviders, and how such expectations are calculated and revised in light ofcourse of the disease, or effective management of symptoms. Methods In order to learn about the use of traditional healing by Navajo asthmatics, in-depth, open-ended interviews were conducted between June1997 and August 1998 with a convenience sample of 24 Navajo familieshaving asthmatic members. Subjects either responded to a letter after beingidentified by health care providers, or responded to a clinic flier or newspaperor radio advertisement requesting interviews with Navajo asthmatics. Each family was interviewed once for approximately one hour. Interviews took place in the family home or at an office at Din\u00e9 College inShiprock, NM. Since several families contained more than one asthmaticmember, information was obtained on a total of 35 individuals with asthma.Interviews were conducted with the parents when the asthmatic was young,although the child often participated as well. Participating families werepaid $20. Fourteen interviews (58%) were conducted with individuals whowere themselves asthmatic, while the remainder were conducted with non-asthmatic parents of asthmatic children. Native Navajo speakers were available to assist with the interview; however, no families requested them, nor was their use ever deemednecessary. All interviews were conducted in English (with the exception ofoccasional terms) by the first author, a doctoral candidate in anthropology atthe University of Arizona, where he has received extensive training inethnographic methods and the Native cultures of the Southwest. Although the interviewer utilized an outline to ensure that all points were covered, the interview was conversational in nature. While the orderof topics differed, the interviewer posed similarly worded questions to eachfamily, who were encouraged to respond in their own words and in as muchdetail as they wished. We asked participants to describe any use of traditionalhealing in the past, both for asthma as well as for other illness, and toconsider the factors that influence their decision to use traditional healers.Other questions explored the expectations of traditional healing held by4 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 patients and families, and the benefits, if any, that had occurred as a result of undergoing traditional healing. Finally, participants were asked to describecurrent biomedical management of asthma, including medication-taking andcare seeking behavior for asthma exacerbations, and to describe personalideas about etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic activity of asthmamedications. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Navajo terms were translated. Transcripts were indexed by topic and analyzedusing the qualitative software package NUD*IST. In addition, discrete datafrom each interview were abstracted to Statistical Package for the SocialSciences (SPSS), to facilitate calculation of percentages. Throughout thecourse of the research project, one of the authors (Morgan), a Native Navajospeaker and teacher of Din\u00e9 philosophy, served as a linguistic and culturalreference and helped to make sense of the interview material. Permission for the project was obtained from the University of Arizona Human Subjects Committee and the Navajo Nation Health Research ReviewBoard, who also approved the publication of the results of the study. Results Traditional Healing for Asthma Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the sample by the level of use of traditional healing. The median age of the 35 asthmaticswas 10 years (mean = 17.5, range 3-74 years). Slightly more than half ofthe sample was female (57%). While most of the asthmatics (54.3%, 45.8%of the families), had used a traditional healer at some time in their life, only28.6% consulted a traditional healer for their asthma. Asthmatics whoconsulted a traditional healer tended to be older than those who did not, butthe difference was not statistically significant. Almost one-half (47.8%) ofchildren aged 16 and under had been taken to a traditional healer at somepoint in the past, but only 26.1% had consulted a traditional healer for asthma.There was no gender difference in the use of a traditional healer. Four ceremonies were prescribed for treatment of asthma: the Shooting (na'at'ooyee) or Lightning Way (h\u00f3chx\u00f3'\u00ed\u00edj\u00ed); the Navajo Wind Way(Din\u00e9 bin\u00edlch'ij\u00ed); the Evil Spirit Way (h\u00f3chx\u00f3'\u00edj\u00ed); and the Mountain Top Way(dzilk'ij\u00ed). These ceremonials treat diseases caused by lightning or wind,and were performed historically for individuals with lung, chest, and throatdifficulties (Wyman & Kluckhohn, 1938). They vary in length from shortinvocations to nine-night ceremonies, and typically progress through stagesof prayer, blessing and singing, as well as the creation of sand paintings. Insome cases, a series of ceremonies spaced several months to one yearapart were deemed necessary.TRADITIONAL HEALING 5 All seven families who participated in ceremonies for asthma reported that the ceremonies relieved asthma symptoms, usually resulting in a declinein the frequency of attacks. As the mother of an asthmatic boy explained, \"Ithink the ceremony has really helped him. Because just this fall he hasn'thad all of those constant attacks.\" Often, the benefits were attributed to adecrease in vulnerability of the asthmatic. One mother described howtraditional treatment had helped protect her son: \"He would usually get realsick if he went into a different environment...it would instantly trigger asickness in his chest. But now, I don't think he is as vulnerable.\" However, inall cases the benefits were only temporary, ranging in duration from onemonth to one year. When symptoms reappeared, families who returned totraditional healers were told that additional ceremonies would be necessaryto ensure that all relevant causes had been addressed. In addition to ceremonies, nine families (37.5%) reported that medicinal herbs could be used to treat asthma symptoms. Many stressedthe fact that the availability of medicinal herbs at the local outdoor marketbelied the need to handle them with the appropriate respect, and emphasizedthe importance of enlisting a traditional healer to lead and supervise herbaltreatment. Two asthmatics (5.7%) had used traditional herbs to treat thedisease. After developing an allergic reaction to the herb, one woman returnedto using her prescription asthma medication.Table 1 Demographic Characteristics of the Study Group by Level of Use of Traditional Healing (N=35) Used traditional Used traditional Never used Overall healing for healing for traditional asthma other healing Age Median years of age 12 11 9 10Number (percent) 6 (26.1%) 5 (21.7%) 12 (52.2%) 23 (65.7%) under 16 years of age Gender Female 4 (20%) 7 (35%) 9 (45%) 20 (57%)Male 6 Total (28.6%) 9 (25.7%) 16 (45.7%) 356 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 The Decision to Use Traditional Healing for Asthma Perceived cause of asthma influenced the use of traditional healers to a limited extent. Forty percent of families who cited traditional diseaseetiologies\u2014including exposure to lightning, pregnancy violations, and theloss of traditional ways of life\u2014as the cause of asthma, consulted a Nativehealer for the disease, compared with 25% of families reporting non-traditionalcauses. The majority of families seeking traditional healing reported expectations that ceremonies would both relieve symptoms and resolve theunderlying problems giving rise to asthma. These families sought traditionalhealing in order to \"get well\" and \"be cured\". By contrast, biomedical therapieswere reported to only suppress symptoms of asthma that would likelyreappear. One respondent stated: \"I don't think it would come back withtraditional [healing].\" When asked, \" And what about with the doctor medication ?\" she replied, \"It may come back, on and off, like what it's doing with my girls now. I think they'll have problems with it in the future.\" However, not all families expected the benefits of traditional healing to be either immediately evident, permanent, or dramatic. Rather thanseeking a cure for asthma in traditional healing, this group expectedincremental or temporary benefits. To be satisfied with traditional healing,one woman told us, a person needs to assume it will \"help you for a certainlength of time.\" It was common to hear such families positively emphasizeimprovement in their asthma rather than its resolution following ceremonies.As one mother said, \"It was real bad and then all of a sudden it just sloweddown, you know. My asthma kind of slowed down.\" For families in thisgroup, being able to reduce the use of asthma medications was an importantmarker of the success of traditional healing. An important factor in the decision to use traditional healing was the potential for ceremonies to be of benefit, even if they did not relieve symptoms,by enhancing other aspects of personal (often social or economic) well-being and addressing imbalance that might cause other illnesses (Milne &Howard, 2000). When asked whether traditional healing might help in adifferent way than biomedicine, one participant replied: \"I think so. Likementally and spiritually. You know, the medicine man tells you that you havethese problems, and when you go to a physician they don't diagnose thosethings. So to me it is important to do prayers, protection ceremonies and allthese things.\" Many Navajo families\u2014whether or not they engaged intraditional healing or cited traditional causes\u2014emphasized the value of afundamental principal of traditional Navajo teaching, \"thinking good thoughts,\"as an important quality and benefit of traditional healing in the treatment ofasthma (Carrese & Rhodes, 1995). The efficacy of biomedical treatments was typically evaluated against more exacting expectations. Asthma medications were expected to provideprompt, dramatic relief from symptoms. One mother compared the slowTRADITIONAL HEALING 7 effects of traditional healing to the immediate relief of bronchodilators. \"It takes awhile. Whereas the albuterol it comes on quick because it's achemical.\" Participants reported learning to expect their asthma medicationsto \"work within about five to ten minutes after taking it.\" One mother describedthe inhaler as, \"instant relief to open up the lungs,\" while another confirmed,\"That's basically about how the inhaler works. Automatically once you useyour inhaler you feel better.\" When expectations of immediate relief werenot met, concern led parents to seek medical attention: But sometimes, even though you give them the medication it doesn't seem to go away quickly. It takes a long period oftime for it to go away. That's when you have to bring themback in and have them get checked again because they arenot improving. The inability of biomedical treatments to cure the disease also provoked disappointment and frustration. One mother criticized her asthma medicationsfor, \"just making it go away temporarily...I wish they would find somethingthat would make it go away.\" Another described becoming discouragedafter learning about new asthma medications that still cannot cure herdaughter's asthma: I hear on TV that this is good for asthma, and I ask the doctor about it. I say, \"Well, is that one good for her? Is itsomething to help cure her asthma?\" That's what I'm tryingto look for. I would like to know, will there be a medicationor something that will completely cure her? Sometimes Iget to the point where I just don't want her to take themedicines. Finally, some asthmatics were disillusioned with their asthma medications after long-term use had not led to a cure. \"I've been taking these[medications] for a long time,\" one told us. \"If they helped to cure it, Iwouldn't be taking them today.\" Perceived severity of disease was also considered when determining whether to use traditional healing. It was common to hear a family who hadnot sought traditional healing state that they \"might try it\" depending on how\"bad\" things became. The majority of respondents reported that they wouldbe more likely to seek traditional healing for asthma if they thought thedisease had become severe, or if the treatments prescribed by IHS doctorswere ineffective in relieving symptoms. The prescription of routine, preventivemedication was taken as a sign that the disease had worsened. \"I think it'sgotten worse,\" one asthmatic told us, \"because I'm taking more medicationand I'm taking it more times a day then I used to.\" Only one-third of thoseasthmatics that reported a decline in the frequency or severity of symptoms8 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 sought traditional healing for the disease. Participants who viewed asthma as severe reported that more than one ceremony would probably be necessaryto achieve a cure. One mother who reported, \"I had to have a lot ofceremonies done for him,\" attributed it to the severity of her son's asthma,which she described as, \"really serious and really scary.\" The majority of families characterized the decision to use traditional medicine as provisional, subject to repeated evaluation based on the courseof the disease and the experience of undergoing traditional treatment, aswell as personal economic circumstances. In general, families identifiedtwo types of factors limiting their use of traditional healing, what we termpractical constraints and ideological considerations (Table 2). No restrictionwas placed on the number or type of factors families could report. Familiesreported a median of two limiting factors per family (range 0-5, mean 1.95).Fourteen families (58.3%) cited at least one practical constraint, whileseventeen families (70.8%) cited at least one ideological consideration. Tenfamilies (41.6%) cited both. Overall, ideological considerations were reportedslightly more frequently than practical constraints (25 times compared to 22times). The relative importance of these factors differed somewhat basedon whether or not the family used a healer at all, either for asthma or otherdiseases.

Longer ceremonies, such as the Shooting or LightningWay, can cost anywhere between $750 and $3000-4000 to perform, includingindirect expenses such as the cost of food and supplies as well substantialinvestments of time. As one family explained, \"If we have the money, youknow, we will take them to a medicine man and get ourselves some help.\"Another mother told us, \"There's the money, and the time...You know, it'skind of hard when you're a single parent and you have a budget.\" The logistic requirements of holding ceremonies also presented a significant hurdle to some participants. An older respondent interested inhaving a ceremony performed had neither the necessary hogan nor a supportive family able to assist the medicine man with his procedures or tocook and take care of guests and healers. In addition, participation of theextended family is an important component of traditional healing. As onewoman described it: I think the way [the medicine man] explained it to us, was, \"It's a family type thing where everybody in your family hasto have something done. It's all inter-related.\" So, even if she has something done for her by herself, it wouldn't help her as much as if all my sisters and brothers and their kidshad something done. If these requirements could not be met, temporary relief of symptoms might be achieved by \"sitting in\" on a ceremony in which another person was theprincipal patient. One family reported doing so. Six families (25%) reported difficulties in locating and selecting a traditional healer. For this group, the lack of personal familiarity with traditionalhealers made the selection of an appropriately trained healer problematic.For example, when asked whether she had used traditional healing, oneparticipant replied, \"Not yet, but I've been tempted to try it. It's just that Idon't know which one to trust.\" Other parents reported that, due to their age, asthmatic children could not be expected to participate in ceremonies or understand themsufficiently for traditional healing to be efficacious. Finally, two familiesreported allergic reactions to the sacred pollens used in traditional ceremonies(Freeman, 1994).10 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 Conflicting Philosophies and Ideological Considerations According to traditional Navajo teaching, there are no incurable illnesses: if the ceremony is performed correctly and all causes are identifiedand addressed, a cure is assured. In addition, hereditary explanations fordisease, which are common in biomedicine, are absent in traditional Navajohealing. Rather, it is believed that every child is born healthy, unless theparents have violated traditional teachings or been exposed to somethingharmful during pregnancy. Families that considered asthma to be a chronic,life-long problem, found it illogical to seek a 'cure' for the disease from atraditional healer. One woman told us: It's hard to explain it to my parents. My parents don't understand English. I tried to explain to them what I haveand then they think it could be cured. What can I say? Itcan't be cured . . . I tried to explain it to them, but they don'tunderstand. They believe in traditional. They want me togo to a medicine man to be cured like that , but I tell them, \"It can't be cured.\" Four families who decided to forgo traditional healing had determined that asthma was not amenable to traditional therapy because it originated in other non-Navajo populations with distinct social settings and ways of life. As one woman said, \"Well, let me put it this way. Asthma, to me, would bea White-man's illness.\" When asked to explain, she responded, \"Becauseyou can treat it this way. You have the inhalers for it. And all the stuff thatwill go with it.\" Another respondent observed that the first group of Navajoto be sent away to boarding schools was the first one to experience suchdiseases. She explained, \"To the Navajo it seems like they came back withthose diseases. And their children are, nowadays, getting diabetes, beingdiagnosed with asthma. And so it's just almost natural for them to be pointingfingers.\" Five families (20.8%) in our sample who had never used a traditional healer reported either that they did not consider themselves to be 'traditional'or were affiliated with another religion. Overall, individuals in our sampletended to identify themselves either as traditional or not, based on how theyhad been raised. For example, one mother told us, \"I was brought up in aChristian home, so I've never tried any of the traditional ways.\" Other familiesavoided or limited the use of traditional healing on the grounds that it was away of life\u2014more closely associated with the preceding generation\u2014fromwhich they had separated. As one woman explained, \"When my grandpawas alive he was a medicine man, and when I would cough he gave mesome kind of root to chew on. It worked. But after he died, you know, it sortof just drifted away.\" Indeed, grandparents often encouraged parents toseek help for their asthmatic child(ren) from a traditional healer. \"When theTRADITIONAL HEALING 11 kids were coughing, grandma would want to do something traditional, saying that, 'It's the effects of the wind'\", one mother recalled. In fact, grandparentssometimes took their asthmatic grandchildren to traditional healers whenthe child was visiting. \"They had this grandfather...I guess he used to doceremonies related to breathing and the wind and things like that. And hedid ceremonies for each one of them.\" But most parents reported that theywere not persuaded to use traditional medicine by such efforts and oftenresisted pressure from their elders. As one mother told us, \"Their grandmadoesn't follow through with that, because I haven't said, 'Let's go ahead,' orwhatever\". Another mother recalled how she would \"explain to Grandma,aunties, or anybody that's there, that, you know, you don't like it because ofthese effects.\" Others expressed concern that the unchanging nature of traditional remedies left them ineffective against a \"new\" disease like asthma. \"Thehigh blood pressure, the sugar, and the asthma,\" one mother told us, \"I don'tthink these can be healed by medicine men.\" One family described theperennial evolution of biomedical medications as evidence of its ability toaddress a \"modern disease\" like asthma. By contrast, the same progressionof therapies was seen by another family as a sign that biomedicine had \"noreal handle on the disease\", and caused concern that their son, whose asthmamedications were frequently changed, was receiving experimental drugs. Finally, awareness of the unquestioning belief and understanding required for the success of ceremonies was a significant consideration in thedecision to use traditional healing. Several families noted that there was nopoint in having a traditional ceremony if the family did not believe in the \"oldways,\" or if they did not speak Navajo, the language in which ceremonies areconducted. One mother told us, \"It probably wouldn't help my daughterbecause she doesn't know anything about Navajo traditions.\" Coexistence of Traditional and Western Medicine There was no relationship between the type of asthma medications used (see Table 3) and the use of traditional healing. Asthma-relatedemergency visits and hospitalizations were common: 66% of asthmatics hadmultiple urgent-care visits and 35.7% had multiple admissions. There wasalso no relationship between frequency of urgent-care visits or hospitalizations,and use of traditional healing. However, two families reported that they hadbeen urged to seek immediate medical attention by a traditional healer whohad been consulted during an acute exacerbation. Concern about potential harmful effects of prescribed asthma medication was commonly expressed but did not systematically influencethe decision to use traditional medicine. While several respondents notedthat their prescribed asthma medications had helped to control the disease,many families remained dissatisfied with biomedical treatment options, oftenciting concern about side effects. 1 Only two families reported no side effects12 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 from anti-asthma medications (median 2, range 0-4). Nevertheless, an evaluation of the potential for dependency on asthma medication, andconsideration of whether continued use of asthma medication would preventthe body from recovering on its own, were important elements of the decisionto use traditional medicine. One mother described weighing her observationthat \"People who've been on Cromolyn for years don't get better\" whendeciding whether to consult a traditional healer for her son. It was often noted that successful traditional healing requires careful consideration of individual belief in and commitment to traditional healing,and a decision about whether or not to continue taking doctor medicationsduring traditional treatment. You have to believe wholeheartedly that the ceremony is gonna take care of you and that it's gonna help you. If youhave doubt...and you think you can completely quit themedication, then what happens when you have an attack?You throw away your inhaler or whatever, and then all of asudden you really need it. Most respondents reported that continuing to take prescribed medications while undergoing traditional treatment would not necessarily signify that thepatient did not believe in the efficacy of traditional healing. \"As the oldpeople say, you have to make things work out, so, if you have to have theWestern society working along with the traditional, then that's the way it'sgot to be.\" Nevertheless, one family stopped taking asthma medicationswhile undergoing traditional treatment in order to indicate their total belief inthe power of the traditional system. Another family discontinued some butnot all medications. Others maintained that since they wished to continue touse all of their \"doctor\" medications they would not participate in traditionaltherapy.Table 3 Current Asthma Medication Use (N=35) Asthma Medication Number of asthmatics (percent) Bronchodilators 34 (97.1) Inhaled Steroids 8 (22.8) Other Anti-inflammatories 2 (5.7) Oral steroids * 1 (2.9) Nebulizers 3 (12.5) * 12 asthmatics (34.2%) reported past use of oral steroids.TRADITIONAL HEALING 13 Discussion Previous research has suggested that Navajo often seek traditional healing for chronic complaints (Kim & Kwok, 1998). This study indicates thatspecific beliefs about each illness may influence the decision to use traditionalhealers, and that a minority of Navajo families seek traditional healing forasthma. In addition, the decision to use traditional healing is periodicallyreevaluated, in light of economic circumstances, expectations and evaluationof efficacy, and the real and projected course of disease. The lack ofunderstanding of Navajo language and teachings by young asthmatics wascited as an important reason for avoiding the use of traditional healing in thetreatment of asthma. One-third of the sample identified the cost of ceremoniesas a significant factor limiting their use. Kim and Kwok (1998) reported thatthe average cost per visit to a Native healer was $388, and the averageannual cost of Native healer use amounted to approximately one-fifth of apatient's reported annual income. The proportion of the sample of Navajo asthmatics using traditional healers is consistent with a prior report from another part of the reservation(Kim & Kwok, 1998) as well as a report from an urban Native Americanhealth center (Marbella, Harris, Dier, Ignace & Ignace, 1998). Our results,however, suggest that use of traditional healing for children\u2014which neitherof these prior studies examined\u2014may be slightly less common. The majority of families who used traditional healing did not report a conflict between the use of traditional healing and the treatment providedby Indian Health Service physicians. Instead, families described the twosystems as complementary, and suggested that traditional healing andbiomedicine addressed different aspects of the illness or person. Similarly,Kim and Kwok (1998) report that conflict between the instructions of medicalproviders and traditional healers occurred infrequently, and that when facedwith conflicting advice, the majority of patients stated that they attempted tofollow both sets of advice. Nevertheless, the benefits expected of biomedical and traditional healing differed significantly. In particular, biomedicine is sought to providesymptomatic relief during acute exacerbations, while traditional medicine isexpected to heal the underlying spiritual imbalance, to restore or fortify mentalwell-being, and even to minimize the perceived negative effects of biomedicalregimens. Among those families who had used traditional healing for asthma,all reported some relief of symptoms. Although those who used traditionalhealing did not differ from non-users in use of biomedical therapies or use ofemergency services or hospitalizations, the rates of use of such serviceswas high. The number of families citing the complexity, length, and effort required for traditional healing may reflect the infiltration of a wider culturalpreference for the more rapid and less demanding treatments promised bypharmaceuticals. Several reports have described how the experience of14 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 increasing demands on personal time and greater impatience with symptoms drives demand for quick, palliative treatment, increasing medication use(Nichter asthmatics our study group often weighed the intense but temporaryrequirements of traditional healing against the prolonged daily commitmentto pharmaceutical regimens (and their real and perceived side-effects). It ispossible that, in the Navajo setting, the availability of biomedical treatmentand the expectation that it can rapidly resolve symptoms\u2014and the extent towhich such therapy is principally an individual approach to health organizedaround the taking of medicines (Nichter & Vuckovic, 1994)\u2014has diminishedpopular interest in traditional healing. However, increasing participation byNavajo in alternative forms of healing that emphasize social interaction, suchas Christian faith healing and the Native American Church, suggest that thepicture is likely more complex (Csordas, 1999; Csordas, 2000; Lewton &Bydone, 2000; Milne & Howard, 2000). Nevertheless, the extent to whichthe rise of pharmaceutical therapy and these alternative forms of healingmay diminish the importance of conceptual frameworks which previouslyguided health behavior remains an important question for future research(Nichter & Vuckovic, 1994) Limitations As all families who participated in the study contained patients being treated for asthma, the sample is biased towards those who seek biomedicalcare, and does not address the traditional healing behavior of those who donot. Additional research with such individuals might provide different insightsinto the role of traditional healing. Although tribal members receive healthcare at no cost from regional medical facilities operated by the U.S. IndianHealth Service, geographic barriers to health care remain significant. As aresult, because the study was conducted in the Shiprock area on the peripheryof the Reservation, it is possible that the treatment decisions of these familiesdo not accurately reflect the health care seeking practices of Navajo who livein interior areas of the reservation. Since the results of this study are derived from a relatively small convenience sample, they may not be representative of the treatmentdecisions of all Navajo. Although we report percentages to show thedistribution of a belief or behavior within our sample, these figures shouldnot be taken to imply their existence or prevalence in the broader Navajopopulation. Instead, our findings offer a view of how one group of Navajoindividuals think about and decide to use traditional healing. Finally, thisstudy did not investigate the use of Native American Church healing or NavajoChristian faith healing in the management of asthma.TRADITIONAL HEALING 15 Conclusions Qualitative research with Navajo asthmatics has revealed a variety of factors underlie the decision to use traditional healing in the managementof asthma. Although our investigation identifies some areas of ideologicalconflict between traditional healing and biomedicine, it appears that practicaland logistic issues (such as economics) may also play an important role indecision-making about use of traditional healing for a number of families.Our results demonstrate a health care seeking process characterized notonly by critical evaluation of traditional medicine, but also by scrutiny of theillness itself and reflection upon local epidemiological and social history. The increase in chronic diseases such as asthma may change patterns of use of traditional medicine by altering expectations about theefficacy and benefits of ceremonial treatment. Our results suggest that asawareness of the nature of asthma continues to grow, popular receptivity to'cures' is altered in two distinct ways. Some Navajo look toward traditionalhealing less for a cure and more to enhance well-being and quality of life.Another group, however\u2014less willing to manage the disease over the long-term\u2014searches for permanent solutions to their chronic problems in theirtraditional ceremonials. Knowledge of the patterns of use of traditional healing for chronic diseases such as asthma remains important for practitioners serving theNavajo population, particularly for those attempting to improve patientsatisfaction with biomedical care by integrating elements or cultural valuesof traditional healing systems. For example, although the efficacy of traditionalhealing is tied to the participation of a wide network of family members, ourstudy suggests that this represents a significant practical constraint. As a growing number of American Indian and/or Alaska Natives turn to private health care providers\u2014both biomedical as well as complementaryand alternative\u2014patterns of use of traditional healing are likely to respond tothe increasing complexity of the medical marketplace (Rhoades, 2002).Although no scientific studies exist, our experience suggests that Reservation-based Navajo are experiencing an increase in the regional availability ofnon-Native forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), suchas chiropracty. Knowledge of how therapy decisions are made within apluralistic health care setting, such as the Navajo reservation, will becomeincreasingly important as a range of treatment options become available toa wider audience (Eisenberg, 1997).16 VOLUME 11, NUMBER 1 Anne L.

Footnote 1In a study of the clinical implications of the perception of asthma medication among Navajo asthmatics, Van Sickle and Wright (2001) reportwidespread hesitancy to take prescribed medication due in part to concernabout dependency. This attitude often led to delays in the use of asthmamedications during attacks, or specific attempts to wean themselves or theirchildren from asthma medications. "}
