Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to vaccines and the treatment or prevention of infectious disease and, more specifically, to compositions comprising a Proteosome adjuvant or a Proteosome:liposaccharide adjuvant formulated with measles virus antigens, and therapeutic uses thereof. 2. Description of the Related Art Measles is a highly communicable disease that infects an estimated 40 million people annually, causing over 900,000 deaths per year (WHO/UNICEF, Joint WHO/UNICEF statement on Vitamin A for Measles, Weekly Epidemiology Record 19:133, 1987). In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF announced a program to reduce measles mortality by at least 50% by 2005 through targeted vaccination campaigns in developing countries. This is to be achieved by ensuring greater than 80% coverage in over 80% of the world (Id.; Orenstein et al., Am. J. Public Health 90:1521; 2000). Although the live-attenuated vaccines in current use are effective, they have serious limitations. In particular, they often fail to protect children younger than 9 months of age due to the presence of neutralizing maternal antibodies (Albrecht et al., J. Pediatr. 91:715 (1977); Markowitz et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 322:580 (1990)). Between 30% and 50% of measles virus (MV) associated deaths occur during this vulnerable period. Maternal anti-measles antibody titers vary widely, and passively acquired antibodies normally have a half-life of three to four weeks. As a result, infants become susceptible to measles at almost any time between birth and one year in age (Crowe, Clin. Infect. Dis. 33:1720, 2001). Several attempts have been made to bypass the interference of maternal antibodies using currently available live attenuated vaccines. A high titer, live (infectious) measles virus vaccination, which has up to 106.3 plaque forming units (PFU) of vaccine strain virus as compared to 103.4 PFU for standard vaccination, was tried (Markowitz et al.) and aerosol administration was tried (Bennett et al., Bull. World Health Organ. 80:806, 2002). The former approach could successfully protect children as young as 3 months of age, but it was associated with a poorly understood increase in childhood mortality. Such mortality may be associated with the administration of vaccines containing live or attenuated measles virus. Early results with aerosol administration of live vaccine MV strain were also promising. However, the doses administered needed to be quite high and the delivery systems are very cumbersome. While unacceptable, these attempts demonstrated that a 2-3 month old infant has an intrinsic ability to respond to MV antigens, and that mucosal immunization might be less susceptible to the interference of maternal antibodies. The ability of antigens to induce protective immune responses in a host can be enhanced by combining the antigen with an immunostimulant and/or adjuvant. Alum-based adjuvants are almost exclusively used for licensed injectable human vaccines. However, while alum enhances certain types of serum antibody responses (Type 2), it is poor at enhancing other types of antibody responses (Type 1) and is a poor activator of cellular immune responses that are important for protection against, for example, intracellular pathogens. Hence, a need exists for identifying and developing compositions therapeutically effective against measles infections, particularly those compositions that can function as a vaccine and elicit protective immunity. Furthermore, a need exists for vaccine formulations, particularly subunit vaccine formulations, which include potent adjuvants that are safe in humans and capable of enhancing the induction of protective systemic and mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses. The present invention meets such needs, and further provides other related advantages.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides Proteosome formulated measles vaccine compositions, and therapeutic uses thereof. These vaccines are straightforward to produce and are capable of eliciting a protective immune response for treating or preventing a measles infection.

In certain embodiments the immune response is a systemic humoral response; a mucosal response; wherein the mucosal response comprises production of a IgA immunoglobulin; and/or a cell mediated immune response. These and other aspects of the present invention will become evident upon reference to the following detailed description and attached drawings. In addition, various references to published documents are set forth herein which describe in more detail certain aspects of this invention, and are therefore incorporated by reference in their entireties.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 5 shows analysis of MV antigen preparation, with and without projuvant or OMP-LPS, by SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy. In The invention described herein relates to the surprising discovery that intranasal administration of a Proteosome-based MV vaccine (including a Proteosome:liposaccharide (LPS)-MV vaccine) can stimulate both a mucosal response in the respiratory tract as well as a systemic antibody response. Moreover, administration of the vaccine compositions described herein in animals, including mice and juvenile rhesus macaques, indicates that the compositions can be safely delivered to a host or subject without any observed toxic or adverse effect. Discussed in more detail herein are immunogenic compositions comprising Proteosomes and one or more measles virus antigens, which are suitable for therapeutic uses such as treating or preventing a measles infection, and methods for preparing the same. The present invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising one or more measles antigens formulated with a Proteosome-based adjuvant, which compositions can be used as a vaccine to elicit a protective immune response. By way of background, a live attenuated measles vaccine is widely used, and the recommended age of immunization has varied from 6 to 15 months but is still an area under discussion (Volti et al., Eur. J. Epidemiol. 9:311, 1993). Although a respiratory route of immunization has been advocated for younger infants, such attempts have proven either unsuccessful or impractical (Khanum et al., Lancet 1:150, 1987) because of interference from neutralizing maternal antibodies (Markowitz et al., supra). Moreover, drawbacks for the use of the current live measles vaccine include lack of protection at mucosal surfaces where the virus first enters and replicates, low thermal stability of the vaccine, the need for reconstitution prior to injection, and the risk of contamination of injection devices, and unwanted side effects or complications that occur after immunization. In the present description, any concentration range, percentage range, or integer range is to be understood to include the value of any integer within the recited range and, when appropriate, fractions thereof (such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer), unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, \"about\" or \"comprising essentially of\" mean\u00b115%. The use of the alternative (e.g., \"or\") should be understood to mean one, both, or any combination thereof of the alternatives. As used herein, the use of an indefinite article, such as \"a\" or \"an\", should be understood to refer to the singular and the plural of a noun or noun phrase. In addition, it should be understood that the individual compositions, formulations, or compounds, or groups of compositions, formulations, or compounds, derived from the various components or combinations of the composition or sequences, structures, and substituents described herein are disclosed by the present application to the same extent as if each composition or compound or group of compositions or compounds was set forth individually. Thus, selection of particular sequences, structures, or substituents is within the scope of the present invention. Measles Virus Polypeptide Immunogens The present invention is directed generally to the use of measles virus (MV) polypeptide immunogens, including H protein, F protein, M protein, N protein, L protein, P protein, or fragments thereof, including fusions to other polypeptides (e.g., a hydrophobic amino acid sequence) or other modifications (e.g., addition of a lipid or glycosylation). The immunogenic MV polypeptides may comprise any portion of such polypeptides that have at least one epitope capable of eliciting a protective immune response (cellular or humoral) against MV infection. Immunogenic polypeptides of the instant invention may also be arranged or combined in a linear form, and each immunogen may or may not be reiterated, wherein the reiteration may occur once or multiple times. In addition, a plurality of different MV immunogenic polypeptides (e.g., different H protein, F protein, or N protein variants, or fragments thereof) can be selected and mixed or combined into a cocktail composition to provide a multivalent vaccine for use in eliciting a protective immune response. Also contemplated are methods for treating or preventing an MV infection or eliciting an immune response using MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof, or a combination of polypeptides (including fusion proteins). MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof can be prepared from a variety of biological sources, such as tissues of an infected subject or cultured cell lines. Primary isolation of MV may be from, for example, peripheral blood cells or from respiratory secretions. Preferably, the isolated MV are amplified on primary cell cultures (such as human blood, lung, conjunctiva, kidney, intestine, anion, skin, muscle, thymic stroma, foreskin, or uterus cells, or monkey kidney or testis cells) or on established cell lines (such polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof are prepared from an established MV vaccine strain, which are known in the art or are later established in the art. In one preferred embodiment, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof are prepared from a Moraten strain, Shwarz strain, Zagreb strain, or Edmonston strain. In a certain embodiment, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof are isolated from intact viral particles. As used herein, the term \"isolated\" means that the material is removed from its original or natural environment. For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide present in a living animal or cell, or virus is not isolated, but the same nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is isolated when separated from some or all of the co-existing materials in the natural system. The nucleic acid molecules, for example, could be part of a vector and/or such nucleic acids or polypeptides could be part of a composition and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. In other embodiments, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof may be either partially purified or purified to homogeneity. As described herein and as is known in the art, a variety of methods may be used to isolate or purify the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof of the instant invention. MV can be propagated on a cell line of choice, such as Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) or CV-1, and the viral particles may be partially or substantially separated from the mammalian cells. For example, a crude extract of MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof can be prepared from infected cells that are subjected to at least one freeze-thaw cycle, centrifuged to remove cells debris, filtered, and the viral particles can be isolated by ultracentrifugation, sonicated, and resuspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent (such as phosphate buffered saline, PBS) (see Example 4). Alternatively or in addition, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof can be isolated or purified using a detergent extraction or sucrose density gradient centrifugation to obtain quantifiable amounts of the Mv immunogens. As used herein, a \"measles split antigen\" preparation refers to the separation, isolation, or purification of MV polypeptides from intact measles virus particles. In one preferred embodiment, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof comprise a measles split antigen, which may be prepared by way of, for example, detergent solubilization. The present invention further refers to certain formulations containing one or more viral antigens, wherein the viral antigens may be a part of compositions or components known as lipid rafts. As described herein and is known in the art, such lipid rafts may represent biologically relevant membranes (host cell or virus) enriched for specific viral antigens. Such lipid rafts may be dissociated by treatment with certain detergents, such as octyl glucoside or methyl B cyclodextrin, to further modify a vaccine formulation. Thus, lipid raft isolation may be used to enrich for specific desired antigens, or used to aid in formulating a vaccine. The presence or absence of lipid rafts may affect, for example, stability of the immunogen or an immunological outcome. The present invention further provides methods for producing synthetic MV polypeptide immunogens, including fusion proteins. The immunogenic polypeptide components may be synthesized by standard chemical methods, including synthesis by automated procedure. In general, immunogenic polypeptides or peptides are synthesized based on the standard solid-phase Fmoc protection strategy with HATU as the coupling agent. The immunogenic peptide can be cleaved from the solid-phase resin with trifluoroacetic acid containing appropriate scavengers, which also deprotects side chain functional groups. Crude immunogenic peptide may be further purified using preparative reverse phase chromatography. Other purification methods, such as partition chromatography, gel filtration, gel electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, or other methods practiced by a skilled artisan may be used. Other synthesis techniques known in the art may be employed to produce similar immunogenic peptides, such as the tBoc protection strategy, use of different coupling reagents, and the like. In addition, any naturally occurring amino acid or derivative thereof may be used, including D- or L-amino acids and combinations thereof. As described herein, the MV polypeptide immunogens or fragments thereof o may be recombinant, wherein a desired MV immunogen is expressed from a polynucleotide that is operatively linked to an expression control sequence (e.g., promoter, enhancer) in a recombinant nucleic acid expression construct. For example, host cells (such as baculovirus and mammalian cell lines) containing H or F or N protein immunogen-encoding nucleic acid expression constructs can be cultured to produce recombinant H or F or N protein immunogens, or fragments thereof (see, e.g., Piltz et al., Intl. J. Parasitol. 33:525 (2003) and references cited therein; see Sambrook al., (2001), supra) . Vaccine Adjuvants\u2014Proteosomes (\"Projuvant\" and OMP-LPS) The invention also relates to immunogenic compositions that contain one or more MV antigen and an additional component to aid or otherwise cooperate in eliciting an immune response, such as an adjuvant. As set forth above, the current live attenuated measles vaccine is poorly immunogenic in children under 9 months of age due to persisting neutralizing maternal antibodies and an immature infant immune system. Drawbacks related to the use of the live attenuated measles vaccine, particularly in third world countries, include lack of thermal stability during storage, which may be an issue in countries with unstable power supplies, and the route of administration is presently by injection, which may lead to transmission of other diseases if the injection is performed in an unsafe manner. Despite the multiplicity of efforts to formulate successful MV vaccines, a need remains for effective compositions to immunize individuals in need thereof, particularly against infection by measles. An alternative to a live attenuated measles vaccine is an MV subunit vaccine as provided by the instant invention, such as a formulation comprising a split measles antigen preparation and a Proteosome-based adjuvant, as described herein. To maximize the effectiveness of a subunit MV vaccine, the MV antigens may be combined with a potent immunostimulant or adjuvant. Exemplary adjuvants include alum (aluminum hydroxide, REHYDRAGEL\u00ae), aluminum phosphate, Proteosome adjuvant (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,726,292 and 5,985,284, and U.S. patent application Publication No. 2001/0053368), virosomes, liposomes with and without Lipid A, Detox (Ribi/Corixa), MF59, or other oil and water emulsions type adjuvants, such as nanoemulsions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.5,716,637) or submicron emulsions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,970), and Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvant. A particularly preferred adjuvant is a Proteosome. Proteosomes are comprised of outer membrane proteins (OMP) from Neisseria species typically, but can be derived from other Gram-negative bacteria (see, e.g., Lowell et al., J. Exp. Med. 167:658, 1988; Lowell et al., Science 240:800, 1988; Lynch et al., Biophys. J. 45:104, 1984; U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,292; U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,543). Proteosomes have the capability to auto-assemble into vesicle or vesicle-like OMP clusters of 20-800 nm, and to noncovalently incorporate, coordinate, associate, or otherwise cooperate with protein antigens (Ag), particularly antigens that have a hydrophobic moiety. Proteosomes are hydrophobic and safe for human use, and comparable in size to certain viruses. By way of background, and not wishing to be bound by theory, mixing of Proteosomes with a protein (e.g., antigen) provides a composition comprising non-covalent association or coordination between the antigen and Proteosomes, which association or coordination forms when solubilizing detergent is selectively removed or reduced, for example, by dialysis. As used herein, \"Proteosome\" refers to preparations of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria species (see, e.g., Lowell et al., J. Exp. Med. 167:658, 1988; Lowell et al., Science 240:800,1988; Lynch et al., Biophys. J. 45:104,1984; Lowell, in \"New Generation Vaccines\" 2nd ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basil, Hong Kong, pages 193,1997; U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,292; U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,284; U.S. Pat. No.4,707,543), which are useful as a carrier or an adjuvant for immunogens, such as MV antigens. Proteosomes may be prepared as described in the art or as described herein (see flowcharts of Any preparation method that results in the outer membrane protein component in vesicular or vesicle-like form, including molten globular-like OMP compositions of one or more OMP, is included within the definition of \"Proteosome.\" In one embodiment, the Proteosomes are from Neisseria species, and more preferably from Neisseria meningitidis. In certain embodiments, Proteosomes are not a carrier but are an adjuvant. As used herein, a Proteosome that is an adjuvant may be referred to as a \"projuvant.\" In certain other embodiments, Proteosomes may be an adjuvant and an antigen delivery composition. In a preferred embodiment, an MV immunogenic composition of the instant invention comprises one or more MV antigens (i.e., MV immunogens or fragments thereof) as described herein and an adjuvant, wherein the adjuvant comprises a projuvant (i.e., Proteosome) and wherein at least one of the measles antigens is H protein. In another embodiment, this formulation comprises one or more measles virus antigens that include an F protein and an H protein. As described herein, the MV antigens can be from a recombinant source or comprise a measles split antigen. Preferably, the measles split antigen is obtained from a vaccine strain, such as a Moraten strain, Shwarz strain, Zagreb strain, or Edmonston strain. In certain embodiments, the invention provides an immunogenic composition that further comprises an immunostimulant, such as a liposaccharide. That is, the adjuvant may be prepared to include an additional immunostimulant. For example, the projuvant may be mixed as described herein with a liposaccharide to provide an OMP-LPS adjuvant. Thus, the OMP-LPS adjuvant can be comprised of two basic components. The first component is an outer membrane protein preparation of Proteosomes (i.e., projuvant) prepared from Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis. The second component is a preparation of liposaccharide. As used herein, \"liposaccharide\" refers to native or modified lipopolysaccharide or lipooligosaccharide (collectively, also referred to as LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria, such as Shigella flexneri or Plesiomonas species). The liposaccharide may be in a detoxified form (i.e., having the Lipid A core removed) or may be in a form that has not been detoxified. The liposaccharide may be prepared as described in the flowchart of Proteosome:LPS or Protollin or IVX or IVX-908 as used herein refers to preparations of projuvant admixed as described herein with at least one kind of liposaccharide to provide an OMP-LPS composition (which can function as an immunostimulatory composition). Thus, the OMP-LPS adjuvant can be comprised, for example, of two of the basic components of IVX-908, which include (1) an outer membrane protein preparation that is a Proteosome (i.e., Projuvant) prepared from Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, and (2) a preparation of one or more liposaccharides. As described herein, the two components of an OMP-LPS adjuvant may be formulated at specific initial ratios (see flowchart of In the preferred embodiment, the final liposaccharide content by weight as a percentage of the total Proteosome protein can be in a range from about 10% to about 500%, in a range from about 20% to about 200%, or in a range from about 30% to about 150%. In one preferred embodiment the adjuvant composition comprising Proteosomes is prepared from Neisseria meningitidis and the liposaccharide is prepared from Shigella flexneri or Plesiomonas shigelloides, and the final liposaccharide content is between 50% to 150% of the total Proteosome protein by weight. In another embodiment, Proteosomes are prepared with endogenous lipooligosaccharide (LOS) content ranging from about 0.5% up to about 5% of total OMP. Another embodiment of the instant invention provides Proteosomes with endogenous liposaccharide in a range from about 12% to about 25%, and in a preferred embodiment between about 15% and about 20% of total OMP. The instant invention also provides a composition containing liposaccharide derived from any Gram-negative bacterial species, which may be from the same Gram-negative bacterial species that is the source of Proteosomes or is a different bacterial species. Immunogenic Compositions and Methods of Use The immunogenic compositions described herein that contain one or more Mv immunogens, which can be used to elicit an immune response, such as a protective immune response. The invention provides methods for treating and preventing MV infections by administering to a subject one or more MV immunogens or fragments thereof, fusion protein, multivalent immunogen, or a mixture of such immunogens at a dose sufficient to elicit an immune response (cellular and/or humoral) specific for MV (which may be a protective immune response), as described herein. MV polypeptide immunogens and variants thereof, or a cocktail of such immunogens are preferably part of a composition comprising an adjuvant, such as projuvant or OMP-LPS, when used in the methods of the present invention. In one embodiment, the immunogenic compositions of the instant invention may further comprise one or more additional microbial antigens, such as viral antigens, bacterial antigens, parasitic antigens, or a combination thereof. For example, the MV immunogenic composition may also include antigens for rubella and mumps. The immunogenic compositions may further include a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier, diluent, or excipient, in addition to one or more Mv immunogen or fragment thereof and, optionally, other components. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or other components suitable for use with an immunogenic composition of this invention include a thickening agent, a buffering agent, a solvent, a humectant, a preservative, a chelating agent, an additional adjuvant, and the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition of the instant invention may further include a diluent such as water or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Preferably, diluent is PBS with a final phosphate concentration range from about 0.1 mM to about 1 M, more preferably from about 0.5 mM to about 500 mM, even more preferably from about 1 mM to about 50 mM, and most preferably from about 2.5 mM to about 10 mM; and the final salt concentration ranges from about 100 mM to about 200 mM and most preferably from about 125 mM to about 175 mM. Preferably, the final PBS concentration is about 5 mM phosphate and about 150 mM salt (such as NaCl). In certain embodiments, any of the aforementioned immunogenic compositions comprising a cocktail of MV immunogens or MV split antigen and an adjuvant (such as projuvant or OMP-LPS) of the instant invention are preferably sterile. The compositions can be sterile either by preparing them under an aseptic environment or they can be terminally sterilized using methods available in the art. Many pharmaceuticals are manufactured to be sterile and this criterion is defined by the USP XXII <1211>. Sterilization in this embodiment may be accomplished by a number of means accepted in the industry and listed in the USP XXII <1211>, including gas sterilization, ionizing radiation or filtration. Sterilization may be maintained by what is termed asceptic processing, defined also in USP XXII <1211>. Acceptable gases used for gas sterilization include ethylene oxide. Acceptable radiation types used for ionizing radiation methods include gamma, for instance from a cobalt 60 source and electron beam. A typical dose of gamma radiation is 2.5 MRad. When appropriate, filtration may be accomplished using a filter with suitable pore size, for example 0.22 m and of a suitable material, for instance Teflon\u00ae. The term \"USP\" refers to U.S. Pharmacopeia (see www.usp.org; Rockville, Md.). Due to the fact that Proteosomes or OMP-LPS result in particles small enough that the immunogenic compositions of the invention can be filtered through a 0.8 filter, a 0.45 filter, or a 0.2 filter. Thus, in preferred embodiments the MV immunogenic compositions of this invention are sterilized by filtration. This is highly advantageous as it is desirable to eliminate any complications by virtue of the presence of such contaminants. The present invention also pertains to methods for treating or preventing a measles infection, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an immunogenic composition comprising an adjuvant and one or more measles virus antigens, wherein the adjuvant comprises either Proteosomes or OMP-LPS, and at least one of the measles antigens is an H protein. In another embodiment, the immunogenic compositions of this invention may be used to elicit an immune response (cellular or humoral or both, which may favor a Type 1 or Type 2 cellular response). A subject suitable for treatment or for eliciting an immune response with a MV immunogen formulation may be identified by well-established indicators of risk for developing a disease or well-established hallmarks of an existing disease. Infections that may be treated with a MV immunogen disclosed herein include infections caused by or due to MV, whether the infection is primary, secondary, opportunistic, or the like. Examples of MV include any antigenic variant of these viruses. Methods for preparing the immunogenic compositions of the instant invention are described herein and are known in art (see, e.g., U.S. patent application Publications Nos. 2001/0053368 and 2003/0044425). The antigen(s) and adjuvant are formulated at specific initial ratios to optimize interaction (or cooperation) between the components resulting in non-covalent association (or non-specific juxtaposition) of a significant portion of the two components with each other. For example, a mixture of at least one MV polypeptide antigen with a Proteosome (projuvant) or OMP-LPS is prepared in the presence of detergent, and reduction or removal of the detergent from the mixture by diafiltration/ultrafiltration leads to association (or coordination) of the antigens with the adjuvant (see The immunogenic compositions that contain one or more MV antigens and a Proteosome-based adjuvant described herein may be in any form that allows for the composition to be administered to a subject, such as a human or non-human animal (e.g., a non-human primate, or rodent, for example, a mouse or rat). For example, such immunogenic compositions may be prepared and administered as a liquid solution or prepared as a solid form (e.g., lyophilized), which may be administered in solid form, or resuspended in a solution in conjunction with administration. The MV immunogenic polypeptide compositions are formulated to allow the active ingredients contained therein to be bioavailable upon administration of the composition to a subject (or patient) or bioavailable via slow release. Compositions that will be administered to a subject or patient take the form of one or more dosage units. For example, a drop may be a single dosage unit, and a container of one or more compounds of the invention in aerosol form may hold a plurality of dosage units. In certain preferred embodiments, any of the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions comprising a MV immunogen or cocktail of immunogens of the invention are in a container, preferably in a sterile container. The design of a particular protocol for administration, including dose level, time of dosing, number of doses, time periods between dosing are determined by optimizing such procedures using routine methods well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the immunogenic composition is administered nasally. Other typical routes of administration include enteral, parenteral, transdermal/transmucosal, nasal, and inhalation. The term \"enteral\", as used herein, is a route of administration in which the immunogenic composition is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or oral mucosa, including oral, rectal, and sublingual. The term \"parenteral\", as used herein, describes administration routes that bypass the infusion techniques. The term \"transdermal/transmucosal\", as used herein, is a route of administration in which the immunogenic composition is administered through or by way of the skin, including topical. The terms \"nasal\" and \"inhalation\" encompass techniques of administration in which an immunogenic composition is introduced into the pulmonary tree, including intrapulmonary or transpulmonary. A composition may be adminstered as an aerosol by a mechanism known in the art, such as by a mechanical apparatus, for example, a nebulizer, whereby the aerosolized composition is delivered to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Preferably, the immunogenic compositions described herein are administered nasally (intranasally). Furthermore, the immunogenic compositions disclosed herein can be used to enhance immunity, or as a follow-on immunization, when given together with another vaccine, such as a live attenuated measles vaccine. For example, compositions comprising one or more MV polypeptide immunogens with projuvant or OMP-LPS may be used as a priming immunization or as a boosting immunization (by mucosal or parenteral routes) prior to or subsequent to administering a live attenuated measles vaccine. In another embodiment, for treating or preventing a measles infection and/or for eliciting an immune response, a subject receives at least one, two, or three priming immunizations with a DNA vaccine followed by a boosting immunization with the compositions disclosed herein comprising one or more MV polypeptide immunogens with projuvant or OMP-LPS. The DNA vaccine comprises one or more recombinant expression constructs that contain a polynucleotide sequence encoding a measles virus polypeptide, or fragment thereof, and that is operatively linked to a promoter sequence (see, e.g., Fennelly et al., J. Immunol. 162:1603-10 (1999); Pasetti et al., J. Virol. 77:5209-17 (2003)). polynucleotide may encode at least one measles virus polypeptide, for example H protein, may encode at least two measles virus polypeptides (i.e., abicistronic polynucleotide), for example, H protein and F protein, or may encode at three, four, or five or more measles virus polypeptides (i.e., a polycistronic polynucleotide). The DNA vaccine may comprise two or more recombinant expression constructs, for example, wherein each construct comprises a polynucleotide containing a promoter that is operatively linked to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes at least one measles virus polypeptide, or fragment thereof. Recombinant polynucleotide expression constructs may be prepared according to methods known to persons skilled in the molecular biology art. Cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (2001), and may include plasmids, cosmids, shuttle vectors, viral vectors, and vectors comprising a chromosomal origin of replication as disclosed therein. Recombinant expression constructs also comprise expression control sequences (regulatory sequences) that allow expression of a polypeptide of interest in a host cell, including one or more promoter sequences (e.g., lac, tac, enhancer sequences, operator sequences (e.g., lacO), and the like. Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell, and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences. In preferred embodiments the constructs are included in compositions that are administered in vivo. Such vectors and constructs include chromosomal; nonchromosomal; and synthetic DNA sequences, e.g., derivatives of SV40; bacterial plasmids; phage DNA; yeast vectors derived from combinations of and phage DNA; viral DNA, such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, and pseudorabies; or replication deficient retroviruses as described below. However, any other vector may be used for preparation of a recombinant expression construct, and in preferred embodiments such a vector will be replicable and viable in the host (subject). In one embodiment, the DNA vaccine is prepared by introducing a recombinant expression vector into bacteria, which bacteria are then administered to a subject. For example, a recombinant expression vector that comprises a polynucleotide encoding one or more measles virus polypeptides, or fragment thereof, may be introduced (e.g., by transfection, electroporation, or transformation) into a strain of Shigella flexneri (see, e.g., Fennelly et al., supra; Pasetti et al., supra). The bacteria may then be prepared for administration to a subject according to methods practiced by skilled artisans for delivery of such DNA vaccines. The DNA vaccine may be delivered intranasally, intramuscularly, intradermally, parenterally, by inhalation, or by any other route and method in the art that provides the vaccine to the subject in a manner such that the encoded MV polypeptides are expressed. Preferably, the MV immunogenic compositions described herein will induce specific anti-MV immune responses, including one or more of a systemic humoral response, a mucosal immune response, and cell-mediated immunity (CMI). A systemic humoral immune response is indicated by the presence of specific anti-measles antigen IgG antibodies or other classes of immunoglobulin in serum, the protective or therapeutic effect of which may be determined in functional assays, including hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Induction of a response measured by HI is useful because the presence of an immunoglobulin in a biological sample from an immunized subject that inhibits hemagglutination is believed to correlate with protection against MV in humans. A mucosal immune response includes production of mucosal antibodies, including IgA in mucosal secretions such as those collected from the respiratory tract, including the nasopharynx and lungs. Not wishing to be bound by theory, the mucosal immune response system likely provides the initial immunological barrier against MV infection, and IgA that is predominant in a mucosal humoral response mediates the defense functions. Analysis of anti-MV IgA antibodies in vitro suggests that the anti-MV immune response prevents virus entry, interrupts virus replication, and/or disrupts transport of virus across the epithelium (see, e.g., Lamm, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 51:311-40 (1997); Yan et al., J. Virol. 76:430-35 (2002)). Cell populations that comprise the mucosal barrier can respond to signals that can reach local or distant sites within the body (Svanborg et al., Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2:99-105 (1999)). According to non-limiting theory, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system, and it likely that IVX908-MV act through the TLR system because PorB, the major N. meningitidis Omp protein in IVX908, binds al., Annu. 21:335-76 (2003)), and the H protein of measles can also bind TLR-2 (Bieback et al., J. Virol. 76:8729-36)). TLR engagement production of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-12) and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The activated innate response directs the effective adaptive immune response. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) includes the switch or decrease from a higher or predominant TH2 response to result in mixed, balanced, increased or predominant TH1 response, for example, as determined by induction of cytokine expression, such as IFN-, without comparable increases in induction of certain TH2 cytokines, such as IL-5 which levels may, for example, be maintained, decreased, or absent. Such TH1 responses are predictive of the induction of other CMI associated responses, such as development of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), which are indicative of TH1 immunity. The presence of measles specific antibodies in a biological sample from a subject, including sera, nasal lavage, and/or lung lavage, may be determined by any one of numerous immunoassays practiced in the art. Such immunoassays include but are not limited to ELISA, immunoblot, radioimmunoassay, and Ochterlony. Determining the functional activity of measles-specific antibodies may also be determined according to methods described herein and known in the art, such as plaque reduction neutralization assays, hemagglutination inhibition assays, and assays that determine the presence of opsonizing antibodies. The capability of a MV vaccine composition, such as Proteosome:MV and/or a IVX908-MV composition described herein to elicit a specific immune response against MV and/or to prevent a measles virus infection or treat a measles virus infection in a subject may be determined in animal models that are described herein and known and accepted in the art. For example, a murine model or a non-human primate model, such as a rhesus macaque model may be used. One, two, three or more doses of a MV vaccine composition may be administered to the animals as primary and boosting immunizations or as one or more boosting immunizations following a primary or priming immunization with a different vaccine, such as an attenuated measles vaccine or a measles DNA vaccine. Preferably, the MV vaccine is delivered to the animals in a similar manner to the delivery method that may be used for administering the vaccines to humans, such as intranasally. The immune response in the animals may be assessed by determining the presence of immunoglobulins that specifically bind to and/or exhibit a function that indicates that the response is therapeutic or protective. For example, the immunoglobulins, particularly IgG and IgA antibodies, may be sampled to determine when and whether a specific immune response has occurred. Examplary assays described herein and known in the art include immunoassays (e.g., ELISA and immunoblot); determination of measles virus-specific cytokine (PRN) assays. PRN values are particularly useful for characterizing the immune response and evaluating whether the animal when challenged with measles virus will be protected from developing sequelae related to measles infection and disease. Seroprotection in humans has been defined as a PRN value greater than 120 (Chen et al., J. Infect. Dis. 162:1036-42 (1990)). As described herein, adjuvant compositions, including Proteosome compositions and OMP-LPS compositions may also be combined with one or more antigens from one or more microbes (virus, bacteria, parasite, fungus) other than or in addition to measles virus and used for treatment or prevention of other infectious diseases. For example, Proteosome:antigen or IVX908:antigen compositions prepared as described herein may be used for treating or preventing diseases resulting from infection by rubella or mumps viruses. Such immunogenic compositions may also be used for eliciting an immune response that is specific to a virus, such as a rubella or mumps virus. Viral antigens for use in such compositions may be isolated or partially isolated from virus particles, or derived from a cell infected with the virus, or expressed recombinantly according to standard molecular biology methods and then isolated. One or more of the viral antigens may be combined with a Proteosome or OMP-LPS adjuvant according to the methods described herein. The viral antigens combined with a Proteosome or OMP-LPS adjuvant may be from a single type of virus or may be used in a cocktail, that is, one or more antigens from one virus may be combined with one or more antigens of one or more other viruses. Any of a number of cocktails or combinations may be prepared. For example, one composition may comprise antigens from measles, rubella, and mumps virus, or or from mumps viruses, or antigens from mumps and rubella viruses. Any one or more antigens from one or more viruses may then be combined with a Proteosome or OMP-LPS adjuvant. Alternatively, a Proteosome:rubella antigen(s) and/or OMP-LPS:mumps antigen(s) compositions may be combined with a Proteosome:MV or IVX908-MV composition described herein and administered in any combination to a subject in need thereof. Each immunogenic composition may be administered separately from another immunogenic composition at different times (and routes). Any of these immunogenic compositions may be used as a primary (initial or priming) immunization and a boosting immunization or may be used as a boosting immunization. An alternative priming (or primary) immunogen may comprise a DNA vaccine containing a polynucleotide that encodes at least one, two, three, four, or more viral polypeptides of a virus to which the subsequent boosting immunization is directed. These DNA vaccines may be prepared by methods described herein and known in the art. All U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications, and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and/or listed in the Application Data Sheet, are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety. The following examples are intended to illustrate, and not limit, the invention described herein.EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Proteosomes Immunogens (e.g., measles virus antigens) may be formulated with Proteosomes to form a vaccine composition of the instant invention capable of eliciting a protective immune response in a human or animal subject. Proteosomes are useful as an adjuvant and are comprised of outer membrane proteins purified from Gram-negative bacteria. Methods for preparing Proteosomes are described in, for example, Mallett et al. Infect. Immun. 63:2382, 1995; U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,201 B1; U.S. patent application Publication No. 2001/0053368; and U.S. patent application Publication No.2003/0044425. Briefly, a paste of phenol-killed Group B type 2 Neisseria meningitides was extracted with a solution of 6% Empigen\u00ae BB (EBB) (Albright and Wilson, Whithaven, Cumbria, UK) in 1 M calcium chloride. The extract was precipitated with ethanol, solubilized in 1% EBB-Tris/EDTA-saline, and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The precipitated Proteosomes were re-solubilized in 1% EBB buffer, diafiltered, and stored in a 0.1 % EBB buffer at 70\u00b0 C. A flow chart of this process, which resulted in Proteosomes having a liposaccharide content of between about 0.5% and about 5%, is shown in Flowchart 1A ( The example in Flowchart 2 ( A Proteosome adjuvant formulation of the instant invention was manufactured by admixing Proteosomes and LPS to allow a presumably non-covalent association. The LPS can be derived from any of a number of gram negative bacteria, such as Shigella, Plesiomonas, Escherichia, or Salmonella species (see Example 2), which is mixed with the Proteosomes of Example 1, as described in Flowchart 3 ( The OMP-LPS adjuvant was tested for (1) Empigen\u00ae (400 ppm) using reverse-phase HPLC; (2) protein content by a Lowry assay; (3) LPS content by measurement of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) assay. The OMP-LPS composition was further characterized for particle size distribution as determined by quantitative number weighted analysis using a particle seizer (Brookhaven Instruments model 90 plus or similar machine) (10-100 nm). However, the particle size for the complex may increase or modulate with varying (e.g., higher) Proteosome to LPS ratio. Stability of the OMP-LPS composition in the adjuvant formulation should be consistent with the previously demonstrated for S. flexneri LPS vaccine (see U.S. patent application Publication No. 2003/0044425). These data demonstrate that OMP-LPS composition was stable at both refrigerated and accelerated temperature (25\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C.). Under these conditions, the LPS component of the composition or any statistically significant portion thereof may be complexed with the Proteosome component of the vaccine formulation.Example 4 Preparation of Measles Virus Antigen Propagation of an attenuated strain of measles virus (MV) used for vaccine purposes in the United States, the Moraten strain, was accomplished by infecting Vero green monkey kidney cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01-0.001, which infected cells were cultured in a 10 level factory chamber (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.). The MOI was low to minimize the generation of defective, interfering particles. Infected cell cultures were monitored until significant cytopathology was detected (e.g., about 3-5 days), at which time infected cell cultures were subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle to disrupt cells. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2100\u00d7g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant containing cell-free MV was recovered and filtered sequentially through a 0.45 m filter and then a 0.22 m filter. The filtered supernatant was then ultracentriftiged at 14,000 rpm for two hours at 4\u00b0 C. The sedimented measles virus particles were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then subjected to sonication. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.) and a standard curve prepared using a mixture of bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA) and bovine gamma globulin fraction II (BGG).Example 5 Analysis of Measles Virus Antigen Preparation Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed to evaluate the presence of MV hemagglutinin (H) protein and fusion (F) protein in the virus preparation (see In parallel, separated MV samples from another gel were transferred to PVDF membranes for evaluation by immunoblot analysis for MV H and F proteins. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% tween-20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies capable of detecting MV H or F proteins, room temperature for 60 minutes. Immunoblots were then washed with PBS-T followed by incubation in the presence of goat-anti-mouse-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 60 minutes at room temperature, after which, membranes were incubated with HRP substrate, ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences); signal was visualized by exposing Immunoblots to X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.). Bands corresponding to MV H and F proteins were detected using both Coomassie Brilliant Blue and immunoblot analysis. For example, a MV H protein band of 80 kDa was detected on superimposed immunoblots and Coomassie stained gels. The MV F protein detected by immunoblot showed the presence various F protein sizes, which is expected because the Fo primary translation product is proteolytically processed into F1 and F2 subunits. Two forms of Fo of 50-60 kDa can be identified, most likely due to a difference in post-translation glycosylation. The F1 band was identified as a 41 kDa protein band. Some cross reactivity between Vero cell proteins and the F antibody used in these experiments was detected (see, e.g., Vero cell extract control lanes of A formulation of the current invention was prepared by mixing the Proteosome:LPS adjuvant (also referred to herein as OMP-LPS) from Example 3 with the MV antigen from Example 4 in proportions that promote optimal stability and immunological outcomes. In some cases, prior to formulation with the Proteosome:LPS adjuvant, virus, antigen preparations were adjusted to contain 1% detergent (e.g., Empigen BB or Mega-10), followed by dialysis, and then mixing with Proteosome:LPS adjuvant.Example 7 Preparation of Formulations Comprising Proteosomes and Measles Virus Antigen A formulation of the current invention was prepared by mixing the Proteosomes from Example 1 with the MV antigen from Example 4 in proportions that promote optimal formulations for stability and immunological outcomes. Prior to formulation with Proteosomes, virus antigen preparations were adjusted to contain 1% detergent (e.g., Empigen BB or Mega-10), as disclosed in Example 6.Example 8 Analysis of Measles Virus Antigen Vaccine Formulations Vaccine formulations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblot analysis) and by immunogold electron microscopy. Before SDS-PAGE analysis, vaccine formulations were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 seconds. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions of the vaccine formulations were collected. Insoluble fractions were resuspended in PBS before the addition of sample buffer containing 3-mercaptoethanol. In the case of Proteosome formulated MV vaccine compositions, the presence of Proteosome OMPs in the soluble fraction of the vaccine formulation was monitored and served, in these experiments, as an indicator of a successful formulation process. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was used to detect proteins present in soluble and insoluble fractions, and immunoblot analysis was used to confirm the presence of MV H and F proteins in dialyzed preparations. Vaccine formulations of Proteosome with MV antigen, and OMP:LPS with MV antigen, were found to contain detectable amounts of MV H and F proteins ( For analysis by electron microscopy ( Immunizations were performed on 21 groups of 10 week old BALB/c female mice, with 5 mice per group. For each experiment, all mice were evaluated every 2 days for body weight and signs of toxicity (e.g., fur condition, hunched posture, oily skin, eye secretions and dehydration) throughout the course of the experiment. BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) and/or intranasally (IN) on day 1 and 14 with a Proteosome:MV antigen formulation, or a Proteosome:LPS:MV antigen formulation. All vaccine formulations contained 0.4 g of MV antigen as prepared in Example 4. For IN immunizations, mice were first lightly anesthetized by inhalation of isofurane, and then presented with vaccine or control formulations using an automated induction chamber delivering 25 l into the nares (12.5 l per nostril). For IM immunization, 25 l of vaccine formulation was presented by injection into the hind limb. In all cases, control mice were immunized IN or IM with buffer (PBS) alone, MV antigen alone, Proteosomes alone, or Proteosome:LPS (e.g., OMP:LPS) alone. For analysis, samples were obtained from the lateral saphenous vein on day 1, on day 14, and, for mice receiving 3 doses of vaccine formulation, also on day 28. Eight days after the final immunization (day 22 and day 36 for the 2 and 3 dose experimental groups, respectively), mice were euthanized by asphyxiation with CO2, and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Nasal and lung lavages were also performed by making an incision in the trachea and inserting a catheter (Clear-Cath, Abott, Ireland), first into the major airways, and subsequently into the nasopharynx. For each location, the catheter was fixed by a suture and sampled with 1 ml PBS containing aprotinin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). All samples were collected and stored at 20\u00b0 C. until used. Spleens were also collected from each mouse and splenocytes were prepared using 70 m Nylon cell strainers (BD Falcon). Single cell suspensions were centrifuged using Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia) at 280\u00d7g for 20 minutes. Cells located at the plasma/Ficoll interface were collected, washed two times, and frozen in fetal calf serum containing 10% dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO).Example 10 Analysis of Antibodies Specific for Measles Virus by ELISA Serum and mucosal MV specific antibody responses were measured by quantitative ELISA. For serum samples, total IgG, IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b) and IgA were measured. For nasal and lung washes, only IgA was assessed. U-bottom, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 1 g/ml MV antigen diluted in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were blocked with 2% skim milk in PBS 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) before dilutions of samples were added in duplicate and incubated for a period of 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. antibodies anti-mouse IgA-Biotin (Pharmingen, BD) was used as a secondary antibody for the detection of IgA, followed by Streptavidin-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Assays were completed by the addition of TM Blue substrate (Serological Corporation). Reactions were stopped using 0.2 M sulfuric acid (Sigma). The mean and standard deviation (SD) of optical density values recorded at 450 nm were calculated from an automatic microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). The antibody concentrations in the test samples were calculated from a standard curve included on each plate using purified mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) or purified mouse IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Tex.). Values are expressed in nanograms of specific antibody per milliliter of serum or lavage fluid (see The ability of MV-specific antibodies contained in samples (serum and/or lavage) to neutralize the growth of MV was assessed by plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) assays as previously described (Ward et al., Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 33:147, 1999). Briefly, Vero cells were plated in 24-well plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) to obtain 90-95% confluence. Samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 40 minutes before use in PRN. Samples were diluted and incubated with MV for a period of 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. after which duplicate wells of 70% confluent Vero cells were infected with 100 l of 10-fold serial dilutions. A 16% methylcellulose overlay in Lebovitz's L15 media (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was applied to infected cells and plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 for 4 days. A solution of 4% neutral red was added to stain the monolayer, and then left for an additional 24 hours. Finally, the cell monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formalin for 10 minutes and visible plaques were counted to determine the number of plaque forming units (see MV antigen vaccine formulations were evaluated for safety (i.e., toxicity) in mice (see also Example 9). Mice were immunized intranasally (IN) with either 2 or 3 doses of MV antigen formulated with Proteosomes or OMP-LPS. In addition, MV antigen formulated with Proteosomes were used to immunize mice via the intramuscular route (IM). No toxicity was detected using any of the vaccine formulations disclosed herein. The mice were observed and weighed every other day. For vaccine formulations administered either IN or IM, no behavioral changes were noted in any of the mice, and no statistically significant fluctuation in weight was detected (e.g., greater than \u00b11.0 gram). These data suggest that the vaccine formulation of the instant invention would likely be safe for use with human subjects.Example 13 Serum IGG Antibody Response Following Immunization with Measles Virus Antigen Vaccine Formulation The ability of MV antigen vaccine formulations to elicit systemic immunity was assessed by analyzing serum samples by quantitative ELISA for MV-specific antibodies. In these experiments, mice were immunized on days 1, 14 and/or 28, as depicted in ELISA for the detection of IgA in nasal and lung lavages was used to determine the ability of MV vaccine formulations to elicit nasal and respiratory mucosal immunity. Nasal and lung lavages were performed 8 days after the last immunization. Significant levels of MV-specific IgA were detected in mice receiving 3 doses of Proteosome:MV vaccine formulations delivered IN, whereas such levels were not detected in mice receiving 2 doses of vaccine ( Plaque reduction neutralization assays were used to analyze serum samples, as well as nasal and lung lavage samples, for immunoneutralizing activity when collected 8 days after the last immunization. In these experiments, Proteosome-MV antigen formulated vaccine delivered IN showed low but significant MV neutralization ( The predominance of different IgG antibody isotypes is associated with a specific type of immune response. Serum IgG1 is associated with a TH2-type response involved in humoral immunity, whereas serum IgG2a is associated with a TH1 -type response involved in cellular mediated immunity. The concentration of isotype-specific IgG1 or IgG2a antibodies was measured by ELISA in serum collected 8 days after the last immunization. Antigen specificity of serum antibodies was determined by immunoblot analysis. Comparative immunoblots were designed to detect MV H, F, and M proteins ( This Example describes the mucosal and systemic neutralizing antibody immune response in mice that received varying doses of an intranasal measles virus vaccine formulated with Proteosome:LPS (IVX908). Measles Antigen Preparation Measles virus split antigen was prepared as follows. Moraten vaccine-strain MV (gift from R. Wittes, Connaught Laboratory, Mississauga, ON) was grown in Vero green monkey kidney cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)=0.01-0.001 using 10 level cell factory chambers (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, N.Y.). At peak cytopathic effect, flasks were freeze-thawed once. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation(2100\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C.); pooled supernatants were filtered first through a 0.45 m filter and then through a 0.22 m filter. The filtrate was ultracentrifuged (10,000\u00d7g for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C.), the pellet was resuspended and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Protein concentration was measured based on a standard curve using a mixture of bovine serum albumin fraction V and bovine gamma globulin fraction II (Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.). Prior to formulation with IVX908, 1% detergent (Mega-10, Bachem AG) was added to the MV antigen preparation, which was then dialyzed against PBS for 7 days in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Measles Virus Antigen Characterization Serial dilutions of the MV split antigen were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue G-250 (Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.) ( As shown in MV antigens run on a parallel gel were transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblot analysis. Membranes containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) before incubation for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) with monoclonal anti-F or anti-H antibodies (provided by Fabian Wild, Institut Pasteur de Lyon, France). Following washing with PBS-T, PVDF membranes were exposed to goat-anti-mouse-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) for one hour at room temperature. Membranes were immersed in HRP substrate and binding of the goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate the PDVF membranes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). The results are presented in Preparation of Proteosome-Based Measles Vaccines. (IVX908-MV) IVX908 (also known as Protollin) was manufactured under cGMP guidelines and was identical to the Proteosome-S. flexneri 2a LPS lot of the prospective S. flexneri vaccine prepared by diafiltration as previously described (Rima et al., Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 191:65-83 (1995)). The ratio of approximately 1:1 wt/wt. N. meningitidis Porin A, Porin B, and class IV protein constitute about 20%, 75%, and 5% of total Proteosome protein content, respectively. IVX908 was mixed with the MV antigen preparation in a 1:1 ratio immediately before administration to animals. Characterization of IVX908-MV by Electron Microscopy Vaccine formulations were centrifuged in an airfuge onto nickel grids for 5 minutes. Grids were then immersed in a blocking solution of 1% BSA for 5 minutes. Monoclonal anti-H (Chemicon International, Temecula, Calif.) was used as the primary antibody. Following one hour incubation at room temperature, grids were further blocked with 1% BSA for 5 minutes, and then exposed to anti-mouse IgG-Gold-10 nm (Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands) for one hour at room temperature. Grids were washed with PBS and double distilled water before being air dried. Finally, the grids were colored with PTA 3% pH 6.0 (phosphotungsic acid) and viewed using a Hitachi 7100 electron microscope. Representative electromicrographs are presented in Animal Study Procedures and Sample Collection All animal procedures were approved by McGill University Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #4481). Twenty-one groups of BALB/c 10-week old female mice were used (5 animals per group). Body weight and signs of toxicity (i.e., fur erection, hunched posture, oily skin, eye secretions, dehydration) were monitored every 2 days throughout the experiment. Table 1 describes the different experimental groups studied. Vaccine formulations contained MV antigens at concentrations of 1, 3, and 6 g per dose, whereas the concentration of IVX908 remained constant at 3 g/dose for all formulations. PBS was used as a diluent for all vaccine formulations. Control groups received IVX908 alone (3 g/dose), MV antigen alone (1, 3, or 6 g/dose), Vero cell protein alone (6 g/dose), IVX908-Vero cell protein (6 g/dose), and vehicle PBS. All vaccines were administered intranasally (IN). Immunizations were performed under isoflurane anesthesia using an automated induction chamber, and 25 l of vaccine were instilled into the nares (12.5 l per nostril) using a pipet gun and sterilized tips. Mice were immunized every 2 weeks on days 1 and 14, and on day 28 for groups receiving a third dose. Mice were bled from the lateral sapheneous vein before every immunization and ten days after the last immunization (day 24 and day 38 for 2 and 3 doses groups, respectively). All doses of IVX908-MV were well tolerated for both primary and booster immunizations. No behavioral changes were noted, and very little fluctuation in weight (\u00b11.0 gram) was observed. Small numbers of animals (<10%) that were immunized intranasally with IVX908 alone or with IVX908-MV had oily fur and hunched posture for up to 5 days following immunization. However, no weight loss was observed in those mice. On terminal days, mice were sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2, after which they were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. Nasal and lung lavages were preformed by making an incision in the trachea and inserting a 12G-catheter (Clear-Cath, Abbott, Ireland), first into the major airways and subsequently into the nasopharynx. For each position, the catheter was fixed by a suture and 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% BSA and a protease inhibitor leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma, St-Louis, Mich.)). Wash fluid was collected by aspiration of the lung lavage or by catching drops from the nostrils. All fluids were stored at 20\u00b0 C. until used. On the terminal day, spleens were aseptically removed and a single-cell suspension was prepared using 70 m Nylon cell strainers (BD Falcon). Splenocytes were resuspended by ELISA Serum and mucosal MV-specific antibody responses were measured by quantitative ELISA. In sera, total IgG and specific IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a) were measured. In nasal and were determined. Round-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, MJS Biolynx, Brockville, ON) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 1 g/ml of whole sonicated MV antigen diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Plates were blocked with 2% skim milk-PBS-T before dilutions of samples in duplicate were added and incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. After washing with PBS-T, secondary labeled antibodies were added for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Secondary antibodies included goat-anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (Pharmingen BD, San Diego, Calif.), goat-anti-mouse-IgG,-HRP, goat-anti-mouse-IgG2a-HRP, and goat-anti-mouse-IgG2b-HRP Birmingham, Ala.). For IgA detection, rat-anti-mouse IgA-Biotin (Pharmingen, BD, San Diego, Calif.) was used as a secondary antibody followed by streptavidin-HRP (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). Assays were completed by the addition of TM Blue substrate (Serologicals Corporation, Norcross, Ga.). Reactions were stopped using 0.2 M sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Oakville, Ontario). Serial dilutions of each sample were measured, and optical density values of the data points falling within the 25%-75% range of the standard curve were chosen to generate the final estimated concentration. The means and standard deviations (S.D.) of optical density values at 450 nm were calculated from an automatic microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). Antibody concentrations in the test samples were calculated from standard curves run on each plate using purified mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Oakville, Ontario) or purified mouse IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Tex.). Values are expressed in ng/ml of specific antibody in serum or in lung/nasal lavage fluid. Seroconversion after immunization with Proteosome-based vaccine was defined as at least a 4-fold rise in antibody titer from pre-vaccination levels. Data presenting total MV-specific IgG present in serum of Balb/c mice that was measured by ELISA on immunization days (1, 14,28) and terminal days (24 or 38) is provided in ELISA results for specific isotype antibodies were performed on serum samples of the terminal bleed of animals that received 3 doses of IVX-908-MV ( Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRN) Assays MV neutralizing antibodies were assessed by plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) assays as previously described (Ward et al., Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 33:147-52 (1999)). Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Falcon, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) to obtain 90-95% confluency. Serum samples were pooled from five animals in each experimental group and heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 40 minutes before use. Serial dilutions of sera were mixed and incubated with low-passage Edmonston MV (25-35 plaque-forming units) for a period of 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Duplicate wells of confluent Vero cells were then infected with 100 l of 2-fold serial dilutions of the sera plus MV mixture. A 16% methylcellulose overlay in Liebovitz's L-15 media (Gibco/Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was applied to infected cells, and the cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 for 4 days. A solution of 4% neutral red was added to stain the monolayers, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours. Cell monolayers were then fixed with 3.7% formalin for 10 minutes. Visible plaques were counted to determine the number of plaque forming units (PFU). Virus alone served as negative control, and human serum from an individual vaccinated with a measles virus vaccine served as a positive control. The PRN value was obtained using the Kaber method to determine the 50% end-point of neutralization. PRN values are expressed as the 10g2 of the reciprocal of serum dilution that reduced the number of plaques by 50%. By way of comparison, seroprotection in humans has been defined as a PRN value >120 (Chen et al., J. Infect. Dis. 162:1036-42 (1990)). PRN values were standardized to antibody concentration. A graphic representation of neutralization activity of serum samples obtained from animals after receiving two doses and three doses of IVX908:MV antigen vaccine is presented in Detection of Anti-H Protein Antibodies in Sera Sera were collected from animals that received 3 doses of IVX908-MV at 6 g per dose with high neutralizing activity and were analyzed by immunoblot to detect antibodies specific for MV antigens. Immunoblot analyses of an MV split antigen (see method of preparation above) using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind H and F MV antigens were also performed. Preparations of MV split antigen, Vero protein, and OMP Proteosome were separated by SDS-PAGE, and an immunoblot of the separated antigens was performed as described above. As shown in Cytokine Detection by ELISPOT In mice, serum IgG, is associated with a TH2-type response, whereas serum IgG2a is associated with a TH1-type response (Maassen et al., Vaccine 21:2751-57 (2003)). Ten days after the last dose of vaccine, spleens were obtained from all mice. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the spleens by processing through a 70 m Nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon) to obtain single cell suspensions. Splenocytes from five animals per experimental group (see Table 1) were pooled. MV-specific stimulation of IFN secretion by (MABTECH, Nacka, Sweden). Splenocytes were cells/well in MultiScreen Immunobilon-P-based 96-well plates (Millipore, Billerica, of anti-IFN monoclonal antibody clone AN-18 diluted in carbonateibicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Splenocytes were stimulated with different concentrations of MV split antigen (0.1 to 10 g) for a period of 72 hours. PHA (5 g/mL) was used as a positive control. Vero protein preparation (10 g/mL) and culture medium were used as negative controls. Results are expressed as spot-forming cells (SFCs)/million splenocytes after subtracting negative control values. Negative controls produced less than 5 spots per well in most experiments (mean=1.3\u00b11.2). Experimental wells were considered positive if more than 5 spots/well were present (>3 SDs above the mean). The mean number of spots induced by the Vero protein preparation alone (negative control values) was subtracted from the mean number of spots induced by different concentrations of MV split antigen, which was normalized to numbers of cytokine spot-forming T-cell subset per 100,000 cells ( Statistical analyses for the experiments in this Example were performed using Instat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.). Means obtained for the different test groups were compared using the Bonferroni multiple comparison ANOVA. In all tests, a p-value<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Example 19 Immune Response in Monkeys Primed with a DNA Vaccine and Boosted with IVX908 This Example describes the immune response in juvenile rhesus macaque monkeys immunized with measles DNA vaccine followed by intranasal boosting immunization with IVX908. All animals in this study were cared for and treated in accordance with procedures and protocols for proper care of research animals. Groups of juvenile rhesus macaques (measles seronegative) received two priming immunizations with a DNA vaccine construct, followed by a boosting immunization with either an attenuated measles vaccine or IVX908-MV. The DNA vaccine constructs included a plasmid comprising DNA that encoded MV H protein (PMSINH) and a bicistronic plasmid comprising DNA that encoded MV H protein and F protein (pMSINH-FdU). The plasmids were prepared according to methods known in the art. A third DNA vaccine, CVD 1208 (pMSIN/HF), with a plasmid that encodes H protein and F protein, according to procedures similar to methods described in Pasetti et al. (J. Virol. 77:5209-17 (2003)). Animals received priming immunizations with a DNA vaccine twice, at day 0 and at Day 28. Each priming dose of pMSINH and pMSINH-FdU was 1 mg total, administered intradermally (i.d.) in 500 g aliquots to two different legs using Biojector\u00ae (Bioject Medical Technologies, Inc., Bedminster, N.J.). CVD 1208 (pMSIN/HF) bacteria were delivered intranasally (i.n.). At Day 59, animals were boosted with either an attenuated measles vaccine (e.g., Schwarz strain or Edmonston strain (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) that is attenuated according to standard protocols), delivered by aerosol according to methods known in the art or with IVX908-MV administered intranasally (i.n.) (50 g total, 25 g per nostril). The boosting immunizations were administered on Day 59. Controls included (1) 2 priming immunizations with PBS followed by a boosting immunization with aerosol delivery of the attenuated measles vaccine; (2) 2 priming immunizations with PBS followed by a boosting immunization with IVX908. An outline of the immunization protocol is presented in Table 2. Serum samples were obtained from the monkeys prior to priming immunizations at Day 7 and at Day 0 (pre-bleeds). Sera were then collected every few days, weeking, or biweekly after the animals received the first priming immunization. The presence of MV antigen specific IgG antibodies in sera was determined by ELISA, which was performed according to standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. MV lysate ((Advanced Biotechnology, Colmbia, Md.). Table 3 presents the fold-increase in anti-MV antigen titer from Day 0 to Day 73 and to Day 91. Measles virus antigen-specific IFN was determined using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the animals according to methods known in the art for fractionating blood. PBMCs were stimulated with MV lysate (Advanced Biotechnology, Colmbia, Md.) (5 g/ml) in nitrocellulose plates that were previously coated with IFN antibodies (Mabtech). Results expressed as the mean number of spot forming cells per 106 PBMCs are presented in Table 4. Sera collected from animals were analyzed for neutralizing activity in a PRN assay, performed according to methods known in the art and described in Example 18. The results for individual monkeys are presented in Table 5. By way of comparison, seroprotection in humans has been defined as a PRN value >120 (Chen et al., J. Infect. Dis. 162:1036-42 (1990)). Seven animals received IVX908-MV and none of the animals exhibited any symptoms that indicated that the IVX908-MV formulation had any toxic or effected any adverse reaction in the animals. Thus, the IVX908-MV measles vaccine was safely administered to animals and induced a specific virus-neutralizing immune response. The capability of the IVX908-MV measles vaccine to prevent animals from manifesting clinical symptoms of a measles infection is determined by challenging the monkeys in the groups as outlined in Table 2 with a strain of measles virus approximately one year after the boosting immunization. The animals are monitored for symptomatology indicating a measles infection and virus load is determined. The humoral immune response, both systemic and mucosal, is determined by methods described herein for measuring immunoglobulin levels in sera and nasal and lung lavages. The cell-mediated response induced in the animals is determined by methods known in the art and described herein.
