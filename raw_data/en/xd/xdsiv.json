Turn to CRISIS SITUATIONS (p213) at the end of the guide.+Dear Parent, Finding someone to take care of your child' s mental health is just as important as finding someone to take care of his or her physical well-being. If your child has abroken bone, you take him or her to an emergency room. But what if he or she is inan emotional crisis? Where do you go? A common complaint that we hear from parents is that they are frustrated with the complexity of the children' s mental healthcare system and the process of navigatingit. We at Bradley Hospital and the Rhode Island Department of Health want to helpsolve this problem and provide accurate and useful information about mentalhealthcare for your child. With the generous support of Hasbro, Inc., we have researchedand produced this \"how-to\" guide for parents on children' s mental health issues. This guide is not meant to diagnose your child. It is meant to be a one-stop resource for all parents\u2014from those who simply have questions about common children' smental health problems, such as ADHD, low self-esteem, or depression, to thosewho are looking for advocacy organizations and support groups to help them withdifficult issues concerning their child' s diagnosis. This guide is written for parents,but it is our hope that family members, community organizations, schools, andhealthcare providers will also use the information in this guide. The mental healthcare system in Rhode Island is complex. This guide maps out all the different parts of the system (both public and private) and how they connect toeach other. We have included warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues;definitions, symptoms, and evaluation and treatment options of common mentalhealth diagnoses; and descriptions of different types of mental healthcare providers,organizations, programs, and services that can help parents. Caring for the mental health needs of your children is our priority. It is our sincere wish that this guide will help children and their families find the answers they needabout mental healthcare and enable them to better access and use the children' s mental healthcare system in Rhode Island.

Information in this guide came from a number of sources. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for the guidance it provided for the content of this guide. We would also like to extend our thanks to Policy Studies Inc. and Chandler Design for their project management, content development, and graphic design services in the development of this guide.Dear Parent, As President of the Parent Association at Bradley Hospital, I know how difficult it is for parents to know where to get services for their children. There is nothing worse thanthe \"helpless\" feeling of not knowing who to go to or what is available to help your child. As a parent of children with mental health issues, I would like to share the story of my family' s journey through the mental healthcare system. I have two children, bothwith a mental health diagnosis, as well as other medical problems. When my firstchild was an infant, my husband and I knew that something just wasn't right. Wewent from one healthcare provider to the next looking for answers, but didn't reallyget any answers other than that we were \"overreacting.\" As an infant, she did nothingbut scream all day and night. She couldn't keep her formula down. As she grew older,she hated being around other people and never left my side. When she went toschool, she was considered the ideal student, working hard and wanting all of herwork to be perfect. But her anxiety was through the roof and so was ours. Finally, at age 7, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for the first time. She had completely shut down. After a long hospital stay, she was diagnosed with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder and was put on medication. Where couldwe turn? We were in a whirlwind. We were supposed to go on with our lives, but ourlives as we had known them had changed forever. She was hospitalized again at age 8and this time we were told that she had Asperger' s Disorder (a form of Autism). Thehospitalizations continued and continued. She was finally admitted to Bradley Hospital. The day we decided to go to one of Bradley' s support groups was a turning point in our lives. We got lots of information and support from other parents. We were all atdifferent points in getting care for our children, but we were able to pool all of ourinformation regarding school placements, treatments, support agencies, programs,etc. Through the years, diagnoses have changed, parents have changed, and mentalhealth services have changed, but the one thing that has been constant is thesupport we've received from doctors, social workers, and staff at Bradley and otherparents in the support group. When we had others to listen and support us, we knew that we could handle any challenge that came our way. We've been though a lot of difficult times over the years, but our lives have been better because we have had information. Information has empowered us on ourjourney through the mental heath care \"maze.\" The new Rhode Island Parents' Guide to Children's Mental Health puts all that information for parents in one place. We are so excited to have this guide for parents. We are looking forward to using the guide tohelp us maneuver through the next phase of our mental health challenges!

Navigating through it can be difficult,time consuming, and stressful. But this guide can help. The guide' s sections are arranged to follow the steps a parent would take to get help for his or her child\u2014from the first moment you notice something is \"not quiteright,\" to the options for paying for mental healthcare, and every step in between. Of course, every parent, child, and situation is different and will enter the mental healthcare system at a different point. Because of this, the guide hascross-references(sections refer you toother sections for moreinformation or nextsteps). So no matterwhere you start in theprocess, you will beable to find theinformation you need.11 1 This guide uses the term \"parent\" to describe any person who nurtures and raises a child. A parentcould to a biological parent, an adoptive parent, afoster parent, a grandparent, an uncle or aunt, asister or brother, or any other caregiver or guardian. The guide also uses the terms \"child\" or \"children\" to describe a child or children, birth to age 21.However, in certain sections, the guide uses morespecific terms to describe when something mightoccur in a child's life.These terms include:wInfants: birth to age 1 wToddlers (or toddlerhood): ages 1 to 3 wYounger children (or early childhood):birth to age 5 wOlder children: ages 6 to 12 wAdolescents (or adolescence): ages 13 to 212 Getting Help for Your Child Follow along with the flowchart on pages 4 and 5 to see how the mental healthcare system works. If you think your child may havea mental health issue, the first question you should ask is whetheror not he or she is in crisis. If your child is in crisis, it means he orshe is at high risk of causing harm to self or others or is completelynot able to function. If you believe your child is in crisis, then youneed to seek help immediately. Turn to CRISIS SITUATIONS (p213) at the end of the guide. If your child is not in crisis, but you still think that he or she may have a mental health issue, then start to keep track of your child' ssigns and symptoms and make an appointment with your child' spediatrician. At this point, it may also be helpful to contact yourchild' s school and let them know that you are concerned aboutyour child' s mental health. It is important to begin communicatingwith your child' s school in order to ensure your child is receivingthe best care possible. If your child' s pediatrician determines that your child' s signs and symptoms are not a part of normal child development, then he or she will suggest getting your child evaluated. In some cases,a pediatrician can do an initial screening. However, in most cases,a pediatrician will refer your child to a mental health specialist. If your child' s pediatrician determines that your child' s signs and symptoms are a part of normal child development, but you are still concerned about your child' s mental health, then you should talkto your child' s pediatrician about your options. Consider getting your child evaluated by a mental health specialist. Also, consider seeking a second opinion. Getting a second opinion means thatyou make an appointment with a different pediatrician or mentalhealth specialist to evaluate your child' s mental health. If thischange in behavior does turn out to be a part of normal childdevelopment, you can still seek additional support and build your parenting knowledge to help your child through this stage. After your child receives an evaluation, it is possible that your childmay be diagnosed with a mental illness. A diagnosis will usuallylead to suggested treatment. Learn all you can about your child' s diagnosis and treatment plan. At this point, a number of different mental health providers are likely to be introduced into your child' slife. You will have to become your child' s advocate. Treatment can2 This guide is also available online atwww.childrensmentalhealthguideri.org3 Defining mental health MENTAL HEAL TH is a sign of a child's overall emotional well-being. Mental health can be difficult tounderstand, because it can berelated to medical, social, or behavioral issues that a child may have. In general, mental health refers to a child's ability to: Adapt well to his or her environment in ways that are healthy; and Cope well with day-to-day stresses, problems, and challenges. When children are not comfortable with how they are feeling, do not have good coping skills, and cannot get along with others, it is possible that they could have a mentalhealth issue.A MENTAL HEAL TH ISSUE impacts a child's emotional well- being. An issue could develop fromdealing with a bully at school or theloss of a loved one. It could be a short-term problem or long-term mental illness. MENTAL ILLNESSES are medical conditions that can disrupt a child's mood, thinking, feelings, and abilityto interact with and relate to others in his or her life. These disruptions can be emotional changes, behavioral changes, or both. For the majority of children, a change in mood, feelings, and behavior is a natural part of child development. However, when these changes begin to impact a child's ability to function on a daily basis, a mental illness may be the cause of these changes. If this is the case, thechild may need mental healthcare.THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEAL THCARE SYSTEM is made up of all the providers, hospitals and health centers, early childhoodprograms, the school system, stateagencies, community and non-profitorganizations, and health insurancecompanies available to addressmental health issues. A mentalhealthcare provider is the person incharge of providing mentalhealthcare for your child. A MENTAL HEAL THCARE PROVIDER can be a pediatrician, a mental health specialist, or a school professional. Each child's situation isdifferent.include working with mental health specialists, hospitals and health centers, early childhood programs, the school system, stateagencies, community and non-profit organizations, health insurance care managers, or a combination of the all of these. Youwill also need to figure out ways to pay for your child' s care. Hopefully, once your child begins treatment, you will see improvement in him or her. If you dosee an improvement, continue with the treatment plan. If you do not see an improvement in your child, then talk to your child' s mental healthcare providers. You may need arevised treatment plan to help manage any symptoms that continue.Remember, it can take time before you see a change. Be patient.If this revised plan still does not improve your child' s signs andsymptoms, then you should talk to your child' s mental healthcareproviders or seek a second opinion to re-evaluate your child' s situation. These are the basics of how to navigate the mental healthcare system. The rest of the guide will describe each of the steps mentioned above. Use the flowchart on the following pages, as well as the T able ofContents and color-coded tabs, to find your way around the guide. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES (p165) ,ACRONYMS (p205) , and TOPIC INDEX (p209) , can also be very helpful.

Symptomclusters can be thought of as different categories ofmental health issues. The following section outlines different symptom clusters, describes typical signs and symptoms, and lists possible diagnoses. This section is not meantto diagnose your child. Many of the signs and symptoms described in thefollowing symptom clusters are also a normal part of child development.However, if the symptom begins to affect your child' s daily life in school, withfamily, or with friends, it may be a sign of a mental health issue. If your childis showing signs or symptoms of a mental health issue, talk to your child' spediatrician. Distinguishing between normal child development and amental health issue is difficult. Your child' s pediatrician can help.27 7 TIP If your child's behavior concerns you, write down how he or she acts each day\u2014specific signs orsymptoms, how often they happen, in what contextthey happen, when you first noticed them, andany other concerns you have. This will be a bighelp when you talk to your child's pediatrician ormental health specialist. It is also a good habit toget into for the future. If your child is diagnosedwith a mental illness, your records can be veryhelpful in charting his or her symptoms and responseto treatment over time.Knowing when to seek help for your child If you suspect that your child has a mental health issue, it may be hard to know when to seek help. If your child has some of the following symptoms, it may be time to talk to your child's pediatrician about your child's symptoms: Extreme anxiety or worry Constant hyperactivity Appearing distracted when others try to interact with him or her Constant nightmares Frequent anger, aggression, or disobedience Constant temper tantrums that cannot be explained Significant changes in eating or sleeping habits Significant change in performance at school Inability to handle daily stresses or problems Constant complaining about physical problems (for example, stomachaches or headaches) Acting withdrawn or depressed Alcohol or drug abuse Self-injurious behaviorsEarly Child Development Issues Even though all children go through the same development stages, every child goes through those stages at his or her own pace. Somechildren develop quickly and others at a slower pace. Sometimes,those children who develop at a slower pace may catch up withother children their age. However, in some cases, there may be adelay in development. A developmental delay occurs when a childdoes not develop basic skills (for example, walking or talking) by a certain age. If you feel there is an extremedifference between thesocial, emotional, ormotor skills developmentof your child and otherchildren of the same age,then it is possible he orshe may have a mentalhealth issue. TIP Check in with your childcare provider about your child's development.As the provider spends a goodamount of time interacting withyour child, he or she may be thefirst to notice if your child isbehind other children his or her agein terms of development.8 When a young child is suffering from a mental health issue, he orshe may not be able to communicatehis or her feelings to you in a waythat you understand. Luckily, youngchildren are good at showing theirparents when they are in a healthystate\u2014they are curious, enchanting,persistent, and confident. Whenyoung children are in an unhealthystate, they can be listless, distracted,aggressive, or insecure.The information on the following pages can help you compare your child' s development with other children his or her age. It can alsohelp you identify any symptoms that may be a cause for concern. A mental health issue in a young child means that he or she is unable to experience, regulate, and express emotionsappropriately; form close relationships with his or her caregivers;explore and act on his or her environment; and learn. Possible mental health diagnoses within this symptom cluster include: Autism Spectrum Disorders (Pervasive Developmental Disorders) (p54) Feeding Disorders (p72) Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) (p86)9 RESOURCES Early Childhood Institute at The Providence Center 401-276-4020 www.providencecenter.org Learn the Signs. Act Early. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Campaign) www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/actearly Zero to Three www.zerotothree.orgUnderstanding your child's temperament Every child is born with a certain temp- erament. Temperament is a manner ofthinking, behaving, or reacting that is characteristic of a certain child. Temperaments are based on a child's biological make upand are the genetic aspects of a child'spersonality (nature rather than nurture). There are three types of child temperaments that most children fall in to: THE EASY CHILD readily adapts to new experiences, generally displays positivemoods and emotions, and has normaleating and sleeping patterns. THE DIFFICUL T CHILD tends to be very emotional, irritable, and fussy and cries alot. The difficult child also tends to haveirregular eating and sleeping patterns. THE SLOW-TO-WARM-UP CHILD has a low activity level and tends to withdrawfrom new situations and people. Theslow-to-warm-up child is slow to adapt to new experiences, but then slowlyaccepts them after repeated exposure. Understanding your child's temperamentcan help you understand your child'sbehaviors and anticipate his or herreactions to different situations.Temperament is not an excuse for achild's misbehavior, but it does providedirection for how you as a parent canrespond to misbehavior. It can help you guide and teach your child in a way that respects the child's individual differences. In addition, it may be helpful to look at your own temperament. Some \"behavioralproblems\" actually stem from a mismatchbetween a parent's temperament and achild's. For example, a highly active childmay irritate a slow-paced parent.10The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all childrenget a developmental screening.A developmental screening tells ifa child is learning basic skills whenhe or she should be. During thescreening, your child's pediatriciancarefully watches as your child plays,talks, moves, and interacts withothers. When a developmentalproblem is recognized early, childrencan get the help they need to grow,learn, and reach their full potential. Birth to Children are working hard to observe and interact with their world. Six Months They are learning to comfort themselves, sleep at regular times,let their caregivers know when they need something, and adjust tofamily routines.

This is especially true for youngchildren. Parents should expect to see their children exhibit thesebehaviors at some point during normal child development.However, when symptoms of overactivity and inattentivenessbegin to appear on a regular basis, occur in more than one setting,and interfere with a child' s schoolwork and interactions withfamily, friends, and teachers, then it is possible he or she may havea mental health issue. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of overactivity and inattentiveness. Your child may be overactive if he or she: Fidgets or squirms in his or her seat and cannot sit still Cannot stay seated for long periods of time Runs around, jumps, or climbs on things in situations where it is not appropriate Has difficulty playing quietly Is in constant motion or acts like he or she is being \"driven by a motor\" T alks too much Blurts out answers before questions have been completed Has difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupts others during conversations or games Your child may be inattentive if he or she: Has a hard time paying attention or daydreams a lot Does not seem to be listening when you or others are talking Is easily distracted from schoolwork or play Makes careless mistakes and does not appear to care about details Does not follow through with instructions and has a hard time finishing tasks Is disorganized with activities and tasks at home or school Loses important things easily14 Being overactive orinattentive means thata child has a difficulttime his orher energy level,paying attention forlong periods of time,or following directions.

As a parent, you have an incredibleamount of influence over your child's levelof self-esteem. The following are somehelpful tips to develop positive self-esteemin your child. Have realistic expectations of your child. If your child is able to achieve what you expect, then he or she will feel successful. Make your child feel special and appreciated. Set aside time each week for you andyour child to spend alone together. Emphasize your child's strengths. Make a list of your child's strengths and usedifferent opportunities to point out his orher abilities. For example, if your childis a good artist, display his or her artwork. Let your child help you with activities, such as cooking, chores, or wrapping presents for others. This is a great opportunity to demonstrate that he or she is helpful and can help others. It is also a nice time to point out his or her strengths! Try to focus on the positive behaviors and acknowledge them. Avoid negative comments. Instead, frame feedback in apositive way. Try not to compare siblings. Instead, highlight the strengths of each child equally. Help your child develop problem-solving skills. As a child becomes better at finding solutions to problems, his or her confidenceincreases.Extreme Anger or Irritability All children show signs of anger or are irritable at different points throughout child development. These behaviors are a part of achild' s exploration of how to express his or her emotions to others.However, if these behaviors begin to impact his or her dailyinteractions with peers and family members, or if the child orother people are getting hurt, then it is possible that an underlyingmental health issue is the cause. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of extreme anger or irritability. Your child may be extremely angry or irritableif he or she: Often kicks, hits, or bites Has explosive tantrums Acts aggressive toward other children, adults, or objects Gets easily frustrated Misunderstands other people' s expressions, words or actions.

Some level of rebellion is anatural part of child development and is the child' s way ofexpressing his or her opinions. However, when a child is regularlydefying the instructions and orders of authority figures (resultingin detentions, suspensions, or legal problems), then he or she mayhave a mental health issue. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of extreme defiance.

Friendships are an important aspect of a child's development and can be very rewarding. Theserelationships should be encouraged so that your child grows up with a network of peers who support him or her. However, there are instances where peer relationships can have a negative impact on a child's development. Bullying is one such instance. Unfortunately, bullying is a common occurrence during the school-age years. WHAT IS BULL YING? Bullying is a way for one child to intimidate or harass another. Bullying can be physical orverbal. Bullying can also occur through the Internet. HOW CAN BULL YING AFFECT CHILDREN? If a child is bullied, it can affect his or her social and emotional development to varyingdegrees. Sometimes it can affect a child's schoolwork. WHY DO CHILDREN BULL Y OTHER CHILDREN? Most children who are bullies need to feel a sense of control or domination over others.Bullying can be a way for children to deal with depression, anger, or events happening inschool or at home. In some cases these children have been victims of abuse or have beenbullied by other children. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU SUSPECT YOUR CHILD IS BEING BULLIED? The most important thing you can do is to give your child opportunities to talk to youopenly and honestly about what is going on. Reassure your child that what is going on isnot his or her fault and that telling you about the situation was the right thing to do.Talk to your child about what he or she has already tried, what has worked and what hasnot, and what he or she thinks should be done. In addition, you should seek help from your child's school. Most of the time, bullying occurs in school and it is important that the school is aware of the problem. Most Rhode Island schools have a bullying policy. Find out what the policy is at your child's school andwhat resources are available to help you and your child deal with the problem. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU SUSPECT YOUR CHILD IS BULL YING OTHERS? It is possible that a child who is bullying others may begin to have social, emotional, legal, or school problems.

TIP Get involved at your child's school. The more involved you are, the more likely you will know who to turn to if your child needs help.Speech and Language Problems Children develop speech and language skills at different speeds. Although the stages that children pass through are the same, theexact age when they achieve speech and language milestones canvary quite a bit. If you think your child is not communicating wellfor his or her age, it may be that your child is just moving at his orher own pace through the developmental stages. However, if youthink that your child is significantly behind, then your child mayhave an underlying mental health issue. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of a speech and language problem. Your child may have a speech and languageproblem if he or she has trouble: T alking clearly enough to be understood outside the family Understanding others Following directions Reading or writing Answering questions Expressing thoughts and ideas in a clear manner using appropriate vocabulary and grammar Using language for engaging in a variety of social interactions with family or friends or in school Possible mental health diagnoses within this symptom clusterinclude: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (p52) Autism Spectrum Disorders (Pervasive Developmental Disorders) (p54) Learning Disorders (p75) Speech and Language Disorders (p90)TIP If you think that your child has a communication problem, don't delayseeking help. Talk to your child'spediatrician and request a referral for a speech-language pathologist.20Helping your child develop speech and language skills HERE ARE A FEW GENERAL TIPS YOU CAN USE AT HOME: Spend a lot of time communicating with your child, even during infancy. Talk, sing, and encourage imitation of sounds and gestures. Read to your child, starting as early as 6 months. You don't have to finish a whole book, but look for age-appropriate soft or board books or picture books that encourage your child to look while you name the pictures. As your child gets older, let him or her point to recognizable pictures and try to name them. Then move on to nursery rhymes, which have rhythmic appeal. Then move on to predictable books, in which your child can anticipate what happens. Use everyday situations to reinforce your child's speech and language skills. In other words, talk your way through the day. For example, name foods at the grocery store, explain what you're doing as you cook a meal or clean a room, point out objects around the house, and point out sounds you hear as you drive. Ask questions and acknowledgeyour child's responses, even when they're hard to understand. 21Drug or Alcohol Use Some children experiment with drugs or alcohol during adolescence, or even earlier. For some children, this behavior becomes a problemand interferes with their activities and health. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms that your child may be using drugs or alcohol. Your child may be using thesesubstances if he or she: Is often tired and irritable Has red and glazed eyes Develops a persistent cough Shows a significant change in personality and mood Begins to behave irresponsibly Develops low self-esteem Exercises poor judgment Is depressed and has a general lack of interest in activities Starts arguments with family members more often Breaks parent rules Develops an overall negative attitude about school Is performing poorly at school and has increased absences Begins to have discipline problems at school Has friends who are not interested in school Begins to have problems with the law Drug or alcohol use may also be a sign of other mental health issues. Some children use substances as a way to control mentalhealth symptoms\u2014a form of self-medicating without the use of(and sometimes the stigma of ) prescription medications. Other children use substances because of a lack of self-esteem or because they do not feel like they fit in or are a part of their community. Ifyou think that your child may have a problem with drugs or alcohol, you may need to think about other mental health issues as well. Possible mental health diagnoses within this symptom cluster include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (p52) Bipolar Disorder (p59) Depression (p67) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (p84) Substance Abuse and Dependence (p94)22 Children who areusing drugs or alcoholon a regular basis maygo to great lengths tohide it from theirparents. TIP Some children are at a higher risk for using drugs and alcohol because of a family history of these types of problems. If your child is at a higher risk for using drugs or alcohol, it is important that you talk to him orher about drugs and alcohol. It is also important to talk about drugs and alcohol with your children even if they are not high risk or do not show any signs or symptoms.Extreme Anxiety or Fear Most children have occasional worries or fears as they grow and develop. As a parent, you have most likely calmed a frightenedchild after a nightmare or had to dispel worries about monstershiding under the bed. All of these childhood experiences arenormal and common. However, when a child continually showssigns of extreme anxiety or fear, then it is possible that anunderlying mental health issue is the cause of the child' s symptoms. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of extreme anxiety and fear. Your child may have extreme fear or anxiety if he or she: Worries about things before they happen Constantly worries about family, school, friends, or activities Feels shaky, restless, or tired Has shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, or cold, sweaty hands Complains of stomach pain, headache, or dizziness Seems irritable and has difficulty concentrating or falling asleep Feels very nervous Feels as though every situation will end badly Speaks of feeling helpless or powerless Has trouble sleeping alone and has nighttime fears or nightmares Resists going to school Argues with others and often stirs up conflict Has a fear of embarrassment or making a mistake Has low self-esteem and lacks confidence Engages in rituals or habits. For example: \u00bb Washes hands until the skin is chapped\u00bb Spends a lot of time putting things in order and feels distressed if the order is disrupted \u00bb Checks doors or locks multiple times \u00bb Does things a certain number of times and feels distressed if it is not the right number. Starts acting younger than his or her age. Some examples of behaviors include bed-wetting, clingy behavior, thumb-sucking,and sharing a bed with a parent. Possible mental health diagnoses within this symptom cluster include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) (p62) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (p84)23 Extreme anxiety is when a child is overlytense or uptight. Extremefear can be a result ofthis intense anxiety. Getting your child to sleep Practically every parent has had a hard time getting his or her child to go to bed, to stay there, and to sleep through the night. For children with mental health issues, sleepproblems can be even more common and have a greater impact on their well-being.A regular sleep schedule is essential for successful treatment of mental health issues andfor a child's overall health, both mental and physical. COMMON STRUGGLES INCLUDE: Establishing a consistent bedtime routine Managing a child's tantrums once he or she is in bed Dealing with a child who wakes up repeatedly during the night Getting a child to sleep through the night in his or her own bed HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR SUCCESS: 1.

Turn off the television or remove the television from your child's bedroom.4. Restrict drinks, especially caffeinated beverages, in the evening. Do not let your child take a bottle or sippy cup to bed. 5. Offer your child a \"transitional object\" for bedtime. A transitional object is something that lets him or her know it is time for bed, such as a favorite blanket, stuffed animal, or toy. 6. Comfort your child for a minute or so before leaving the room, but remember you want him or her to learn to put himself or herself to sleep. 7. End your child's bedtime routine with your child in bed, although not necessarily asleep. 8. Expect that your child will go to sleep\u2014do not play or have a conversation with your child after you say good night. If your child gets out of bed, calmly return your child tobed and say, \"It's time to sleep.\" If you must return to comfort your child, interact aslittle as possible. 9. Reward progress! It is helpful to talk with your child's pediatrician about setting effectivesleep routines that work best for your child.

Extreme Sadness and Despair Most children exhibit changes in their mood as they develop and grow. \"Mood swings\" are a normal part of childhood. However, if achild displays sadness for weeks at a time, these emotions do notappear to be going away, and they interfere with the child' s abilityto function on a daily basis, then it could be a sign of a mentalhealth issue.

Monitoringyour child's mood and behaviorafter a trauma is important becausewitnessing a trauma may leadto the development of differentmental health issues. Problems after a Traumatic Event It is normal for children to have an emotional or physical response to a traumatic event. Examples of traumatic events includeemotional, physical, or sexual abuse, violence, accidents, naturaldisasters, severe physical injuries, and life-threatening illnesses. Children' s reactions to an event can vary, and some reactions are more severe than others. If a child' s reaction to a traumatic eventbecomes very intense, lasts for a long time, and impacts his or herability to function, he or she may have a mental health issue. The following is a list of typical signs and symptoms of a problem after a traumatic event. Your child may have a problem after atraumatic event if he or she: Refuses to return to school Clings to parents or other family members Has persistent fears related to the traumatic event Has nightmares, screams during his or her sleep, or wets the bed Loses concentration Is increasingly irritable Is easily startled and jumpy Begins to have behavior problems at home and school that are not typical for him or her Complains of stomachaches, headaches, or dizziness with no known physical cause Withdraws from friends and family Is extremely sad and listless Is less interested in activities he or she enjoys Is preoccupied with the details of the event Starts acting younger than his or her age.

Children can react and possibly develop mental health issues from witnessing or being threatened by a traumatic event.27Talking with your child after a traumatic event If your child has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, it is important for you to talk to your child about what happened and how it makes him or her feel. Encouraging other family members to talk to your child and support him or her through this difficult time is also important. Parents' support and understanding can make a big difference in a child'sability to deal with the event. TIPS FOR TALKING WITH YOUR CHILD AND DEALING WITH THE EVENT: Keep your interactions with your child brief until you've had a chance to collect yourself. Be honest with your child. Let them know that they are safe, but that you need time togather your thoughts. Talk about the facts. However, don't assume that children, especially those under age 8 or 9, will really understand the facts about the traumatic event. They need you to put the facts into perspective. Let young children know that they, as well as their family members, are safe. With older children and adolescents, answer their questions about safety in more detail. Limit the amount of exposure to media images of the event. Parents can help by watching television with theirchildren. Keep up with your family's usual schedule (for example, take your kids to basketball practice as usual). Schedule a formal family meeting to discuss the facts and feelings in a calm, orderly fashion. Use your family traditions, beliefs, and religious practices, as well as your extended support network, assources of strength and as ways to find meaning andcomfort. Follow your child's lead for providing more information or talking about the traumatic event. Your child mayneed to discuss his or her thoughts on many occasions. Answer his or her questions honestly. Check in with your child and let him or her know you are available to talk. Talk to your child's pediatrician if your child shows prolonged signs of stress. Although a certain amount of anxiety is to be expected, prolonged reactions may be a sign that your child needs mental healthcare.Children pick up on attitudes and feelingsof their parents, sop a r e n t sn e e dt og e tsupport. Talk to otheradults on an ongoingbasis to sort out yourown feelings of anxietyand uncertainty.

Psychosis The word \"psychosis\" is used to describe a situation where a child loses touch with reality. Psychosis is very rare in children. It isnormal for children to go through a stage where they cannot tellthe difference between what is real and what is pretend.

T alk to your child' s pediatrician about your child' ssymptoms.31 Talking to Your Child's Pediatrician Your child' s pediatrician is often the first person you will call if you think your child has a mentalhealth issue. Your child' s pediatrician is the main medical doctor you take your child to for healthcare. Pediatricians help to ensure that your child is healthyby providing advice and care around growth and development, illnesses,immunizations, nutrition, injuries, and physical fitness. Pediatricians willalso monitor your child' s behavior and emotions, including issues aroundhis or her social and family life, schooling, and learning abilities. This section outlines the role of pediatricians in the mental healthcare system, including how they evaluate your child' s mental health and whatservices they offer, and providesresources for helping you find apediatrician. The section also explainsthe limitations of pediatricians whenit comes to mental healthcare for yourchild and the importance of gettingreferrals to mental health specialists.333 33 The guide uses the term \"pediatrician\" to refer to a child'sprimary healthcare provider.This is true for most children.However, for some children,their primary healthcare providermay be a family practice doctor.The information provided aboutpediatricians in this section andthroughout the guide applies tofamily practice doctors as well.TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS Your child' s pediatrician provides general medical care and focuses on your child' s overall health. There are also pediatricianswho have additional training in child development calledDevelopmental Behavioral Pediatricians (p106). Other medical doctors for children are specialists. Specialists focus on certain areas of the body, such as the brain, hearing, speech, ordigestive system. Pediatricians refer children to specialists if theyhave specific conditions that require more focused evaluationsand treatments. For example, a pediatrician may refer a child to agastroenterologist (p107) if he or she has a feeding problem. For more information on mental health specialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . EVALUATIONS Pediatricians use different methods to evaluate your child' s mentalhealth. Your child' s pediatrician may ask you or your childquestions about his or her behavior and emotions to ensure thatyour child is reaching typical development milestones and is inoverall good health. Sometimes the pediatrician will ask aboutyour child' s interactions with family and friends or your child' sbehavior at school to find out if there are any warning signs ofmental health issues. The pediatrician may use screeningchecklists or forms with questions. These tests help to suggest orrule out possible mental health issues. The pediatrician can rule out medical conditions that sometimes have similar symptoms tomental health issues. If the pediatrician believes your child mayhave a mental health issue, the pediatrician will refer you to amental health specialist for an evaluation. For more information,turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .34SERVICES OFFERED Some pediatricians evaluate and diagnose mental illnesses and can prescribe medications to treat them. However, mostpediatricians are not trained to be the primary source for yourchild' s mental healthcare. After initially screening your child, mostpediatricians will refer you to mental health specialists orcommunity programs for evaluation, diagnosis, support, andtreatment. For more information on mental health specialists,community programs, and other parts of the mental healthcaresystem, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT (p101) . HOW PEDIATRICIANS WORK WITHIN THE MENTAL HEAL THCARE SYSTEM Your child' s pediatrician plays an ongoing role in your child' s mental healthcare. He or she can work with your child' s mentalhealth specialists, the school system, and community programs toensure that your child' s care and environment support overallhealth. If your child' s mental health specialist prescribesmedication, your child' s pediatrician can make sure it does notinteract with other medications your child may take for physicalconditions. Mental health issues can also affect a child' s physicalhealth. For example, a child who is depressed or anxious may loseor gain weight, have physical symptoms (headaches orstomachaches), or be losing sleep. Pediatricians can monitor theserisks and treat physical conditions if needed.35 TIP Follow your instincts. If you know in your heart something is wrong, don't take \"he'll be fine\" from anyone. If you're not comfortable with a mental healthcare provider, diagnosis, or treatment, get second (or third or fourth...) opinion. Find someone who will listen to you.LIMITATIONS Although some pediatricians are well trained in mental health issues, some are less familiar with mental health diagnoses or treatment.Some pediatricians may not have a wide range of knowledgeabout available mental health specialists or programs for referral.Also, pediatricians usually have limited time during yearlyappointments to fully evaluate children' s mental health issues. Despite these limitations, a pediatrician is an important first point of contact with the mental healthcare system because of his or herfamiliarity with your child and your child' s overall medical care.However, because of these limitations, it is important for parents toget referrals for mental health evaluations and treatment. RESOURCES T o find a pediatrician or family practice doctor, visit: AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS: www.aap.org AMERCIAN ACADEMY OF FAMIL Y PHYSICIANS: http://familydoctor.org36 37 Cultural considerations Not everyone is familiar with the idea of seeking help from a mentalhealthcare provider for a child'smental health issues. Instead, familieswho have come to the United Statesrecently may reach out to olderfamily members, religious orcommunity leaders, or healers. These people share the same race, speak the same language, or share thesame ethnic or religious traditions. Families may be uncomfortable witha mental healthcare system that does not seem personal or sensitive totheir unique cultural experiences. While it is possible to find a mental healthcare provider who shares yourethnicity, race, or religious traditions,such providers are in limited supply.A provider who is of a different raceor ethnicity than your family may askyou questions to find out if you arecomfortable with the differences. Ifthese questions do not make sense toyou, let the provider know how youfeel. Ask the provider to explain whythis information is helpful in working with you and your family. A provider should understand the importance of honoring the family's belief system about how children are expected to grow up. It is important to tell the provider how parenting is done in your family and to shareyour views of child development. For example, some families value obedience and respect very highly and are less comfortable whenchildren are invited to express theirfeelings directly to adults. Otherfamilies have strong ideas about thedifferences between male andfemale development. Children offamilies that are new to this countryoften feel torn between what friendsat school expect and what elders athome require. Sometimes this creates distress and conflict. Mentalhealthcare providers can help withthis issue. In many families, extended family members are very strong influencesin children's lives. Remember to letthe provider know about all of thepeople in your family who help makedecisions about your children andwho should speak for the family,especially if these people can't be inthe meeting (for example, fathers orgrandmothers).

If a child is experiencingcertain symptoms, a mental healthcare provider canevaluate the child and figure out if he or she has amental health issue. Sometimes the symptoms are justpart of normal child development. Sometimes they arenot and the child is diagnosed with a mental illness. The following section explains some of the most common mental health diagnoses in children. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but ratheran introduction to the common types of diagnoses. The diagnoses are listedin alphabetical order. Each diagnosis provides a definition of the illness,describes common signs and symptoms, explains how the illness isdiagnosed, lists typical co-existing diagnoses, introduces possible treatmentoptions, and provides a few resources specific to that illness. If you think that your child may have one of these illnesses, it is important that you first contact your child' s pediatrician.

Anxiety disorders can range from mild to severe. The different types of anxiety disorders in children include: GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER: With this disorder, a child has a significant amount of worry and anxiety about a varietyof situations. This anxiety is hard to control. Children with thisdisorder are often described as \"worriers.\" They have physicalsymptoms of anxiety, such as easily tired, sleep problems,muscle tension, upset stomach, acting \"edgy,\" and irritability.Their worrying interferes with their functioning in social andschool settings or in other daily activities. PANIC DISORDER: With this disorder, a child has repeated periods of intense fear or discomfort, along with othersymptoms, such as a racing heartbeat or shortness of breath.These periods are called \"panic attacks\" and can last anywherefrom a few minutes to a few hours. Panic attacks often developwithout a known cause or without warning and can interferewith your child' s relationships, schoolwork, and development. SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER: With this disorder, a child worries excessively about his or her primary caregiver. Thiscan lead to not wanting to go to school or socialize outside ofthe home, having nightmares and worrying about losing theirprimary caregiver, being unable to sleep alone, and havingsignificant physical symptoms when separated or anticipatingseparation from their primary caregiver. Separation anxiety is anormal part of infancy and early toddlerhood. If it returns afterthis development stage, however, it is considered a disorder. SOCIAL PHOBIA: With this disorder, a child has a significant fear of social or performance situations, fearing that he or she willhumiliate or embarrass himself or herself. For children, thisleads to anxiety around other kids, not just around adults. Theanxiety or fear leads to problems with functioning in social andTIP If your child has been diagnosed with a mental illness, it is importantthat you get as much informationas you can. Check out the resourceslisted at the end of each diagnosislisting and investigate optionsfor support and treatment.49 Diagnosing mental illnesses in children For some mental illnesses, such as bipolar disorder or ADHD, your child has to show a certain number of signs and symptoms to be diagnosed. When talking to a mentalhealthcare provider about your child's illne ss, ask what the clinical criteria are for specific diagnoses. Usually mental healthcare providers diagnose a mental illness based on thecriteria described in the DSM-IV. DSM-IV stands for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,Version 4. It is a handbook about mental health illnesses that h elps all doctors use a common language when talking about mental health. The handbook d escribes different diagnoses and lists the different symptoms for each one. Mental illnesses can be difficult to d iagnose in children for a many reasons, including: Mental illnesses can be diagnosed at different points in a child's development, depending on the nature and characteristics of the illness. Many illnesses have similar signs and symptoms, and it can take time to get a correct diagnosis. Many of the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses are also a part of normal child development. Distinguishing between a mental illness and normal child development can be hard when a child first starts to show signs and symptoms. Some mental illnesses happen together. A child has co-existing disorders when he or she has two or more mental illnesses at once.school settings or in other daily activities. Children with this disorder are often seen by others as \"shy.\" SPECIFIC PHOBIA: With this disorder, a child excessively worries about a particular object or situation (for example, flying,spiders, or heights). In addition, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (p80) and PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (p84) are also considered anxietydisorders. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of anxiety disorders include: Intense fear (a sense that something terrible is happening or going to happen) Racing or pounding heartbeat Dizziness or lightheadedness Shortness of breath or a feeling of being unable to breathe Trembling or shaking Feelings of disconnection and confusion about reality Fear of dying, losing control, or losing his or her mind EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Anxiety disorders can lead to complications for your child if notrecognized and treated appropriately. Anxiety disorders can bediagnosed anytime in childhood or adolescence. If you think yourchild has an anxiety disorder, your child may need a comprehensivepsychiatric evaluation or psychotherapy evaluation. For moreinformation, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Many children with one anxiety disorder will end up having morethan one anxiety disorder. Common mental health diagnoses thatco-exist with anxiety disorders include: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity varietyof forms other thanclassic (OCD) (p80) (ODD) (p82) Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (p84) Speech and Language Disorders (p90) Substance Abuse and Dependence (p94) TREATMENT A psychotherapist or a child and adolescent psychiatrist can treatanxiety disorders.

While allchildren may show signs of inattention, distractibility, impulsivity,or hyperactivity at times, a child with ADHD shows these signsmore frequently and severely than other children of the same ageor developmental level. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of ADHD include: Trouble paying attention Making careless mistakes and not paying attention to details Easily distracted Losing school supplies and forgetting to turn in homework Trouble finishing class work and homework Trouble listening Trouble following multiple adult commands (directions or instructions) Blurting out answers Impatience Fidgeting or squirming Leaving seat and running about or climbing excessively Seeming \"on the go\" T alking too much and difficulty playing quietly Interrupting or intruding on others EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Signs and symptoms of ADHD are often recognized by the schoolsystem because the child' s behavior frequently interrupts andcauses trouble in the classroom. ADHD usually begins and isdiagnosed before age 7 and can continue to affect the child through to adulthood. If you think your child has ADHD, your childmay need an ADHD evaluation.

ADHD and ADD These two diagnoses are often lumped together because they are very similar.ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) is likeADHD, without the \"H\" which stands forHyperactivity. Children diagnosed withADD have symptoms of inattention and distractibility, without the impulsivity andhyperactivity that characterize children with ADHD. Children with ADD tend to be quieter. Their minds may be constantly\"on the move\", but they may not show it. Instead, they tend to daydream more. Because the child's behavior is oftentimes less disruptive, ADD is often a difficult diagnosis to make. ADD tends to be more common in girls.52TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist with ADHD include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Bipolar Disorder (p59) Conduct Disorder (p64) Depression (p67) Learning Disorders (p75) Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) (p82) Substance Abuse and Dependence (p94) TREATMENT ADHD can be treated by a pediatrician, a developmentalbehavioral pediatrician, a neurologist, or a child and adolescentpsychiatrist.

ASDs are neurological disorders, which means that they affect how the brain works. Although every childwill go through development stages at his or her own pace, a childwho has significant delays may have ASD. The different types ofASDs include: ASPERGER'S DISORDER: Asperger' s Disorder is a relatively new diagnosis that affects boys more than girls. Most children withAsperger' s Disorder have average or above average intelligenceand early language development. However, they have severelyimpaired social skills and are unable to use their language skillsto communicate effectively with others. Many children with thisdisorder have poor coordination, repetitive speech, problemswith reading, math or written skills, odd behaviors or mannerisms,obsession with specific topics, and a lack of common sense. AUTISTIC DISORDER: Children with this disorder have trouble forming normal social relationships and communicating withothers. They may also have a limited range of activity andinterests. Autistic Disorder is also sometimes referred to as earlyinfantile autism, childhood autism, classic autism, or Kanner' sautism. Autistic Disorder affects boys more often than girls. PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER - NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED (PDD-NOS): PDD-NOS is also called atypical autism or mild autism. Children with PDD-NOS usually have severeimpairment in several areas of development, including socialinteraction and communication skills. It is diagnosed when achild has many features of autistic disorder, but does not meetthe full criteria. Within the diagnosis of PDD-NOS, there are alsotwo specific conditions: \u00bb CHILDHOOD DISINTEGRATIVE DISORDER: Childhood Disintegrative Disorder is a condition that occurs in children,ages 3 to 4. The child' s thinking, social, and language skills getworse over the course of several months. This rare conditionis also known as disintegrative psychosis or Heller' s Syndrome.54\u00bb RETT'S DISORDER: Rett' s Disorder is a genetic disorder seen mostly in girls. It starts in children, ages 6 to 18 months. It is characterized by wringing of hands, slowed brain andhead growth, walking abnormalities, seizures, and mentalretardation. A genetic test is now available to confirm adiagnosis of Rett' s Disorder. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS ASDs affect each child in different degrees. T wo children with thesame disorder can act very differently and can have very differentskills. However, all children with ASDs share difficulties in 3 skill areas:social interaction, social communication, and repetitive behaviors. Typical signs and symptoms related to social interaction problems include: Spending more time alone rather than with others Showing little interest in making friends Being less responsive to social or physical interactions, such as making eye contact, hugging, smiling, imitating, or being awareof other' s feelings Typical signs and symptoms related to social communicationproblems include: Losing or not developing speech or another method of communicating, such as pointing or gesturing. For example, achild may not have typical speaking skills for his or her age, notrespond to his or her name or to parents' questions, or appearnot to understand simple requests. Typical signs and symptoms related to repetitive behaviors include: Being very focused on one interest or topic Lacking imaginative play Not imitating other' s actions Not beginning or playing along in pretend games Becoming too attached to objects or toys Playing with toys in unusual ways, such as lining them up Not liking changes in routine or the location of objects Having unusual body movements, such as spinning or hand flapping55 TIP Help your child learn about his or her condition.

These senses includethe five common senses (sight,hearing, touch, taste, and smell), aswell as sensory systems, such asbalance and movement and muscleand joint sense. Just like the brainsends messages to the body aboutsmell or taste, the brain also sendsmessages to the body about balance,movement, and how to use musclesand joints. For example, balance andmovement senses help a child comedown a slide or use a swing in aplayground. Muscle and joint senseshelp a child lift a spoon withoutspilling. The senses are working allthe time in order for the body toperform daily functions. Sensoryintegration is when all of the senseswork together well to perform thesedaily activities.When one or more senses is not working and the brain cannot tell thebody how to behave, it is calledSensory Integrative Disorder. SensoryIntegrative Disorder can reveal itselfin many ways. On one hand, a childmay be overly sensitive to touch,movements, sounds, or sights. He orshe may withdraw from touch, avoidcertain textures in clothes of food, orbe very sensitive to loud noises. Onthe other hand, a child may beunder-reactive to stimulation. He orshe may seek out intense sensoryexperiences, such as whirling around,falling, and crashing into objects, or appear oblivious to pain or body positioning. Children with Sensory Integrative Disorder may also have the following signs and symptoms: Unexpected reactions to sensory inputs (for example, aggression or fearfulness in new situations) A high or low activity level compared to other children Coordination problems (for example, poor balance, difficulty with new tasks, or awkward,stiff, or clumsy behavior) Academic or motor development delays (for example, tying shoes or zipping a coat) Difficulty following directions Lacking in the ability to plan tasks or anticipate outcomes Appearing distracted, bored, lazy, or unmotivated Avoiding tasks and appearing stubborn or troublesomeAn occupational therapist who is trained in sensory integration canevaluate and treat Sensory IntegrationDisorder. The therapist creates anenvironment where a child can playin an organized manner. A balance ofstructured and free play teaches thechild to use his or her senses effectively.In addition, treatment also includesdeveloping a predictable scheduleand daily routine for the child. Doingthis limits the amount of disruptionand disorganization in the child'senvironment. The therapist can alsowork with a parent to help the childat home. 57In addition, a child' s senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste) may be overactive or underactive. A child may: Cover his or her ears Become stiff when held Remove clothes often Refuse to eat certain foods Smell objects frequently Become either overly quiet or hyperactive in noisy or bright environments EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Most children with an ASD show signs of a disorder in infancy.ASDs are usually diagnosed in children, ages 18 to 24 months, withthe exception of Asperger' s Disorder, which begins later on. T omake a diagnosis, providers must see clear signs and symptoms ofan ASD before age 3. If you think your child has ASD, your childmay need a developmental evaluation or a comprehensivepsychiatric evaluation. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . Before using these evaluations, providers may first use several medical tests to rule out otherproblems, such as hearing loss or mental retardation. TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist with ASDs include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Bipolar Disorder (p59) Depression (p67) Learning Disorders (p75) Tic Disorders (p97)Families are often thefirst to notice that their child is not reachingdevelopmentalmilestones and toobserve worrisomebehaviors.

Treatment must be tailored to the needs and strengths ofyour child. Factors to consider when choosing treatments include:your child' s age, level of skills, type of learner (for example,whether they learn better by seeing or hearing things), behaviors, andprevious treatments. Many treatments have been developed to address a range of social, language, sensory, and behavioral challenges that children withASDs may have.

All children have \"mood swings\" from time to time, butchildren with Bipolar Disorder constantly switch between manicand depressed moods. The frequency of these mood changes canvary among children. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical manic signs and symptoms of Bipolar Disorder include: Severe changes in mood\u2014either unusually happy or silly or very irritable, angry, agitated, or aggressive Unrealistically high self-esteem Significant increases in energy and the ability to go with little or no sleep for days without feeling tired Increase in talking\u2014the child talks too much or too fast, changes topics too quickly, and cannot be interrupted Distractibility\u2014the child' s attention moves constantly from one thing to the next Repeated high risk-taking behavior, such as abusing alcohol and drugs, reckless driving, or sexual promiscuity Typical depressive signs and symptoms of Bipolar Disorderinclude: Irritability, depressed mood, persistent sadness, or frequent crying Thoughts of death or suicide Loss of enjoyment in favorite activities Frequent complaints of physical illnesses, such as headaches or stomachaches Low energy level, fatigue, poor concentration, or complaints of boredom Major changes in eating or sleeping patterns, such as overeating or oversleeping59EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Bipolar Disorder can be a very dangerous condition in children, with both the manic and depressive symptoms having an impacton all aspects of their lives. Unfortunately, diagnosing BipolarDisorder is complex. Bipolar Disorder can be diagnosed at anypoint in childhood, but it tends to be more common inadolescence. If you think your child has Bipolar Disorder, yourchild may need a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. For moreinformation, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist with BipolarDisorder include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (p52) Conduct Disorder (p64) Substance Abuse and Dependence (p94) TREATMENT Treatment of Bipolar Disorder usually requires a team-basedapproach. The team should include a psychotherapist and achild and adolescent psychiatrist. For more information on mentalhealth specialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . The team could also include a care manager to help coordinate achild' s treatment. For more information on health insurance care managers, turn to page 144 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . The treatment should address school, work, social, and family functioning. Treatment may include psychoeducation,psychotherapy, and mood stabilizing medications. For moreinformation, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH TREATMENT (p147) . A family support group can also be helpful. If Bipolar Disorder is affecting the child' s ability to learn, adjustments may need to be made in his or her educationprogram.

At the moment, it is hard to say. Psychiatrists have not agreed upon acommon definition of BipolarDisorder in children. Someprofessionals have a more limitedand narrow definition, and somehave a more broad and generaldefinition. Also, there is a lack oflong-term research on this disorder inchildren. It is thought that about 1%of children have Bipolar Disorder,which is similar to the number ofadults with the disorder. About 59%of adults with Bipolar Disorderreport that their symptoms started inchildhood.IF MY CHILD IS DEPRESSED, WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FORDEVELOPING BIPOLAR DISORDER? Risk factors for developing Bipolar Disorder include: A family history of Bipolar Disorder Medication-induced mania or hypomania Sudden onset of symptoms Delusions (fixed false beliefs) Moving very slowly (psychomotor retardation) Significant increase in need for sleep WHAT DOES MANIA OR HYPO- MANIA LOOK LIKE IN A CHILD? Mania is a period of extreme irritability that lasts for about a week(or less if hospitalization is necessary).During this time, the child wouldhave three or more of the followingsymptoms: Significantly increased self-esteem (for example, feels like a superhero) Decreased need for sleep (for example, sleeps 3-4 hours and feelsfully rested in the morning) Very talkative, difficult to interrupt, and uses rapid speech Racing thoughts (difficult to follow a linear path in his or her thoughts) Easily distracted Increase in goal-directed activity (normal activities done in large amounts) Engaging in pleasurable behaviors that are dangerous (for example, sexual talk or actions, or extremely wild driving) Hypomania is a milder form of mania that does not last as long (4 daysrather than 7 days) and is not severe enough to require hospitalization.HOW DO I KNOW IF IT IS ADHD OR BIPOLAR DISORDER? Psychiatrists are working hard to answer this question. Hyperactivity isa common symptom in both ADHDand Bipolar Disorder\u201490% of bipolarcases have this symptom. Childrenwho respond inconsistently topsychostimulants (medications thatraise the mood or energy level) mayhave Bipolar Disorder, rather thanADHD. Also, children with ADHDhave symptoms that are chronic,whereas mania occurs in episodesand reflects a change in functioning.A decreased need for sleep andincrease in goal-directed activities aretwo distinguishing features of BipolarDisorder. Children with ADHD can beirritable or feel a loss of pleasure orinterest in usual activities due todecreased self-esteem and associateddepression. Even more confusing is that some children may have both Bipolar Disorder and ADHD.Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder Body Dysmorphic Disorder Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) occurs when a child is extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw in his or her appearance.Children with BDD are obsessed with the belief that something iswrong with the way they look. They may describe themselves aslooking ugly, unattractive, \"not right,\" deformed\u2014or even\"hideous\" or \"monstrous.\" Although this preoccupation frequentlyfocuses on the face or head, children with BDD can dislike any partof their body. The preoccupations can be very difficult to control. It is normal for children to be occasionally concerned with their appearance. However, it is also important to note that not allappearance concerns in adolescents are normal or a passingphase. If your child has an extreme preoccupation or obsessionwith his or her appearance, then he or she may have BDD. Typical signs and symptoms of BDD include: Often scrutinizing the appearance of others and comparing his or her appearance with others Often checking his or her appearance Hiding the flaw with clothing, makeup, his or her hand, or posture Seeking surgery, dermatological treatment, or other medical treatment, when doctors or other people have said the flaw isminimal and treatment is not needed Often asking others about the flaw or trying to convince others of its ugliness Excessive grooming (for example, combing hair, shaving, removing or cutting hair, or applying makeup) Avoiding mirrors Often touching the disliked body part to check its shape, size, or other characteristics Picking his or her skin to try to improve its appearance Measuring the disliked body part Excessively reading about the flaw and how to make it look better Exercising or dieting excessively Using drugs (for example, anabolic steroids) to become more muscular or lose fat Changing his or her clothes often to try to find something that makes him or her look better Avoiding social situations in which the flaw might be exposed Feeling very anxious and self-conscious around other people because of the flaw62It may be hard tonotice some of thesigns and However,noticing a grades, adecrease socialactivities, a desire tonot want to leave thehouse may providesome clues about yourchild's underlyingmental health issue. 63EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS In addition to its effects on everyday functioning, BDD can cause serious emotional problems that may have long-term effectson a child' s academic progress, job performance, or social life(for example, poor grades, dropping out of school, withdrawingfrom family and friends, becoming housebound, and even tryingto kill himself or herself ). BDD often begins as early asadolescence. If you think your child has BDD, your child may needa comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. For more information,turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist with BDD include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Depression (p67) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) (p80) Substance Abuse and Dependence (p94) TREATMENT Treatment options for BDD can help to lower the impact that thedisorder has on a child' s life. Treatment may reduce appearancepreoccupations and compulsive behaviors, lessen emotionaldistress, and improve depression. It may also help children feelbetter about how they look, function better, and lead a happierand more productive life. A psychotherapist or a child and adolescent psychiatrist can treat BDD.

Phillips, MD Learning to Live With Body Dysmorphic Disorder By Katharine A. Phillips, MD, Barbara Livingstone Van Noppen, MSW,and Leslie Shapiro, MSWAvailable from the ObsessiveCompulsive Foundationwww.ocfoundation.orgConduct Disorder Conduct Disorder is a group of behavioral and emotional problems in children. These general behavioral and emotional problemsusually result in the child having difficulty following rules andbehaving in a socially acceptable way. As a result, many childrenwith Conduct Disorder are viewed by others as \"bad\" ordelinquent, rather than as having a mental illness. Most childrenwill test their parents' rules at some point during theirdevelopment. However, when a child \"goes to the extreme\" inbreaking these rules, then he or she may have Conduct Disorder. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of Conduct Disorder includeaggression, rule violation, and property destruction. Someexamples of potential behaviors include: Bullying, threatening, or intimidating others Initiating physical fights with others Using a weapon that could cause serious physical harm to others (for example, a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, or gun) Being physically cruel to others Stealing from someone while confronting him or her (for example, assault) Forcing someone into sexual activity Staying out at night often despite parental objections Running away from home Skipping school often Breaking into someone else's building, house, or car Lying to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations Stealing from someone without confronting him or her (for example, shoplifting without breaking and entering) Setting fire to property or objects EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS It is crucial for Conduct Disorder to be diagnosed early to reducethe risk of the child getting hurt or hurting others, as well as reducethe risk of the child getting involved with the judicial system.Conduct Disorder can be diagnosed at any time in childhood oradolescence.

However, treatment is complexand depends on the severity of a child' s case. In many cases acomprehensive and team-based approach to treatment is used.The team should include family, school professionals, and otherprofessionals who can hold the child responsible for his or herbehavior and help the child avoid problems with the law. In addition to the child' s pediatrician, the team could include a child and adolescent psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, and an advancedpractice registered nurse.

If yourchild has Conduct Disorder, you may needsomeone to step in and help. If your child has a mental health issue in addition to Conduct Disorder, you maywant to file a voluntary petition. Thispetition is a request for services that your insurance may not pay for. If approved,the Rhode Island Depar tment of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) would step inand pay for these services. These servicesinclude residential facilities or specialschools for your child. If your child has Conduct Disorder without another co-existing mental illness and youare having trouble managing him or her,you may want to file a wayward petition. This petition is a request for the judicial system to take over the care of your child.This is often a \"last resort\" for parents.Your child will get the services he or sheneeds, but you will have to hand over the care of your child to the courts.65Comprehensive treatment for Conduct Disorder needs to occur over a long period of time. Treatment needs to individually addresseach of the causes for the child' s behaviors. Depending of theparticular situation, different treatments, including medication,may be needed. Parent management training is an essential part oftreatment for Conduct Disorder. In addition, psychotherapy(particularly, cognitive behavioral therapy) may also be veryhelpful. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH TREATMENT (p147) . It is important to note that some types of treatment do not work.For example, group psychotherapy is not a recommended form oftreatment for children with Conduct Disorder. In addition,inoculation approaches are not effective. Inoculation approachesare \"scared straight\" methods that try to prevent the behavior byscaring the child with the consequences of the behavior. Examplesof these approaches include putting a child in jail for a few days orsending him or her to boot camp. If Conduct Disorder is affecting the child' s ability to learn, adjustments may need to be made in his or her education program.For more information on the school system, turn to page 118 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT .

Fassler and Lynne DumasAbout 5 out of 100 children suffer fromdepression at somepoint in their childhoodor adolescence.69Suicide Many children feel strong emotions as they grow up, including stress, self-doubt, confusion, and a number of pressures related to success and their future. For some children, these pressures lead them to believe that suicide is their only way out. A child at risk for suicide typically shows the signs and symptoms of depression. Typical signs and symptoms include: Change in eating and sleeping habits Withdrawal from friends, family, and regular activities Violent or rebellious behavior Running away Excessive drug and alcohol use Neglect of his or her personal appearance Change in his or her normal personality Persistent boredom Difficulty concentrating Decline in the quality of schoolwork Frequent complaints about physical symptoms, such as stomachaches, headaches, or fatigue Loss of interest in activities he or she used to enjoy Not accepting of praise or rewards In addition, a child who is planning to commit suicide may: Complain that he or she is a bad person or feels rotten inside Begin to give verbal hints of committing suicide by saying things like: \u00bb I won't be a problem for you much longer\u00bb Nothing matters\u00bb I t ' sn ou s e\u00bb I won't see you again Put his or her affairs in order (for example, give away favorite possessions, clean his or her room, or throw away important belongings) Become suddenly cheerful after a period of depression Show signs of psychosis If your child is at risk of committing suicide, the first step in treatment is to develop a plan to keep your child safe. A mental health specialist will work with you and your child to develop a safety plan. Once the threat of suicide is reduced, the next phase of treatment focuses on addressing any underlying mental illness. Children can return to a healthy life after having suicidal thoughts.

Although it isnormal for children to be occasionally concerned with theirappearance, weight, and the type of food they eat, a child who isobsessed with food and his or her shape or weight may have aneating disorder. The level of preoccupation relates to theseriousness of the condition. Anorexia Nervosa (also called Anorexia) and Bulimia are the two most common eating disorders. They occur mostly in teenage girlsand young women and less often in teenage boys and young men.A child with Anorexia often refuses to eat, eats very little, orexercises more often than necessary. A child with Bulimia ofteneats large amounts of high calorie or high fat foods and then triesto counteract this by vomiting, overexercising, or using laxatives. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Identifying symptoms of Anorexia or Bulimia in your child may bevery difficult. Often, children hide these illnesses from their familiesand friends. In fact, one common sign of an eating disorder ispulling away from friends and spending more time alone. Typical signs and symptoms of eating disorders include: Perfectionism and an excessive drive for high achievement in school Low self-esteem Believing he or she is fat regardless of how thin he or she becomes The need to feel control over his or her life Dramatic weight fluctuations EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Eating disorders can lead to serious medical problems. Earlydetection and intervention is important. However, eating disorderscan be difficult to recognize and diagnose because children willoften go to great lengths to hide their behaviors.

However, your child mayhave a feeding disorder if he or she refuses to eat for an extendedperiod of time and your child' s weight is not in line with otherchildren his or her age. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of feeding disorders include: Failure to eat that is not explained by a medical condition or by lack of available food T oo little weight gain or a significant weight loss EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS It is essential to diagnose feeding disorders early, because childrenwill not grow and develop without appropriate nutrition. Inaddition, feeding disorders can also make it difficult for parents to72 bond with their children. Diagnosis of a feeding disorder can be complicated because it requires both a medical and a mentalhealth evaluation. A provider will look at medical, social, andbehavioral factors to find out the cause of the feeding problem.A feeding disorder is typically diagnosed early in infancy, withinthe first 6 to 12 months. If you think your child has a feedingdisorder, your child may need a feeding evaluation. For moreinformation, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .

T alk to your child' s pediatrician about your child' ssymptoms. TREATMENT Treatment may include different types of psychotherapy andtraining, as well as medical monitoring. The goal of treatment of afeeding disorder is to make meal time a more positive experiencefor the parent and the child. This will help the parent meet thenutritional, physical, and developmental needs of the child. Specific treatments may focus on improving mealtime structure, schedule, and limits; teaching parents successful eating approaches; making sure that parents are providing good food choices and variety; and helping to improve parent-child interaction patterns. For more serious cases, treatment should be team-based and could include the following providers: the child' s pediatrician, a gastroenterologist, a psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, a nutritionistor dietician, a speech-language pathologist, and occupational and physical therapists.

Learning Disorders Learning disorders (or disabilities) are considered to be disorders of basic brain processes. There are several types of learningdisorders, including mathematics, reading, written and oralexpression, and l istening comprehension. A child may have a learning disorder in a single area of functioning, such as reading,or may have multiple, overlapping learning disorders. Althoughmany children have trouble learning in school from time to time, achild who is consistently having trouble with an academic subjector subjects at school may have a learning disorder. MATHEMATICS A mathematics learning disorder can occur in either mathcalculation or math reasoning. Problems with math calculationinclude difficulty learning basic math facts and performing basicmath operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, anddivision. A problem with math reasoning includes difficulty solvingmath problems that is not simply the result of difficulties withmath calculation. The two types of mathematics learning disorderscan also occur together. Typical signs and symptoms of a mathematics learning disorder include difficulty: Mastering numbers, such as counting or understanding quantities Learning and memorizing basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts, leading to slow and cumbersomecalculating strategies Counting by 2' s, 5' s, 10' s, or 100' s Estimating Lining up numbers, resulting in calculation errors Comparing numbers (greater than or less than) T elling time Learning multiplication tables or formulas Interpreting graphs and charts Visualizing mathematics concepts, such as geometric shapes, numerical quantities, or rotation in space Holding mathematical information in his or her head long enough to complete a calculationLearning disordersaf fect children from all racial, economic, andcultural backgrounds. 757676 Understanding the language aspects of mathematics, such as understanding word problems Moving from concrete mathematical representations (for example, counting objects) to abstract representations (for example, using symbols and numbers to perform calculations) READING A reading learning disorder can occur in one of three areas: basicreading, reading comprehension, or reading fluency. Basic readingrefers to the ability to decode words. Reading comprehension isthe ability to make sense of and understand written information.Reading fluency refers to the ability to read quickly and fluidly. Thethree types of reading disorders may, and often do, occur together. Typical signs and symptoms of a reading learning disorder include: Difficulty recognizing and remembering sight words (words that good readers should instantly recognize without having to\"figure them out\") Frequently losing his or her place while reading Confusing similar-looking letters, numbers, or words (for example, beard and bread) Reversing letter order in words (for example, saw and was) Poor memory for printed words and new vocabulary Poor understanding of what has been read Significant trouble naming letters and learning to read Problems associating letters and sounds, understanding the difference between sounds in words, blending sounds intowords Guessing at unfamiliar words rather than using word analysis skills (sounding them out) Reading very slowly Substituting or leaving out words while reading Disliking and avoiding reading or reading \"reluctantly\"Once diagnosed with alear ning disorder, a child is provided withservices and orprotections Individuals withDisabilities andservices may continueinto adulthood.Dyslexia Although not a formal mental health diagnosis, dyslexia is a common term used for a type of reading learning disorder. Dyslexia generally affects achild's ability to decode and spellwords. Dyslexia can occur in children ofall different intelligence levels. Typical signs and symptoms of dyslexia include having difficulty: Learning to speak Organizing language (for example, a child may reverseletters or words) Learning letters and their sounds Spelling Reading Learning a foreign language Calculating math equations Memorizing math facts 77WRITTEN EXPRESSION Children with this disorder have problems with their writing skills. This disorder often occurs with an oral expression learning disorder. Typical signs and symptoms of a written expression learning disorder include: Difficulty formulating ideas into a logical, coherent sentences or paragraphs Consistent difficulty learning and applying grammatical concepts in written sentences (for example, capitalization,punctuation, conjugation, or noun-verb agreement) Poor spelling ability Poor handwriting ability Slow and labored writing (not due to motor disability) ORAL EXPRESSION Children with this disorder have problems expressing themselvesverbally (by speaking). Typical signs and symptoms of an oral expression learning disorder include: Consistent difficulty answering developmentally appropriate questions, often shown by a long pause between the time aquestion is asked and when the child answers Consistent difficulty formatting thoughts into speech (ideas are jumbled or confused and the meaning is often lost) Difficulty with word finding (cannot find the word to say, even though they know what they want to say) Difficulty giving directions or telling stories Bypass strategies Bypass strategies are a way of \"going around\" a child's learning disorder. An example of abypass strategy is providing a child whohas a mathematics calculation dis ability with a calculator. Another example would be providing books on tape to a child whohas a disability of basic reading skills. Depending on a child's specific disorder and age, bypass strategies may be taught to children to help them learn what they can at a better pace. Bypass strategies can help them keep up with classroom instruction and continue to benefit from instruction at hisor her level or ability. Bypass strategies should not replace appropriate instruction in the area of thelearning disorder. This is particularly truewhen children are still young and are morelikely to accept help.LISTENING COMPREHENSION Children with this disorder have difficulty listening to and understanding what others say. Typical signs and symptoms of a listening comprehension learning disorder include: Difficulty following verbal instructions, particularly those with multiple steps Difficulty following along with class discussions Difficulty understanding vocabulary words Long pauses before answering questions Becoming confused or frustrated when information is presented verbally, but not when information is presented visually Becoming tired quickly when listening to stories or lectures Easily distracted in class EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Early diagnosis (and treatment) of a learning disorder is extremelyimportant. Early diagnosis can reduce the potential negativeeffects of having a learning disorder, such as low self-esteem,depression, and lack of success in school. As many children learnways to compensate for their learning disorder, a learning disorderis typically diagnosed when a child' s ability to \"hide\" the disorderreaches its limit. If you think your child has a learning disorder,your child may need an educational evaluation. For moreinformation, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .

OCD usually affects older children and adolescents,but can begin earlier. OCD occurs when a child develops intenseobsessions or compulsions that interfere with day-to-dayfunctioning. It is normal for all children to have some level of focuson certain items or activities, particularly young children who\"obsess\" as part of how they learn. However, when theseobsessions cause significant anxiety or distress, take up more thanone hour a day, or interfere with a child' s normal routine (school,social activities or relationships), then he or she may have OCD. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of OCD include: COMPULSIONS: Repetitive behaviors or rituals (for example, hand washing, hoarding, keeping things in order, or checking something over and over) or mental acts (for example, countingor repeating words silently). For example, a child may check thelocks on all the doors in the house after his or her parents havegone to sleep. The child may then fear that he or sheaccidentally unlocked a door while checking them and will thencheck the locks all over again. OBSESSIONS: Recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are unwanted and cause significant anxiety ordistress. Frequently, they are unrealistic or irrational. Forexample, a child may have constant thoughts that a familymember will be harmed. EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS In addition to causing distress and interfering with normal life, OCD can lead to depression and social isolation in some cases ifnot evaluated and treated. OCD can be diagnosed anytime inchildhood or adolescence. If you think your child has OCD, yourchild may need a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation orpsychotherapy evaluation.

March Oppositional Defiant Disorder Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by an ongoing pattern of uncooperative, defiant, and hostile behavior towardauthority figures that has serious effects on a child' s day-to-dayfunctioning. At some point during child development, most childrenexpress some form of oppositional behavior. When children are tired, hungry, stressed, or upset they are likely to argue, talk back, disobey,and defy parents, teachers, or other adults. However, if this type ofbehavior becomes frequent and affects a child's social, family, andschool life, then his or her behavior may be caused by ODD. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of ODD include: Frequent temper tantrums Excessive arguing with adults Active defiance and refusal to comply with adult requests and rules Deliberate attempts to annoy or upset people Blaming others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior Often being irritable or easily annoyed by others Frequent anger and resentment T alking in a mean and hateful way when upset Seeking revenge82 Parenting a child with a disruptive behavior disorder Parenting a child with a disruptive behavior disorder, such as ODD or Conduct Disorder, can be very challenging. Here are some tips to help: Think positive! Praise your child when he or she shows flexibility or cooperation. Time-outs are not only for children. If you feel you may react to a conflict with your child that would make it worse, take a break. Your child needs a role model to show him or her appropriate behavior. Pick your battles. Since a child with a disruptive behavior disorder has trouble avoiding power struggles, prioritize the things you want your child to do. If you give him or her a time-out in his or her room for misbehavior, don't add time for arguing. Set up reasonable, age-appropriate limits with consequences that can be enforced the same way each time. Take care of yourself. Try to work with and obtain support from the other adults (for example, spouse, teachers, and coaches) who know your child. EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS A child with ODD hears a lot of negative comments about him or herself. If ODD is not diagnosed, these negative comments can endup impacting a child' s self-esteem and this can lead to a variety ofother mental health issues. ODD is usually diagnosed in earlychildhood. If your child is oppositional, his or her behavior will beseen at home and in other settings, such as school, daycare, orother activities. If you think your child has ODD, your child mayneed a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation or psychotherapyevaluation. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .

For more information on mentalhealth specialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . Comprehensive treatment for ODD needs to occur over a longperiod of time. Treatment needs to individually address each of thecauses for the child' s behaviors. Depending of the particularsituation, different treatments may be needed. Treatment of ODDmay include parent management training and medications. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH TREATMENT (p147) . It is important to note that inoculation approaches are noteffective. Inoculation approaches are \"scared straight\" methods that try to prevent the behavior by scaring the child with the consequences of the behavior. Examples of these approaches include putting a child in jail for a few days or sending him or herto boot camp.

PTSD is a prolonged emotional and physical reaction to atraumatic event. Throughout development, all children experiencestressful events that can have an emotional or physical affect onthem. These experiences are usually short lived. If a child developsongoing difficulties after a traumatic event, he or she may have PTSD. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of PTSD include: Easily agitated immediately following the event Intense fear, helplessness, anger, sadness, horror, or denial Avoidance of situations or places that may trigger memories of the event Frequent memories of the event Repetition of events from the trauma over and over while playing Nightmares or general problems falling and staying asleep Withdrawn and less emotionally responsive Detachment from feelings Physical or emotional symptoms that continually arise with a reminder of the event Worries about dying at an early age Loss of interest in activities he or she once enjoyed Complaints of headaches and stomachaches Problems concentrating on tasks Starts acting younger than his or her age.

They tend to be unresponsive toparents, caregivers, or other adults when they are upset and maynot seek out nurturing or comfort from caregivers. Healthyattachments are formed when a child is able to \"ask\" for care fromadults in the form of crying, talking, or other communication andwhen adults are able to provide care for a child. If a child is missingeither of these components (lacks the ability to \"ask\" for care oradults are not providing appropriate care), the child may not beable to form healthy attachments and may have RAD. There are two types of RAD: EMOTIONALL Y WITHDRAWN / INHIBITED TYPE: A child has extremely emotionally inhibited behavior in social interactions with others. When distressed or upset, these children do not tryto obtain comfort or nurturing and may resist offers of comfort. INDISCRIMINATE / UNINHIBITED TYPE: Children are very unselective when they choose caregivers or others to providethem comfort. They tend to lack a preference for primarycaregivers and to lack an appropriate wariness of strangers.These children may wander from caregivers without checkingback and often approach or seek nurturing from total strangersrather than from caregivers they know. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of RAD include: Severe colic or feeding difficulties Failure to gain weight Detached and unresponsive behavior Difficult to comfort him or her Defiant behavior Appearing distracted Lack of response in social interactions History of physical or emotional abuse or neglect, repeated moves, or a traumatic event86RAD is the result of situations such asconsistent physicalabuse or neglect,inconsistent caregiving,or repeated the childto create closeattachments withcaregivers.EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS The emotional and social problems associated with RAD can continue to have an impact throughout childhood. RAD is usually diagnosedbefore age 5. If you think your child has RAD, your child may need acomprehensive psychiatric evaluation or psychotherapy evaluation.For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . Diagnosis of RAD is based on an evaluation of both the caregiverand the child, as well as the interaction between the two. TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Children with RAD are at greater risk for delays in development.Pediatricians should evaluate them regularly for appropriatedevelopment. Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist withRAD include: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (p84) Speech and Language Disorders (p90) TREATMENT A psychotherapist can treat RAD. For more information on mentalhealth specialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . A key component of treatment of RAD includes making sure thechild has safe, consistent, and familiar caregivers. Treatment focuseson creating appropriate and secure attachments with caregivers byworking with the child and caregivers individually and as a group.Treatment options include parent-child interaction psychotherapyand skill building. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH TREATMENT (p147) . If the child has been traumatized, this may also be something that needs to be addressed in treatment. There are quite a few potentially dangerous RAD treatments that should be avoided. These include treatments that are designed toenhance attachment through physical restraint, coercion, or \"reworking\" of the trauma. These also include treatments thatpromote regression for reattachment. Although the names of thethese treatments can vary, some names to watch out for include: Attachment Therapy, Holding Therapy, Rage Reduction Therapy, Re-Attachment Therapy, and Rebirthing Therapy. There is no scientific evidence that these treatments work. And w orse, these treatments can be dangerous\u2014they have been associated with deaths on multiple occasions. For appropriate treatment, talk to your child' s pediatrician and get a referral for a mental health specialist. If RAD is affecting the child' s ability to learn, adjustments may need to be made in his or her education program.

Handbook for Treatment of Attachment - Trauma Problems inChildren (1994) By Beverly James New York University Child Study Centerwww.aboutourkids.orgSchizophrenia Schizophrenia is very rare in children. Schizophrenia can cause unusual behavior and abnormal thinking. Children normally gothrough a stage where they cannot tell the difference betweenwhat is real and what is pretend. However, after this stage ofdevelopment, if a child continues to see and hear things that donot exist, he or she may have Schizophrenia. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of Schizophrenia include: Trouble discerning dreams from reality Seeing things and hearing voices that are not real Confused thinking Vivid and bizarre thoughts and ideas Extreme moodiness Peculiar behavior Believing that people are \"out to get them\" Severe anxiety and fearfulness Confusing television or movies with reality Severe problems in making and keeping friends Start acting younger than his or her age. Some examples of behaviors include bed-wetting, clingy behavior, thumb-sucking, and sharing a bed with a parent.88The symptoms ofSchizophrenia aresometimes mistaken asmoodiness or asign of Schizophrenia,but may be due toanxiety, stress, ordepression. Misdiagnosis If your child is receiving treatment for a mental health illness and he or she is not getting better, this may mean that you need to change your child's treatment plan. It also may be a sign that you should take a look at your child's diagnosis. Your child may not have the correct diagnosis or may have an additional diagnosis that has not been considered yet. EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.

Fuller Torrey89Speech and Language Disorders Speech and language disorders is a general category that covers the following diagnoses: ARTICULATION DISORDER: Articulation disorders include difficulties making sounds. Sounds can be substituted, left off,added, or changed. These errors may make it hard for otherpeople to understand the child. COMMUNICATION DISORDER: Communication disorders include difficulties giving or receiving non-verbal, verbal,written, or gestural messages (for example, reaching, pointing,or shaking hands). These problems can be related to speech,language, or hearing. FLUENCY DISORDER: Fluency disorders include problems such as stuttering, the condition in which the flow of speech isinterrupted by abnormal stops, repetitions (st-st-stuttering), orprolonging sounds and syllables (ssssstuttering). LANGUAGE DISORDER: Language disorders can be either receptive or expressive. Receptive disorders refer to difficultiesunderstanding or processing language. Expressive disordersinclude difficulty putting words together, limited use of vocabulary,or inability to use language in a socially appropriate way. RESONANCE OR VOICE DISORDER: Resonance or voice disorders include problems with the pitch, volume, or quality ofa child's voice that distract listeners from what is being said.These disorders may also cause pain or discomfort for the childwhen speaking. SOCIAL COMMUNICATION DISORDER: Social communication disorders include difficulties using words, pictures, facialexpressions, body language, eye gaze, and gestures to start andcontinue interactions with others. These problems includedifficulty participating in conversations, knowing how close tostand to others, and being able to vary what one says based onwhether the other person is a teacher, acquaintance, friend, orfamily member.90 TIP Parent involvement is crucial to treating speech and language disorders. A speech-language pathologist may recommend parent counseling and education. Ask your child's speech-language pathologist for suggestions on how you canhelp your child, such as emphasizingimportant words when you readtogether.SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of speech and language disorders include when a child has a hard time: T alking clearly enough to be understood outside the family Understanding others Following directions Reading or writing Answering questions Expressing his or her thoughts and ideas in a clear manner using appropriate vocabulary and grammar Using language in a variety of social situations EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS If untreated, children with speech and language disorders may notbe able to fully engage in daily conversations with their parents,family members, or other children. They also may not be able tofollow directions\u2014not because they do not want to listen, butbecause they do not understand. In school, a child with speechand language problems may fall behind, shut down, or act up.

Children who begin therapy early in their development tend to do better than childrenwho begin therapy later. This does not mean that older childrenand adolescents cannot make progress in therapy. However, whena problem goes unrecognized, it can interfere with a child' s familyinteractions, social relationships, and schoolwork. When a problemis identified, a speech-language pathologist can work with thechild, parents, and teachers to enhance the child' s speech andlanguage development and reduce the impact of the any problemson a child' s family, social, and school life. Treatment may include clinic or home-based coaching, individual or group therapy, school-based individual or group therapy in aclassroom, and other school-based interventions. Speech-languagetherapy may include: ARTICULATION THERAPY: In this treatment, a speech-language pathologist models correct sounds and syllables for a childduring play activities. A speech-language pathologist helps thechild learn how the sounds are formed with the lips, tongue,and teeth (for example, moving the tongue to the back of themouth to say \"car\" instead of \"tar\"). LANGUAGE INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES: In this treatment, a speech-language pathologist talks to a child and uses pictures,books, objects, structured play, or actual events, such ascooking. The speech-language pathologist may model certainwords or types of sentences and ask the child to imitate.T ogether, these activities work to improve vocabulary, sentencestructure, and language use. The level of play is age appropriateand related to the child's specific needs. For older children, thespeech-language pathologist tries to improve a child' s ability tounderstand others, like his or her teachers. A speech-languagepathologist may teach the child to ask questions when he or shedoes not understand something in class or may explain thevocabulary used in daily school assignments. If the speech and language disorder is affecting the child' s ability to learn, adjustments may need to be made in his or her educationprogram.

If your child uses single words like \"doggie,\" then you can use a phrase like \"nice doggie.\" When interacting with your child, give him or her time to listen and learn. Pause after you talk, so your child has a chance to talk or gesture to answer you. Be patient. Your child may not repeat words you say right away, but these words may \"pop out\" later. Ask helpful questions (rather than test questions) and acknowledge your child's responses, even when they're hard to understand. If your child says \"bamma\" and you think he or she means to say \"grandma,\" ask your child \"Are you talking aboutgrandma\" (helpful question) rather than \"What's her name?\" (test question). Show your child that it is okay for him or her to ask questions when he or she does not understand what you are saying. If your child looks puzzled or does not follow a direction correctly, consider changing what you say and see if it helps him or her. If your child is having trouble expressing himself or herself, focus on what he or she means, rather than how he or she says it. If your child is having trouble understanding what you are saying, use gestures, objects, or pictures to help him or her understand what you are talking about. Older children can benefit from drawings, simple lists, and outlines. Keep in mind that even older children may not understand abstract expressions, such as \"Those people live in a zoo.\" When giving directions or just talking, say what you mean. For example, instead of saying \"Put down your dukes\" say \"Put your hands down.\" 93Substance Abuse and Dependence For some children, continued use of alcohol, drugs, or other substances (for example, over-the-counter medications like coughsyrup or household products like inhalants) may begin to interferewith their activities and health and develop into a substance abuseproblem. If children take the substances often enough, their bodyor mind may become dependent on them (in other words, theyneed the substances to function). The child will have negativephysical and emotional reactions to not having the alcohol ordrugs. Children can also develop a tolerance for the substance. Thealcohol or drug will no longer make them feel drunk or high theway it did at first, and they need more of it to feel that way. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Typical signs and symptoms of substance abuse and dependenceinclude: Fatigue or red and glazed eyes A lasting cough Sudden mood changes or irritability Irresponsible behavior Withdrawal from the family Decreased interest in school or a negative attitude toward school A drop in grades Discipline problems at school or problems with the law94There are a numberof risk factors that canincrease the likelihoodthat their community,and a family historyof substance abuseor addiction. EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Substance abuse can affect every aspect of a child' s life and can lead to problems in school, with relationships, and even with lawenforcement. Continued substance abuse can lead to medicalproblems, as well. For these reasons, it is important that it isdiagnosed as early as possible. Unfortunately, substance abuse isalso an issue that can be easily hidden. Substance abuse anddependence is typically diagnosed in adolescence, but it can occurin younger children. If you think your child has a substance abuse and dependence problem, your child may need a comprehensive psychiatricevaluation or psychotherapy evaluation. For more information,turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . In addition to an evaluation, a provider will usually do a toxicology screening todetermine what types of substances are in your child' s system.Sometimes a child may not know exactly what he or she hasingested, so it is important to establish exactly what types ofchemicals are present. TYPICAL CO-EXISTING DIAGNOSES Substance abuse is often a sign of other mental illnesses. A childmay use alcohol or other drugs as a way to feel better and reducethe symptoms of a mental illness. For example, a child who isdepressed may use drugs as a way to feel happier, or a child withanxiety may use alcohol to help him or her relax. If your child is abusing substances, it is important to both seek treatment for thesubstance abuse and have him or her evaluated and possibly treated for other mental illnesses. Common mental health diagnoses that co-exist with substance abuse and dependence include: Anxiety Disorders (p48) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (p52) Bipolar Disorder (p59) Conduct Disorder (p64) (p67) Eating Disorders (p70) Learning Disorders (p75)95For both evaluationa n dt r e a t m e n to fasubstance abuse anddependence problem,it is important to finda mental healthcareprovider who specializesin substance abuse.TREATMENT Substance abuse and dependence can be treated by a licensed mental health counselor, a psychotherapist, or a child andadolescent psychiatrist. For more information on mental healthspecialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . There are many successful treatments for substance abuse anddependence. Treatment includes drug or alcohol rehabilitation,which allows the child' s body to get over any physical dependenceto the substance. In addition, individual and family psychotherapyare suggested forms of treatment. Medication may be used toreduce emotional or psychological dependence on a substance.Treatment of any existing mental illnesses can also help in treatingsubstance abuse. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH TREATMENT (p147) . Many treatment facilities exist specifically to treat substance abuseand dependence and provide comprehensive programs forchildren with substance abuse problems. Treatment programs caninclude twelve step programs and peer support from friends whodo not use substances. In particular, treatment programs usuallyaddress how the child is spending his or her time and figure out away to keep the child busy through recreational or vocationalservices. As children with substance abuse problems may havetrouble in other areas, comprehensive programs also usuallyinclude legal, family, and medical services.

Tics can occur in any part of the body,but are most common in the face, shoulders, hands, or legs. Inaddition, some tics can be vocal. A vocal tic is when a child makessounds or speaks involuntarily. Tics can range from mild to severe. Most tics are mild and hardly noticeable. However, in some cases, they are frequent and severeand can affect a child' s ability to function in many different areas,including at home, school, and work. The different types of tic disorders in children include: CHRONIC TIC DISORDER: With this disorder, a child has either one or more motor or vocal tics that last for more than a year. This type of tic disorder is rare. In some cases, chronic tics maybe a sign of T ourette's Disorder (p98). TRANSIENT TIC DISORDER: A child with this disorder has multiple motor and/or vocal tics that last for at least a month,but not more than a year. Tics are usually mild and hard tonotice, but may increase in frequency when a child is tired,nervous, or stressed. Transient Tic Disorder is the most commontype of tic disorder in children. This disorder goes away on itsown and does not require treatment. EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS Tic disorders can be very stressful for children, especially due tothe other children' s reactions to the tics. Tic disorders can be diagnosed at any time in childhood. If you think that your child has a tic disorder, your child may need a comprehensivepsychiatric evaluation. For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .

This section describes some of the key people andorganizations that may be a part of your child' s treatment, while also helpingyou figure out whom you should contact when you have concerns aboutyour child.6 101 101You and Your Support Team As a parent, you are in charge of your child' s care. Your child is dependent on you for everything that he or she needs. Being yourchild' s number one advocate is the most important job you haveand can truly make a difference in how successful your child willbe. Dealing with a mental health issue is difficult, and the moresupport that a child has, the more likely he or she will besuccessful at managing it. BEING AN ADVOCATE Parenting a child with a mental health issue can be incrediblychallenging at times. Depending on the issue, your child may needregular psychotherapy, medication, and an incredible amount ofsupport from family and friends. Parenting a child with a mentalhealth issue means you are in charge of finding the appropriateservices for your child, coordinating them, and monitoring theireffectiveness. This guide can help you find your way through themental healthcare system and offer tips and suggestions on whereto start and who to contact, but it is up to you to make sure yourchild gets what he or she needs out of the system. Finding goodcare for your child and watching him or her succeed can be veryrewarding. You and your child both deserve that feeling!The best advocate foryour child is YOU\u2014 a parent knows his orher child better thananyone else and knowswhat he or she needsto succeed. TIP Talk with other parents to discuss strategies, common problems,and what kinds of solutions have worked. Many parents have received the best advice from other parents.102BUILDING YOUR CHILD'S SUPPORT TEAM Building a support team is a great way to offer your child the support and encouragement that he or she needs. A support teamis a network of people that care about your child and can includefamily members, family friends, teachers, your child' s pediatrician,your child' s mental health specialists, and other members of thecommunity. A support team can also help you\u2014as a parent and anadvocate. Here are a few suggestions to begin building yours: Decide how much information you are willing to share with others about your child' s mental health issue. If your child is old enough to participate in this decision, ask for his or her opinion.Explaining aspects of your child' s mental health issue may requiresharing personal information about your child and your family.You, your child, and your family need to decide how comfortableyou are talking about these details with specific people. Make a list of people who you think should be a part of your team. What would make each person a good advocate for yourchild? Do they have skills or access to resources that would beuseful? Do they have time and interest in being a part of yourteam? T alk to them about what role would be the best fit for them. When you build your team, talk to each person about respecting the confidentiality and privacy of your child. You may becomfortable sharing some details of your child' s mental healthissue with them, but you may not want them to share thosedetails with other people. Create open lines of communication with people on your team. Even if you have decided to limit the amount of information youshare, try to talk regularly to your team about the things youhave decided to share. Communication about the needs of your child, yourself, and your team will help you get the most out of your team without causing harm or undue stress to anyone. Share the responsibilities of supporting and advocating for your child. Each team member brings his or her individual expertise to the table, as well as his or her unique relationship with yourchild. Different perspectives can be very helpful.103 It is important to protect yourchild's privacy about his or hermental health. Yet, at the sametime you need to share importantinformation with teachers, familymembers, and members of yoursupport team. Stigma is createdby secrecy, so be as open and asmatter of fact as possible. Whensharing information with schools,it is often helpful to have yourchild's pediatrician or mental healthspecialist write a letter to providespecific information as needed.ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS Advocacy organizations teach parents and families how to advocate for the education,health, and socio-economic well-being of their children andfamilies.

Maternal depressionduring this time can change analready challenging adventure into apotentially overwhelming one.Depression can cause distress, canimpair parenting, and can impact amother's relationship with her babyand other family members. There are 3 forms of maternal depression: baby blues, postpartumpsychosis, and postpartum depression.Each one varies greatly in severity,duration, and impairment. BABY BLUES is the least severe and most common type of maternaldepression. Symptoms usually includeepisodes of crying, mood swings, andworry. Symptoms usually start within the first few days following childbirth, and may last for a fewhours up to several days. Although distressing, the symptoms do notcause significant parenting problems.POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS is a rare, yet very severe, mental illness.Symptoms include depression, alongwith hallucinations or delusions.These symptoms cause majorproblems with a new mother's abilityto function. This illness usuallyrequires that the mother behospitalized. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION is the third type of maternal depression.Typical signs and symptoms ofpostpartum depression include: Loss of pleasure or interest in usual activities Sleep and appetite changes Cognitive disturbances Loss of energy Recurrent thoughts of death These symptoms co-occur for at least a two-week period of time.

Depression iscalled postpartum depression if the symptoms begin within the first 3 months following childbirth. Postpartum depression does not just affect the mother. It can be harmful to the baby and the entire family. Postpartum depression has been associated with problems with infant development, poor parent-childinteractions, and unhealthy family functioning.Women at-risk for postpartum depression can be identified early(even during pregnancy) byevaluatng whether they have ahistory of depression.

Childcare providers who provide care for more than 3 children in a home or center must belicensed by The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). STATE AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS: At state and community programs, the professionals will vary depending on the type of program. In particular, Early Intervention staff may include medicaldoctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, or advanced practice registered nurses, depending on the site. Formore information on mental health specialists, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT .115 TIP Childcare providers can also be valuable partners in your child'smental healthcare. If you feelcomfortable, let your childcareprovider know your child's mentalhealth issues and treatmentplan. They may be able tosupport your efforts through theirchildcare program.Under the Individuals with Disabilities EducationAct (IDEA), the samerights are guaranteed tochildren, ages 3 to 5, aschildren who attendpublic schools. If yourchild is not enrolled inschool because they areunder age 5, the schoolsystem is still responsiblefor getting your child theservices he or she needs.EVALUATIONS In addition to the evaluations available through your child' s pediatrician and possibly the school system, there are many opportunities foryour child to receive mental health and development evaluations: CHILDCARE PROVIDERS: Whether your child attends a childcare program in a family childcare home or a center-based program,many childcare providers informally evaluate your child' sdevelopment. In addition, some childcare providers conductdevelopmental screenings for children. The childcare programwill screen the child while in their care and give you results. STATE AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS: Evaluations are offered through a variety of state agency and community-basedprograms. For more information on these programs, see theresources listed below. For more information about the different types of evaluations thatmental health specialists can perform, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) . SERVICES OFFERED The options for early childhood services vary depending on thechild' s age. Children, birth to age 3, may be eligible to receive services through Early Intervention (EI). EI is a statewide, family-centered programthat promotes the growth and development of infants and t oddlers116 Parents may call any Early Intervention (EI) site if they have concerns abouttheir newborn, infant, or toddler. When a child is referred to EI, eligibility is determined through an EI evaluation. The purpose of theevaluation process includes not only eligibility determination, but also information gathering forplanning purposes and answering family questions regarding their child's development.A child may be eligible for EI if he or she is under age 3 and is experiencing delays in development, has certaindiagnosed condition or conditions, or has circumstances that may result in significant delays in development. After a child is determined eligiblefor EI, the family works with a team of professionals to design a plancalled the Individualized Family Services Plan. This plan outlines the child's strengths and needs and is developed based on the result of the evaluation and the concernsof the family.Families serve as key members of theteam in the plan development toensure that it is realistic and workable for both their child and family. Theplan, once completed, will identifysupports and services necessary forthe child and family to meet desiredgoals. For a listing of EI sites, turnto page 174 in ADDITIONAL RESOURCES .Accessing Early Interventionwith developmental challenges. EI helps eligible children and families get the supports and services necessary to meet their goals. EI serves any eligible child regardless of ability to pay. For more information on EI, turn to page 174 in ADDITIONAL RESOURCES . Children, ages 3 to 5, who have special needs, may be eligible toreceive special education services through the school system, evenif they are not yet enrolled in public school. Ask your local schooldepartment to help you get a referral for an evaluation for specialeducation services. If an evaluation is conducted and your child iseligible for special education services, the school system will workwith you to determine which services and/or supports will beoffered, as well as how and where to provide them. Services may beprovided in a child' s home, childcare program, or local publicschool. For more information on the school system, turn to page118 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT . RESOURCES In addition, the following state agency and community programscan provide you with information and services that you need tohelp care for your child. For more information on any of theseprograms, turn to ADDITIONAL RESOURCES (p165) . CEDARR FAMIL Y CENTERS: CEDARR stands for Comprehensive Evaluation, Diagnosis, Referral and Re-Evaluation. Thesecenters offer families information on specific diagnoses andtreatment options and can help make appropriate referrals CHILD CARE SUPPORT NETWORK (CCSN): CCSN provides health and mental health consultation to child care centers and familychildcare homes throughout the state. CHILD OUTREACH: All children, ages 3 to 5, are eligible for a free Child Outreach Screening. This brief screening evaluates a child' s abilities in specific areas. EARL Y HEAD START .

WATCH ME GROW RHODE ISLAND: This program works with pediatricians and childcare providers to get them to conduct developmental screenings and refer parents to services when needed.117The School System The school system is an important part of the mental healthcare system. The school system can be the main point of entry into themental healthcare system for parents. It can be the first place thatsomeone may notice signs and symptoms of a mental health issuein a child. It can be the place where a child receives an evaluation.It can also be a parent' s source for information and referral toresources and treatment outside the school setting. The main role of a school system is to provide your child with an education. Sometimes mental health issues can affect a child' sbehavior, ability to learn, and interactions with peers and adults inschool. If your child has a mental health issue that is affecting hisor her learning, then the school system aims to understand yourchild' s needs and works to ensure that the school environmentsupports your child' s learning. School professionals may be involved in many of the steps in helping a child with a mental health issue: RECOGNITION: School professionals may be involved in the initial recognition of any signs and symptoms of a mentalhealth issue. Your child spends a lot of time at school, sosometimes a teacher or administrator may be the first person torecognize an issue. EVALUATION: School professionals may also be involved in the initial evaluation of your child' s mental health. These evaluationsare focused on your child' s learning and educational needs.However, mental health issues may surface in these evaluations. REFERRAL: School professionals may be able to refer you to mental health specialists or programs outside the school system. SUPPORT: School professionals may also be able to provide on- going support and follow-up through individual meetings withyour child, support groups, or school-based activities.118Parents of children underage 3 should contactEarly Interventionto seek help for theirchildren. If your childis over age 3, even if heor she is not in school,you should contact yourlocal school department. TIP Don't forget about the teacher! Remember to include your child'steacher when getting help for yourchild. Your child's teacher has themost direct interaction with yourchild of any school professionaland can offer valuable insight intoyour child's behaviors. Your child's teacher can also connect you with other school professionals who m a yb ea b l et oh e l p .TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS School professionals include administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, teachers' assistants, andschool nurse teachers. Mental health specialists who work specifically for the school system include school psychologists, school counselors, or school social wor kers. These school mental health specialists offer various levels of support and treatment. Sometimes they will meet with a child or parent to discuss andwork out emotional or behavioral issues. If they suspect that achild has a mental health issue, they generally refer him or her to amental health specialist outside the school. They may follow upwith the child in school to monitor and support his or her ongoingmental health as it relates to his or her school success. School mental health specialists SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS are mental health specialists with a master's degree in social work.They are clinically trained, meaningthey have spent a good part oftheir education and training workingwith clients. They hold a license fromthe Rhode Island Department of Health as either a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) or Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker(LICSW). They also hold a certificationfrom the Rhode Island Department of Education. School social workers conduct evaluations and facilitate services for all students, their families,a n ds c h o o ls t a f f ,r e l a t e dt oa student's social, emotional, and mental health needs. School social workers are the direct link amonghome, school, and community services.SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS are educators who have post-Masters degree training in psychology,learning theory, and education.They hold a certification from theRhode Island Department ofEducation and may also be certifiedby the National School Psychology Certification Board. School psychologists participate in theevaluation of student's eligibility for special education services, including evaluating academic skills and learning. They also evaluate learning environments, design and evaluateprograms for academic and behavior management, and use evidence- based research to develop and recommend effective interventions.SCHOOL COUNSELORS (formerly guidance counselors) are educators who have a Master's degree (or thesubstantial equivalent) in schoolcounseling. They hold a certificationfrom the Rhode Island Department of Education. They possess thequalifications and skills to addressacademic, career development, and personal needs of students. School counselors offer academic guidanceand support services, including: organizational, study, and test-taking skills; and career awareness, exploration, and planning services. School counselors workcollaboratively with other schoolstaff to help all students besuccessful academically, vocationally,and personally.119 For more information on mental health specialists outside the school system, turn to page 106 in MENTAL HEAL TH SUPPORT .EVALUATIONS School mental health specialists use methods similar to other mental health specialists to better understand your child' s abilitiesand needs, to determine possible mental health issues, and tomake referrals as necessary. In the schools, evaluations are usedspecifically to determine if a child has a disability and is in need ofspecial education services. Schools may have their own staffconduct evaluations or, in other cases, schools may have outsideconsultants conduct evaluations. The following is a list ofevaluations that may be performed and the type of professionalresponsible for performing the evaluation. Social Assessments and Family History: School Social Worker Medical Evaluation: Pediatrician Developmental Evaluation (children, ages 3 to 5): Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician Psychological Evaluation (also called a Cognitive Evaluation): School Psychologist Speech-Language Evaluation (also called Language and Communication Evaluation): Speech-Language Pathologist Educational Evaluation: Diagnostic Prescription T eacher, Special Education T eacher, or School Psychologist Sensory or Fine Motor Evaluation: Occupational Therapist Physical Development or Gross Motor Evaluation: Physical Therapist Adapted Physical Educational Evaluation: School Adapted Physical Education T eacher Functional Behavioral Assessment: School Evaluation T eam or other team, including the parents, teachers, and other schoolprofessionals listed above, as needed For more information, turn to MENTAL HEAL TH EVALUATIONS (p39) .120Functional BehavioralAssessment is a problem-solving process forpromoting positive behavior.The beyondthe behavior itself and triesto find specific social,emotional, environmental,or cognitive factors thatcontribute to the behavior.A plan is developed toaddress the specific problembehaviors and developmore positive, productivebehaviors. TIP Think about getting an independent evaluation outside the school.These are usually more in-depthand may offer more insight intoyour child's health. This independent evaluation can also provide supporting documentation if a parent disagrees with the school's evaluation results or services. Check with your health insurance company first, however. Each plan has their own criteria for what costs the plan will cover for evaluations outside the school. Also, let the school know that you are having your child independently evaluated. Schools need to take the results into account, but do not necessarily have to follow the evaluation's recommendations.TIP To ensure good continuity in care, ask the school to identify oneschool professional who will serveas the contact person for your child'smental healthcare providers outsidethe school. 121Special education regulations in RhodeIsland are currentlybeing revised. Formore information,visit www.ride.ri.govSERVICES OFFERED The school system uses a variety of techniques to promote mentalhealth in the classroom, as well as respond to the needs of a childwith a mental health issue. POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORT (PBIS): PBIS is a model for creating effective school-wide practices thatprovide students with positive supports. These supports encouragepositive relationships, social development, and productivebehavior. For more information, visit www.pbis.org. RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION (RTI): RTI is the practice of providing research-based interventions to children who arehaving difficulty learning in regular classrooms. Children areclosely observed and their responses are charted to see if thoseinterventions help the child meet learning expectations. Whenan intervention does not work, the intervention is adjusted orchanged. The child' s progress is then again carefully observedand charted. In cases where a child does not make progress, anevaluation may be used to see if the child has a learning disorder.The information gathered during the RTI process offers a newapproach to evaluating learning disorders. Rather than consideringa child' s test scores, the evaluation team carefully considers theRTI information and what this information shows about thechild' s learning abilities and needs. For more information, visitwww.interventioncentral.com or www.ritap.org/rti. SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES: The school system is responsible for providing special education for children, ages 3 to 21, with disabilities who require special services under IDEA(Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). Special educationservices are education services designed to meet the c hild' s unique learning needs in the least restrictive environment. A child' s Individualized Education Plan (IEP) describes special education and related services necessary for the child to access and make progress in the general education curriculum. The amount and type of special education services a child receives depends upon the unique needs of the child and is an IEP teamdecision. There are a variety of different levels of specialeducation services. For more information, visit www.ride.ri.gov.122Accessing special education services involves multiple steps. Use theoutline below to navigate your waythrough the process. STEP 1: REFERRAL A parent, healthcare provider,teacher, or other professional canmake a referral for special educationservices for a child who may have adisability. The referral is made to adesignated person or office in theschool district. Although this varies from district to district, the referral is often made to the Director of SpecialEducation or the building principal atthe elementary level, or the Directorof Guidance at the secondary level.(Contact the Special Education Officein your local school district todetermine the designated person oroffice.) Once received, the referralmust be forwarded to an evaluationteam within 10 days.STEP 2: EVALUATION Your child's evaluation team couldinclude: You, the parents General education teachers Special education teachers A representative of the local school district Individuals who can determine teaching needs based on evaluation results Other individuals who have knowledge or expertise regardingyour child The school system has ten school days upon the receipt of the referral tohold a meeting of the evaluationteam. The evaluation team meets toreview the referral with you anddetermine if your child needs to beevaluated. The purpose of evaluationis to get more information about thechild's educational needs. If needed,the team decides which evaluationsshould be done. If the evaluation team decides that evaluations are not needed, the teammust notify the parents in writing ofits decision and the reasons for itwithin 10 school days. If the parentdoes not agree, then he or she mayrequest mediation or a due processhearing to resolve the issue (p134). The evaluation team should also consider a referral for a 504 plan.If the evaluation team decides that evaluations are needed, parents will be asked to sign a Consent toEvaluate form. This form gives theschool system permission to evaluatethe child in the areas agreed upon.The school s ystem has 60 calendar days, including weekends and holidays, to evaluate the child, completewritten reports, and meet with theparents. Upon completion of the evaluations, the evaluation team will reconvene with the family to discussthe child's evaluation results anddetermine if the child is eligible toreceive special education services. Accessing special education Students not eligible for special education services may be provided for under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a broad civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination against individuals based solely upon their disability. School systems who receive federal funds are required to have a process to identify students with disabilities as defined under Section 504 and to develop 504 plans which provide reasonable accommodations for the student to access education programs or activities.For more information, contact your local school department and ask for the 504 plan coordinator.TIP Ask for information about the parent advisory committee inyour local school district. Theparent advisory committee is agroup of parents who meet withthe school department, typicallywith the Special EducationDirector, on a regular basis.The parents on the committeegive their advice, input, andfeedback on issues related tospecial education services.There is also a parent advisorycommittee on the state level.123STEP 3: INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN (IEP) Once your child is determined eligible for special education services,an IEP is developed. The IEP is a legaldocument. It serves as a writtenagreement between the schooldistrict and the parents about how tomeet each of the child's needs thatresult from the child's disability. The IEP is developed by an IEP team. All school professionals who are orwill be involved in educating yourchild should be a part of the IEP team. Your child's IEP team must include: You, the parents General education teachers Special education teachers A representative of the local school district Individuals who can determine teaching needs based on theevaluation results Other individuals who have knowledge or expertise regardingyour child (for example, your child'smental healthcare providers orother providers, such as a physicalor occupational therapist or home-based therapy agencyrepresentative) In addition, parents have the right toinvite other individuals who they feel should be part of the IEP team.An initial meeting is held to develop an IEP for your child (and annuallyafter that). The date and time of theIEP meeting should be convenient forboth the parents and schoolprofessionals. A notification of themeeting should be sent to everyonewho is invited to the meeting. The opening of the meeting should include introductions of allparticipants so that everyone has a clear understanding of who the parti-cipants are and what their role is in the development of the child's program. During the meeting, participants should: Create a list of the child's strengths, abilities, and interests. Identify the needs of the child. Review the specific skills the child is demonstrating in identified areasof need, based on informationfrom current evaluations and directand indirect observations. Discuss how the strengths, needs, and skills of the child relate to thegeneral curriculum. Discuss how the child is currently participating in the educationalprogram and activities (presentlevel of functioning). Discuss the development skills that would follow the present level offunctioning. Set reasonable long-term goals for skills that could be learned duringa one-year time frame. If needed, write short-term objectives, as well.Short-term objectives are createdwhen a child has impairments that significantly affect his or her ability to function day to day. Figure out what kinds of supplementary services and modifications the student needs tomeet goals and objectives. Focus on the amount of time that the child will need from different providers to make progress.STEP 4: LOCATION OF SERVICES During an initial IEP meeting,participants discuss where specialeducation and other related serviceswill take place. The Individuals withDisabilities Education Act (IDEA)presumes that a child will be educatedin the regular education classroom inthe school that the child would attendif not disabled, with the appropriatesupplementary aids, services,program modifications, and supportsto school staff. Before a child can beplaced outside of the regulareducation classroom, the full rangeof supplementary aids and servicesthat would facilitate the child's placement in the regular educationclassroom must be considered. If the IEP team decides that a particular child cannot be educatedsatisfactorily in the regular educationclassroom, even with appropriatesupplementary aids and services,that child could then be placed in asetting other than the regulareducation classroom. For moreinformation on specialty schools,turn to page 195 in ADDITIONAL RESOURCES . In all cases, decisions must beindividually determined on the basisof each child's abilities and needs,and not solely on factors such as: Category of disability Significance of disability Availability of special education and other related services Configuration of the service delivery system Availability of space Administrative convenience Rather, each student's IEP forms the basis for the decisions.HOW THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WORKS WITHIN THE MENTAL HEAL THCARE SYSTEM The school system can work with your child' s pediatrician, your child' s mental health specialists, and your family to address yourchild' s educational needs. School psychologists, school socialworkers, and school counselors may follow up with a child' smental health specialists to ensure that the child receives the rightcare and support at school. School nurses work with mentalhealthcare providers outside the school to follow through with achild' s medication plan within the school environment. LIMITATIONS Although school professionals continue to strive to betterunderstand mental health issues, some may not have a high levelof knowledge about mental health issues. Schools sometimes lackthe resources to fully accommodate children with mental health Procedural Safeguards Procedural Safeguards are parents' rights specified by state and federal law. The local school district must ensure that parents fully understandtheir rights in the special education system. These are often referred to as \"due process\" rights. Parents are entitled to a written copy of their Procedural Safeguards: At the very first step of the special education services referral process Whenever they request an evaluation At least once a year while their child has an IEP Any time that they request them In the event that they find it necessary to file a complaint Procedural Safeguards must be provided in language understandable to parents. Parents are entitled to an explanation of the Procedural Safeguards, as well as any needed clarification in parents' native language. Procedural Safeguards include ways to resolve disagreements during the referral, evaluation, or IEP team processes. At any time tha t parents find that they disagree with school professionals, they are encouraged to ask the sch ool to explain their rights. For more information on parents' rights, contact an advocacy organization (p104). 124issues who have special needs. T eachers and administrators also may interpret signs and symptoms of mental health issues asbehavioral problems. Families may contact school mental health specialists for assistance in advocating for the needs of their child within the school.School mental health specialists work with the family to identifyadditional resources both within the school and in the communityso that a child' s emotional, social, and academic needs are met.

If you choose to hand deliver the written request to the school,make sure the person who receives the request signs it with his or her name, title, and the date. Have them make you acopy of the request with that information on it. You can also send a written request in the mail. At the post office, ask for Certified Signature Request service. You will get notified when the school gets the letter. Either way, you will have a record that a request was made. Behavioral problems may be a sign of anunderlying mentalhealth issue. If yourchild is amental health specialist.Your child's IEP is an important component of his or her care. Parentsmay feel that they have little tocontribute in an IEP meeting andmay see themselves as \"amateurs\"and school staff as \"professionals.\"But parents can and should play avital role in writing their child'seducational program. Parents AREpart of the team and parentfeedback, comments, and concernsare important.HERE ARE SOME TIPS TO HELP YOU PREPARE FOR AND MAKE APOSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TOYOUR CHILD'S IEP MEETING: Keep a file, binder, or notebook on your child's educational history.

When a mentalhealthcare provider makes a diagnosis, he or sheevaluates the degree to which the particular illness isaffecting your child in order to recommend appropriatetreatment. However, there are certain levels and typesof treatment that may be helpful for you to understandas you advocate for the best care for your child. This section describes the different levels of treatment for your child, from emergency services to outpatient care. It also describes the different types oftreatment: psychotherapy, trainings, and medications. For the types oftreatment related to specific mental health diagnoses, turn to COMMON MENTAL HEAL TH DIAGNOSES (p51) .7 147 147 There are many other types of treatment besides those listed in this guide. The ones listed here areevidence-based treatments, meaning they havebeen studied extensively and proven to work.This does not mean that other treatments maynot work for your child. However, it is importantto be extremely cautious in choosing alternativetreatments for your child. Always do yourhomework and talk to your child's treatmentproviders. Some of these treatments don't work,can interact with your child's other treatments,or even worse, can be harmful to your child.Treating the child, not the diagnosis For most medical problems, a d iagnosis leads to proper and effective treatment. For children affected by a mental illness, however, a diagnosis may not always leadto a specific and effective treatment. Inorder to properly treat a child, a providerneeds to look beyond the diagnosis andtake into account how a child functions inhis or her family, school, peer group, andcommunity. Some things to consider (andmake sure your provider is considering): Mental illnesses exist on a continuum. A continuum means that there are different levels of severity for eachmental illness. Signs and symptomscan range from mild to severe andare usually not the same for each child. Children with the same illness may not act the same, show the same signs and symptoms, or need the same treatment. In fact, treatment options for a mental illness will vary depending on how mild or severe the symptoms are. Children with a mental illness are still children, which means they areconstantly developing, growing, andchanging. Because of this, treating children with a mental illness requires a different approach. Children will need to be re-evaluated as they develop. A child may get diagnosed and treated for one illness, when in fact he or she has more than one illness. Or perhaps he or she does not even have the originally diagnosed illness, but a completely different one. For all these reasons, it is important to treat the child, rather than just thediagnosis!Levels of Treatment Services Depending on your child' s situation, he or she may need different levels of care. The following list describes the different levels oftreatment services and where you can access them. EMERGENCY SERVICES: These services are for children who need immediate evaluations because there is concern aboutsafety\u2014either the child is in danger of hurting him or herself oranother person. Children may also need emergency services ifthey are completely unable to function (for example, are unableto take care of themselves, have isolated themselves from familyor friends, have refused to go to school, or are out of control insome way). These services are available at mental healthhospitals and community mental health centers. CRISIS SERVICES: These services are for children who need an urgent evaluation within 48 hours. These services help tostabilize crises and refer children and their families to lessintensive services. These services are available at mental healthhospitals and some community mental health centers. OFFICE-BASED OUTPATIENT SERVICES: These services include evaluations, psychotherapy, trainings, and medicationmanagement. These services are available primarily atcommunity mental health centers, although some mentalhealth hospitals offer outpatient services.148 INTENSIVE NON-RESIDENTIAL OUTPATIENT SERVICES: These services are available for children who need intensive treatment for mental health issues. These children need more than regularoutpatient care, but they are still able to live at home. There areonly a few of these programs in the state, located at hospitals, inthe community, and at community mental health centers. Thereare two main types of intensive non-residential outpatientservices: \u00bb PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM (PHP): In PHP , a child spends about 4 to 6 hours per day in treatment for 5 to 7 daysa week. A child and adolescent psychiatrist and a nurse, aswell as possibly other mental health specialists, providetreatment. \u00bb INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM (IOP): IOP is a less intensive program than PHP . In IOP , a child spends 2 to 3hours per day in treatment for 2 to 5 times per week. Amental health specialist is involved in the child' s treatment,but it may or may not be a child and adolescent psychiatrist. RESIDENTIAL SERVICES: These services are for children who need short-term or long-term (from a few months to a year ormore) intensive treatment and are not able to live at home.These services are offered at some mental health hospitals, butare mostly located at community organizations. These servicesare not offered at community mental health centers. For moreinformation on residential programs, turn to page 190 in ADDITIONAL RESOURCES .

Apsychotherapist can be a psychologist, psychiatrist, advancedpractice registered nurse, a social worker, or a licensed mentalhealth counselor. Psychotherapy can take place in a provider' s officeat a hospital, clinic, mental health center, or private practice. T o find a psychotherapist, get a referral from your child' s pediatrician. You can also get a recommendation from your child' sschool, childcare provider, or other parents or friends. You can alsocall your insurance company for help finding a psychotherapist. There are a variety of different types of psychotherapy. Individual, family, and group psychotherapy, as well as parent-childinteraction therapy, are described below. INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOTHERAPY This type of psychotherapy takes place one-on-one with just thepsychotherapist and the patient. There are numerous different typesof individual psychotherapy. Some of the different types include: COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT): This form of psychotherapy is primarily used to treat depression and anxiety,but there are other uses for CBT as well. CBT helps people tounderstand the connections between their thoughts, feelings,and behaviors. CBT is very collaborative between the patientand the psychotherapist and requires that the patient do\"homework\" outside of sessions. DIALECTICAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (DBT): This form of psychotherapy is primarily used to treat people who have poorcoping skills and very strong emotions. DBT combines CBTskills and mindfulness training and uses individual, group, andfamily psychotherapy components. DBT is also verycollaborative between the patient and the psychotherapist andrequires that the patient do \"homework\" outside of sessions.150 INTERPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY (IPT): This form of psychotherapy helps depressed children understand and resolve problems that they have with other people that may make theirdepression worse. IPT is only used over a short period of time.The kinds of issues discussed include social isolation, grief,transitions to a new role (for example, college, new sibling orstep-parent), and role disputes (for example, who is in charge). PSYCHODYNAMIC PSYCHOTHERAPY: This form of psychotherapy is primarily used to treat patients who havepatterns of behavior that are not effective for them in their lives.It involves regular sessions with the focus on developing astrong trusting relationship with the psychotherapist in whichthe patient is safe to explore their interpersonal interactions.For young children, this psychotherapy often takes the form of\"play therapy,\" where the psychotherapist will interact with thechild while the child plays. FAMIL Y PSYCHOTHERAPY This form of psychotherapy is used to treat family problems. Thepsychotherapist considers the family, not the individual, as theunit of treatment and emphasizes relationships andcommunication patterns between people as the focus of work tobe done in treatment. In children, family psychotherapy is usuallydone in addition to individual psychotherapy, as a child' s behaviorhas an impact on the parents and parents can have an impact ontheir child' s behavior.Psychoeducation When a child develops a mental health issue, the child, parents, and other familymembers need specific information aboutwhat is happening\u2014the diagnosis, themeaning of specific symptoms, what isknown about the causes, effects, andimplications of the mental health issue.The more the family knows, the less theywill blame the child who is experiencing it,or themselves for thinking they somehow caused it. Psychoeducation is the education of the child, parents, and family members about the child's mental health issue andtreatment. It includes information on howto recognize signs of relapse, so that thechild can get necessary treatment before ithappens. It also involves teaching copingstrategies and problem-solving skills toparents and other family members to helpthem deal more effectively with the child.In addition, psychoeducation providesthe child and family an idea of whatthey can expect with the child's mentalhealth issue over time. All treatment of children's mental health issues should include some level of psychoeducation. However,psychoeducation is particularly importantin the treatment of anxiety disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD), Bipolar Disorder, depression,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Schizophrenia. For example, if a child hasan anxiety disorder, psychoeducation canhelp the child, parents, and other familymembers understand what triggers ananxiety attack so they can defuse thesituation and prevent a crisis. Through psychoeducation, children, parents, and other family members gain insight and learn skills that will reducesdistress, confusion, and anxiety within the family and complement the child'streatment\u2014all lending to the success ofthe child's treatment. 151GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY Group psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy where a small group of patients meet regularly to talk, interact, and discussproblems with each other and the psychotherapist (also called agroup leader). Group psychotherapy can include elements of CBT ,DBT , and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Group psychotherapyattempts to give individuals a safe and comfortable place wherethey can work out problems and emotional issues. Patients gaininsight into their own thoughts and behavior and offer suggestionsand support to others. In addition, patients who have a difficulttime with interpersonal relationships can benefit from the socialinteractions that are a basic part of the group psychotherapyexperience. Sometimes it is easier for children to hear feedbackfrom their peers than from a psychotherapist; this is a strength ofthis form of treatment. PARENT -CHILD INTERACTION THERAPY (PCIT) This type of therapy involves both the parent and the child.PCIT focuses on the relationship between the two, and is usedspecifically for young children.152 In some cases, team-basedtreatment is recommended.This means that theremay be multiple mentalhealthcare providersworking withyou and your child to treatyour child's mental illness.There also may be multipleforms of treatment goingon as well. It is essentialthat you and your child'spediatrician be includedin this treatment team.Trainings Trainings are a form of treatment that focus on educating the child and the parents on ways to improve the mental health of the child.Trainings are usually done in combination with psychotherapy.There are a variety of different types of trainings. Parent managementtraining and skills building trainings are described here. PARENT MANAGEMENT TRAINING Parent management training (PMT) is a form of treatmentrecommended for families of children with oppositional defiantdisorder or other disruptive behaviors. PMT teaches parents tochange their own behaviors and thereby alter their child's problembehavior in the home. It works to alter the patterns of negativeparent-child interactions that often start in early childhood.Parents learn to pay attention to a child' s positive and socially-appropriate behavior. If a child misbehaves, parents learn to useconsequences that are effective, brief, and not physically oremotionally harmful to the child. SKILLS BUILDING TRAINING Skills building training involves working with the individual,family, or group to build skills that are necessary for good mentalhealth. These trainings can be a part of any psychotherapy. Thereare a variety of types of skills building trainings. Some of thedifferent types include: BIOFEEDBACK TRAINING: A form of treatment that teaches a person how to decrease their anxiety and muscle tension (for example, headaches or pain) by using electronic feedback of hand temperature or muscle tension. The person learns how to deeply relax in a way that is easy to see, hear, and understand. COPING SKILLS TRAINING: This type of training is used to help children develop the skills needed for dealing with stressful situations. These skills help children to understand stressful situations, take appropriate actions, and be effective at solvingproblems.153 RELAXATION SKILLS TRAINING: Relaxation skills are useful for everyone, but they have been found to be particularly helpful for people with anxiety. Relaxing includes both clearing themind and calming the body. Some of the relaxation techniquesthat are most helpful for children include abdominal breathing,guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation. SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING: This type of training is usually conducted either in group or individual psychotherapy. Itfocuses on developing a child' s social skills, such as skillsneeded for communication, decision-making, problem solving,and friendships. These are skills necessary for developing andmaintaining positive social relationships with others. 154 If you feel overwhelmed, it's important to find different ways to cope with the stress of caring for a child with mental health issues. Try the following healthy ways to handle stress: Exercise Spend time with friends Watch movies Listen to music Talk to other parents Participate in support groups Make time for yourself Make time for fun Learn how to relax Family counseling can also help parents and siblings manage the stress that goes with having a child in thefamily who is struggling with mental health issues. Also, stress management tech niques, including deep breathing and guided imagery, can be very helpful. Complementary therapies, such as mindful meditat ion, acupuncture, massage therapy, and Reiki, can also reduce stress.Dealing with stress Medications Medications can be an effective part of the treatment for children' s mental illnesses, but they should not be used alone.
