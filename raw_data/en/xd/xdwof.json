People have been sensing energy and messages from stones since time immortal. Crystal healing isn't \"new age\" - it is a very ancient practice that is [older than medicine or religion](https://moonrisecrystals.com/ancient-origin-of-healing-crystals/). When we use crystals, we are tapping into a universal energy that crosses all boundaries of race, gender, age, religion, and politics. Crystal healing works because it taps into the part of us that is simply human. Regardless of whether or not you feel crystal energy, you can still benefit from crystal healing. They can be used as talismans (objects that evoke good energy) and amulets (objects that protect against bad energy). You can work with a single stone or in combination. Sometimes the combinations are very intricate and complex, others are very simple. There is no \"right way\" to use crystals. Each person should follow the path that suits their own comfort and growth. Please use wisdom when considering crystal therapies for healing. Crystals are frequently used in pagan rites and by individuals who consider themselves \"spiritual\" rather than religious. But, crystals are also commonly used by members of all the major religions. Some people believe the crystals have a power, while others believe the crystals are a tool to connect to a Higher Power. What's important is how our beliefs expressed in actions and words. The purpose of healing crystals is to help people feel good and behave in ways that bring Light and Love into the world.
