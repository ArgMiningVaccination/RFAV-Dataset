Those aged 6 months and older can receive the injectable vaccine unless contraindicated. The flu vaccine does not protect against the common cold and respiratory infections caused by other viruses, such as COVID-19. The quadrivalent injectable vaccine, which contains 4 different strains of the flu virus, is recommended for people aged 6 months and over with chronic illnesses. For a child younger than 9 years, 2 doses of the vaccine, given 1 month apart, are required when it is a first vaccination against the flu. For the 2022-2023 season, the vaccine offered through the Qu\u00e9bec Flu Vaccination Program contains the (H3N2) B/Austria/1359417/2021/Victoria lineage B/Phuket/3073/2013 B/Yamagata lineage To find out all the details on the flu vaccination campaign in each region of Qu\u00e9bec and to book an appointment, see the page Flu Vaccination Program. Symptoms after vaccination Some symptoms may be caused by the vaccine, such as redness at the injection site. Other problems may occur by chance and are not related to the vaccine, such as cold, gastro or headache. The injectable flu vaccine is safe. Most reactions are harmless and do not last long. Nature and frequency of possible reactions to vaccine Frequency Possible reactions to vaccine In most cases (more than 50% of people) Pain at injection site Very often (less than 50% of people) Redness and swelling at injection site Muscle pain, joint pain, headache, fatigue Loss of appetite, drowsiness (difficulty staying awake), irritability Often (less than 10% of people) Bruising or itching at injection site Fever, chills and discomfort, particularly in people receiving the flu vaccine for the first time Swelling of the face (this reaction is also part of ORS) Redness of the skin Dizziness Swollen glands Rarely (less than 1 person in 1,000) Seizures (the body stiffens, and muscles contract in a jerky and involuntary manner) Numbness, neuralgia (pain along the course of a nerve) Extremely rare reactions Extremely rare reactions may occur after a flu vaccine. The Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is one such reaction. This syndrome causes progressive paralysis, meaning that one or more parts of the body go numb until you are no longer able to move. This paralysis eventually disappears, but it can sometimes leave permanent effects. The cause of GBS is unknown. In most cases, GBS occurs following infection of the intestines or lungs. It mostly affects young adults and people aged 60 years and older. The risk of having Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after receiving a flu vaccine, if such risk exists, is extremely low. In fact, there is less of a chance of developing GBS after flu vaccination than after contracting an infection such as the flu. Serious allergic reactions are also extremely rare. What to do after vaccination Tips to follow immediately following vaccination Wait 15 minutes before leaving premises where vaccine is received. If an allergic reaction occurs, the symptoms will appear a few minutes after the vaccination. If you feel side effects, immediately inform the person giving the vaccine. That person will be able to treat you immediately. Tips to follow at home If you experience redness, pain or swelling at the injection site, apply a cold, damp compress on it. Use medication for fever or discomfort if needed. When to seek medical help See a doctor if one of the following applies "}
