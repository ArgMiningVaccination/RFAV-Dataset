Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. 2 June 2023 EMA/213341/2020 Rev. 51 EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines [OBSOLETE2] The European Medicines Agency (EMA) together with the responsible scientific committees and their working parties , and in collaboration with the European Commission, operates rapid procedures to support the development and evaluation of treatments and vaccine s for COVID -19. The EMA emerging health threats plan foresees that detailed procedures are set -up to adapt different types of review activities to the n eeds of the health threat/crisis situation. Whilst respecting the regulatory requirement s and established review principles (e.g. independence of experts), these procedures aim , within timelines that are appropriate for the public health emergency situation , to provide most efficient management of product- review activities leading to scientific ally sound and robust outcomes. The EMA Emergenc y Task Force (ETF)3, coordinates and enables fast regulatory action on the development, authorisation and safety monitoring of treatments and vaccines intended for the treatment and prevention of COVID -19. Working with the best experts from within the EU regulatory network, the ETF's activities include providing guidance on development plans of COVID -19 medicines when formal scientific advice is not yet feasible , advising the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on formal scientific advice (rapid or regular - see section 1 ) and , ultimately , on product - related assessments, including those on a rolling basis. For such formal development support and evaluation activities rapid procedures have been established. These procedures are available for products intended for prevention or treatment of COVID -19, including both new products and products already authorised in other conditions. This document provides an overview of EMA's rapid formal review procedures relate d to COVID -19 and is mainly intended as procedural guide for developers. It complements other documents published under the guidance for medicine developers and companies on COVID -19 and the respective guidance provided for regular procedures published on the EMA website for research and development and for marketing authorisation . EMA's rapid formal review procedures related to COVID -19 are outlined in the following sections: 1 Revision 5 updates EMA contact email for development early support interactions and marks the guidance as obsolete due to the end of public health emergency status of COVID -19. 2 This document outlines the acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 products that was applied during the public health emergency from March 2020 until May 2023. Outside the public health emergency status the exceptional measures are no longer applied (albeit some may be applied outside public health emergencies on a case-by-case basis), but they may be considered in case of any future public health emergencies. 3 Before current ETF according to Regulation (EU) 2022/123 came into operation in April 2022, COVID -19 EMA pandemic Task Force (COVID -ETF) was operating under EMA's emerging Health Threats Plan. obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 2/7 1. Rapid scientific advice 2. Rapid agreement of a paediatric investigation plan and rapid compliance check 3. Rolling review 4. Marketing authorisation 5. Extension of indication and extension of marketing authorisation 6. Compassionate Use 7. Other considerations 1. Rapid scientific advice Rapid scientific advice is provided in support of evidence generation planning for treatments and vaccin es for COVID -19. This procedure has been formally established with Regulation (EU) 2022/123, building on the experience gained during the COVID -19 pandemic4. It follow s the general principles of the regular scientific advice but with adaptations to facilitate acceleration . The coordinators for the scientific advice are members of the ETF, including also EMA staff . Each advice is discussed and agreed by the ETF on the basis of the coordinator's report and adopted by the CHMP . Since assessment standards need to be maintained, the level of expedition in providing the scientific advice will depend on the number and complexity of the requests and on the availability of resources in the public health threat situation of COVID -19. The rapid scientific advice process will not be applicable to all scientific advice requests related to an emerging public health threat and regular scientific advice procedu res continue to be used as well. The key features of scientific advice for medicines targeting COVID -19 are the following: There are no pre -specifi ed submission deadlines for developers to submit their submission dossier. There is flexibility regarding the type and exten t of the briefing dossier , which needs to be discussed on a case -by-case basis. This scientific advice is free of charge in accordance with Regulation (EU ) 2022/123 and the EMA Executive Director Decision (EMA/ 534263/202 1). Where scientific advice is accelerated, the total review time from the start to the final advice letter is reduced to 20 days , compared to the regular 40/70 days timeframe . This is achieved through accelerating all milestone stages of the process (assessment report circulation, peer review, adoption). In addition to the formal assessment procedure , also the validation process preceding it is accelerated. Depending on the nature of the request the timelines could be shorte ned even further. The scope and general principles of rapid scientific advice are the same as of regular scientific advice . Any scientific advice is not a pre -assessment of data but rather support s prospective evidence planning . The European regulatory system will make every effort to assist the development of the products by providing relevant rapid feedback . Importantly, the scientific robustness of the advice remains ensured through the involvement of specific experts and the CHMP, which can be enriched 4 A similar procedure was available as an ad hoc procedure earlier during the COVID -19 pandemic. obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 3/7 with additional expertise through the ETF where necessary . The final advice is always adopted by CHMP . To plan for such rapid scientific advice, developers sho uld make the initial contact through the pheearlyinteractions@ema.europa.eu5 mailbox in order to allow review of suitability and maturity of the planned request for the rapid scientific advice procedure. Once agreed, a project manager will be allocated and the request should be sent through the usual work flow for scientific advice (see scientific advice ). Additional guidance and support on the submission will be provided by the EMA Scientific Advice Office. In case of preliminary development plans, not yet suitable for formal scientific advice, early guidance will be provided by the EMA Health Threats and Vaccines Strategy Office and the ETF instead. 2. Rapid agreement of a paediatric investigation plan and rapid compliance check Application s for agreement of a paediatric investigation plan s (PIP), deferrals or waivers for treatments and vaccines for COVID -19 are being reviewed in expedited manner , taking into account applicable legislative requirements . The compliance checks are also be ing expedited. On the basis of the regular processes, a rapid and flexible approach will be identified for each case, whilst preserv ing the scientific robustness of the outcome. The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) is responsible for the scientific assessment of such application s and the ETF provides scientific input. The received a pplications for products intended for prevention or treatment of COVID -19 are prioritised based on their need for acceleration , considering in each case the immediate progress with the development (e.g. initiation of clinical trials in the paediatric population) or the upcoming submission of a marketing authorisation application. The key features of rapid PI P and compliance checks are the following: There are no pre -specifi ed submission deadlines for developers to submit their submission dossier. There is the possibility of a focused scientific documentation to be provided by the developer , which needs to be discussed on a case -by-case basis. The total evaluation time for a paediatric investigation plan (including waiver or deferral) from the start to the adopted PDCO opinion will be reduced to a minimum of 20 days , compared to normally up to 120 days activ e review time. This is achieved through accelerating all milestone stages of the process (validation, s ummary report preparation, peer review, committee discussion, adoption). The exact timelines will depend on the complexity of the PIP , as well as on the preparedness by the sponsor to respond to questions during the evaluation. Following PDCO opinion, the EMA decision will be adopted within 2 days, compared to the usual 10 days. Given that paediatric development needs to be seen fr om a global perspective, it is foreseen to discuss the plan with international regulators during the evaluation. Sponsors are invited to consider outreach to other regulators (e.g. FDA) in parallel to facilitate such exchange. The timelines for a compliance check in advance of a m arketing authorisation application will be defined in accordance with the urgency and can be reduced to 4 days if necessary. 5 Alternatively, during the officially recognised public health emergency due to the COVID -19 pandemic the email address 2019-ncov@ema.europa.eu can also be used obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 4/7 However, in case of non -compliance by the sponsor , these timelines might not be met . Developers are highly recommended to prepare early for such interaction. To enable such acceleration, it is of utmost importan ce that the sponsor is well prepared and the proposed plan is mature. Specifically, also in the current situation, a pplicants are strongly advised to consider the paediatric requirements early in development and to contact the EMA well in advance of submission to prevent any possible delay s. A pre -submission interaction is highly recommended. Submission of applications should follow the usual procedures (see paediatric medicines ), unless stated otherwise in this guidance (e.g. concerning submission deadlines) . Additional guidance and support will be provided by the EMA paediatric medicines office. 3. Rolling review Rolling Review is an ad hoc procedure used in an emergency context to allow EMA to continuously assess the data for an upcoming highly promising application as they bec ome available , i.e. preceding the formal submission of a complete application for a new marketing authorisation ( or for an extension of indication in case of authorised medicines) . Through this process, EMA is able to complete the review of marketing authorisation application dossier earlier while ensur ing robust scientific opinions . Such rolling reviews are conducted under the EMA emerging heal th threats plan and starting them requires specific agreement by the ETF. Use of a rolling review can only be agreed f or products that are of strategic importance in the context of the pandemic , for which the proof of concept has been established based on clinical data, no blocking issues have been identified, and the dossier and manufacturing plans are sufficiently matur e so that application for a (conditional) marketing authorisation can be expected no later than within approx imately 4 months from the start of rolling review . The ETF also act s as forum for discussion on the rolling data assessment and will advise the CHM P on a recommended course of action . As for other procedures , the rolling review assessment is performed by the Rapporteur and Co -rapporteur teams and the outcomes are adopted by the CHMP. The key features of rolling review process are the following: Each Rolling Review submission occurs in eCTD format with a n application form , a Module 2 overview and responses to a cumulative listing of all outstanding questions from previous review cycles. The contents of each rolling review submission ha ve to be pre- agreed between the applicant and the EMA. There can be several Rolling Review cycles with the timelines for assessment and providing questions to the applicant being agreed with Rapporteurs and EMA for each review cycle, based on the content s of the respective submission and the overall time plan for submission of data . Responses to list of questions from previous Rolling Review cycles are ideally to be incorporated into subsequent Rolling Review submissions . While only applications of sufficient maturity are accepted for rolling review , unexpected delays with providing responses to the questions raised or significant delays from the agreed submission schedule may lead to delays in completing the rolling review stage of the application review . Following the rolling review, once the CHMP , based on the advice of the ETF, considers that the data package is sufficiently complete to proceed to formal regulatory submission , submission by the company of the formal marketing authorisation application or extension of indication is expected, which , after validation , will be processed under a shortened timetable (see section s 4 and 5) . The duration of the procedure will depend on the amount of data not yet assessed as part of rolling review cycles. obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 5/7 To plan for such R olling Review, developers should make the initial contact through the pheearlyinteractions@ema.europa.eu mailbox5 in order to allow review of suitability and maturity of the planned submission for appointment of Rapporteurs for potential rolling review 6. Once agreed7, an EMA product lead will be allocated, who will provide guidance and support throughout the procedure . 4. Marketing authorisation Applications for a marketing authorisation for products intended for prevention or treatment of COVID - 19 are treated in an expedited manner . The applicants are advised to contact EMA via email to pheearlyinteractions@ ema.europa.eu5 early in the development to discuss scientific and regulatory aspects of their planned application. Following or in parallel with confirmation of the eligibility to centralised procedure, the EMA Product Lead will be appointed. The EMA Product Lead will liaise with the applicant to understand the proposed submission schedule incl uding the availability of pivotal data . This information will help to estimate the likely start of a possible rolling review and marketing authorisation application review, so that prospective Rapporteurs have some certainty as regards their resource planning. Once the Rapporteurs are appointed, the applicant may request a pre- submission meeting to present their development and submission plans and discuss potential use of rolling review (as described in section 3). Use of a rolling review is expected to lead to finalisation of the marketing authorisation procedure much earlier than with other types of review. Should the applicant not wish to use rolling review or in case the application has not been accepted for such review, the applicant may still apply for accelerated assessment . In such case, the review of the application is started only after validation of a complete application, but the maximum active review time is reduced from 210 to 150 days, which in practice may even be shorter . In addition to the above listed options, should the applicants consider that shortening of procedural timelines would have important public health impact in dealing with COVID -19 pandemic in another context (e.g. a need is identified during a clock -stop of an ongoing procedure) , they are encouraged to contact their EMA Product Lead and provide a description of the expected public health impact and explain how accelerating the assessment would support dealing with COVID -19 pandemic , with a view to agree a shorter review timetable ad hoc (see section 5). EMA also accelerate s the linguistic review process for products intended for prevention or treatment of COVID -19 and works closely with the European Commission, keeping them informed about such applications , to facilitate the acceleration of the decision -making process. 5. Extension of indication and extensio n of marketing authorisation The above -mentioned support measures are also available for already authorised products that are being developed (repurposed) for treatment or prevention of COVID -19. Marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) are encouraged to sha re early information about their planned development for COVID -19 with the EMA (the appointed Product Lead) and the Rapporteurs. They can make use of rapid scientific advice (see section 1) and rapid agreement of a PIP or its modification (see section 2). 6 If considerable amount of data becomes available on products intended for prevention or treatment of COVID -19 after appointment of rapporteurs but before an agreement on rolling revi ew is reached, it may still be possible to arrange sharing this data informally with EMA and the rapporteurs to facilitate familiarisation with the data and preparations for upcoming assessment. 7 The eligibility of the product for centralised procedure also needs to be confirmed, but can be done independently, in advance of Rapporteur appointment. obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 6/7 Should the data on new development become available stepwise (rather tha n from completion of a single pivotal study) , the MAHs may consider applying for a rolling review (see section 3). Alternatively, the MAH s are encouraged to contact their EMA Product L ead and provide a description of how a shorter review timetable for the procedure concerned is expected to have an important public health impact and would support dealing with COVID -19 pandemic . Such possible shortening of procedure timelines will be cons idered by EMA and ETF, as appropriate. EMA also substantially accelerate s the linguistic review process for procedures related to COVID -19 and works closely with the European Commission , keeping them informed about such applications , to facilitate the acceleration of the decision- making process. 6. Compassionate Use Certain unauthorised medicinal products may be made available at national level through compassionate use programmes, even more in an emergency context , in order to facilitate the availability to patients of new treatment options that are under development. While coordination and implementation of a c ompassionate use programme remain competence of a Member State, EMA can provide through the CHMP recommendations for a \"group of patients' on a medicinal product eligible to the centralised procedure, in order to favour a common approach across Member States . Applicant s cannot submit directly to the EMA a request for a CHMP opinion on a compassionate use and should instead contact National Competent A uthorities for any proposals to offer a compassionate use programme . However, developers of products for treatment or pre vention of COVID -19 are encouraged to contact EMA via email to pheearlyinteractions@ema.europa.eu5 and in this context provide also information on compassionate use applications underway at national level (or other use of an unauthorised product for treatment or prevention of COVID -19 under an exemption at national level) . National Competent Authorities should inform EMA if they are making a product available to a group of patients for compassionate use . A CHMP opinion on a compassionate use can only be initiated by the CHMP based on request from a N ational Competent Authority. The ETF will prepare a recommendation for the CHMP with the support of the CHMP Rapporteurs (if already appointed) . Upon initiation of such procedure s, applicant s should be ready to submit their available data. The CHMP can accelerate the procedure and issue an opinion in a short timeframe, depending on the urgency of the situation and the amount of data available. The CHMP opinion on compassionate use will be updated on a regular basis as more data become available (e.g. new safety data). 7. Other consideration s The Priority medicines (PRIME) scheme could be considered by developers to receive enhanced support for the development of treatments or vaccines for COVI D-19. This voluntary scheme is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines. Through such enhanced development support it is envisaged that the evidence generation is optimised, which should also facilitate accelerated assessment at the time of application for a marketing authorisation. In the context of COVID -19 the scheme is predominantly suitable for treatments and vaccines in earlier stages of development. Other options described in this document, including rapid scientific advice and obsolete EMA initiatives for acceleration of development support and evaluation procedures for COVID -19 treatments and vaccines EMA/213341/2020 Page 7/7 rolling review, are expected to remain the main tools for acceleration of procedures in the context of COVID -19 pandemic. Applicatio ns for orphan designation for treatment (or prevention) of COVID -19 are not expected due to the high number of cases of infections in the EU and worldwide. Therefore, no specific consideration is provided in this document regarding rapid reviews of orphan designations. Developers should contact the Orphan Medicines office , in case they wi sh to discuss specific proposals. At the request of EMA Executive director or the European Commission EMA may also adopt a scientific opinion under Article 5(3) of the Regu lation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning treatments against COVID - 19. Timetables applied for such procedures take into account the urgency of the subject matter of the assessment. The ETF can also consider the need to prepare and publish scientific positions to support the Member States or the relevant European Commission bodies such as Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) in their decisions to obtain and/or use specific medicines during a declared public health emergency or in preparation for one. For more detailed advice on use of rapid procedures for post -authorisation activities the marketing authorisation holders for COVID -19 treatments or vaccines are adv ised the contact the respective contact persons in the EMA product team (e.g. the Product Lead or Quality Specialist) . obsolete "}
