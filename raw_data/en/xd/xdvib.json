The Federal Air Surgeon made this determination after evaluation of available medical information about these COVID-19 vaccines and potential side effects. As a result of this determination and consistent with 14 CFR \u00a7 61.53(a), each person subject to part 67 who receives the vaccine must wait 48 hours after each dose before acting as pilot in command or as a required flightcrew member. - In the event that an FAA medical certificate holder experiences side effects after the 48-hour period has elapsed, the medical certificate holder may not act as pilot in command, or in any other capacity as a required flightcrew member as described at [14 CFR \u00a7 61.53(a) for the duration of the symptoms](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d0ec4880b2eeccf160e69d8e956eeb70&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_153&rgn=div8). What duties or activities are permissible during the 48-hour post-vaccination observation period? - The following duties can be performed during the 48-hour post-vaccination observation period: providing/receiving flight simulator or aviation training device instruction, including ground instruction or operational training not involving flight operations; office duty/administrative tasks; dead-heading/jump-seating; and distance learning. Will the experience of individuals receiving the vaccine affect FAA guidance (possible shortening the 48-hour \"No Fly/No Safety-Related Duty\")? - Yes, as additional data becomes available and the medical understanding of the side effect profile matures, the FAA will reevaluate the \"No Fly/No Safety-Related Duty\" "}
