Visitors: Hours for visiting most adult patients are 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Some areas may limit the number of visitors you can have at one time. Masks: Oregon no longer requires masks in health care settings. At OHSU, we still require masks for ages 2 and older: - In areas where patients and staff are at greatest risk. - By patient request. - Based on guidance from the CDC. See where masks are required: [English](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2023-03/OHSU-Mask-Policy-by-Location-March31-2023.pdf) | [Spanish](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2023-04/OHSU-Mask-Policy-by-Location-March31-2023_SPA-US.pdf) OHSU respects all who choose to wear masks, at any time and in any setting. The reasons to wear a mask may be very personal. We expect all OHSU members, patients and visitors to respect this choice. OHSU strongly recommends mask-wearing throughout our health care system, including at OHSU hospitals and clinics, Hillsboro Medical Center and Adventist Health Portland. OHSU highly recommends all patients wear masks when outside their room. OHSU staff will wear masks if asked to do so by patients or family members, and are expected to ask about your masking preference. Please let us know at any time if you would like us to wear masks.

Visitor policy [People with disabilities can have support people](#accordion-1032521-1) Everyone deserves access to health care. People with disabilities have the right to get support from people they trust while they are in the emergency room or hospital. If you have a disability and need help speaking with hospital staff, deciding on health care or doing daily tasks, you can name at least 3 support people (friends, family, paid or unpaid personal care assistant, etc.) to help you. A disability may include a physical, intellectual, behavioral or cognitive impairment, deafness, being hard of hearing or other communication barrier, blindness, autism, or dementia. You can always have 1 support person with you: - In the emergency room - During your hospital stay if you need them to help with your care - For any talk about hospice care - When you discuss or think about signing an advance directive or POLST form Support people must follow OHSU's infection-control standards and OHSU policy for safety. Notes: - The patient or their representative decides whether support is needed. - Treatment should still be guided by an existing POLST, advance directive or similar instruction. - \"Support person\" means a family member, guardian, personal care assistant or other paid or unpaid helper chosen by the patient to physically or emotionally help them, or make sure they can communicate with hospital staff. [Visiting patients in the hospital](#accordion-1032521-2) - Hours for visiting most patients are 5 a.m. - 9 p.m. - Adult patients can have 1 overnight visitor in most cases. - Child patients can have 2 overnight visitors in most cases.
