Constipation, weight gain, hair loss? These can all be hypothyroidism symptoms. Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes [low thyroid symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hashimotos-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351855). Acupuncture and TCM can offer an alternative hypothyroidism treatment and address Hashimoto's thyroiditis symptoms. Recent data shows that hypothyroidism is fairly common. In the U.S., where it was previously thought that about 5% of the population may have some signs of hypothyroidism, more recent research shows that that number is over 10%. While people of all ages can have signs of hypothyroidism, it is most common among women over 50. The thyroid and the pituitary gland work to release various thyroid hormones that control metabolism and other processes. The primary [thyroid hormones](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23524-thyroid-stimulating-hormone-tsh-levels#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20too%20much,the%20United%20States%20have%20hypothyroidism.) are thyroxine (T3) the production of T3 and T4. The normal TSH level for most adults is in the range of 0.27 - 4.2 uIU/mL. Lower TSH levels are often a sign that the body is producing too much thyroid hormone, which leads to symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which is often due to [Graves disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-graves-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), which is also an autoimmune thyroid disorder. When TSH levels are high, there is probably too little thyroid hormone, or low thyroid hormone levels. Hypothyroidism is considered \"overt\" when a person has high TSH levels and low T4 levels. A person is considered to have subclinical [hypothyroidism](https://academic.oup.com/jes/article/7/1/bvac172/6820965) when their TSH is elevated, but T4 is in the normal range. Hashimoto's disease, also known as [chronic thyroiditis](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/chronic-thyroiditis-hashimotos-disease#:~:text=It%20is%20caused%20by%20a,family%20history%20of%20thyroid%20disease.), is the most common cause of hypothyroidism, but because it is a slowly progressing autoimmune disorder, it can take years for symptoms for thyroid to show up. Hypothyroidism causes, or risk factors for Hashimoto, include: genetics, changes in hormones during pregnancy, and the presence of other autoimmune diseases. It is possible to have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and also have another autoimmune condition, such as [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [Celiac Disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [Lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or Type 1 Diabetes. In some cases, hypothyroidism can be caused by an iodine deficiency in the diet. This is rare in the U.S., though, and iodine supplementation is not helpful in cases of hypothyroidism that are not caused by a lack of iodine. Acupuncture and TCM are excellent modalities for treating all kinds of autoimmune disorders, because they work holistically to treat both the root causes of the problem, and hypothyroid symptoms. Top 10 Hashimoto Disease Symptoms Signs of thyroid issues can take a long time to become severe enough that people notice them and seek diagnosis and treatment. Hypothyroidism symptoms can just seem like \"normal\" fatigue or other signs of aging. Sometimes when people visit their primary care doctor, and they run a typical panel of blood tests, thyroid hormone levels are still in the normal range, so no treatment is recommended. However, hypothyroidism symptoms typically come on gradually, and will likely get worse with time, as the disease progresses. Hashimoto's Disease Symptoms include: - Fatigue, sluggishness, tired all the time - Drowsiness, sleepy all the time - Increased sensitivity to cold, feel cold all the time - Dry skin, brittle nails, hair loss, puffy face - Muscle pain, muscle stiffness, muscle weakness, joint pain, stiff joints - Swollen thyroid, enlarged thyroid gland, goiter, swollen tongue - Memory problems, difficulty concentrating, foggy head - Change in menstrual cycle, irregular menstruation, heavy bleeding during period - Weight gain - Depression, [mental health](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)problems If hypothyroidism is not treated, it can lead to serious complications. These may include: heart problems or cardiovascular diseases, like irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) and high cholesterol. Hashimoto's can cause problems with sexual function, libido, and fertility in both men and women. In rare cases, people with untreated low thyroid levels can develop Myxedema. [Myxedema](https://www.healthline.com/health/myxedema#causes) is the term for advanced, severe hypothyroidism, which can lead to: - Low blood pressure - Low heart rate - Low blood sodium levels - Low blood oxygen levels - Low body temperature (hypothermia) - Mental confusion In extreme cases, Myxedema can lead to a health crisis in which a person may go into shock, a coma, or seizures. Myxedema crisis requires immediate emergency care. Hypothyroidism can develop slowly, with minimal symptoms. However, it is important to get proper diagnosis and treatment for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. As time goes on, untreated hypothyroidism can lead to more complications. Medical Treatment for Hashimoto's Disease Getting a [diagnosis for Hashimoto's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hashimotos-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351860) will usually involve a series of blood tests. As an autoimmune disorder, Hashimoto involves the production of antibodies that mistakenly attack healthy cells. In the case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an antibody test may show that the immune system is making TSO antibodies. Thyroid peroxidase (TSO) a protein that is vital to the production of thyroid hormone. In addition, blood tests will show if there is elevated TSH and/or low levels of T4. If a person has symptoms, or an enlarged thyroid gland, and high TSH levels, then a diagnosis of [Hashimoto's](https://www.thyroid.org/hashimotos-thyroiditis/) may be made, whether or not the T4 levels are low. An [ultrasound](https://www.thyroidcancer.com/hashimotos-thyroiditis) can indicate that there is swelling or inflammation in the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism Medication The usual treatment for Hashimoto's disease is [hormone replacement](https://www.thyroid.org/hashimotos-thyroiditis/). Levothyroxine, under the brand names Levoxyl, or Synthroid, is usually given in pill form. This hypothyroid medication mimics the action of T4 hormone. For many patients, [medications](https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/july-2019/vol-12-issue-7-p-8-9/#:~:text=If%20persistent%20symptoms%20in%20patients,TPOAb%20and%20improve%20some%20symptoms.) for low thyroid will help to stabilize the TSH and T4 levels, and symptoms will improve. However, for some people, the continued autoimmune disorder process continues to cause symptoms, even when thyroid hormone levels are in the normal range. In these cases, doctors may recommend surgery. A [thyroidectomy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/thyroidectomy#:~:text=Thyroidectomy%20is%20surgical%20removal%20of,critical%20functions%20of%20the%20body.) involves the removal of some or all of the thyroid gland. After a thyroid surgery, a person will need to continue taking thyroid hormone replacement medication, as they will not produce any without the thyroid gland. Acupuncture and TCM treatment offer an alternative or adjunct therapy for Hashimoto's disease, which can help improve immune function and address symptoms. Can Acupuncture Help Hashimoto's? Acupuncture works by harmonizing the Qi (life force energy) of the organ systems of the body. When Qi is out of balance, then some bodily processes happen in excess, and others are deficient. A TCM practitioner observes and listens carefully to each person's individual experience of symptoms to discover which organs are out of balance. In the case of hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's, deficiency of Qi and blood can be building up over a long period of time, and gradually begin to impact organs: mainly, the kidneys, spleen, and heart. For a while, while the condition is still what conventional medicine considers to be subclinical hypothyroidism, the spleen Qi is weak, and causes some symptoms, like weakness and fatigue. Then, as the situation progresses, the kidney Qi is affected, and more symptoms begin to occur. Yang Qi is not able to warm the organs enough, so dampness and cold begin to accumulate. This causes symptoms like constipation, swollen joints, brain fog, and memory problems. Chronic kidney and liver qi deficiency can cause menstrual problems, and infertility. If the problem continues, then the heart is affected, too, and cardiovascular symptoms begin to arise, like palpitations, respiratory problems, and low blood pressure. The acupuncturist deduces from the pattern of symptoms which organs are affected, and then uses acupuncture treatment, herbs, and other modalities like cupping or moxibustion to bring more energy to depleted areas and help nourish them. Can TCM cure hypothyroidism? Not exactly, but [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2095496418300992) has shown that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for thyroid disorders, whether it is used as an alternative medicine for Hashimoto's disease, or as an adjunct therapy. [Case studies](http://eprints.ugd.edu.mk/18018/) have shown that regular acupuncture treatment can help stabilize thyroid hormone levels, slow the progression of the autoimmune disease, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of life. For those who are trying to conceive and are struggling with infertility issues due to thyroid disorders, acupuncture can be a [holistic treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337562/) that helps balance hormones and improve fertility. Acupuncture treatment may [help prevent miscarriage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) due to autoimmune conditions. Acupuncture can also be helpful for [pain management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039606014005406) after a thyroidectomy procedure. Acupuncture Near Me for Hashimoto's Disease - West Los Angeles Area Acupuncture is an excellent modality for helping to treat many autoimmune diseases and thyroid conditions, including Graves disease, [hyperthyroidism](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hyperthyroidism-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). TCM can also help with [menopause and perimenopausal](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) symptoms, which often occur concurrently with hypothyroidism in women over 50. Acupuncture can also help with all kinds of mental health problems like depression and anxiety, which may be related to underlying physical conditions. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Graves Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-graves-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By eye pain? Feeling anxious and irritable? Hand tremor? These can all be signs of Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve Graves disease symptoms. [Graves disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system creates antibodies that make the thyroid produce too much thyroid hormone. This is known as an \"overactive thyroid,\" or hyperthyroidism. Many different conditions can lead to excessive levels of thyroid hormone, but Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. About 80% of people with hyperthyroidism have Graves disease. Graves disease tends to affect women more often than men. A person is more likely to have [Graves disease](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/endocrine-diseases/graves-disease) if other people in their family have it, or have [Hashimoto's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hashimotos-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People who have Graves may also have other autoimmune disorders, like [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), autoimmune gastritis, Type 1 [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or vitiligo (an autoimmune skin condition). As with other autoimmune diseases, there is still limited understanding from a medical research perspective about what exactly causes Graves disease. Graves disease requires attention, as it can lead to serious health issues. What Is Overactive Thyroid? The thyroid gland is located in the front of the throat and is responsible for producing hormones that control [metabolism](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21893-metabolism), or how the body converts food into energy. The main thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T3) and triiodothyronine (T4). The thyroid hormones impact many processes in the body, including your metabolic rate (how you use calories), how quickly food passes through your digestive tract, your heart rate, maintenance of body temperature, and the production of new cells to replace dying ones. Thyroid function can have a big impact on your weight and digestion. Thyroid hormone [imbalances](https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid) can cause skin problems, vision problems, and problems with menstrual cycles, libido, and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Acupuncture](https://www.healthline.com/health/acupuncture-hyperthyroidism#about) can be an effective treatment for managing hyperthyroidism symptoms. Top 10 Graves Disease Symptoms Graves disease most [typically begins](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15244-graves-disease) to show up in midlife, between the ages of 30 and 50. Signs of Graves disease may develop slowly over several weeks or months. Each individual's experience with symptoms may be different; you may have some of the following symptoms, but not others. Common symptoms of Graves disease include: - Rapid weight loss - Increased appetite [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), more frequent bowel movements - Rapid heartbeat, heart palpitations - Feeling shaky, hand tremor, tremor in fingers - Clammy skin, sweating, feeling hot - Insomnia, trouble sleeping - Goiter, enlarged thyroid gland on the front of the throat - Changes in menstrual cycle - Muscle weakness About a third of people with Graves disease will also develop [Graves ophthalmopathy](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/graves-eye-disease), or thyroid eye disease. This happens due to inflammation and swelling of the muscles and tissues around the eyes. This can happen in both eyes, or just one eye. Graves disease eye symptoms can include: - Bulging eyes - Eyelids don't close all the way - Puffy eyes, swelling around the eyes - Eye pain, eye pressure - Sensitive to light - Eye irritation, gritty eyes - Double vision - Blurred vision - Red eyes - Trouble moving the eyes Treatment for Graves Disease Diagnosis of Graves disease will usually involve blood tests to check for elevated thyroid hormones and the presence of antibodies that stimulate thyroid hormone production. A thyroid uptake scan will show how much iodine your thyroid absorbs; high absorption of iodine is a sign of Graves disease. A Doppler ultrasound may also be done to see if there is extra blood flow to your thyroid gland. Graves disease is considered a chronic condition with no cure. However, [medications and other interventions](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2016/0301/p363.html) can help control thyroid hormone levels. Antithyroid medications like Tapazole block the overproduction of T3 and T4. Side effects of these medications can include itchy skin rashes, nausea, hair loss, muscle pain or joint pain, headaches, dizziness, and other problems. Some people can develop serious liver problems. Radioiodine therapy, or radioactive iodine ablation (RAI), is a treatment for Graves disease that involves taking [radioactive iodine](https://www.thyroid.org/radioactive-iodine/), which, as it is absorbed by the thyroid, will destroy the overactive cells of the thyroid gland. Many patients who undergo this treatment will end up being hypothyroid (low thyroid levels) and will have to have thyroid hormone replacement treatment. RAI treatment can affect the salivary glands, causing dry mouth and sometimes a loss of the ability to taste. A [thyroidectomy](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/thyroidectomy/about/pac-20385195#:~:text=Thyroidectomy%20is%20the%20surgical%20removal,how%20quickly%20you%20burn%20calories.) is a surgical option, which involves the removal of some or all of the thyroid gland. This may be recommended if a person has a very enlarged goiter, or thyroid gland. As with RAI, this may require that a person takes thyroid hormone replacement in the future. There is a risk that the vocal cords can suffer damage during this procedure, which may affect a person's voice long-term. Acupuncture and TCM offers an alternative or adjunct treatment for Graves disease that can help address the root cause of hyperthyroidism as well as help to manage symptoms. Can Acupuncture Help Graves Disease? According to TCM theory, hyperthyroidism and Graves disease are related to imbalances in Qi: typically, yin deficiency is the result of excessive yang energy. Stagnation of phlegm in the liver meridian around the throat area can also have an impact on the thyroid gland. Herbal formulations that help address liver qi stagnation can help relieve many of the symptoms associated with Graves disease, including palpitations, increased heart rate, and insomnia. Other [Chinese herb treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9017513/) can help to reduce thyroid hormone levels and even the size of an enlarged thyroid. [One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2044-acupuncture-beats-drugs-for-hyperthyroidism) that compared patients who were treated with acupuncture and herbs versus those who were treated with antithyroid medications. Over 95% of the group who received TCM treatment had positive outcomes, while 73% of the group who were given medications saw positive improvement. Another independent study showed a similar result, with some patients given acupuncture plus conventional medications, while another group received medication only. The acupuncture group had a 96% positive outcome, while the medication only group had a 64% success rate. One [case study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21058888/) of a woman who had tried antithyroid medications but had suffered from hives as a side effect had good results after taking TCM herbs. Her thyroid levels returned to normal and remained in the normal range even after she discontinued the herbs. An [overview](https://www.verywellhealth.com/chinese-medicine-for-thyroid-disease-3231507) of research shows that acupuncture and herbs have the potential to help patients with Graves disease and hyperthyroidism by lowering thyroid hormone levels, relieving stress, improving sleep, and relieving symptoms like tremors and muscle weakness, as well as IBS-like symptoms of diarrhea. A TCM practitioner can also give personalized advice regarding dietary and other lifestyle changes that can further help to alleviate symptoms and strengthen Qi. Acupuncture Near Me for Graves Disease in West Los Angeles Acupuncture and herbal medicine can be excellent modalities for hard-to-treat disorders, because TCM offers a different lens through which we can see health issues like autoimmune disorders and hormonal imbalances. TCM treatments can strengthen a person's health on the deepest levels, while also relieving a wide variety of symptoms. Acupuncture can be very helpful for thyroid disorders like Graves disease and hyperthyroidism, as well as Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hashimoto) and hypothyroidism. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat POTS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pots-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you often feel shaky, like you're fainting, or experience dizziness, especially when you're getting up from sitting down or lying down? Do you feel like you have a rapid heartbeat, or shortness of breath? Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, known as PoTS syndrome, or POTS, is a condition that causes unstable blood pressure when changing positions. Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve dizziness and other symptoms of POTS. [Postural tachycardia syndrome](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1050173821001225) (or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) is a chronic disorder related to the autonomic nervous system that causes people to experience [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [increased heart rate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) when they move into an upright position; this is known as orthostatic intolerance. [POTS syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=Postural%20orthostatic%20tachycardia%20syndrome%20(POTS,from%20a%20lying%20down%20position.) is fairly common, affecting up to 3 million people in the U.S. POTS occurs more often in people assigned female at birth, and often first shows up during the teenage years. The most common [symptom of POTS](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=The%20symptoms%20of%20POTS%20include,%2C%20palpitations%2C%20tremor%20and%20nausea.) is feeling light-headed when changing your position from sitting to standing, or when getting up from lying down. Whenever we have been sitting or lying down for a while, blood pools in the lower parts of the body. When we get up, the autonomic nervous system starts a series of actions to move blood back up into the top half of the body. This involves squeezing blood vessels, and releasing adrenaline and norepinephrine, to make the heart beat faster. When a person has POTS, more blood tends to pool in the legs, and the nervous system process doesn't cause the normal, quick response from the blood vessels, so more hormones are released, which can cause the person's heart rate to increase, and a [dizzy, faint feeling](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/pots-lightheadedness-and-a-racing-heart-202110012608#:~:text=However%2C%20for%20others%2C%20a%20vicious,of%20circulating%20blood%20is%20reduced.). Medical science has not yet discovered exactly what causes POTS, but there are different characteristics that allow for categorizing these different types of POTS syndrome: - Neuropathic POTS - damage to small fiber nerves that control blood vessel constriction in the abdomen and limbs - Hyperadrenergic POTS - when a person has elevated levels of norepinephrine - Hypovolemic POTS - when a person has unusually low blood levels - Secondary POTS - when POTS symptoms are related to another condition that causes neuropathy, such as [Lyme disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lyme-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or autoimmune disorders like [Lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or [celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). While POTS is not rare, it can be difficult to get a diagnosis, because the criteria can be vague, and the symptoms can so often be related to other conditions, or just seem \"normal.\" For many people, POTS is truly debilitating and can have a serious, negative impact on daily life. It can also contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. Acupuncture and TCM offer an adjunct or alternative treatment for POTS that can help with dizziness, irregular heartbeat, digestive problems, muscle weakness, migraines, trouble sleeping, and other symptoms, all at the same time. Top 10 POTS Symptoms The primary symptoms of POTS are related to the cardiovascular system: rapid heartbeat, and dizziness. However, there can be many other [POTS symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/pots-syndrome-symptoms#symptoms). - Irregular heart rate, rapid heart rate, fast heartbeat, chest pain, heart palpitations - Dizziness, especially when standing up or getting up from lying down, feeling faint - Breathing problems: hyperventilating, bronchial asthma, shortness of breath [Constipation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-constipation-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), nausea, abdominal pain - Muscle weakness, muscle pain, tremor - Skin rash, flushed face, flushing, sweating [Migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Cognitive issues, brain fog, difficulty concentrating - Trouble sleeping - Frequent urination, nocturia Other symptoms of POTS may include: [tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), blurred vision, red or purple appearance of the legs when standing up, and a \"jittery\" feeling or general nervousness. As with many syndromes, different people will experience different combinations of symptoms. While dizziness and rapid heartbeat are the signs most commonly associated with POTS, many people with POTS will also suffer from abdominal pain and gastrointestinal problems, perhaps without realizing there is a correlation.

Medical Treatment for POTS As there is no definitive cure for POTS, [Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots) treatments typically aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Dietary modifications are a fundamental component of POTS management. Adequate daily fluid intake is crucial. A diet that includes plenty of salt helps maintain blood volume, aiding blood flow to vital organs. Patients are typically advised to avoid alcohol and carefully monitor caffeine intake, as these substances can exacerbate symptoms. Exercise is gradually introduced, often starting in reclined or horizontal positions, with the goal of increasing exercise tolerance over time. Physical therapy helps retrain the autonomic nervous system, enhancing blood circulation. Compression garments can help reduce blood pooling, and specific postures while sitting or sleeping may alleviate symptoms. Identifying triggers such as prolonged sitting, heat, or certain drugs allows for better symptom control. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse, along with adequate sleep hygiene, aids overall well-being. While no single pharmacological solution is universally effective, some medications may be prescribed based on individual symptoms. These may help to improve blood volume, aid sodium retention, reduce heart rate, and enhance blood vessel constriction. While POTS symptoms may intermittently improve with medications and lifestyle modifications, the underlying cause of POTS may persist. Acupuncture and TCM treatment can provide a holistic solution for individuals living with POTS, which may help to address the root causes of this syndrome. Can Acupuncture Help POTS? POTS is a kind of Dysautonomia; this is a general term that describes conditions that involve malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system. This causes people's bodies to have problems with regulating the sorts of functions that are typically automatic, like the beating of the heart, circulation of blood, breathing, and temperature control. Western medicine offers some treatments that can help address individual symptoms of dysautonomia, but it does not have a way of treating the root of the problem. It can be difficult to get proper treatment, because people who suffer from POTS and other kinds of dysautonomia often seem reasonably healthy, and their complaints\u2014dizziness, headaches, mental health problems\u2014seem vague. Acupuncture and TCM have been used to treat these kinds of problems for centuries. [Acupuncture treatment](https://acupuncturetoday.com/article/33268-dysautonomia-the-medical-condition-you-may-already-be-treating) can help provide positive effects on the subtle communications of the nervous system, as well as the [heart rate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK196324/), and physiological symptoms of anxiety. According to TCM theory, several organ systems may be involved and need support: not only the heart, but also the kidneys or spleen. [Studies](https://www.omicsonline.org/proceedings/dysautonomia-relief-by-acupressure-59444.html#:~:text=Worthy%20of%20note%2C%20there%20is,viable%20choice%20for%20treating%20dysautonomia.) have shown that acupuncture for dysautonomia can help relieve symptoms like heart palpitations, insomnia, and digestive problems. A qualified acupuncturist is also well-versed in nutrition and can offer more detailed information regarding dietary and lifestyle changes that can help each individual patient. Your TCM provider will spend time learning more about you, so that they can offer personalized advice. Acupuncture Near Me for POTS in West Los Angeles TCM and acupuncture can help people with all types of autoimmune disorders, nerve disorders, and conditions involving fatigue and dizziness that may be difficult to solve with conventional methods. Acupuncture works on a deeper, more subtle level to help address complex syndromes. If you are regularly experiencing trouble with feeling light-headed, having unexplained headaches and sleep problems, it may be time to seek a more holistic alternative treatment. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How To Treat Psoriasis With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-psoriasis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Rash, skin, itchy skin? These could be signs of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes skin to form in thick, scaly, discolored patches, especially on the elbows and knees. Acupuncture and TCM treatment can help relieve psoriasis and address the root causes of this autoimmune skin disease. Autoimmune disorders stem from the body's immune system malfunctioning. In the case of psoriasis, the body produces too many skin cells, forming thick scales, known as \"plaques,\" or a [bumpy rash](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840). As with other conditions that involve skin skin problems\u2014like [eczema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-eczema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [dermatitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dermatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [scleroderma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-scleroderma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)\u2014psoriasis tends to flare up periodically, becoming worse for a few weeks or months at a time, and then improving. A psoriasis flare up happens because of widespread inflammation. What Causes Psoriasis Flare Ups? Getting a cut or burn on your skin can trigger a [psoriasis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6866-psoriasis) flare up. So can infections like a staph infection, strep infection, helicobacter pylori bacterial infection (which can also cause stomach ulcers), or chlamydia. Viral infections like HIV and hepatitis C can trigger psoriasis. Fungal [infections](https://www.psoriasis.org/episode-189-transcript/#:~:text=The%20bacteria%20that%20can%20cause,Also%2C%20porphyromonas%20gingivalis%20and%20chlamydia.) like candida, or yeast infections, can also trigger a psoriasis flare up. Psoriasis affects millions of people, of all ages. [Psoriasis rash](https://www.verywellhealth.com/psoriasis-symptoms-7095398?utm_source=googleawpaid&utm_medium=con&utm_campaign=19663561560-428457&utm_content=647800675393&utm_term=g-psoriasis&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2eilBhCCARIsAG0Pf8shav5TNGpwSLI96_i9qBpu-C9hDjV6Qynmb-9Xj-gQfoUqSnlS1T4aAuwcEALw_wcB#citation-1) can cause intense itching (pruritus), so much so that it can affect a person's ability to concentrate in daily life and can also have a negative impact on sound sleep. Medical research has not yet discovered exactly what causes psoriasis, but it may be partly due to genetics and partly due to environmental factors. It is not uncommon for a person to have psoriasis and also have [another autoimmune condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7678535/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20psoriasis%20is%20found,%2C%20vitiligo%2C%20and%20alopecia%20areata.), such as lupus, celiac disease, Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), or autoimmune thyroid disease. [Acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154484/) and TCM are excellent modalities for helping to relieve the symptoms of skin conditions like psoriasis and many autoimmune disorders. Acupuncture and herbs can help relieve itchy rashes and also help to improve the functioning of the immune system. Acupuncture treatment can also help with the emotional and psychological toll of dealing with psoriasis. Top 5 Types of Psoriasis Plaque psoriasis is by far the most common type of psoriasis, accounting for about 80% of cases. Other types of psoriasis are more rare and can be very serious. - Plaque psoriasis or Psoriasis vulgaris - the most common type of psoriasis; thick scales that are red or pink with a silvery coating on them. These patches, or plaques, can itch intensely. - Guttate psoriasis - small red or pink bumps that appear suddenly, covering the torso, arms, and/or legs. This condition sometimes clears up and does not return. In some cases, though, it can keep coming back, or later turn into plaque psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis may be triggered by infections, like strep throat. - Pustular psoriasis - this is a rash of painful bumps that are filled with pus. Generalized pustular psoriasis is an extreme version of this condition, which can quickly cover the whole body and be accompanied by other symptoms like fever, headache, and muscle weakness. Generalized pustular psoriasis is a serious condition requiring medical care. - Inverse psoriasis or Intertriginous psoriasis - develops in areas where skin folds upon itself, like armpits and around the genital area - Erythrodermic psoriasis - usually develops as a more severe condition after a person has already been struggling with psoriasis. The skin becomes very red and appears to be burned. The person will feel very ill, with fever and chills and a rapid heart rate. Requires immediate medical attention. Psoriasis is not only intensely uncomfortable, but the scaly skin can also have a significant impact on a person's confidence in their appearance. These factors can mean that having psoriasis can have a negative effect on a person's mental health and emotional health. Acupuncture, when used as an adjunct therapy for psoriasis and other autoimmune conditions can help address anxiety, depression, and mood disorders, as well as helping with physical symptoms. Medical Treatments for Psoriasis Conventional [treatment for psoriasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389757/) aims to help slow down the overproduction of skin cells and relieve pain and itching. Topical Medications for Psoriasis Topical products are applied directly to the skin. - Corticosteroids: Frequently prescribed for mild to moderate psoriasis, available in various forms like oils, creams, lotions, etc. - Vitamin D Analogues: Synthetic forms of vitamin D that slow skin cell growth, used alone or with corticosteroids. - Retinoids: Available as gel or cream, they reduce skin cell growth and may cause skin irritation and sensitivity to light. - Calcineurin Inhibitors: Calm the rash and reduce scaly buildup, useful in areas of thin skin. - Salicylic Acid: Reduces scaling of scalp psoriasis and prepares the scalp to absorb medication more easily. - Coal Tar: Reduces scaling, itching, and inflammation, available in various forms like shampoo, soap, cream, and oil. Oral or Injected Medications for Psoriasis Systemic medications may work on the immune system or on skin cell production to help relieve psoriasis. - Steroids: Injection of triamcinolone into small, persistent psoriasis patches. - Retinoids: Pills to reduce skin cell production, not recommended during pregnancy. - Biologics: Injected drugs that alter the immune system to improve symptoms in moderate to severe psoriasis. - Methotrexate: Weekly oral dose to decrease skin cell production and suppress inflammation. - Cyclosporine: Oral calcineurin inhibitor for severe psoriasis. - Treatment approach based on needs and psoriasis severity. - Start with milder treatments and move on to stronger ones if necessary. - Pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis may require stronger systemic medications. [Phototherapy](https://www.psoriasis.org/phototherapy/) exposes the skin to ultraviolet light under a dermatologist's supervision. UVB can help slow down cell production. Light therapy may use lamp units with bulbs, or a laser may be used to target very specific areas of affected skin. Can Acupuncture Help Psoriasis? In TCM, elemental factors like heat, wind, dampness, dryness, and so on, are considered to act as pathogens, having a negative effect on bodily systems when they are either in excess or deficient. According to TCM theory, the root causes of psoriasis may be related to pathogenic factors of excessive heat and dryness. Heat, as a pathogen, can cause redness and itchy skin. Wind can cause dryness of the blood. These conditions in combination can lead to stagnant blood and a fiery heat building up. TCM classifications for diagnosis related to psoriasis would include: - Blood heat - Blood stasis - Blood dryness - Blood deficiency An individual, depending on their specific presentation of skin rash and other symptoms, may be diagnosed with a combination of these factors. In [Chinese medicine](https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-021-00550-y), the skin and the lungs are connected, with the skin being the outward presentation of what is going on in the lungs. So, acupuncture treatment for psoriasis may focus on strengthening lung Qi. In other cases, the large intestine may be related; because of dryness, it may not be receiving enough fluid to be able to do the job of moving toxins out of the body. In some cases, it may be that intense emotions are affecting the liver, causing blood stagnation due to stress. Liver Qi stagnation can cause overheating and for blood to \"overflow\" from vessels, causing red bumpy rashes. Thus, herbal remedies and acupuncture treatment will often aim to clear heat, cool the blood, and improve circulation. Many herbs are helpful for this, as well as for helping to reduce inflammation and soothe dryness and itching. Chinese medicine [herbal preparations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865286/) have been shown by modern scientific studies to inhibit immune-inflammatory reactions, regulate Th cells, and mediate the formation of skin lesions. Review of [scientific studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546634.2020.1789048) of TCM for psoriasis have shown that it can be effective for reducing the severity of skin lesions and help prevent recurrences of flare ups. Acupuncture Near Me for Psoriasis in West Los Angeles Psoriasis is a painful skin condition that requires special treatment. As an autoimmune condition, psoriasis needs to be addressed on a deeper level, as opposed to simply trying to relieve the itchy, scaly rash on the skin's surface. TCM offers a holistic way of treating both skin diseases and autoimmune disorders that can bring deep relief. Consider seeking acupuncture as an adjunct treatment for psoriasis. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Scleroderma With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-scleroderma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. Hard, thickening, tight skin? Itchy, dry skin that is shiny? Changing skin color? These could be symptoms of scleroderma, an autoimmune disorder that causes your body to produce too much collagen. Acupuncture and TCM treatment can help relieve inflammation and pain while helping to resolve the underlying cause of scleroderma. [Scleroderma](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/scleroderma#:~:text=Overview%20of%20Scleroderma&text=When%20an%20immune%20response%20tricks,many%20systems%20in%20your%20body.) can be considered a type of [ dermatosis](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/dermatoses-systemic#:~:text=Dermatoses%20is%20a%20general%20term,Dermatomyositis) (skin lesion), and also a type of [connective tissue disease](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14803-connective-tissue-diseases#:~:text=Your%20body%20is%20held%20together,rheumatoid%20arthritis%2C%20scleroderma%20and%20lupus.) (negatively impacting tissues that connect structures in the body), as it usually affects skin and cartilage, often starting in the extremities, and then extending up the limbs towards the trunk. [Collagen](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23089-collagen#:~:text=Collagen%20accounts%20for%2030%25%20of,muscles%2C%20bones%20and%20connective%20tissues.) is a form of fibrous protein that the body produces to maintain the structure of skin cells, muscles, bones, and connective tissue. The immune system triggers collagen production when we are injured, but in the case of scleroderma, the body is overproducing and accumulating too much collagen. [Localized scleroderma](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/scleroderma/types-of-scleroderma) affects primarily the skin tissue, but can also spread to subcutaneous tissues, like fascia and muscles. In some cases, scleroderma can also impact internal organs, like the esophagus, lungs, heart, and kidneys. This is known as systemic scleroderma. Top 3 Types of Scleroderma Localized scleroderma can be differentiated into 3 types: - Localized scleroderma - a few patches of discolored skin (circumscribed morphea); these skin lesions can vary in size, may be oval shaped, and are usually yellow in the center with a red border. - Generalized scleroderma - also called generalized morphea, with this type there are more patches of thick, hard skin on various parts of the body, which may overlap. - Linear scleroderma - more common in children, may show up as one band of affected skin on a limb or on the trunk, with a few patches of morphea. Linear scleroderma on arms and legs may affect the growth and development of that limb, as scleroderma may impact the muscle and bone tissues as well as the skin. Systemic scleroderma is rare, but happens more commonly in women between the ages of 30 and 50. This type of scleroderma can manifest in different ways. [Systemic scleroderma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scleroderma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351952) can sometimes first show up as Raynaud's phenomenon, or Raynaud's syndrome, in which the blood vessels in the hands and feet close up when the weather is cold and cause color changes to the skin, as well as sensations of numbness, prickling, tingling, or pain. Stress can also trigger Raynaud's. Systemic [scleroderma](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/systemic-scleroderma/) can cause scarring on the skin and internal organs, which can lead to gastrointestinal problems like acid reflux, cardiovascular and pulmonary problems, or renal disease. [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.sruk.co.uk/about-us/news/exploring-acupuncture/) can be used as an adjunct treatment to help relieve symptoms of pain related to skin hardening, as well as helping to alleviate heartburn and [GERD type symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) in patients with esophageal symptoms of scleroderma. TCM can also help address the root causes of scleroderma and other autoimmune disorders. What Causes Scleroderma? As with most autoimmune disorders, medical science has not yet discovered exactly why some people develop this condition. While it is not passed from parent to child the way genetic diseases are, you are [more likely to have scleroderma](https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/scleroderma#:~:text=Researchers%20suspect%20that%20exposure%20to,production%20of%20too%20much%20collagen.) if someone else in your immediate family has it, too. It is believed that factors like environmental toxins and/or viral infections can trigger scleroderma symptoms to flare up. The overproduction of collagen is due to abnormal functioning of the immune system. Because women develop scleroderma more often than men do, it may be that there is a hormonal factor that affects the disease, as well. Diagnosis and Medical Treatment for Scleroderma There is no cure for scleroderma, so conventional medical treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. The treatment plan may vary depending on the specific manifestations and severity of the disease. To diagnose scleroderma, doctors rely on a combination of clinical assessments, medical history review, physical examinations, and lab tests. A doctor will first observe skin changes, such as thickening and hardening, then look for internal organ involvement and other symptoms. Blood tests can help identify specific antibodies associated with scleroderma, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and anti-Scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase I) antibodies. Additionally, blood tests can assess organ function, including kidney and liver function, as well as inflammatory markers. X-rays, ultrasound, or CT scans may be used to evaluate internal organ involvement, such as lung fibrosis, gastrointestinal complications, and cardiac abnormalities. A skin biopsy sample may be taken to confirm the presence of fibrosis and assess the degree of inflammation. Medications that may be recommended for treating scleroderma symptoms include: - Immunosuppressants: Medications such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine may be prescribed to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation. - Corticosteroids: Oral or topical corticosteroids can help manage inflammation and alleviate symptoms in certain cases. However, long-term use may have potential side effects and is usually minimized. - Vasodilators: Medications like calcium channel blockers and prostacyclin analogs may be prescribed to improve blood flow and manage Raynaud's phenomenon. - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These medications can help manage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, which are common in scleroderma patients. Patients are often advised to make lifestyle changes to manage their condition effectively. These may include:using skin moisturizers and avoiding excessive sun exposure, and using sunscreen with a high SPF, avoiding cold temperatures and stress to prevent triggering Raynaud's, quitting smoking, and eating an anti-inflammatory diet. Can Acupuncture Help Scleroderma? TCM treatment for scleroderma focuses more on addressing the underlying causes of the condition, rather than simply trying to relieve symptoms. An acupuncturist will look closely at the whole person, listen carefully to hear all the symptoms they are experiencing, even those which may seem unrelated, feel their pulse and make other observations, and then ascertain which diagnostic pattern may apply. According to TCM theory, scleroderma symptoms may occur due to: - Blood stagnation - Yang deficiency - Kidney Qi deficiency or yang deficiency - Liver and Gallbladder damp heat - Liver blood deficiency - Liver win - Spleen yang deficiency - Stagnation of cold, wind, and/or damp Depending on the diagnosis, the TCM practitioner will then plan a treatment protocol to address the root cause, using acupuncture and herbs. For example, [herbs can help](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=googlescholar&id=GALE%7CA159393375&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=176e4672) move stagnant blood, relieving the skin conditions related to scleroderma. Herbs can even help to inhibit collagen production, to help reduce skin hardening. Acupuncture has been shown to [help reduce](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09645284221076504) the number of Raynaud's attacks. [Moxibustion](https://www.jikm.or.kr/journal/view.php?number=4435) treatment may also be used to help relieve symptoms related to Raynaud's phenomenon. The use of acupuncture for stress relief is also integral to treatment for scleroderma, as stress can trigger a worsening of symptoms. Acupuncture can help [reduce esophageal reflux](https://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/3587/) in cases where esophageal strictures have developed due to scleroderma in the digestive tract and help improve kidney function when kidneys have been impacted by fibrosis. TCM herbal formulations for scleroderma will be individualized for each patient's needs.
