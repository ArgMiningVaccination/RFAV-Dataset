Dr. Shirai received the award from Dr. David Katz, the president of [American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM)](https://lifestylemedicine.org/), who originally led her to join this community. During her acceptance, she thanked Dr. Jenny Lee\u2014a Korean pioneer of Lifestyle Medicine\u2014for her great leadership in the Asian region. Dr. Shirai says, \"I am looking forward to the continuing growth of Lifestyle Medicine communities around the world.\" Dr. Shirai's study found that cardiac patients in the United States and Japan differ greatly in how they perceive what influences their condition. In the U.S., cardiac patients have a stronger belief that genetic influences led to their cardiovascular conditions (48.41%, p< .001). In Japan, cardiac patients strongly believe their lifestyle influenced their conditions (55.96%, p< .001). The study\u2014which focused on 176 phase-II, cardiac rehabilitation participants in the U.S. and Japan\u2014suggests that a belief in genetic influence is likely associated with the participant's level of confidence in achieving exercise goals. Moreover, a strong belief in lifestyle influence is likely associated with the degree to which participants engage in enough exercise. However, in neither population did belief in genetic influence affect individuals' dietary habits. The interest in Lifestyle Medicine is growing internationally. In fact, the [Asian Society of Lifestyle Medicine ](https://lifestylemedicineasia.org/)will launch its first conference in March in Taipei (. This year, Dr. Shirai served as a scientific committee member for this conference. \"We already have more than 10 core volunteer working members from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, Dr. Shirai says. \"As a Japanese native who lives in the U.S., I represent Japan in this society. I can't stop fantasizing about starting cross-national studies\u2014similar to Ancel Keys' work\u2014with my Asian Society colleagues.
