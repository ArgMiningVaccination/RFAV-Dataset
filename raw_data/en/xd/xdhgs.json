Dr. Cutler provides Holistic Medicine and Wellness services for Birmingham, West Bloomfield, Troy, and all of Oakland County. We're about a 20-minute drive from Detroit, MI.", "sitename": "Cutler Integrative Medicine |", "date": "2021-05-06", "cleaned_text": "A national expert in naturopathic medicine, Doug Cutler, ND, founded the Integrative Health Model and uses a holistic approach with naturopathic medicine to create breakthroughs in his patients' health. His ability to empower patients to better health after they have exhausted conventional methods has patients on a waitlist to see him. Dr. Cutler launched his new ClubIV, one of the only FDA/USP-compliant IV/IM (intravenous/intramuscular) nutrient therapy clinics in Michigan. Over 80 advanced nutrient formulas are customized to increase energy, improve sleep, optimize immune function, recover cellular homeostasis, promote healing and recovery, reduce stress and anxiety, support weight loss, and much more. There is no comparison to the superior potency of nutrients delivered via IV/IM therapy. The nutrient dose bypasses the gastrointestinal system and is delivered directly into the bloodstream, so results are fast, allowing you to feel better sooner. Dr. Cutler's philosophy as a licensed naturopathic physician is focused on determining the underlying causes of illness while also treating the symptoms\u2014often the combination of factors such as nutritional or biochemical dysfunctions, lifestyle, genetics, environmental toxicants, as well as the mind, emotions, and beliefs. Naturopathic Medicine in our Bingham Farms, Michigan, office is a distinctively natural approach to health and healing that recognizes the wisdom of the natural healing process. The whole person finds balance through the stimulation, enhancement, and support of the inherent healing capacity of the patient. Naturopathic Medicine achieves a deeper level of healing. Licensed Naturopathic Physicians are trained to serve as primary care general practitioners who are experts in the prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment of both acute and chronic health conditions. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in our Michigan office is a collection of varied medical and health care systems, treatments, and products that are not regarded as part of conventional medicine or integrated into the dominant health care paradigm. Conventional medicine (Western or Allopathic Medicine) is practiced by MDs (medical doctors) and DOs (doctors of osteopathic medicine) and by other health professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, physical therapists, and nurses. Complementary Medicine denotes the use of complementary and alternative medicine together with conventional medicine. Alternative Medicine is a method that replaces conventional treatment and therapy. Holistic Medicine is based on the principle that we are interconnected beings, and what impacts one part of us will impact our entire self. When you visit us for holistic medicine at our Bingham Farms office, we don't see you as just the sum of your symptoms. We use your symptoms as clues to what causes are undermining your potential for optimal health and harmony. In today's fast-paced and chemically-overloaded world, it's never a question of if we are toxic, but of how toxic we are. We look at how nutritional deficiencies, a stressful lifestyle, environmental toxicants, genetic risks, and a negative emotional outlook might be assailing your body, spirit, and psyche.
