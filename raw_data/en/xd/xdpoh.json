[I'd like to sign up ](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-subscribe) Information for people with heart conditions Why is it important to be vaccinated if I have a heart condition? Although Covid may not seem as serious as it used to, and although you may have had it already, it can still cause serious illness - even in younger people and those without health problems. It's particularly important, however, for vulnerable people with a heart condition or a long-term condition to be vaccinated. This is because Covid infection can lead to long-lasting symptoms (long Covid) even for people don't have a serious illness early in the infection. Getting vaccinated will also reduce the risk of you spreading Covid to other people who may be vulnerable. Is the vaccine safe for people with heart conditions? Yes, the vaccine is safe for people with heart and circulatory conditions. No vaccine is approved unless it is considered safe for people with long-term conditions, including heart and circulatory conditions, and including older people. Is the vaccine safe for people taking blood thinners like warfarin or other anticoagulants? In general, yes, but you should let the person giving you the vaccine know that you are taking an anticoagulant. As with any injection, there is some risk of bleeding. Like most vaccines, the coronavirus vaccine is injected into the muscle of your upper arm. Injections into your muscle may bleed a little more than injections that are given under the skin, but less than those that are given into a vein. If you are taking a blood thinner such as warfarin, or a new anticoagulant, the bleeding may take a little longer to stop and you may get more bruising on your upper arm. Public Health England and the Department of Health have said that you can have the vaccine if your anticoagulant treatment is stable. That generally means that you will have been taking the same dose for a while and that if you are on warfarin, that your INR checks are up to date and that your latest INR level was in the right range. Is the vaccine safe for people taking blood thinners like clopidogrel or other antiplatelet drugs? Yes, the vaccine is safe for people taking clopidogrel and other antiplatelet medications. You may experience a little more bruising around the injection site. Is the vaccine safe for people taking heart medications? Yes, the coronavirus vaccine is safe for people taking heart medications. This includes beta blockers, statins, blood pressure drugs and other heart medications. Your medication won't stop the vaccine from working, and the vaccine won't cause problems with your medication. There is special advice about having the vaccine for people who are taking [warfarin or other anticoagulants](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-vaccine-your-questions-answered#warfarin) What is the risk of heart inflammation (myocarditis) from the vaccine? Visit our [Covid-19 vaccines and myocarditis](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-vaccine-your-questions-answered/myocarditis-and-covid-19-vaccines-should-you-be-worried) page for up to date information about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. Is the vaccine less effective for people with underlying health conditions? Experts have tested how vaccines work in people with most health conditions, including heart conditions, and found they are just as effective. The only possible exception to this is people who are taking immunosuppressants or are immunocompromised. We know that people in this group don't tend to have a strong enough immune response to the Covid-19 vaccine. What is the dosing schedule for people who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed? Everyone over 12 with a severely weakened immune system should have been offered: - three doses (given 8 weeks apart) as part of their primary course - A booster jab (given no sooner than 12 weeks from the third dose) followed by a further booster 3 to 6 months later. This has been offered to up to people in the UK who were severely immunocompromised - including for example if you have had a heart transplant or are on certain types of steroid medication. This recommendation followed findings from [research carried out by the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_808086_en.html), showing that 40% of people who are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised do not have a strong enough immune response after two doses of the vaccine. Is it safe, and how effective is it? Is the coronavirus vaccine safe? Vaccines are only approved for use after being thoroughly tested on tens of thousands of people. Experts at the MHRA looked carefully at all evidence about the vaccine to make sure that it met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. All of the approved vaccines are shown to be safe. There have been a very small number of reports of allergic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. For the vast majority of people, there is no need to worry about these reports. The number of serious allergic reactions has been extremely small. Any [serious reactions to the vaccine have been carefully recorded](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting), and we can see from this data that the chance of an allergic reaction is much lower after a booster dose, compared to the first dose. The only people with allergies who should not get the vaccine are those with a history of serious reaction to the vaccine ingredients. You can have the vaccine even if you have a history of anaphylactic shock to other things - just let the person who is giving you the vaccine know beforehand. Can I have the flu jab and a Covid booster at the same time? Yes, it is safe to have them at the same appointment, and some GP surgeries, pharmacies and employers are offering this. It will depend on the arrangements at the pharmacy, surgery or vaccination centre that you are attending. If you are eligible for both, you can ask if you have them at the same time. If they are given at the same time, you will get one in each arm. Is the AstraZeneca vaccine safe? Does it cause blood clots? Visit our webpage about the safety of the [Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine), including side effects and the risk of blood clots. How effective is the vaccine, and how long does it last? Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have proven to be very effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalisation, and death from Covid-19. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report [published in February 2023](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1134076/vaccine-surveillance-report-week-5-2023.pdf) suggests that even six months after the bivalent vaccine, most people can expect some degree of protection (about 60% vaccine effectiveness) from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19. We know that boosters offer even greater protection against serious illness and hospitalisation from Covid-19, which is why it's important to have a booster when you are offered it. What are the side effects? What side effects does the Pfizer vaccine have? Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects, although many people don't get any side effects at all. For the Pfizer vaccine (like the other vaccines), the vast majority of side effects are mild and short-term. The most common are pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain or chills. Don't worry if your arm starts to hurt the next day, this isn't a cause for concern and is usually gone within a day or two. You can take paracetamol to treat any of these side effects. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, [side effects tend to be stronger with the second dose](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1034252/UKHSA-12222-COVID-19-what-to-expect-CYP.pdf). The types of side effects are the same and should still only last a day or two. Often side effects are just a sign that the vaccine is doing its job: it can happen with many vaccines that some people might feel slightly unwell because their immune system is responding to the protein, but this is not a Covid-19 illness and the vaccine can't give you coronavirus. What side effects does the Moderna vaccine have? Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects, although many people don't get any side effects at all. For the Moderna vaccine (like the other vaccines), the vast majority of side effects are mild and short-term. The most common are pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, joint pain or chills. You can take paracetamol to treat any of these side effects. For the Moderna vaccine, side effects tend to be stronger with the second dose. The types of side effects are the same and should still only last a day or two. Often the side effects are just a sign that the vaccine is doing its job: it can happen with many vaccines that some people might feel slightly unwell because their immune system is responding to the protein, but this is not a Covid-19 illness and the vaccine can't give you coronavirus. What side effects does the Novavax vaccine have? As with other Covid vaccines, you're very unlikely to get any serious side effects, as these are very rare. Some people experience temporary side effects such as soreness at the injection site, tiredness, headache, fever, muscle pain, or joint pain. You can take paracetamol to treat these and they don't usually last more than a couple of days. What you need to know about getting the vaccine How do I book an appointment? If you are eligible for your first dose, you should have been invited by your GP or the NHS to book your appointment. If you have recently changed address, email address, or phone number, make sure your contact details are up to date with your GP, so that you can be contacted when it is your turn. You need to be registered with a GP to book your vaccine appointment. Anyone in the UK can register with a GP, and you won't be asked for any proof of identity or your immigration status to register. Which vaccines are being used in the UK? These are the main vaccines currently being used in the UK: - The Moderna bivalent vaccine (also known as Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1) The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine Comirnaty or BNT162b2) - The Moderna univalent vaccine (also known as Spikevax or mRNA-1273) - The vaccine made by Novavax, Nuvaxoid (also known as Covovax or NVX-CoV2373) is being used for people who are unable to have the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. The University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222) is no longer being used in the UK. How does the vaccine work? Most of the vaccines are based on the fact that coronaviruses have club-shaped spikes on their outer coats, which form a corona - Latin for crown - on the virus surface. Studies suggest that the immune system is good at recognising these if it has encountered them before, and therefore these are a good approach for a vaccine. If a vaccine is able to produce a \"spike\" inside the body, the immune system recognises the \"spike\" and responds to it. That means that if the body encounters the Covid-19 virus in future, the immune system will recognise it and act against the virus so it cannot develop into an illness. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is an mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine. Messenger RNA gives a body's cells instructions to make specific proteins - in this case, viral proteins that can be recognised by the immune system. This vaccine contains a small part of the genetic code for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The vaccine delivers the mRNA to the body's cells, so that they make the protein that appears in the \"spike\" on the outside of the Covid-19 virus. The vaccine does not contain any live virus. The Moderna vaccine works in a very similar way to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It uses mRNA to tell the body's cells to create the spikes that are on the surface of the coronavirus, so that the immune system can respond to them. It does not contain any live virus. How quickly does the vaccine work? It may take a few weeks to build up protection from your first dose. Your body should respond more quickly to any future doses. I have a fear of needles - what can I do to prepare for the appointment? Having a fear of needles (trypanophobia) is very common - it affects up to 1 in 10 people and is nothing to be ashamed of. Visit our information on [managing your fear of needles.](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/phobia-of-needles) Can I get the vaccine if my blood pressure is high or low on the day? Having high blood pressure generally won't stop you getting the vaccine. If your blood pressure is very high on the day of the appointment, particularly if you feel unwell, ask your doctor or the vaccine centre for advice. You can also have the vaccine if your blood pressure is low. Let the person who is giving you the vaccine know if you feel faint or lightheaded. How soon can I have the vaccine after surgery or having a stent? You may be asked to wait a few days (a week at most) between surgery and getting your vaccine. This is so that any reaction you have to the operation can be separated from a reaction to the vaccination. If you have an angioplasty procedure (in other words, you've had a stent fitted), it doesn't necessarily need to cause any delay with getting your vaccine, especially if the procedure was planned and there are no complications. Check with the healthcare professional when you have your stent fitted if you're not sure. I've already had Covid-19, do I still need to get vaccinated? Yes, it's really important to get the vaccine, even if you've already had Covid-19. We know that the risk of being reinfected with Omicron is much greater than previous variants of Covid. Getting vaccinated will help to top-up your level of protection, so you are less likely to catch Covid again, and much less likely to become seriously unwell from it. However, you may need to wait a little while between catching Covid and having the vaccine, to give your immune system time to recover. Check with your healthcare provider how long you need to wait. Can the vaccine give me coronavirus? No, you can't get coronavirus from the vaccine. None of the vaccines contain live forms of the Covid-19 virus. Does the pneumococcal vaccine protect me from Covid-19? No, the pneumococcal vaccine protects you from a different illness, not Covid-19. It's important to have both vaccines if you are offered them.
