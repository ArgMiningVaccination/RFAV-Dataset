NHS Scotland has contacted people who are eligible for a flu vaccine only. You should attend the appointment you've been given, or make or rearrange your appointment as soon as possible. Flu vaccines are being prioritised in September. Flu and coronavirus vaccines will be offered to those eligible between September and December. It's strongly recommended you get vaccinated if you're eligible this winter. Invitations for people who are eligible will start being sent from late August. You may receive your invitation at a different time than previous years. The postal invites will arrive in white envelopes with clear NHS Scotland branding. People with a digital preference will receive their vaccine appointment or prompt by text and/or email. Please do not try to make an appointment until you've been invited by NHS Scotland. Health and social care workers can [book their winter vaccines now](https://vacs.nhs.scot/csp). Online booking portal You can log in to book using your unique username and password. This is the same as you had for your previous doses of the coronavirus vaccine. You can [rearrange your appointment](/covid-19-vaccine/rearrange-or-opt-out-of-your-vaccination-appointment/) if the time or day doesn't suit you. If you're trying to rearrange your appointment online and there are no vaccination appointments available, please check again later.
