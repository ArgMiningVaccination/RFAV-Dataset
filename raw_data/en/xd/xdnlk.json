Performance Objective 1 - Student Success Student Success Performance Targets LSU Shreveport (LSUS) places a great emphasis on student academic success as it is an integral part of overall institutional performance. Several of the initiatives that have been conducted over the past four years remain in place, and other new programs have been added or modified to improve student performance. Overall, student retention at both the 1st to 2nd and 1st to 3rd year metrics, as well as award productivity has remained consistent with previous years; however, the same institution graduation rate metric has increased su bstantially. Student Success Policies/Programs/Initiatives Through a thorough examination of institutional effectiveness, LSUS evaluates their areas of strength and weakness related to student success with an annual evaluation of student learning outcome s at both the program level and in the general education program. These annual evaluations overwhelmingly demonstrate that teaching , in terms of the time and commitment that faculty take with students to ensure quality classroom and online learning , is a strength of the institution and has been paramount in the substantial increases seen in the same institution graduation rate . The faculty and staff have been engaged in several student success initiatives over the past four years; these initiatives contin ue to grow and evolve which has contributed to the institution 's success. Below is a description of current practices that have been continued for the reporting year followed by new initiatives implemented in 2013 -14. The student success initiatives that have been successful and were therefore continued in the 2013 -14 academic year were: 4 -week grades for early alert for students, student development/academic skills sessions from the Student Development office, improved academic advising through the training of advisors and the increased information available about advising to students online , and the availability of more online and compressed semester courses which has helped students with certain time constraints or issues with access to the campus. New initiatives for the 2013 -14 academic year were designed to assist the student early in their academic career at LSUS. The Freshman Orientation session, organized by the Admissions Office, was mod ified to provide increased interaction between academic advisors and incoming students in order to establish a relationship prior to the student attending LSUS. Additionally, with the upcoming implementation of the SACSCOC Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), various faculty members implemented metacognitive strategies into their teaching to examine student success. Data and verbal feedback from classes where these techniques were implemented showed positive student learning gains . Lastly, the institution imp lemented the Developmental Pilot Program that allowed for students who were not admissible to LSUS, but were within 2 points on the respective section of the ACT entrance exam, to enroll at LSUS provided they enrolled in a co -requisite course for either Ma th or English. LSUS had 62 students participate in 4 the math program, and 6 students in the English program. Data regarding the success of this program will be reported in the following year. Data Based Evaluation Data based evaluation continues to play an important role in LSU Shreveport's student success programs. Every semester grade distributions are reviewed to determine the courses in which students perform poorly . Data from this review showed that Math cours es have continued to pose problems to t he student body. Discussions in the General Education committee are ongoing on how to solve this issue through changes to pedagogy and examining additional preparation courses for students to give them the appropriate foundational skills. Tracking/Monito ring/Reporting Mechanisms used for Student Success In an ongoing annual basis, student learning is tracked and evaluated by each department. Any issues that hamper student success are rectified through new courses, change in pre - requisite, change in peda gogy, or other such activities. Several programs have utilized technology to assist students in their success by plac ing additional materials online, and by using interactive software to help in the learning process. Evaluation of the general education p rogram follows the same protocols as the academic departments; t he data presented from general education assessment identified a continuous problem with students meeting the expected level of success on math and critical thinking problems. After reviewing this data, and by obtaining feedback from faculty and staff the institution decided to implement a QEP based on metacognition. The QEP is designed to engage students in active learning, to teach them how they learn, and then to help them develop the skil ls required to learn and apply their learning across disciplines. It is expected that this program will increase student success in the classroom. Student Success for Targeted Measures 1. First to Second Year Retention of Freshmen Students LSU Shreveport had an ambitious 1 -2 year retention target of 69% for Year 5 of the GRAD Act. Of the 3 18 students enrolled in fall 2013, 2 11 students returned for the fall 2014 semester giving LSUS a retention rate of 66. 4%. This rate was consistent with the previous ye ar, and an improvement from Yea r 2 and 3. The targeted rate of 69% was missed by nine students. Multiple attempts were made by various groups on campus to encourage students who had not returned to LSUS to re -enroll. Primarily, after spring advising and prior to the fall semester academic advisors were given a list of students who were eligible to return but who had not yet registered and were asked to contact these students. This resulted in additional students returning to LSUS, but not enough to meet the targeted retention rate. In an effort to encourage more of this cohort to return, the Admission's Office called the group of non -returning students to encourage them to 5 enroll in courses during the 2nd compressed semester courses in order for them to continue with their studies. These calls netted four additional students enrolling in this session, but the institution remained nine students short in order to meet their retention goal. The chart below shows the historical enrollment and retention patt ern for this metric: 1st to 2nd Year Retention Rate Chart Baseline Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 1st to 2nd year retention cohort 349 345 334 315 364 318 1st to 2nd year retention number retained same institution 226 237 217 207 241 211 1st to 2nd year retention calculated rate 64.8% 68.7% 65.0% 65.7% 66.2% 68.0% 69.0% Target met (+/ - 2%)? YES YES YES YES YES NO 2. First to Third Year Retention of Freshmen Students Of the 364 students in the 2012 -13 cohort of freshman, 180 students returned for the third fall semester resulting in a retention rate of 49.5%. The targeted rate was 49 .0% and therefore the institution met its 1 -3 retention rate goal. 3. Same Institution Graduation Rate LSUS has continued to improve its same institution graduation rate from the baseline year rate of 20 .1% to Year 5's rate of 32.6%. This marked improvement has been in part because of a more selective admissions requirement and the efforts of the campus to increase retention of the student body. 4. Award Productivity The award productivity is a useful metric for LSUS because it accounts for many of the transfe r students that graduate on an annual basis that are excluded from the institution's Graduation Rate. The target for this metric was 16.9%, and the institution achieved a rate of 17.7%. 5. Percent Change in Program Completers There has been an enrollment shi ft at LSUS that resulted in an increased number of graduate students, and a decrease in the number of degree -seeking undergraduate 6 students. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of completers at the undergraduate level and an increase at the grad uate level. The institution did not meet its target for completers at the undergraduate level over the baseline year, but far exceeded its target at the graduate level. A campaign is underway to contact students who did not return to the institution and who are close to degree completion to encourage them to enroll and complete their degree. The chart on the following page shows the historical data for the number of completers at the undergraduate and graduate level. Number of Completers at the Undergrad uate and Graduate Level 2008 -09 Base. 13 -14 Target 13-14 Actual Target Met? Number of completers in the academic year -Undergraduate 527 532 446 NO Percent change in program completers over baseline year - UG NA 1% -15.4% NO Number of completers in the academic year -Graduate 106 109 131 YES Percent change in program completers over baseline year - Graduate NA 2.8% 23.6% YES 6. Percent of Freshmen Admitted by Exception For the 2014 -15 academic year, LSUS allowed 5 .3% of its freshman class to be admitted by exception. There were a total of 393 freshmen students for the year, with 21 students admitted through an exception. 7. Passage Rates on Licensure and Certification Exams LSU Shreveport continues to perform at a high level in its Teacher Education program as evidenced by the exemplary passage rate of students taking the PRAXIS exam. The targeted passage rate of 100% was met for the 2012 -13 year. There were 30 students i n the alternative certification program, and 47 students in the traditional teaching degree for a total of 77 students that took the PRAXIS exam and passed. Develop Partnerships with High Schools to Prepare Students for Postsecondary Education LSU Shrev eport has worked hard to develop and keep its partnerships with area high schools . With the cessation of financial support from the state for this program, t he cost of these courses tripled for students and has resulted in a decrease in the total number of students enrolled. In the reporting year, 1 ,558 students were enrolled in the program, compared to 2,062 in the previous year . In the reporting year, h igh school students took 8,782 credit hours through the dual enrollment program and successfully completed 8,383 (95%) of these hours. 7 2. Performance Objective 2 - Articulation and Transfer LSU Shreveport is in a unique position to serve transfer students as it has two community colleges within the Shreveport/Bossier metropolitan area . The instit ution has identified the need for a smooth transition from these two -year schools to the baccalaureate degree and is working on progress to facilitate this process . Over the past five years there have been increasing conversations, examination of current and best practices, and the implementation of new programs in order to assist the transfer students. The following narrative explains the programs and initiatives that have been implemented or continued during the 2013 -14 academic year and in the fall of 2014 . As an indication of Chancellor Clark's focus on improving collaborative opportunities with the two year schools, his first day as LSUS Chancellor was spent on the campuses of Southern University of Shreveport and Bossier Parish Community College. On July 1, 2014 all campus Vice -Chancellors from LSUS met on the SUSLA campus in the morning and that afternoon LSUS leadership team met on the BPCC campus. In ea ch case the LSUS leadership renewed their commitment under Chancellor Clark's direction to strengthen and streamline opportunities for transfer from each two year campus to LSUS. Additionally, in the fall of 2014, faculty from all academic schools at L SUS met on the BPCC campus with their counterparts. These meetings generated articulation agreements for all programs at LSU Shreveport. To communicate these agreements to students, LSUS is building a website entitled a \"Bridge to LSUS\" that will include the following information: a. Transfer/course matrix that will provide a field in which students can enter in their course offerings and determine course equivalency b. Information about SUSLA articulation agreements in all programs c. Information about BPCC articulation agreements in all programs d. Information about BPCC@LSUS program e. Financial aid information (including targeted transfer scholarships) f. General admissions information (including information about the application process) g. Information and times when LSU Shreveport faculty and staff will be available on the BPCC and SUSLA campuses In December, the design of the web site was developed and the site will be launched in Spring 2015. Meetings with faculty from SUSLA are scheduled for Spring 2015 . Initiat ives Continued in 2013 -14 1. BPCC@LSUS The BPCC@LSUS program has been in existence since the fall 2013 and continues to grow in terms of enrollment. This program allows students who do not meet the LSUS admission requirements, but want to attend the institut ion in order to earn a four -year degree, the 8 opportunity to take courses on LSUS' campus and gain experience and college credits at the collegiate level. Beginning in the Fall 2013 semester there were 61 students enrolled in the program . Spring 2014 saw e nrollment growth to 73 students , and as of Fall 2014 there were 126 students enrolled in the program . The number of referrals to the BPCC@LSUS program decreased slightly from the previous year (195 to 185) ; however the number of students enrolled in the p rogram grew as students became more aware of the opportunity and benefits of transitioning to LSUS through this initiative. Referral Agreements with Community Colleges LSUS has a referral agreement with Bossier Parish Community College for students that applied to the institution, but did not meet the admission requirements. Through this system, 185 students were referred to this community college. 2. Articulation Agreements LSUS currently has 8 articulation agreements with Bossier Parish Community College . These agreements are in the area of Computer Science and Community Health . As of March 2014, there are over 20 agreements in the review stages with BPCC that will be implemented for the 2015 -16 academic year. Data -Based Evaluation Data based evaluat ion of student performance is extremely important when assessing transfer students. The Office of Institutional Research performs a grade analysis each semester to assess areas of academic weakness of students who transferred from respective local institu tions. Any issue s are communicated between the Provost s at the respective institution s. Additionally, general education assessment is disaggregated by native LSUS students and transfer students to assess any differences between those who took all general education courses at LSUS and those who transferred these credits from another institution(s). Again, areas of weakness are shared between institutions. Recently, the Office of Institutional Research at LSUS has worked with the BPCC campus to identify t he top 10 majors that their students transfer into at LSUS in order to ensure there are alignments of curricula. Additionally, the students that transfer from the BPCC@LSUS program are tracked in terms of academic progress, any recurring academic weaknesses will be communicated with the Director of the BPCC@LSUS program to improve these students' academic preparation. Tracking/Monitoring Mechanisms Students that transfer from the BPCC @LSUS program are tracked from their point of transfer through to graduation. Fall 2014 was the first semester that students who completed the 9 BPCC@LSUS program were eligible to enroll at LSUS; there were four students that completed the transfer. These students' academic performance was reviewed at the end of the fall semester by the LSUS Office of Institutional Research and discussed with the Director of the BPCC@LSUS program. Once a similar program is established with the Southern two -year campus in S hreveport a similar report will be generated to enable both schools to work together on student academic preparation. The total number of baccalaureate degree -seeking transfer students entering from the prior year was 525 , and the retention rate from fall to spring of these students was 61.9%. This was consistent with the 2012 -13 academic year, and above the 2011 -12 retention rate of 57.4%. For the t argeted measure of transfer students at the level of sophomore or higher, the number of students transferring at this level was higher, and the retention rate, 66.6%, exceeded the target of 64.5%. The number of completers that began as transfer students decreased in the 2013 -14 academic year to 256 from 312 the previous year , but the overall number of undergraduate completers also decreased so this number was expected to be lower than in previous years. Of these transfer completers, 42 had earned an Asso ciate degree prior to transfer. Percent of Transfer Students Admitted by Exception (limit 8 percent) For the 2014 -15 academic year, 42 transfer students attend LSUS on an exception. This was a calculated rate of 7 .1% from the previous year's enrollment o f 592 total transfer students. Transfer Students with an Associate Degree The number of students transferring to LSUS with an Associate degree increased to the highest level in five years with 102 students . The retention of this population from year 1 t o year 2 was 58.8%. This decreased slightly from the previous year, but is consistent with retention rates from Year 1 through 3 of the GRAD Act. Louisiana Transfer Degree Enrollment & Retention There have been no students with a Louisiana Transfer degree enroll at LSUS in the past five years. It is therefore not possible to calculate the 1st to 2nd year retention rate of this cohort. There were also no baccalaureate completers for the 2013 -14 academic year from this group of students. 10 3. Performance Objective 3 - Workforce and Economic Development Programs eliminated, modified, or added LSUS continually reviews its academic programs to ensure they are consistent with local, regional, and statew ide needs. In addition to reviewing program alignment with these needs, department chairs are asked to complete a review of their programs for current enrollment number s and the predicted number of completers for the upcoming years. In the 2013 -14 academic year, no programs were eliminated or modified. One program, the Doctorate degree in Leadership Studies was officially approved by the Board of Regents in January, 2014. This degree is closely aligned with workforce needs in local schools, busine sses, and non -profit organizations. So far, three cohorts of students have been admitted for a total of 37 students currently enrolled as of Spring 2015. The first graduates are expected in the December, 2017. Programs Aligned with Wor kforce and Economic Development All programs at LSUS support the local, regional, or statewide workforce and economic development needs. Specifically, the programs at LSUS aligned with the reported state key industries as identified in the \"Blue Ocean\" initiative are as f ollows: 1. Digital Media/Software Development a. Fine Arts, B.A. - with a concentration in Animation and Visual Effects b. Digital Arts, B.F.A c. Computer Science, B.S. d. Computer Systems Technology, M.S. 2. Specialty Healthcare a.

School Psychology, S.S.P Overall, 100% of programs at LSUS are aligned to meet the career aspirations of high school students and adult learners in the state and region. It is also important to note that with the availability of the Workforce and Innovation for a Stronger Economy fund (WISE funding), LSUS has designated the following degree pr ograms in high -demand fields to receive additional resource support: graduate Education degrees , undergraduate Accounting degree, Computer Science programs , and programs in the H ealthcare fields at both the undergraduate, graduates, and certificate levels. Resources include new faculty positions to cover the growth in enrollment in these programs, as well as technology and equipment enhancements for improved student learning. Use of Technology for Distance Education Distance education, particularly at the graduate level has seen aggressive growth over the past two years . Enrollment in the graduate programs has increased over 200% for both the Master of Education in Curriculum & Instruction and the Master of Business Administration since the programs have been offered through distance learning. Growth was also seen in the Master of Health Administration program which was already offered online but has benefitted from the increased web -based marketing of other LSUS' online graduate programs. Enrollmen t in Graduate Online Programs Degree Program # students fall 2012 # students fall 2013 # students fall 2014 Curriculum & Instruction, M.Ed. 33 99 141 Business Administration, MBA 54 39 360 Health Administration, MHA 28 29 141 Non-Profit Administration, MS 28 20 12 To support the growth in online programs, LSUS has upgraded their LMS system from MOODLE to MOODLErooms. This upgrade incre ases the bandwidth so that students have increased access. Additionally, this platform allows for an improved ability to track and provide feedback to students, allows for easier access to electronic media placed on the LMS, and has shown to provide increased satisfaction and student engagement. LSUS had a \"Targeted\" number of online degree programs of 3 for Year 5, and has 13 exceeded that by 2 program as it offers 5 total degrees online . There are 4 programs at the graduate level - Business Administration, MBA, Curriculum and Instruction, M.Ed., Health Administration, MHA, and Human Services Administration, M.S. A dditionally one undergraduate program, the Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication is available online. Progress in the Number of Students placed in Jobs LSU Shreveport takes pride in assisting students find employment after degree completion through its active Career Services Office. Based on the latest available Louisiana Employment Outcomes Report the following information reflects LSU Shreveport's student employment rates. i. Percent of completers found employed As noted in the chart, the percentage of undergraduate completers that found employment at least 6 months after graduation was consistently around 65% for the 2009 -2010 to 2011 -12 academic years. At the graduat e level the number of completers finding employment at least six months after graduation was higher than at the undergraduate level, but did decline 20% from 2009 -10 to 2011 -12. This could be attributed to the national economic downturn which had a negati ve effect on employment rates across the country. Found Employment after 6 months Max Degree Level 2009 -2010 2010 -2011 2011 -2012 3 74% 62% 73% The degree programs at the baccalaureate level at LSU Shreveport where students had the highest earning 18 months after graduation are listed in the chart below and focus heavily on the sciences, education, and business. Degree 18 months after grad. Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services $ 46,548.80 Education $ 37,525.05 Physical Sciences $ 35,192.00 Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services $ 35,181.80 Biological and Biomedical Sciences $ 29,794.14 In 2013, the institution began collecting employment data through \"The Outcomes Survey\" software which requires students to complete an employment survey prior to graduation as well as data points of three months, six months , and a year after graduation. The report indicates that the majority (98%) of undergraduate completers stay in Louisiana for employment post - graduation, and that 62% of graduate complete rs remain in Louisiana after completing their degree. 14 4. Performance Objective 4 - Institutional Eff iciency and Accountability Eliminate Remedial Education Course Offerings and Developmental Study Programs As of the Fall 2014 LSU Shreveport no longer offered any developmental coursework. Since the baseline year of 2009 -10, LSUS has scaled back on the number of remedial courses offered and the number of students enrolled in those courses. In 2009 -10, there were 12 courses offered, and 285 students enrolled. In Year 4, 2013 -14 there were 5 courses offered and 168 students enrolled. As of Year 5, there were 0 courses offered and 0 students enrolled. Students that did not meet the increased admission requirements, and therefore required some form of remedial education, were referred to the BPCC@LSUS program that a cts as a bridge between the two institutions. The bridge program allows students to complete their remediation courses from Bossier Parish Community College, as well as all other transfer requirements, on the campus of LSUS. Conversations regarding simil ar bridge programs with Southern University's two -year campus in Shreveport have taken place, but there is currently no formal agreement between the two institutions for a similar bridge program. Associate Degrees LSU Shreveport does not offer any Associat e degree programs and therefore has no students pursuing an Associate degree. Non-Resident Student Tuition LSU Shreveport continued to increase its out -of-state tuition a nd fee rate and is now within $5 00 of the SREB projected average for 2014 -15 for SREB Category 4 institutions. LSUS vs SREB Average Non -Resident Tuition and Fees Baseline 2010 -11 2011 -12 2012 -13 2013 -14 2014 -15 Total tuition and fees charged to non - resident students in the reporting year $8,503 $9,605 $11,230 of ($1,883) ($440) based on an increase of 4.79% from 2013 -14 Impact on Enrollment and Revenue An increase in out -of-state tuition and fees has not had an impact on the number of students enrolling from out -of-state. Due to the growth in online pr ograms there has actually been a growth in the number of students enrolled that are not Louisiana residents. H owever, 15 these increases have mostly been see n in the online graduate programs that are offered through the collaboration with Academic Partnershi ps and the tuition and fees are the same regardless of location. Fall 201 4 UG GRAD Total Full Time 220 73 293 Part Time 73 173 246 Total 293 246 539 Percent of eligible programs with either mandatory or recommended accreditation status LSU Shreveport has 27 academic programs that have either mandatory or recommended accreditation status. Of the 27 programs, 2 2 are accredited. The MPH program went through the CEPH accreditation process for new programs in the fall 2014, and had their on -site visit during the spring 2015. The final outcome of this program accreditation will be announced in fall, 2015. 16 Section 5 Item Explanation fall 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 a.
