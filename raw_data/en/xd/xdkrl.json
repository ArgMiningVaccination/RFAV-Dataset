HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 1 MINUTES HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION Clackamas Community Colle ge Wilsonville Training Center, Rooms 111 -112 Wilsonville, Oregon August 11, 2016 Members Present : Som Saha, MD, MPH, MD; Kim Hodges, MD; Gary Allen, DMD. Members Absent: Irene Croswell, RPh Staff Present : Darren Coffman ; Ariel Smits, MD, MPH; Cat Livingston, Also Attending: Jesse Little Oregon Authority); Valerie King, MD , MPH , Adam Obley, MD, MPH, Craig Mosbaek Based Policy); Amara McCarthy; Amanda Kerbe; Duncan Neilson (Legacy Health). Call to Order Som Saha, Chair of the Health Evidence Review Commission ( HERC ), called the meeting to order . Role was called. Minutes Approval Meeting materials , pages 4-11 MOTION: To approve the minutes of the May 19, 2016 meeting as presented. CARRIES 11-0. (Absent: Garside ) Director's Report Membership Update Darren Coffman said Dr. Jim MacKay, vice -chair of the Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee (HTAS) recently retired. Also, in HTAS news, to fill the role of retired oncologist Gerald Ahmann, staff recruited and vetted a physician willing to serve on that subcommittee . Dr. Vinay Prasad is an oncologist and hematologist at OHSU specializing in lymphoma. He is nationally known for his research that seeks to improve the medical decisions doctors make, and improve the quality of evidence that doctors use to treat patients. Dr. Prasad is the author of \"Ending Medical Reversal: Im proving Outcomes, Saving Lives.\" Olson, also an oncologist, added his support for Dr. Prasad's appointment. Prasad regular ly publishes papers about topics this body debates and is a perfect fit for this work. HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 2 Darren said there a dentist is interested in serving on the Oral Health Advisory Panel (OHAP) . Dr. Len Barrozini , who is the Multnomah County dental director and would bring a nice perspective to the already -seated group . MOTION: To approve the appoint ments of Drs. Prasad and Barrozini to HTAS an d OHAP, respectively. Carries 11 -0. (Absent: Garside) Other Business Dr. Livingston explained, as b ackground , there is a statewide o pioid taskforce, c omprised of a diverse group of member s (including medi cal, pharmacy and nursing boards, associations, clinics, and Federally Qualified Health Centers ). Their guidelines are expected by the end of this year. This yea r, guideline note 60 was approved , which allowed for an array of treatments for back pain (acupuncture, chiropractic, yoga ) not previously covered. The guideline also limited use of surgical interventions and eliminated opioid use for chronic back pain. It appears the Commission may need to revisit the guideline to see how it applies to other types of chronic pain . Staff considered forming a workgroup to look at the opioid guidelines but decided to wait for the taskforce's recommendations and until a suff icient time has elapsed (6-12 months) for stakeholders to gain experience with the new guideline so that the appropriate issues can be discussed . Value -based Benefits Subcommittee (VbBS) Report on Prioritized List Changes Meeting materials , pages 58 -567 Ariel Smits reported the VbBS met earlier in the day , 8/11/2016 . She summarize d the subcommittee's recommendations. RECOMMENDED CODE MOVEMENT (effective 10/1/16) : Make various straightforward coding changes. Place the 2017 ICD -10-CM codes on various lines on the Prioritized List or in alternate implementation files . Add treatment codes and a new guideline to the covered laryngeal stenosis line to allow treatment of vocal cord dysfunction in children with dysphonia or dysphagia. Add placement code for implantable cardiac loop recorders to the diagnostic list with a new diagnostic guideline note. Add treatment codes for e lectronic tumor treatment fields to a covered cancer line with a new guideline limiting use to initial treatment of glioblastoma that meets certain criteria. o Commissioners concluded that it was discriminatory to disabled persons to include performance meas ure requirements such as the KPS or ECOG score over a certain level. There was concern that this provision might be in conflict with the ADA. Commissioners struck that portion of the proposed guideline (represented as red strike through wording ): GUIDELINE NOTE 155 ELECTRIC TUMOR TREAT MENT FIELDS FOR GLIO BLASTOMA Line 299 Electric tumor treatment fields (codes HCPCS A4555 and E0766) are included on this line only when : HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 3 1) Used for the initial treatment of supratentorial glioblastoma 2) Used in combination with temozolomide 3) The patient has Karnofsky Performance Status score of 70 or higher or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 -1 Electric tumor treatment fields are not included on this line for recurrent glioblastoma or any other indication. RECOMMENDED GUIDELINE CHANGES (effective 10/1/16) : Edit the preventive services guideline to remove dates for documents and add in links to the underlying government documents. Edit the hyperbaric oxygen guideline to correct two ICD -10-CM codes. o After a brief discussion about the coverage of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for radiation cystitis and radiation proctitis the Commissioners added codes for radiation (ICD N30.4) and radiation proctitis 62.7) on line 337 CONDITIONS REQUIRING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY Delete the diagnostic guideline regarding TB testing. Add a new guideline specifying coverage of acute mediastinitis, but not chronic mediastinitis. Add a new guideline requiring that the un derlying diagnosis be covered to allow for an encounter for desensitization for allergens. Edit the acupuncture guideline to clarify that the number of visits covered are per year or per pregnancy. Edit the back conditions medical guideline and opioid guideline to clarify the intent of coverage. MOTION: To accept the VbBS recommendations on Prioritized List changes not related to coverage guidances, as amended . See the VbBS minutes of 8/11/2016 for a full description. Carries: 12-0. Coverage Guidance Evidence Submission Policy Clarification Meeting materials , pages 569-570 Coffman began by recalling the discussion started at the May 19, 2016 meeting (pages 5 -6). Recently, after a coverage guidance was create d and vetted though the established polices and was being presented at a meeting, new evidence was submitted. The decision was to stop discussion until it was determined if the new evidence w ould change the recommendation. I n this case, it turn ed out that one of the documents didn't meet inclusion criteria and the other had been reviewed and did not meet inclusion criteria. This step significantly delayed the approval process. Staff have proposed a few changes to the previously reviewed language that would allow staff to determine if the evidence is a \"game -changer\" and allow staff to restrict consideration evidence submitted outside of 30 -day public comment period. Dr. Perez, a guest, testified that he was a previous late-submitter and explained there is some confusion about what was meant by \"reviewed.\" He felt his submitted evidence , though late, would be added to the evidence directly addressed in the coverage guidance public comment disposition. Coffman clarified staff followed the policy for comments received outside the official public comment period . Though they were not included in the coverage guidance public comment disposition because they were late, they were sent to Commissioners to be reviewed seven days prior to the meeting as specified in HERC's HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 4 policy . If the proposed policy language is accepted, staff would have discretion to decide if the submitted evidence meets the threshold to stop the current process. Gingerich and Livingston added that staff ha ve implemented a new communications system to inform stakeholders about t opics of interest. There was some discussion centered on agreement and minor text editing of the policy document ; please see Appendix A for the final language . MOTION: To approve t he Evidence Submission Policy as amended . Carries 1 2-0. Coverage Guidance Topic: Tobacco Cessation In Pregnancy Meeting materials , pages 571 -651 Dr. Obl ey began the presentation . The r ate of smoking at any time during pregnancy is 8.4% ; in Oregon, the rate is 10.3%, slightly higher than the national average . Of women who smoke in the first or second trimester, only 1 in 5 will successfully quit smoking by the third trimester . Smoking in pregnancy increases risk of miscarriage , stillbirth, preterm birth, growth restriction, placental abnormalities and abruption, and premature rupture of membranes . Exposure to secondhand smoke can also impact low birth weight and can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome . The scope of this coverage guidance looked at: Population: Women during pregnancy and the postpartum period Intervention: Screening for tobacco use, pharmacotherapy, behavioral interve ntions (telephonic, in person, individual, group), Internet based interventions, and multisector interventions such as policy, systems, and environmental change Comparator: No care, usual care, other studied interventions Outcomes : pregnancy complications (critical) , low birth weight (critical) , infant death (critical), abstinence from tobacco during pregnancy (important), long-term abstinence from tobacco (important) Evidence sources includ ed Cochrane and AHRQ systematic reviews. Dr. Charles Bentz , a Professor at the Pacific University College of Health Professions and a private practice physician at Fanno Creek Clinic in Portland and Dr. Duncan Neilson , Clinical Vice President, Legacy Health System of Portland , served as experts for the subcommitt ee's review of this topic. Dr. Neilson attended the meeting to address questions and provide additional assistance, if required. Livingstone read through the GRADE -Informed Framework ( page 574): Coverage question: Should pharmacotherapy or electronic nicotine delivery systems be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy? Coverage question: Should behavioral interventions be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy? Coverage question: Should ultrasound with high feedback be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy? Coverage question: Should financial incentives be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy? HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 5 Coverage question: Should partner support be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy? Coverage question: Should clinical interventions to reduce secondhand smoke exposure be recommended for coverage f or tobacco cessation in pregnancy? Saha commented on the wording of some of the questions such as partner support and high feedback . He said we seemed to be using terms from studies and he would rather see more common and understandable terms used . Furth er, he took issue with the statement about FDA -approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation (blue box, last paragraph) . The wa y it reads, the language appears to imply that pregnant women would be treated differently due to their condition and he suggest ed that their coverage be the same as for others in terms of pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation . Neilson said that nicotine replacement is routinely uses for pregnant patients. He also said that studies with pregnant women are flawed and difficult to conduct, making study results difficult to interpret . After some discussion, Commissioners edited the contested paragraph in the draft proposal as follows: Federal law requires coverage of tobacco cessation services, including FDA -approved pharmacoth erapy, for pregnant women. There is insufficient evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy on critical pregnancy -related outcomes. Therefore, there is no coverage recommendation on pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in pregnant women Coverage should be based on evidence for the use of pharmacological smoking cessation therapies in adults and adolescents with attention to their safety profiles in pregnant women . Further discussion led to deleting all instances of \"partner support.\" Staff were advise d to not make assumptions about a pregnant person's gender. Staff will make the language consistent throughout the coverage document, using \"during pregnancy\" where appropriate. Direct quotes from literature will be kept intact. MOTION: To approve the pr oposed coverage guidance for Tobacco Cessation In Pregnancy as amended. Carries 12 -0. MOTION: To approve the proposed coding changes edits and edits to Guideline Note 4 TOBACCO DEPENDENCE, INCLUDING PREGNANT WOMEN and Guideline Note 99 ROUTINE PRENATAL ULTRASOUND for the Prioritized List as amended. Carries 12 -0. HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 6 Approved Coverage Guidance HERC Coverage Guidance For women who use tobacco during pregnancy, the following interventions to aid in tobacco cessation are recommended for coverage: Behavioral interventions ( strong recommendation ) Financial incentives (incentives contingent upon laboratory tests confirming tobacco abstinence are the most effective) ( weak recommendation) Prenatal ultrasound with feedback around smoking impacts on the fetus (weak recommendation) The following interventions are not recommended for coverage: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (strong recommendation) Counseling -based interventions to reduce secondhand smoke exposure ( weak recommendation) Federal law requ ires coverage of tobacco cessation services, including FDA -approved pharmacotherapy, for pregnant women. There is insufficient evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy on critical pregnancy -related outcomes. Coverage should be based on evidence for the use of pharmacological smoking cessation therapies in adults and adolescents with attention to their safety profiles in pregnant women. Multisector Interventions To reduce the use of tobacco during pregnancy and improve associated outcomes, the evidence supports the following interventions: Financial incentives (incentives contingent upon laboratory tests confirming tobacco abstinence are the most effective) ( weak recommendation) Smoke -free legislation Tobacco excise taxes No or insufficient evidence is available for the following: Internet or text messaging based interventions Mass media campaigns specific to pregnant women HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 7 Changes to the Prioritized List of Health Services Modify Guideline Note 4 as follows : GUIDELINE NOTE 4, TOBACCO DEPENDENCE , INCLUDING PREGNANT WOMEN Lines 1, 5 Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling are included on this line 5, alone or in combination, for at least 2 quit attempts per year. A minimum of four counseling sessions of at least 10 minutes each (group or individual, telephonic or in person) are included for each quit attempt. More intensive interventions and group th erapy are likely to be the most effective behavioral interventions. For pregnant women, additional intensive behavioral counseling is strongly encouraged and not subject to limits. Inclusion on this line follows the minimum standard criteria as defined i n the Oregon Public Health Division \"Standard Tobacco Cessation Coverage\" (based on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), available here: https ://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Pages/pubs.aspx . The USPSTF has also made \"A\" recommendations for screening, counseling, and treatment of pregnant and nonpregnant adults, included in Guideline Note 106. The development of the pregnancy -related portions of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance. See http://www.oregon.gov/oha/herc/Pages/blog -reduce -tobacco - use-pregnancy.aspx Modify Guideline Note 99 as follows: GUIDELINE NOTE 99, ROUTINE PRENATAL ULTRASOUND Lines 1, 39,41,67 Routine ultrasound for the average risk pregnant woman is included on these lines for: A) One ultrasound in the first trimester for the purpose of identifying fetal aneuploidy or anomaly (between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation) and /or dating confirmation. In some instances, if a patient's LMP is truly unknown, a dating ultrasound may be indicated prior to an aneuploidy screen B) One ultrasound for the purpose of anatomy screening after 18 weeks gestation. For women using tobacco during pregnancy, additional counseling around smoking impacts on the fetus is included during this ultrasound. Only one type of routine prenatal ultrasound should be covered in a single day (i.e., transvaginal or abdominal). The development of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance. See http://www.oregon.g ov/oha/herc/Pages/blog MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS: TOBACCO PREVENTION AND CESSATION , INCLUDING PREGNANT WOMEN Benefit coverage for smoking cessation on Line 5 and in Guideline Note 4 TOBACCO DEPENDENCE is intended to be offered with minimal barriers, in order to encourage utilization. To further prevent tobacco use and help people quit, additional evidence -based p olicy and programmatic interventions from a population perspective are available here: Oregon Public Health Division's Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention Section: Evidence -Based Strategies for Reducing Tobacco Use A Guide for CCOs https://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/TobaccoPrevention/Documents/e vidence -based_strategies_reduce_to b_use_guide_cco.pdf Community Preventive Services Task Force (supported by the CDC) - What Works: Tobacco Use http://www.thecommunityguide.org/about/What -Works-Tobacco - factsheet -and-insert.pdf The Community Preventive Services Task Force identified the following evidence -based strategies: HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 9 To reduce the use of tobacco during pregnancy and improve associated outcomes, the evidence supports the following i nterventions: Financial incentives (contingent upon laboratory tests confirming tobacco abstinence are the most effective ) Smoke -free legislation Tobacco excise taxes Coverage Guidance Topic: Skin Substitutes for Chronic Skin Ulcers Meeting materials , pages 652 -760 Saha said VbBS did not complete their discussion on this topic so it is tabled. Public Comment Amanda Kerbe, a former fire fighter , with no conflicts of interest offered testimony about Guideline Note 60 . She said she suffers from stag e 4 c omplex regional pain syndrome and has tried alternant therapies such as acupuncture , massage, and yoga. The only thing that helps her function and thrive are opioids, which are prescribed by her medi cal team. She founded \"Patients Not Addicts\" , which advocates for chronic pain patient's right to opioids . She stated , \"Pain is hard, but even harder having doctors look at us as ad dicts.\" She said doctors should fight for those who are unable to fight for themselves, including patients who, for medical reasons, need opioids to function. Amanda shared about the stigma she experiences in her daily life, including doctors and professi onals in positions of power. In a recent custody battle, the state appointed custody evalu ator said that c hronic pain is just an excuse for an addict to get drugs . Amanda said in the absence of correctly prescribed medications, people who live in persisten t pain have three options: alcohol , street drugs , and s uicide She urged the commission to find a way to restrict inappropriate use without restricting appropriate use. Amanda shared her frustration that it is difficult for citizens to find out about meetings where topics like this are discussed. Smits and Williams said that HERC's policy is one part of the discussion; there is a multi -disciplinary taskforce who are decid ing on statewide policies. They urged her to connect with that group and offered a link to the website. Similarly, Amar a McCarthy shared her struggle with chronic pain , which stemmed from a motor vehicle accident in 2001. Among other things, she stated t hat an addict takes drugs to run from life ; a persistent pain sufferer takes medication to engage in life Saha clarified that Guideline Note 60 OPIOIDS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE applie s to spine pain treatment so her pain condition , as well as may others such as sickle cell anemia, are unaffected. He thanked the public commenters and ended by saying the he knows the commission is avoiding collateral damage with its actions. HERC Minutes 8/11/2016 10 Items for Next Meeting Staff will modify wording in the Tobacco Cessation in Pregnancy coverage guidance so that no assumptions are made about a pregnant person's gender. Adjournment Meeting adjourned at 4:30 pm. Next meeting will be from 1 :30-4:30 pm on Thursday , October 6, 2016 at Clackamas Community Appendix A Appendix A 1 Coverage Guidance Policy on Consideration of Evidence Discovered After Formal Public Comment Period For coverage guidances, the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) generally only includes studies during its initial Coverage Guidance development (before the relevant subcommittee reviews the first draft) or when these studies are submitted during the formal written comment period. The se studies are reviewed based on how well they address the pre -specified scope of the Coverage Guidance and their methodological quality. In exceptional circumstances, however, the HERC recognizes the need to review studies submitted by stakeholders or di scovered by staff outside the formal comment process. To minimize biases which may be introduced by consideration of evidence at other times in the process, HERC has approved this policy, outlining the circumstances which may justify consideration of new e vidence when it is discovered outside the formal routine guidance process and public comment period. Decisions about whether to delay the process for a new study will be made by staff, based on where a coverage guidance is in the development process and t he importance of the evidence in question. The new study or studies need to be likely to alter a recommendation in a way that would significantly impact health outcomes or cost for the population in question. Such studies are also typically: Randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews of randomized trials demonstrating comparative effectiveness or harm, or large registry or population -based studies demonstrating harm, AND are of Moderate or high quality according to HERC criteria If staff learns of a study after the formal comment period ends, staff will make a determination of the importance of the study in question based on the criteria above. Staff would delay the process as needed in order to incorporate the study and update the existing liter ature search to assure that there are not any additional studies which may be appropriate to include. For studies that do not meet these criteria, they could be resubmitted at the next scheduled two -year topic rescan. New coverage guidance topics can also be nominated for consideration annually. In the case of new evidence (that meets the criteria above) being identified after a Coverage Guidance has already been approved by the originating subcommittee, it would be referred back to that subcommittee befor e coming to HERC and VbBS. Less significant changes may be incorporated by the Commission during the final approval process. EbGS 9 -1-2016 Minutes Page 1 MINUTES Evidence -based Guidelines Subcommittee Clackamas Community College Wilsonville Training Center , Rooms 111 -112 29353 SW Town Center Loop E Wilsonville, Oregon 97070 September 1, 2016 1:30 -4:00pm Members Present : Wiley Chan, MD, Chair; Beth Westbrook, PsyD ; Alison Little, MD, MPH ; Kim Tippens, ND, MSAOM, MPH ; Eric Stecker, MD, MPH, Vice -Chair (by phone). Members Absent: George Waldmann, MD Staff Present: Darren Coffman , MD, MP H; Jason Gingerich; Daphne Peck. Also Attending : Moira Ray , MD, Val King MD, MPH , Craig Mosbaek , MPH and Rachel Hackett, MPH (OHSU Ce nter for Evidence -based Policy) ; Maria Rodriguez (OHSU) ; Jessie Little (OHA) ; Joanne Rogovoy (March of Dines) ; Steve Sebers (The CHP Group) ; David Bove (Pain Consultants of Oregon) . 1. CALL TO ORDER Wiley Chan called the meeting of the Evidence -based Guidelines Subcommittee (EbGS ) to order at 1:30 pm. 2. MINUTES REVIEW No changes were made to the draft 6/2/2016 minutes. Minutes approved 4-0 (Stecker not present ). 4. Review of public comment on Timing of Long -Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) Placement Ray reviewed the public comments presented in the meeting materials as well as some errors that were corrected in the draft coverage guidance . There were three major concerns expressed in public comment : One was coverage for women cover ed under the Oregon Health Plan's Citizen Alien Waved Emergency Medical (CAW EM) program. Currently, contraceptive care is not covered under the CAWEM plan . EbGS 9 -1-2016 Minutes Page 2 Others expressed the need for coverage for removal or other aftercare for women who have a LARC placed. Because these devices are long -lasting, women may require aftercare eve n after losing the health plan coverage that paid for their LARC device. Some fel t that this could be viewed as a form of coercion to use contraception if they can't get appropriate aftercare, especially LARC removal when fertility is desired. These issues are not directly within HERC's purview, since its work addresses people who are covered on a health plan, not uninsured people. Staff has, however, relayed these concerns to others in the Oregon Health Authority who may be able to address them . Ray reviewed staff's recommended changes to the draft coverage guidance, which acknowledges these issues. Living ston asked Rodriguez, who serves as ad hoc expert for this topic, if she had any additional comment. She said work is ongoing to address im plementation issues . In addition she is working with others on some standardized language for use in patient counseling to address concerns about about coercion. Livington reported that Medicaid fee -for-service is moving forward with the development of a plan to address immediate LARC placement, but that some Coordinated Care Organizations may have more work to do. A motion was made to approve the draft coverage guidance , including the changes presented in the meeting materials , then for ward the draft to HERC for review . Motion approved 4-0 (Stecker not present) . DRAFT COVERAGE GUIDANCE Immediate postpartum and postabortion placement of a long -acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) (implant or intrauterine device) is recommended for coverage (strong recommendation ). 5. Review draft scope statements for topic rescan on approved Coverage Guidances approved or rescanned in 2014 The subcommittee discussed scope statements for the following topics , with King and Livingston reviewing the key issues : Prenatal Genetic Testing (staff recommendation is to retire this covera ge guidance) Staff explained that with the Commission's new methodology, this coverage guidance would be impractical due to the wide variety of interventions. For the Oregon Health Plan , this topic will be left to the Prioritized List process and be handled by VbBS . There was minimal discussion. Planned Cesarean Birth King reviewed the draft scope statement ; there was minimal discussion. Routine Ultrasound in Pregnancy The subcommittee discussed the difficulties with answering the questions related to timing . Timing of ultrasound is challenging because pregnancy dating is not always exact. After brief discussion no changes were made. Livingston said that staff discussed breaking the cove rage guidance into separate parts for dating and fetal anomalies. King said some ultrasounds are for EbGS 9 -1-2016 Minutes Page 3 multiple purpos es. King said there is not a strong evidence base . King said that there are no new randomized trials and the additional observational trials are unlikely to change coverage policy. After discussion, the subcommittee decided to recommend retiring this coverage guidance since the existing guidance is driven more by practice guidelines than evidence. Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children Westbrook asked about later hearing loss , after the effusion is resolved . King said that t his can happen and would be included under the outcome of persistent hearing loss . Livingston said persistent will be defined according to how the studies define it rather than specifying a specific time period . King said that the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics have shifted on this and there appear to be evidence -based reasons for this. Chan clarified that the harm of antibiotic resistance would co me from population -based evidence as opposed to individual outcomes. Nonpharmacologic Interventions for Treatment Resistant Depression The subcommittee discussed whether to add acupuncture to scope (based on an emailed public comment) and decided against it. Livingston noted that the public commenter cited \"qualitative\" evidence; with such evidence, a review would likely produce a recommendation against coverage , so the subcommittee elected not to add acupuncture to scope. Acupuncture for major depression (as first line therapy) might be appropriate as a separate topic for a coverage guidance or for the Prioritized List. The subcommittee retitled the scope statement to clarify that it is only related to major depression (not milder forms of depression). At Westbrooks request, the key questions were edited to differentiate between recurrent versus single -episode major depressive disorder. Imaging for Low Back Pain The subcommittee removed the word \"advanced\" from the entire scope statement, as scope include s plain film x -rays. At Chan's request, the subcommittee removed the word \"nonspecific\" and replaced it with the language in the population description regarding acute low back pain and acute excacerbations. Under key question 2, the subcommittee added re sponse to prior treatments and known structural abnormalities as factors which may affect effectiveness . Westbrook asked how the coverage guidance would address monitoring of chronic low back pain; King explained that it would not. Low Back Pain: Pharmacological and Herbal Therapies The subcommittee added oral steroids, marijuana and homeopathic therapies to the list of interventions. Under key questions, the subcommittee added the source, preparation and standardization of herbal therapies and cha nged the wording from \"response to previous medication trials\" to \"response to previous interventions.\" The subcommittee then heard public comment from David Bove of Pain Consultants of Oregon. He expressed support for herbal therapies for low back pain, i ncluding California poppy and corydalis, which are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. After discussion of the HERC's evidence standards and methodology, he suggested that these products not be called out specifically in the scope statement on Pharmacolo gic and Herbal therapies for low back pain. Tippens questioned the omission of pain from the listed outcomes. Livingston acknowledged there is some disagreement about this within OHA clinical staff, with at least one person seeing pain as important since p ain is what patients complain of and seek relief for. She explained that measures of function often include pain as a component but focus on a person's ability to function in their environment. The subcommittee recognized that pain outcomes, use of pain as a fifth vital sign and treating pain to a level of zero may result in inappropriate opioid use. Low Back Pain: Non -Pharmacologic Non -Invasive Interventions EbGS 9 -1-2016 Minutes Page 4 Under key question 2 (f) the subcommittee replaced \"previous trials of non -pharmacologic, non - invasive interventions\" with \"any prior intervention\" and deleted contextual question 2 as it was duplicative. King noted that under important outcomes, change in utilization of opioid medications would be included in scope. Low Back Pain: Minimally Invasive and Non -corticosteroid Percutaneous Interventions King discussed several public comments which staff considered in the development of this scope statement. She noted that diagnostic injections are not in scope. The committee discussed that the scope statement did not need to change for the public comments, but the appointed expert may be key to discuss issues such as patient selection . The subcommittee discussed possible ad hoc experts for this topic. Neuroimaging for Dementia The scope statement was changed to consistently include mild cognitive impairment as well as dementia. The subcommittee also changed \"reversible causes of dementia\" to \"reversible causes of cognitive impairment\" for precision. The subcommittee recommended retiring this topic as w ell. A motion was made to approve all the scope statements as amended and retire the coverage guidances on Neuroimaging for Dementia, Prenatal Genetic Testing and Routine Ultrasound in Pregnancy. The motion was approved 5 -0. 6. ADJOURNMENT The meeting was adjourned at approximately 4 :30 pm. The next meeting is scheduled for November 3 , 2016 from 2:00 -5:00 pm at Clackamas Community College, Wilsonville Training Center, Rooms 111 -112, 29353 SW Town Center Loop E, Wilsonville, Oregon 97070 . HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 1 MINUTES Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee Clackamas Community College Wilsonville Training Center, Roo ms 111 -112 29353 SW Town Center Loop E Wilsonville, Oregon 97070 September 15, 2016 1:00-4:00pm Members Present : Som Saha, Livingston , MD, MP H; Jason Gingerich. Also Attending : Adam Obley, MD, Val King MD, MPH & Craig Mosbaek (OHSU Ce nter for Evidence - based Policy ); David Halmar, Abby Anderson (Bioventus) ; Barry Schlansky , MD (OHSU) ; Kari Thomas , MD (Legacy Good Samaritan) ; Andrea Herzka , MD (OHSU) . 1. CALL TO ORDER Saha called the meeting to order at 1 :14 p.m. 2. MINUTES REVIEW Minutes from the 6/16/2016 meeting were reviewed and approved 4-0 (Sorweide absent) . 3. STAFF REPORT Coffman reported that Derrick Sorweide has agreed to serve as chair of the subcommittee, beginning at the February, 2017 meeting. In addition, Vinay Prasad has been officially appointed to the HTAS, though he could not attend today's meeting. The subcommittee voted to appoint Sorweide as chair by a vote of 4-0 (Sorweide absent). 4. Noninvasive Testing for Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Obley reported that there were no public comments on this coverage guidance. Coffman noted that the Oregon Health Plan's fee -for-service Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will be discussing the appropriate treatment threshold for chronic hepatitis C, with a staff recommendation to change the treatment threshold to stage 2 fibrosis with revised prior authorization criteria which align with the draft HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 2 coverage guidance. These recommendations will be presented at the ir Se ptember 29th meeting , but if they are accepted the state will need to consider how to address the fiscal implication of this change. Dr. Barry Schlansky, the appointed ad hoc expert for this topic , expressed support for the draft coverage guidance as pres ented. Coffman said that he had been expecting comment on FibroSure. This test has historically been included in the prior authorization criteria for the direct -acting antivirals. No comments were received, and Coffman has heard indirectly that a leading O regon hepatologist is comfortable with the recommendations. The subcommittee voted to refer the draft coverage guidance to the VbBS and HERC. Motion approved 4-0 (Sorweide absent). DRAFT HERC Coverage Guidance If a fibrosis score of F2 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C, the following are recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) : Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) Touch tissue quantification, ElastPQ) Shear wave elastography (SWE) (Aixplorer\u00ae) Blood tests (only if tests are unavailable): Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) Fibrometer FIBROSpect\u00ae II If a fibrosis score of F3 is the threshold fo r antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C, one or more of the following are recommended for coverage (strong recommendation ): Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse wave elastography (SWE ) Magnetic resonance elastography is recommended for coverage for F2 or F3 only when at least one imaging test (FibroScan, ARFI, and SWE) has resulted in indeterminant results, a second one is similarly indeterminant, contraindicated or unavailable, an d MRE is readily available (weak recommendation). Noninvasive tests should be performed no more often than once per year (weak recommendation). The following tests are not recommended for coverage for the detection of liver fibrosis to guide HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 3 treatment de cisions with antivirals in chronic hepatitis C (strong recommendation): Imaging tests Real time tissue elastography 5. Scope statements for rescan of topics approved in 2014 The subcommittee discussed the draft scope statements, with Obley and Livingston presenting the key issues. Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy f or Wounds and Burns There was minimal discussion. Saha noted that the scope has been limited from the previous coverage guidance which covered a wide variety of indications for this therapy. Artificial Disk Replacement Livingston noted that the outcomes here are about function, not pain , and that this standard will be followed with all of the topics. Gingerich noted that public comments were forwarded to members of the subc ommittee in their entirety. Saha stated that while pain is important, it can be hard to measure , and that the reason to treat pain is ultimately to improve function. The subcommittee changed \"nonsurgical comparators\" to \"nonsurgical interventions (e.g. opi oids).\" Hip Resurfacing The subcommittee made the same change as made for Artificial Disk Replacement, with minimal discussion. Knee Arthroscopy in Patients with Osteoarthritis Farris said that he believes that this surgery has minimal benefits. Saha as ked why the outcomes are not the same as for the prior two topics. After brief discussion the subcommittee agreed to standardized the outcomes to match the hip resurfacing topic , substituting the outcome of total knee arthroplasty for utilization of total hip arthroplasty . Lumbar Discography The subcommittee made prognostic accuracy for surgical outcomes an important outcome (rather than critical) and utilization of surgery a critical outcome . Viscosupplementation for Osteoarthritis of the Knee Farris exp ressed his doubts that this intervention improves outcomes. David Holman provided public comment, representing Bioventus, which distributes two viscosupplementation products. He presented four publications showing that viscosupplementation delays total kne e replacement surgery, and asked that the scope statement include the delay in surgery. Saha said that it would under the outcome of utilization of surgery. Saha asked Obley to remove quality of life and to add utilization of nonsurgical interventions (e.g . opioids). DXA for Screening and Monitoring of Osteoporosis Obley explained that t his topic will be split into two topics for screening and monitoring . For the HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 4 screening topic, there was no discussion. For the monitoring topic, the subcommittee discusse d that in key question 2, hormones and vitamin D would be considered medications. Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome The subcommittee discussed that short -term function should be an important rather than a critical outcome , with long -term function as c ritical. The subcommittee agreed to make this change to all the previously discussed scope statements related to arthritis and back pain. Saha suggested changing the outcome of quality of life to avoidance of opioids , as with the other topics. Obley said that because of the assertion that this surgery delays hip arthritis, it is different than the others. Saha asked Farris whether the candidates for this surgery are generally in chronic pain. Farris said he would hope not; generally they are young athletes . Gingerich said that in the previous coverage guidance the recommendation was to cover the surgery , despite a low level of evidence. After brief discussion the subcommittee l eft the quality of life outcome and removed the population restriction which requ ired adolescents to be skeletally mature. Dr. Andrea Herzka provided public comment on this topic, noting that several large trials are underway comparing physical therapy to surgery. She believes these trials will provide the randomized evidence the HERC is looking for. However , the stud ies may have had difficulties getting patients to be randomized to a physical therapy protocol. She expressed support for the scope statement as amended. Sleep Apnea Treatment in Adults There was minimal discussion; the s ubcommittee made no changes. Upper Endoscopy for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) There was no discussion. The subcommittee voted 5 -0 to approve the scope statements as revised. 6. Coverage guidance statuses Since the meeting was running ahead of schedule, Livingston explained some proposed upcoming changes to the coverage guidance monitoring process. Due to the increasing number of approved coverage guidances that require monitoring, it is requiring more and more staff resources. Staff is prop osing a new status of \"inactive\" for topics where staff believes new evidence is unlikely to change conclusions. Such topics would only be rescanned if new evidence likely to change conclusions came to the attention of staff , either through their professio nal activities or by stakeholders. Staff would make that recommendation as a part of the rescan process and the decision would be made by the subcommittee and the Commission. HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 5 7. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (3D Mammography) for Breast Cancer Screenin g in Average risk Women Dr. Kari Thomas introduced herself. She is a radiologist at Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and OHSU. Her expertise includes breast, pelvic and fetal imaging. In her practice, she has used 3D mammography since 2012. Dr. Linda Humphr ey introduced herself. She is not an expert in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) but knows about breast cancer screening in general. Livingston noted that she was an author of the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation s related to mam mography . Obley reviewed the draft coverage guidance. Humphrey asked whether , in the STORM trial, the same radiologist read each mammogram two times, with DBT on the second reading. Obley confirmed that in the Housami et . al. report, it was a single radiologist, while in the Ciatto report (based on the same data) , there were two independent reviews of each mammogram. Saha asked whether Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) counted as cancer for these studies. Obley said that it did for m ost studies and added t hat, as shown in Table 3, some studies reported on the percentage of invasive cancers detected by each imaging modality. In most trials, the proportion of cancers detected were similar. Thomas shared her clinical experience that DBT detects more invasive c ancer , with the same amount of DCIS , though Obley confirmed the studies he reviewed showed mixed results . Thomas cited several more recent observational studies which which were not considered in the coverage guidance. She also noted that the studies which showed no difference in cancer detection rate were much smaller than those that did show a difference. After extensive discussion, the subcommittee decided to request staff perform a new evidence search to pick up observational trials which would not hav e met inclusion criteria for the original search and include them as well as studies submitted in public comment. Staff will edit the next version of the draft coverage guidance, incorporating this evidence. When Obley presented the data about the recall rate, the subcommittee discussed the general pattern of higher recall rates in the United States versus Europe, which accounts for the wide range in recall rates in both the DM and DBT+DM groups. Thomas noted that there are 9 studies which show a lower recall rate with DBT+DM, and the two studies showing a similar recall rate were actually conducted using the same data. She said that if you only look at the data from the United States, there are 11 studies that show lower recall rates with DBT+DM and none s howing different results. Humphrey noted that the difference in specificity of 96% versus 97% shown in the table may not look large , but are actually quite significant in terms of positive predictive value when applied to a large population. Obley said tha t there was only one study that calculated sensitivity and specificity. Based on the differential recall rate patterns in the U.S. and Europe, Saha asked that the studies be separated to reduce confusion. Livingston reviewed the resource allocation sectio n as well as the values and preferences and other factors leading to the recommendation for noncoverage. When Obley reviewed the other payer policies, Thomas noted that Cigna recently began covering DBT. HTAS 9 -15-2016 Minutes Page 6 Thomas asked about the cost information and cited economic reviews suggesting lower population costs due to lower recall rate and earlier detection of invasive cancers. Gingerich explained that the cost listed in the resource allocation section of the draft coverage guidance was based on the incremental costs of mammography alone, since the quality of the evidence suggesting lower recall and earlier detection is very low. The subcommittee requested that staff should add the cost modelling study cited by Thomas. The subcommittee added language to the res ource allocation column to indicate that if recall rates and biopsies are reduced, the additional costs of 3D mammography could be offset. Thomas commented that requiring evidence of impact on breast cancer morbidity and mortality should not be required for an improvement on digital mammograms, as these were not required for the conversion from film to digital mammography. Saha explained that the Commission knows it won't always get this data, but always looks for it in cancer -related topics. During the discussion of values and preferences, Thomas mentioned a new study published this week which showed that many women experiencing false positi ve mammograms still prefer annual screening. The subcommittee voted 5 -0 to put the draft coverage guidance out for public comment . Staff will incorp orate the results of an additional evidence search for newer trials together with the response s to public comments in the draft to be reviewed at the next meeting . 8. ADJOURNMENT The next new topic will be Breast Cancer Screening in Women at Above -Average Risk. Livingston asked whether the initial evidence search for this topic should follow the expanded approach as outl ined above. The subcommittee expressed agreement with this approach. The meeting was adjourned at 4:00 pm. The next meeting is scheduled for December 1 , 2016 from 1:00- 4:00pm in Room 111-112 of Clackamas Commu nity College. OHAP Minutes, 9/8/201 6 Page 1 MINUTES Health Evidence Review Commission's Oral Health Advisory Panel (OHAP) Clackamas Community College Wilsonville Training Center, Room 211 September 8, 2016 8:30-10:00 AM Members Present: Gary Allen, DMD, Chair; Bruce Austin, DMD; Deborah Loy (via phone) ; Mike Shirtcliff, DMD ; Lori Lambrig ht; Karen Nol MD, Attending: Wetherspoon, CareOregon Dental; All Health; Dayna Steringer, Advantage Dental . Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was calle d to order at 8:05 am and roll was calle d. The minutes from the 2015 OHAP meeting were reviewed and no corrections or concerns were raised. Coffman reviewed the charge of OHAP and the organizational structure within HERC. Loy requested that the extracted list of dental lines be reviewed for the current biennial review for possible line reprioritization, and also review of the procedure code placement. HERC staff will send out the extracted dental lines to the OHAP group via email for review prior to the next OHAP meeting . Topic: 2017 CDT code placements Discussion: 1) D0414: the suggested placement is identical to similar code D0415 and was felt to be appropriate 2) D0600: agreed that this procedure is experimental 3) D1575: no discussion 4) D4346: no discussion 5) D6081: There was r obust discussion regarding this at the August DCO meeting. Allen stated that interventions necessary to save the current dental situation (implant or OHAP Minutes, 9/8/201 6 Page 2 not) should be covered. Austin stated that this procedure would affect the health of surrounding teeth and bones. Loy stated that providers were concerned about provider liabil ity for treatment of an implant when they did no t place the implant initially. The group r esponse wa s that it is not always possible to get the patient back to the original prov ider and the responsibility of the current provider is to the patient and their health. Shirtcliff stated that he agreed with Allen to try to improve overall mout h health. The group felt that there was a n eed to discuss overal l coverage of implant codes, and determine what should be covered -- cleaning, maintenance, removal , and/or other procedures. HERC s taff was directed to pull implant -related CDT codes to review as a whole set to determine what should be covered. Included in this d iscussion should be coverage of placement of implants, as these are now becoming standard of care in dentistry and may be more cost effective than a partial denture. The next OHAP meeting should also consider implant l ine reprioritization. The que stion arose as to whether removal of an implant should be considered medical (i.e. extraction of a foreign body ) or dental . HERC staff indicated that bridges are also not currently covered. If implant placement and/or repair is considered for coverage, t hen bridge repair codes and possibly creation codes should also be considered. Coffman indicated that partial or complete coverage of implants and/or bridges raised the concern for cost increase. The group decided that D6081 should be placed on line 622 with other implant codes for now, and an OHAP meeting should be convened later this year to discuss implants and bridges as a biennial review item . The October DCO meeting will discuss this, then the next OHAP meeting will be planned for late November or early December 2016. Any changes to implant and/or bridge coverage will be discussed at the January HERC meeting and have implementation planned for January 2018. 6) D6085: this code is similar to D6081 above. Will place on line 622 for now and will include at next meeting for biennial review discussion of dental implant coverage. 7) D9311: There was discussion about how this code and D9991 -D9994 (below) could be implemented , as dental does not use ICD -10 codes and therefore the Ancillary File would be difficult for dental use. HSD staff indicated that MMIS would have to demonstrate that other covered CDT codes were billed with the visit. Schwartz was concerned that these ancillary services are not included in the DCO capitation rate, but feels that this would be very useful and should be supported. Shirtcliff asked who should be responsibl e for these types of services: dental, behavioral health, medical, public health? Loy stated that the system needs to get away from paying solely for den tal procedures, need s additional/other payment system to fund these case management services . Smits indica ted that case management services were rarely paid as an individual service in the medical world. 8) D9991 -D9994: Decision was made to put in the Ancillary File. HSD will work on who can use them, how they can be billed, and other operational rules. These codes will be made open for encounter purposes but unlikely to be reimbursed for now. Actions: 1) See Appendix A for spreadsheet of code place ments OHAP Minutes, 9/8/201 6 Page 3 Topic: GN17 Preventive Care Discussion: Tabled until November OHAP meeting Topic: GN43 Oral Surgery - Extraction of Third Molars Discussion: Smits introduced the summary of the issue. Allen w as concerned about the vagueness of the current guideline note. Others agreed that the current guideline is too vague and the rules based on this guideline were hard to interpret. Loy indicated that the proposed guideline was much improved. Allen address ed the proposed wording about requiring two or more episodes of pericoronitis. He indicated that there are other interventions other than extraction for pericoronitis. Austin asked about inclusion of unrestorable caries as an indication for extraction. Allen replied that the wording that the tooth can't be maintained would cover that situation. Shirtcliff inquired about the case of a painful erupted third molar, when the pain was excruciating or unmanageable. Schwartz replied that the correct path to t ake is to follow the evidence. The problem this guideline is attempting to solve is when the teeth are taken out prevent ively without pain or other pathology. Shirt cliff requested that intractable pain be added to the guideline as an indication for extra ction. Allen was concerned about how to define intractable pain. Allen thought that Health Partners Minnesota had a guideline about third molar extraction that addressed pain. He will look for that guideline and see if there is language in it that could be adopted regarding when painful third molars should be extracted. . There was also a question about what to do in the situation when an orthodontist requested extraction as part of braces \u2014the answer was not to cover this. Allen will get the Minnesota guideline he mentioned, and staff will rework the guideline and send around f or email approval of OHAP group, and will tentatively bring to the October VBBS meeting for approval. Actions: 1) HERC staff with work with Dr. Allen to revise guideline and will send to OHAP group with tentative plan to get email approval prior to the October, 2016 VBBS meeting . Otherwise discussion will continue at the November/December O HAP meeting. OHAP Minutes, 9/8/201 6 Page 4 Topic: Removal of tori and excision of hyperplastic tissue Discussion: OHAP felt that the proposed changes were an excellent idea. There was some discussion about the increase in cost associated with covering removal of this type of tissue. The counterargument was that there is increased cost in the preparation of dentures when this type of tissue is not removed. HSD will look into the cost of adding these services; if significant, then these changes may have implementation delayed. Actions: 1) Remove D7970 ( Excision of hyperplastic tissue -per arch ) from line 349 DENTAL CONDITIONS (EG. SEVERE CARIES, INFECTION) Treatment: ORAL SURGERY (I.E. EXTRACTIONS AND OTHER INTRAORAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES and add to line 457 DENTAL CONDITIONS (EG. MISSING TEETH, PROSTHESIS FAILURE) Treatment: REMOVABLE PROSTHODONTICS (E.G. FULL AND PARTIAL DENTURES, 2) Add D7472 of torus palatinus) and D7473 (Removal of torus mandibularis) to line 457 and remove from the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage table 3) Adopt a new guideline regarding D7970, D7472 and D7473 as shown below : GUIDELINE NOTE XXX R EMOVAL OF TORI AND E XCISION OF HYPERPLAS TIC TISSUE Line 457 D7472 and D7473, and D7970 are included on this line only when used in conjunction with m aking a prosthesis. Topic: Implant removal and debridement Discussion: Delayed until November /December OHAP discussion regarding implants Public Comment: No additional public comment was received. Issues for next meeting: 1) Preventive dental guideline 2) Biennial review of implants and dental bridges Next meeting: o TBD, plan a late November or early December 2016 meeting Adjournment The m eeting was adjourned at 10:12 AM.

Both guidelines reference intraocular steroid treatments and the same CPT codes. GUIDELINE NOTE 116, INTRAOCULAR STEROID TREATMENTS Lines 100, 365,445 Intraocular steroid treatments (CPT 67027, 67028) are included on 10-CM H30.0, met: uveitis is chronic, non-infectious, and there has been appropriate trial and failure, or intolerance of therapy, with local and systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. Intraocular steroid treatments (CPT 67027, 67028) are included on Line 100 for treating chronic diabetic macular edema (ICD- 10-CM E11.311) only when there has been insufficient response to anti-VEGF therapies, and only when FDA approved treatments are utilized. Intraocular steroid treatments (CPT 67027, 67028) are only included on Line 445 for treatment of macular edema due to: 1. central retinal vein occlusion (ICD- 10-CM H34.81) in those individuals who have failed therapy. 2. Branch retinal vein occlusion (ICD- 10-CM H34.83) when treatment with laser photocoagulation has not been beneficial, or treatment with laser photocoagulation is not considered suitable because of the extent of macular hemorrhage in those individuals who have failed anti-VEGF therapy. GUIDELINE NOTE 117, INTRAOCULAR STEROID IMPLANTS FOR RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION Line 445 Intraocular steroid treatments (CPT 67027, 67028) are only included on Line 445 for treatment of macular edema due to: 3. central retinal vein occlusion (ICD- 10-CM H34.81) in those individuals who have failed therapy. 4. Branch retinal vein occlusion (ICD- 10-CM H34.83) when treatment with laser photocoagulation has not been beneficial, or treatment with laser photocoagulation is not considered suitable because of the extent of macular hemorrhage in those individuals who have failed anti-VEGF therapy . 2. Modify GN 104 to clarify that viscosuplementation is not included on these lines for osteoarthritis of the knee and remove language about \"covered.\" Remove line 361 as CPT 20610 is not on that line. CPT 20610 is a generic code (Arthrocentesis, aspiration and/or injection, major joint or bursa (eg, shoulder, hip, knee, subacromial bursa); without ultrasound guidance) that could be used for other procedures. GUIDELINE NOTE 104, VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION OF THE KNEE Lines 361, 436, 467 Viscosupplementation of the knee (CPT 20610) is not covered for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016CPT 20610 is included on these lines only for interventions other than viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee.

VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Oculopathy 1 Question: Where should oculopathy diagnoses be placed on Prioritized List? Question source: HERC staff, HSD Issue: ICD10 ICD-9 only included diabetic oculopathy. The ICD- 10 codes were placed on lines containing the underlying disease (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, etc.). However, these lines do not contain the CPT codes required for treatment of the oculopathy. Diabetic oculopathy is listed as a subdiagnosis of ICD-9 250.50 (Diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations, type II or unspecified type) and similar codes. Oculopathy is no longer listed as a subdiagnosis for diabetic eye disease in ICD-10. The diabetic codes would appear on line 100 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY if they continued to be included as a subdiagnosis of diabetic eye disease. Oculopathy is an eye disease which can present as an interstitial keratitis, scleritis, iritis, chorioretinitis, or exudative retinal detachment. It can be caused by a variety of conditions. The current placement of these codes allows treatment of the underlying disease but not the eye manifestations. ICD-10 Code Code description Current pla cement A50.01 to SUBACUTE, CHRONIC AND OTHER TYPES OF IRIDOCYCLITIS, 340 SCLERITIS and 365 CHORIORETINAL INFLAMMATION a. Will allow treatment of eye manifestation of the disease b. Keep codes on their underlying disease lines VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Wigs for Chemotherapy/Radiation Induced Hair loss 1 Question: how should the Prioritized List be modified to indicate coverage for wigs for patients with hair loss due to chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment? Question source: HERC staff, HSD staff Issue : Under the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid expansion population has to receive a benefit which includes the Essential Health Benefits as defined by law. Oregon is selecting the PacificSource Codeduct Plan as its base benchmark, and that plan includes coverage for wigs of up to $150 per year for people who have undergone radiation or chemotherapy treatment. In order to meet other regulatory requirements in an efficient way, Oregon has chosen to provide a single benefit package for the expansion population and the categorically eligible populations. The most expedient way to meet this requirement is to add this coverage for wigs. Procedure code: HCPCS A9282 (Wig, any type, each) is on the Ancillary List Possible ICD-10 diagnostic codes: L58.0 (Acute radiodermatitis) is (Drug-induced androgenic alopecia) is on 588 DISEASE NAILS, HAIR AND HAIR FOLLICLES L65.8 (Other specified nonscarring hair loss) is on line 588 DISEASE OF NAILS, HAIR AND HAIR FOLLICLES. Radiation induced hair loss is indicated as a subdiagnosis T45.1X5 (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs) in on line 107 POISONING BY INGESTION, INJECTION, AND NON-MEDICINAL AGENTS T66.XXX (Radiation sickness, unspecified) which has adverse effects of radiation therapy as a subdiagnosis is on lines 337 CONDITIONS REQUIRING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY, 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT Y84.2 (Radiological procedure and radiotherapy as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure) is on the Informational List Z92.21 (Personal history of antineoplastic chemotherapy) is on the Informational List Z92.3 (Personal history of irradiation) is on the Informational List VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Wigs for Chemotherapy/Radiation Induced Hair loss 2 HERC staff recommendations: 1) Add HCPCS A9282 (Wig, any type, each) to line 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT a. Advise HSD to remove HCPCS A9282 from the Ancillary specified nonscarring hair loss) to line 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT 3) Adopt the following coding specification for line 428 a. \"ICD -10 L58.0, L64.0 and L65.8 are only included on this line for pairing with HCPCS A9282.\" 4) Adopt the new guideline below for line 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT GUIDELINE NOTE XXX W IGS Line 428 Wigs (HCPCS A9282) are covered only for hair loss due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Rehabilitative and Habilitative Therapies 1 Issues : 1) GN6 was discussed at the May, 2016 VBBS meeting and the VBBS directed staff to remove vascular and cardiac rehabilitation from the guideline, as these are very different type of services with different indications for frequency and use compared to other rehabilitative services. HERC staff was directed to create a new guideline for cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. After reviewing many private insurance policies regarding these services, staff determined that any such guideline would need to be extremely long and detailed. OHP medical directors were queried about their need for such a guideline and the unanimous reply was that such a guideline was not useful: these services are not abused and a detailed guideline would not assist the CCOs. Therefore, staff is proposing removing vascular and cardiac rehabilitation from this guideline with no new guideline. 2) GN 6 Rehabilitative Therapies requires several edits to bring it into compliance with federal rules regarding habilitative services. Excerpts from federal rule regarding habilitative services are shown below: a. Separate coverage limits must also be established for rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (see 45 CFR 156.115(a)(5)(iii)) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. A combined limit that cannot be exceeded based on medical necessity is not permissible. States will need to assess any existing limits on this coverage to determine if an amendment to the ABP SPA is required. b. Text of 45 CFR 156.115(a)(5)(iii) i. (iii) For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, do not impose combined limits on habilitative and rehabilitative services and devices. c. Federal definition of habilitative services: i. 45 CFR 156.115 1. (5) With respect to habilitative services and devices - 2. (i) Cover health care services and devices that help a person keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living (habilitative services). Examples include therapy for a child who is not walking or talking at the expected age. These services may include physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings; VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Rehabilitative and Habilitative Therapies 2 HERC staff recommendation: 1) Modify GN6 as shown below a. Brings guideline into alignment with federal regulations b. Removes cardiac and vascular rehabilitation from GN6 limits with no new guideline about these types of rehabilitation GUIDELINE NOTE 6, REHABILITATIVE AND HABILITATIVE THERAPIES Lines 34, 50,61,72,75,76,78,85,95,96,135,136, 561,574,592,611,666 The quantitative limits in this guideline note do not apply to mental health or substance abuse conditions. A total of 30 visits per year of rehabilitative therapy and a total of 30 visits per year of or habilitative therapy (physical, occupational and speech therapy , and cardiac and vascular rehabilitation ) are included on these lines when medically appropriate. Additional visits, not to exceed 30 visits per year of rehabilitative therapy and 30 visits per year of habilitative therapy , may be authorized in cases of a new acute injury, surgery, or other significant change in functional status. Children under age 21 may have additional visits authorized beyond these limits if medically appropriate. Physical, occupational and speech therapy , and cardiac and vascular rehabilitation are only included on these lines when the following criteria are met: 1. therapy is provided by a licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, physician, or other practitioner licensed to provide the therapy, 2. there is objective, measurable documentation of clinically significant progress toward the therapy plan of care goals and objectives, 3. the therapy plan of care requires the skills of a medical provider, and 4. the c lient and/or caregiver cannot be taught to carry out the therapy regimen independently. No limits apply while in a skilled nursing facility for the primary purpose of rehabilitation, an inpatient hospital or an inpatient rehabilitation unit. Spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, or cerebral vascular accidents are not subject to the visit limitations during the first year after an acute injury.

Documents from 10/6/2016Vitreous Hemorrhage with Retinal Tears 1 Question : How can the Prioritized List have coding changes to allow treatment of bleeding into the vitreous when there is a retinal tear? Question source: Andreas Lauer, MD, Casey Eye Institute Issue: When a retinal tear occurs, there may be bleeding into the vitreous which needs to be removed to allow laser therapy or cryotherapy to the actual retinal tear itself. Dr. Lauer recommends adding a vitrectomy code to line 304 VITREOUS DISORDERS which allows vitrectomy with laser photocoagulation (CPT 6703 9). All other vitrectomy (CPT 67039, on line 304. Dr. Lauer would like ICD-10 H43.1 (Vitreous hemorrhage) to pair with 67039. Currently 67039 appears on lines 100, 284, 290, 353, 365, 388, and 453. Dr. Lauer also recommends adding two diagnosis codes for retinal tears and breaks (ICD-10 H33.30, H33.31) to the retinal detachment line (284 RETINAL DETACHMENT AND OTHER RETINAL DISORDERS ) to allow pairing with vitrectomy with laser photocoagulation. Currently, H33.30 and H33.31 are only on line 379 RETINAL TEAR. The definition of these lines, however, would prevent this addition. His request is that H33.30 and H33.31 should pair with CPT 67039.

Question source: HERC staff Issue: During the ICD-10 podiatry review, the podiatry experts recommended moving ankle arthritis (M24.17x Other articular cartilage disorders, ankle/foot) from line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT to line 436 INTERNAL DERANGEMENT OF KNEE AND LIGAMENTOUS DISRUPTIONS OF THE KNEE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INJURY/IMPAIRMENT as they felt that ankle arthritis was of equivalent severity to knee arthritis. They also proposed moving a set of CPT codes for repair of ankle arthritis to this line ( CPT codes 20920-20924,27612,27690-27692,28008,28010,28035,28050-28072,28086-28092,28110- 28119,28126-28160,28220-28341,28360,28705-28760,29450,29750,29891-29907). This recommendation was discussed at two VBBS meetings, but never approved. However, M24.17 was moved to line 436 in error, but none of the proposed CPT codes for repair were moved. M24.17 also currently appears on line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS; it no longer appears on line 545. The relevant repair CPT codes for ankle arthritis appear on line 392. In a separate issue for this meeting, HERC staff are proposing deletion of line 392. The other M24.1 series codes for other non-ankle joints appear on line 392 and line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS other than the hip diagnosis (M24.15) which appears on the line 361 in addition to lines 392 and 530. There are multiple other ICD-10 codes which can be used for ankle arthritis, which appear in the table below. These codes are on inconsistent lines and may or may not have CPT codes pairing with them that are appropriate for surgical repair . Of note, major arthritis or recurrent dislocations of foot joints appear on line 364 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MAJOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS. Another appropriate arthritis line is 361 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS, AND ASEPTIC NECROSIS OF BONE. HERC staff recommendations: 1) Consolidate all specific ankle arthritis ICD-10 diagnosis codes to the arthritis medical and surgical lines (lines 361 and 467) as shown in the table below a. Leave \"not elsewhere classified \" and other non-specific diagnoses on uncovered lines b. Appropriate surgical CPT codes appear on line 361 for repair c. ICD-10 M24.17 (Other articular cartilage disorders, ankle and foot ) should only appear on an uncovered line as the primary types of arthritis (osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, etc.) are already on the upper lines d.

It causes pain and swelling of the toe, and may cause issues with walking. The treatment for this condition is typically NSAIDs, ice or heat packs, injections into the joint, physical therapy, and changes in footwear. Surgery may be required in patients with severe symptoms that do not respond to conservative measures. The main surgical options are fusion of the joint (arthrodesis), simple excision of the joint (Keller's procedure) and joint replacement with an artificial implant. Hallux rigidus is generally categorized into 4 types, depending on severity of symptoms and radiographic findings. Coughlin and Shurnas Classification Exam Findings Radiographic Findings Grade 0 Stiffness Normal Grade 1 mild pain at extremes of motion mild dorsal osteophyte, normal joint space Grade 2 moderate pain with range of motion increasingly more constant moderate dorsal osteophyte, <50% joint space narrowing Grade 3 significant stiffness, pain at extreme ROM, no pain at mid - range severe dorsal osteophyte, >50% joint space narrowing Grade 4 significant stiffness, pain at extreme ROM, pain at mid - range of motion same as grade III VBBS/HERC history The placement of hallux rigidus (ICD-10 M20.2) was reviewed by the podiatry and the orthopedics ICD-10 review groups. Prior to these reviews, the ICD-9 equivalent of M20.2 was on line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT. The podiatry group suggested moving M20.2 to 467 OSTEOARTHRITIS AND ALLIED DISORDERS with the addition of a series of This suggestion was discussed at length at two VBBS meetings, but no decision was reached. However, M20.2 was moved from line 545 to line 467 in error after these meetings, without any movement of CPT codes to allow treatment. Of note, line 467 is a medical line and does not contain other surgical procedures for other joints. The surgical line for osteoarthritis is 361 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS, AND ASEPTIC NECROSIS OF BONE. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Hallux Rigidus 2 The orthopedic ICD-10 review group subsequently reviewed ICD-10 M20.2 and suggested moving it from line 545 to line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS, which was not approved. The orthopedics documents were incomplete and the discussion related to this change cannot be located. However, after the orthopedic review at VBBS, one treatment code for hallux ridigus (CPT 28289) was added to line 392 but the ICD-10 code was not. This appears to be an error as well.

N=1 trial (20 patients) examining PT for osteoarthritis of the big toe joint b. Mean differences at four weeks follow up were 3.80 points (95% CI 2.74 to 4.86) for self reported pain, 28.30 \u00b0 (95% CI 21.37 to 35.23) for big toe joint range of motion, and 2.80 kg (95% CI 2.13 to 3.47) for muscle strength. Although differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups were reported, the risk of bias was high. The trial failed to employ appropriate randomisation or adequate allocation concealment, used a relatively small sample and incorporated a short follow up (four weeks). No adverse reactions were reported. c. Authors' conclusions The reviewed trial presented a high risk of bias, which limited conclusions that could be drawn from the presented data. The inclusion of only one trial indicates the need for more robust randomised controlled trials to determine the efficacy of interventions for this condition. 2) Roukis 2010, systematic review of cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy for hallux rigidus a.

A total of 18 (4.8%) procedures underwent surgical revision. c. cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy should be considered a first-line surgical treatment for hallux rigidus. However, there is still a need for methodologically sound prospective cohort studies that focus on the use of this procedure for specific grades of hallux rigidus and compare the subjective and objective outcomes as well as the need for surgical revision with other procedures. 3) Deland 2012, review of surgical treatment of hallux rigidus (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225095651_Surgical_Management_of_Hall ux_Rigidus - Study not included due to length) a.

The main outcome measures reported were pain relief and patient satisfaction. Three studies reported that 73% (8/11), 79% (46/58) and 100% (7/7) of joints with implants were pain free after mean follow-ups of 17 months, 12 years and 35 months, respectively. Another study including 86 implants reported a VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Hallux Rigidus 4 statistically significant improvement in pain scores after the procedure. Two further studies reported pain relief in 66% (59/90) of implants and 94% (30/32) of patients (mean follow-ups of 3 years and 8 years, respectively). c. Complications: The main complication reported was the formation of osteophytes around the implant. This affected between 4% (2/49) and 71% (41/58) of implants. in 0% (0/106) to 29% (21/73) of implants, and frequency of fracture was related to the length of time that the implant had been in place. At the follow-up assessment, between 0% (0/11) and 8% (3/37) of implants had needed to be removed (mean follow-ups of 17 and 70 months, respectively). Other complications included malpositioning of the implant, infection, inflammation, dislocation and persistent pain. 2) Roukis 2010 , review of autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty for hallux rigidus a. N=2 studies (23 patients) b. Both studies used the AOFAS First Metatarsal-Phalangeal-Hallux Scoring System, which had a mean of 26.0 preoperatively rising to 89.4 postoperatively. First metatarsal-phalangeal joint mean of 16.7_ preoperatively rising to 51.1_ postoperatively. Complications occurred in 4 (14.3%) feet and no feet required surgical revision. The results of this systematic review demonstrate improv ement in patient outcomes and first metatarsal-phalangeal joint dorsiflexion, as well as few complications following autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty for end-stage hallux rigidus. However, there is still a need for methodologically sound prospective cohort studies that compare autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty with other forms of arthroplasty and arthrodesis for end-stage hallux rigidus.

Aetna considers total prosthetic replacement arthroplasty with silastic implants and hemiarthroplasty medically necessary for persons with disabling arthritis of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint (hallux rigidus). Expert input: Chris Seuferling, DPM ...my research supports surgical procedures, at least in advanced stage cases of hallux rigidus (M20.21/2). I would recommend approving 2 surgical procedures for advanced stage hallux rigidus diagnosis M20.21/2): VbBS Issue Arthrodesis 1st MPJ B) 28292: Keller procedure (Though this is listed as bunionectomy, it is appropriate for advanced stage patient who is not candidate for fusion ie; older, inactive, or osteopenic patients) C) I would also recommend covering surgical procedure 28289 (cheilectomy) for earlier stage cases. Recommend covering stage 3 and 4 as the highest priority and cover fusion surgery (arthroplasty) only (not implants). Cheilectomy would be a lower priority for coverage as this is used for stage 1 and 2. Stages are based on radiographic findings. Stage 1 has a inflamed, painful joint with no radiographic findings; these patients have pain with exercise but not necessarily daily activities. Stage 2 has early radiographic findings; this stage can respond to conservative care (PT, injections, orthotics, etc.). Stage 3 and 4 have joint destruction and do not respond generally to conservative care. HERC staff summary Hallux rigidus is a disabling arthritic condition. The current evidence base for the efficacy of surgical treatment is of poor quality (small trials, methodological flaws) but there is generally poor quality l iterature in the podiatry field. Surgical treatments including joint implants are covered by most insurers and are recommended by NICE (based on 3 small studies). ICD-10 diagnosis codes for other arthritic conditions of the big toe joint are currently covered on line 361 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS, AND ASEPTIC NECROSIS OF BONE and pair with arthrodesis, but not cheilectomy or the Keller procedure.

VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Posterior Tibialis Tendinopathy 1 Question : Should surgical correction of flat foot (posterior tibialis tendinopathy) be reprioritized higher on the Prioritized List? Question source: Dr. Richard Owens, orthopedic surgery Issue : Flatfoot diagnoses are generally on uncovered lines, and the diagnoses on the Prioritized List used for this condition generally do not pair with the most used repair codes. Dr. Owens has requested that the HERC consider coverage for flat foot due to posterior tibialis tendonopathy. Dr. Owens feels that lack of coverage for the early forms of this disorder results in patients developing more severe stages and finally getting coverage for an ankle fusion surgery for the late states, when earlier care might have prevented the need for such extensive surgery. Flatfoot (hyperpronation and flattening-out of the longitudinal arch) (also known as pes planus or pes planovalgus) is a common deformity among children and adults. It may be congenital, or be acquired due to various conditions including posterior tibial tendon dysfunction. Lack of a functional arch affects the biomechanics of the lower leg and can result in pain. Flat feet are very common in children, and may resolve as the child grows. Flat feet can also develop as an adult ( \"adult acquired flatfoot \") due to injury, illness, unusual or prolonged stress to the foot, faulty biomechanics, or as part of the normal aging process. If a youth or adult appears flatfooted while standing in a full weight bearing position, but an arch appears when the person plantar flexes, or pulls the toes back with the rest of the foot flat on the floor, this condition is called flexible flatfoot. Most flexible flat feet are asymptomatic, and do not cause pain. In these cases, there is usually no cause for concern. In some patients, lower leg pain results from the flat foot, which can be treated with the use of shoes with properly fitting, arch-supporting orth otics. Rigid flatfoot, a condition where the sole of the foot is rigidly flat even when a person is not standing, often indicates a significant problem in the bones of the affected feet, and can cause pain in about a quarter of those affected. Other flatfoot-related conditions, such as various forms of tarsal coalition (two or more bones in the midfoot or hindfoot abnormally joined) or an accessory navicular (extra bone on the inner side of the foot) should be treated promptly, usually by the very early teen years, before a child 's bone structure firms up permanently as a young adult. Both tarsal coalition and a n accessory navicular can be confirmed by X- ray. Rheumatoid arthritis can destroy tendons in the foot (or both feet) which can cause this condition, and untreated can result in deformity and early onset of osteoarthritis of the joint. Such a condition can cause severe pain and considerably reduced ability to walk, even with orthoses. Ankle fusion is usually recommended. There are 4 stages of acquired flat foot deformity. Stage I is an inflammation of the tendon and normally is treated conservatively with braces. Stage II has the foot remaining flexible, with arch collapse and mild sinus tarsi pain. Stage III is a rigid fore and hindfoot, with severe sinus VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Posterior Tibialis Tendinopathy 2 tarsi pain and subtalar arthritis. Stage IV involves ankle pain, deltoid ligament compromise, and subtalar arthritis and talar tilt in ankle mortise are seen on xray. Acquired flat foot deformity is typically seen in middle aged patients with conditions such as diabetes. Treatment of asymptomatic flat feet is not required. Foot or leg pain due to flat feet is treated with orthotics for arch support, NSAIDs, and/or foot exercises. Surgery may be done for more severe stages of flat foot or when conservative therapy fails. From Dr. Rich Owen I am sending a review article from our orthopedic review journal. It discusses the four stages of adult acquired flatfoot deformity. Patients predictably progress from Stage 1 to at least Stage 3 and sometimes Stage 4 without treatment. Currently, OHP doesn't cover surgical or nonsurgical options. The condition is severely debilitating, and gets worse with time. Many times nonsurgical treatment does not work. Dr. Owens recommended the following coverage for acquired flatfoot: 1) Stage 1: braces or orthotics to prevent progression. 2) Stage 2: braces or orthotics.

N=3 trials (305 children) b. Data from one trial (40 children with juvenile arthritis and foot pain) indicated that use of custom-made orthoses compared with supportive shoes alone resulted in significantly greater reduction in pain intensity (mean difference (MD) -1.5 points on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% CI -2.8 to -0.2; number need to treat to benefit (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 23), and reduction in disability (measured using the disability subscale of the Foot Function Index on a 100mm scale (MD -18.65mm, 95% CI -34.42 t o -2.68mm). c. The second trial of seven to 11 year old children with bilateral flat feet (n = 178) found no difference in the number of participants with foot pain between custom-made orthoses, prefabricated orthoses and the control group who received no treatment. d. A third trial of one to five year olds with bilateral flat feet (n=129) did not report pain at baseline but reported the subjective impression of pain reduction after wearing shoes. No adverse effects were reported in the three trials. e. Authors' c onclusions The evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently too limited to draw definitive conclusions about the use of non-surgical interventions for paediatric pes planus. Future high quality trials are warranted in this field. Only limited interventions commonly used in practice have been studied and there is much debate over the treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic pes planus 2) MacKenzie 2012 , review of treatment of pediatric flatfoot a. N=13 studies, generally poor quality b. Conclusions: evidence for efficacy of nonsurgical interventions for flexible pediatric flat feet is very limited. Future research needs validated foot type assessment, applicable outcome measures for the intervention, the use of control groups, allowance for independent effects of footwear, age range comparisons, larger samples, and prospective, longer follow- up. 3) Bouchard 2014 , review of flatfoot in children and adolescents a. Most flexible flatfoot deformities are asymptomatic, will not lead to future pain or disability, and do not require treatment . b. Scant convincing evidence exists to support the use of inserts or shoe modifications for effective relief of symptoms, and there is no evidence that those devices change the shape of the foot. c. Surgery is rarely indicated, and in nearly all cases, an associated contracture of the heel cord is present d. Indications for flatfoot surgery are strict: failure of prolonged nonsurgical attempts to relieve pain that interferes with normal activities and occurs under the medial midfoot and/or in the sinus tarsi.

No evidence was identified on the rate of progression of early stages to later stages; similarly no evidence was identified on the ability of orthotics or braces to prevent such progression. If flatfoot progresses to ankle arthritis, there are effective surgical and non-surgical treatment available on the Prioritized List. Severe flat foot deformity treatment can also be pursued through the exceptions process. HERC staff recommendations: 1) Consolidate diagnosis and treatment of flat foot onto line 580 CAVUS DEFORMITY OF FOOT; FLAT FOOT; FLAT FOOT; POLYDACTYLY AND SYNDACTYLY OF TOES and remove from line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT 2) Add CPT 28735 correction) ) to line 580 and remov e from lines 364, 392, 545 3) Add the following CPT codes to for procedure descriptions 2) Other \"clean up\" code movements 1) Add ICD-10 M21.6 ( Other acquired deformities of foot ) to line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT and remove from line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Acupuncture Guideline Clarification October 2016 1 Question : How should the acupuncture guideline be modified to specify limits for tobacco cessation? Question source: HERC staff Issue : Tobacco cessation (line 4) was added to the acupuncture guideline in May, 2016. Previously, there were no session limits for acupuncture to tobacco cessation. The May, 2016 change added the restriction of 12 sessions per year. 12 sessions was chosen to be consistent with the session limits for other conditions. The staff evidence summary from the May meeting is belo w: Four meta-analyses (White 2014, Di 2014, Cheng 2012, and Tahiri 2012) came to varying conclusions [about whether acupuncture alone was effective for tobacco cessation], either finding superiority of acupuncture over control/sham at 0-6 months or inconclusive. The differences between the meta-analyses was most attributable to differing methods of pooling. In general, the w idely varying acupuncture techniques and protocols used in RCTs let to the inability to draw firm conclusions on effectiveness. The general staff conclusion is that acupuncture may be helpful for smoking cessation, and is definitely not harmful. The number of visits used in study protocols ranged from 3-20, but were generally fewer than recommended by experts. There is insufficient evidence about the need to pair acupuncture with other therapies for smoking cessation. The acupuncture guideline was updated at the August, 2016 meeting to limit treatments to a certain number \"per year\" or \"per pregnancy.\" Tobacco cessation was left off that discussion, but will be included in the acupuncture guideline on the October, 2016 Prioritized List. To be consistent with the August, 2016 changes, the acupuncture sessions for tobacco cessation would be limited to 12 per year. However, the ACA mandates two quit attempts be covered per year. The acupuncture guideline could be modified to reflect that 12 sessions would be covered for each quit attempt as mandated by the ACA. Note: the ACA does not require acupuncture be covered for tobacco cessation at all. HERC staff have received guidance from the Oregon Department of Justice that tobacco cessation is included under mental health parity and therefore may not be subjected to hard visit numbers. Two possible changes to the acupuncture guideline could be made to accommodate this: either remove tobacco from the guideline and therefore subject to no visit limits or add in wording to make the visit limits \"soft limits.\" VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Acupuncture Guideline Clarification October 2016 2 HERC staff recommendations: 1) Modify GN92 as shown below regarding tobacco cessation a.

VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Tobacco smoking and surgical procedures Tobacco smoking and procedures, Issue #755 Page 1 Question : Tobacco smoking and elective surgeries Question source : Medical Directors from CCOs Issue : At the November 2015, January 2016, and August 2016 VbBS meetings, a new proposed guideline on tobacco cessation and elective surgeries was discussed. At the most recent meeting, several changes were made to the proposed guideline. 1) Consider elimination or modification of the language around patients with serious and persistent mental illness 2) Expanding the guideline to include all elective surgical procedures, including podiatry, other dental procedures, and more. Add language about excluding specific categories (such as diagnostic, oncologic, and reproductive). 3) Modify the 6 month cessation language to be more clear for implementation Selected e xcer pts from initial evidence summary Thomsen, 2014 (document not included due to length) 1. Cochrane systematic review of RCTs looking at interventions for preoperative smoking cessation 2. 13 trials including 2010 participants 3. Smoking cessation at least 4 weeks prior to surgery results in improved morbidity 4. Smoking cessation counseling a. Brief interventions ineffective for either complication reduction or long term smoking cessation b. Intensive interventions, defined as weekly face to face for 4-8 weeks with telephonic support, and with pharmacotherapy (NRT) are effective 5. Optimal period unclear 6. Conclusion: There is evidence that preoperative smoking interventions providing behavioral support and offering NRT increase short-term smoking cessation and may reduce postoperative morbidity. Based on indirect comparisons and evidence from two small trials, interventions that begin four to eight weeks before surgery, include weekly counselling and use NRT are more likely to have an impact on complications and on long-term smoking cessation.

Mayo Clinic laboratories http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test- catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/82510 a. In addition to nicotine and metabolites, tobacco products also contain other alkaloids that can serve as unique markers of tobacco use. Two such markers are anabasine and nornicotine. Anabasine is present in tobacco products, but not nicotine replacement therapies. Nornicotine is present as an alkaloid in tobacco products and as a metabolite of nicotine. presence of anabasine >10 ng/mL or nornicotine >30 ng/mL in urine indicates current tobacco use, irrespective of whether the subject is on nicotine replacement therapy. The presence of nornicotine without anabasine is consistent with use of nicotine replacement products. Heavy tobacco users who abstain from tobacco for 2 weeks exhibit to tobacco smoke can cause accumulation of nicotine metabolites in nontobacco users. Urine cotinine has been observed to accumulate up to 20 ng/mL from passive exposure. Neither anabasine nor nornicotine accumulates from passive exposure. 4.

HERC STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Discuss adoption of a new guideline note: ANCILLARY GUIDELINE NOTE X, SMOKING CESSATION AND ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES Smoking cessation is required prior to elective surgical procedures for active tobacco users. Cessation is required for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure and requires objective evidence of abstinence from smoking prior to the procedure. Elective surgical procedures in this guideline are defined as surgical procedures which are flexible in their scheduling because they do not pose an imminent threat nor require immediate attention within 1 month. Reproductive, cancer- related and diagnostic procedures are excluded from this guideline. The well-studied tests for confirmation of smoking cessation include cotinine levels and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. However, cotinine levels may be positive in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) users (which is not a contraindication to elective surgery coverage). In patients using NRT the following alternatives to urine cotinine to demonstrate smoking cessation may be considered: o Exhaled carbon monoxide testing (well studied) o Anabasine or anatabine testing For patients with psychosis or cognitive delay, intensive smoking cessation should be offered, but cessation is not required prior to elective surgery if quit attempts exacerbate their mental health. Certain procedures, such as lung volume reduction surgery, bariatric surgery, erectile dysfunction surgery, and spinal fusion have 6 month tobacco abstinence requirements. See Guideline Notes 8, 100, and 112. Additional issues: Modify guideline notes 8, 100, and 112: A) to be consistent in requiring cotinine level testing, and B) consider adding language about the frequency of testing.

VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Congenital Torticollis 1 Question should congenital torticollis be Question source: VBBS acquired torticollis (ICD-10 M43.6 Torticollis) was removed from line 407 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE and kept only on line 607 DISORDERS OF SOFT TISSUE as an errata. This placement was consistent with previous placement of this code prior to the implementation of the new back lines. At the August meeting, VBBS members expressed concerns that congenital torticollis (ICD-10 (Congenital deformity of sternocleidomastoid muscle) is currently on line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS. HERC staff was directed to review the evidence for various treatments for congenital torticollis and propose a new line placement which would allow coverage for those treatments found to be effective. VBBS was most interested in having this condition covered in children. G24.3 (Spasmodic torticollis) is on line 367 DYSTONIA of muscle(s); neck muscle(s), excluding unilateral (eg, for cervical dystonia, spasmodic torticollis)) for botulinum toxin injection but not physical therapy CPT codes (97001, 97002 and similar). The OHP medical directors felt that congenital torticollis was a condition that affected infants and very young children. Once a child has reached the age of approximately 3 years, the condition is harder to treat and neuroplasticity is no longer present. Defects in vision, hearing, and other complications from the torticollis will likely no longer respond to treatment of the torticollis at this point in neurodevelopment. Torticollis in older children may cause disabilities, but these disabilities would likely be treatable using different diagnosis codes. HSC/HERC history In August 2011, congenital torticollis (ICD- 9 754.1 Congenital torticollis) was removed from 428 SPINAL DEFORMITY, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT and 596 SPINAL DEFORMITY, NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT and added to line 551 ACUTE AND CHRONIC DISORDERS OF SPINE WITHOUT NEUROLOGIC IMPAIRMENT by the HOSC/HSC. This decision was based on the fact that 50-70% of cases of congenital torticollis spontaneously resolve in the first year of life with minimal residual deficits. PT is indicated if complications are not resolving. One review cited (Do 2003) indicated that botulinum toxin and surgery may be considered for resistant cases after 6 months of physical therapy. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Congenital Torticollis 2 Evidence 1) Suhr 2015 , review of treatment for congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) a. Review includes \"early onset, ages birth to 3 months\" and \"later onset, ages 3 months to 6 months.\" b. Conservative management of CMT can achieve good- to-excellent outcomes in greater than 90% of cases. Prognosis and treatment duration vary depending on infant age at onset of treatment, severity of ROM restrictions c. CMT may have long-term developmental consequences. d. The major intervention is PT, and parent training e. Adjunct therapies may be added to the first-choice interventions if appropriate, such as microcurrent, myokinetic stretching, kinesiological taping, Tscharnuter Akademie for Motor Organization approach, and orthoses such as a tubular orthosis for torticollis (TOT) collar, soft foam collar, and custom-fabricated cervical orthoses 2) Cheng 2000 , prospective case series of PT for congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) a. N=1,086 infants b. Interventions: i. N=266 (24.5% of patients): home treatment for deficit of passive rotation of less than 10 degrees 1. Results: no deterioration detected in any patient. 5% changed to manual stretching group when no improvement was seen without 4 weeks after start of treatment. All patients had excellent results at final assessment, none required surgical intervention. i. N=820 (75.5% of patients): Manual stretching by PT for deficits of passive rotation of the neck of more than 10 degrees, with 3 sessions per week. Therapy stopped when full passive rotation of the neck was regained or there was no further improvement after 6 months of treatment a. Results: Most cases treated with manual stretching showed progressive improvement of the range of side flexion, rotation, the head tilt, the craniofacial asymmetry, and a decrease in the tumor size in the SMT group. b. The overall mean duration of treatment with physiotherapy was 118 days (3.9 months). c. The overall final outcome scores for the manual stretch group were excellent and good in 91.1%. ii. Surgical treatment: The indications for surgery were for patients with significant head tilt and deficits of passive rotation and side flexion of the neck greater than 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 and the presence of tight band or tumor in the SCM. They either have not responded to or improved additionally after at least 6 months of physiotherapy manual stretching. For the majority of patients a uniform method of distal unipolar open release and partial excision of the clavicular and sternal heads of the sternomastoid muscle was done. Postoperatively, an intensive program VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Congenital Torticollis 3 of physiotherapy was prescribed that included scar treatment, maintenance of full passive range of motion of the a. Conclusions: Patients with initial deficits of passive rotation of less than 10\u00b0 showed excellent and good outcome with active home positioning and stimulation program. The remaining cases with rotation deficits of over 10\u00b0 and treated with manual stretching program showed an overall excellent to good results in 91.1% with 5.1% requiring subsequent surgical treatment. 3) Cheng 2001, subgroup analysis of PT group from Cheng 2000 a. Adverse events with manual stretching: Sudden giving-way or snapping of the sternomastoid was observed during treatment with manual stretching in 8%. This group had good outcomes b. Conclusion: This large prospective study demonstrated that controlled manual stretching is safe and effective in the treatment of congenital muscular torticollis when a patient is seen before the age of one year. 4) Kim 2015 , meta-analysis of surgical treatment for neglected congenital cervical torticollis a. N=12 studies (220 patients) i. All studies used an interrupted time-series design ii. Surgical intervention were unipolar or bipolar release iii. Patients were 8-27 years of age iv. Follow up 2-9 years v. All studies rated as having high risk of bias b. Results: Surgical treatment was successful in 81 percent of cases, based on the scoring systems for surgical outcome. The summary effect size of a successful result of surgical treatment was 0.81 (95 percent CI, 0.73 to 0.87). The range of motion of the neck and skeletal deformities showed significant improvement after surgery. a. Conclusions: Surgical treatment for neglected congenital muscular torticolli s produced satisfactorily successful results, with improvement in both the range of motion of the neck and secondary skeletal deformities. b.

(Evidence Quality: II; Recommendation Strength: Moderate) HERC staff summary Congenital muscular torticollis with <10 degrees of rotation can be safely and effectively managed with home based interventions. CMT with >10 degrees of rotation has good outcomes with manual stretching physical therapy. Surgical interventions are rarely required. Botulinum toxin injection is not an effective treatment for CMT. The majority of studies are in infants (<1 year of age).

There are only approximately 20 ICD-10 codes on line 392 that do not also appear on line 364. There is no clear definition of what is considered a major vs a minor joint. The diagnoses on line 392 include hip, wrist, shoulder, ankle, finger and toe conditions, while the diagnoses of line 364 include basically all joints. The ICD-10 Orthopedics group never finished their review due to the overwhelming number of new ICD-10 codes and their complexity. Therefore, there is not clear guidance on how these lines should be treated. On review, HERC staff found very few codes on line 392 that could not be easily placed elsewhere, and did not see a good rationale for maintaining both of these lines. Additionally, these two lines have caused confusion and beew n sadfasdasd source of numerous questions from providers and plans about what diagnoses were intended to appear on each. Line 392 contains only 2 CPT codes not found on line 364 (CPT 26045 and 26426). CPT 26045 is on one other appropriate line. CPT 26426 is on two other inappropriate lines and needs to be added to the line containing the diagnosis of boutonniere deformity. HERC staff recommendations: 1) Delete line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS a. All ICD-10 codes also appearing on line 364 should remain on line 364 b.

Question source : Carl Ste vens, MD, OHP Medical Director with CareOregon Issue : Dr. Stevens requested that coverage for uncomplicated inguinal hernias in adults and for any type of umbilical or ventral hernia be reviewed. He feels that lack of coverage for uncomplicated hernias in adults limits many symptomatic patients and affects their ability to work. He feels that elective repair of hernias, especially in young patients with symptomatic abdominal wall hernias that limit their ability to work, would allow return to functional status. He also argues that such repair is the commun ity standard of care. The current guideline may result in undue morbidity and disability in members with symptomatic hernias. Historically, repair of uncomplicated hernias has not been covered as the complication rate with watchful waiting was felt to be very low. Hernia repair surgery is the most common elective surgery in the US. Coverage for repair of uncomplicated ventral and/or inguinal hernia has been discussed extensively at the H ealth Services Commission and HERC (see below). History : 1) In 1994, move uncomplicated hernias in children under age 18 to covered line due to significantly higher rate of complication if left untreated ( >30% in children vs <2% in adults). 2) 1998 biennial review considered moving uncomplicated hernias for patients over age 1 8 from the low uncovered line to a covered line. Noted that complicated/obstructed hernias had a death rate of 10% if untreated, and 0.5% if treated. No change was made with that review other than adding some surgical CPT codes missing from the covered line. 3) 2002 biennial review looked at coverage for uncomplicated hernia. In that review, ventral hernias were added to the lower, uncovered hernia line. 4) In 2005, ventral hernias were considered for addition to the upper hernia line, but not moved. Reducible umbilical hernias in children were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 5) In 2006, the current guideline was added to clarify when hernias were on the covered upper line. 6) In 2007, coverage for hernias in children were reviewed, and coverage maintained due to evidence of higher rates of complications for children. 7) In 2008, the guideline was clarified that all incarcerated hernias are on the upper line. Laparoscopic repair codes were added to the upper hernia line 8) In 2008, repair of large ventral hern ias was reviewed. The outcomes of repair of large ventral hernias, with our without mesh, was found to be poor. 9) In 2010, Dr. Gubler, a surgeon on the HOSC, recommended coverage of inguinal hernias, as femoral hernias were covered. He also felt that fat incarc eration rather than 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 2 intestinal incarceration, should be a covered indication for repair. No changes were made based on his recommendations. 10) In 2012, the ICD -10 general surgery review group proposed div iding the two hernia lines into 3 lines. The evidenc e supporting the safety of expectant management was discussed. Members decided to continue the current line structure for hernias. All ventral hernias were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 11) In 2014, ventral hernias were again discussed and the hernia g uideline modified to clarify coverage. 12) In 2015, ventral hernias were again discussed and lack of any coverage, even when incarcerated, was clarified again. Evidence Inguinal hernia, watchful waiting (WW) vs surgical repair 1) AHRQ 2012 , comparative effectiveness review of inguinal hernia repair a. For pain -free hernia, watchful waiting was compared to surgical repair b. Two studies met inclusion criteria. One compared WW with Lichtenstein repair, and the other compared WW with \"tension -free mesh repair\" (w hich might have been Lichtenstein repair). Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias for all outcomes reported. c. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: long - term QOL, which was reported as \"overall change in health status in previous 12 months\"; long -term pain; and acute hernia/ strangulation. The evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion for one outcome: long -term QOL, for which the results favored repair over WW. Estimated difference on a 0 -11 scale, 7 points (CI: 0.4 to 14.3) d. Evidence level was considered low 2) Fitzgibbons 2006 and 2013 , RCT of WW vs surgical repair a. N=720 men (364 watchful waiting, 356 surgical repair) b. At 4.5 years, p rimary intention -to-treat outcomes were similar at 2 years for watchful waiting vs surgical repair: pain limiting activities (5.1% vs 2.2%, respectively; P=.52); PCS (improvement over baseline, 0.29 points vs 0.13 points; P=.79). Twenty -three percent of pa tients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to receive surgical repair (increase in hernia -related pain was the most common reason offered); 17% assigned to receive repair crossed over to watchful waiting. Self -reported pain in watchful -waiting patien ts crossing over improved after repair. Occurrence of postoperative hernia -related complications was similar in patients who received repair as assigned and in watchful -waiting patients who crossed over. One watchful -waiting patient (0.3%) experienced acut e hernia incarceration without strangulation within 2 years; a second had acute incarceration with bowel obstruction at 4 years, with a frequency of 1.8/1000 patient -years inclusive of pat ients followed up for as long as 4.5 years. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 3 c. After 11.5 years, the es timated cumulativ e cross over rates using Kaplan -Meier analysis was 68%. Men older than 65 years crossed over at a considerably higher rate than younger men (79% vs 62%). The most common reason for cross over was pain (54.1%).A total of 3 patients have required an emergency operation, but there has been no mortality. d. Conclusions Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe because acute hernia incarc erations occur rarely. The later study added that patients should be counseled that symptoms will likely progress and an operation will eventually be needed. 3) Chung 2010, RCT of WW vs surgical repair a. N=160 mean , with painless inguinal hernia (80 surgery, 8 0 WW) b. Mean follow -up of 7.5 years i. 42 men had died (19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group) ii. 46 of the 80 men randomized to observation had conversion to operation. iii. The estimated conversion rate (using the Kaplan -Meier method) for the observation group was 16 (95 per cent confidence interval 9 to 26) per cent at 1 year, 54 (42 to 66) per cent 5 years and 72 (59 to 84) per cent at 7.5 years. The main reason for conversion was pain in 33 men, and two presented with an acute hernia. Sixtee n men developed a new primary contralateral inguinal hernia and three had recurrent hernias. iv. Conclusion: Most patients with a painless inguinal hernia develop symptoms over time. Surgical repair is recommended for medically fit patients with a painless in guinal hernia. 4) Mizrahi 2012 , systematic review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernia a. N=41 articles b. No significant difference in pain scores and general health status were found when comparing the patients who were followed up with the patients who had surgery. A significant crossover ratio ranging between 23% and 72% from watchful waiting to surgery was found. In patients with watchful waiting, the rates of IH strangulation were 0.27% after 2 years of follow -up and 0.55% after 4 years of follow -up. In p atients who underwent elective surgery, the range of operative complications was 0% to 22.3% and the recurrence rate was 2.1%. c. Conclusion: Both treatment options for asymptomatic IH are safe, but most patients will develop symptoms (mainly pain) over time and will require operation. 5) Hwang 2014 , retrospective cohort study in NHS of WW vs sur gery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. NHS instituted a nationwide policy of WW for asymptomatic inguinal hernias in 2010 b. A total of 1,032 patients undergoing inguinal her nia repair in the 16 months after the policy change were compared with 978 patients in the 16 months before. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 4 c. RESULTS The period after the policy change was associated with 59% higher odds of emergency repair (3.6% vs 5.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 -2.47). In turn, emergency repair was associated with higher odds of adverse events (4.7% vs 18.5%, Fisher's exact test). d. CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a watchful waiting policy for asymptomatic inguinal hernias was associated with a significant increase in need for emergency repair, which was in turn associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Current policies may be placing patients at risk . 6) Van den Heuval 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. The risk of incarceration is approximately 4 per 1,000 patients with a groin hernia per year. Risk factors for incarceration are age above 60 years, femoral hernia site and dur ation of signs less than 3 months. b. The recurrence rate after tension -free mesh repair in the management of emergency groin hernias is comparable to that of elective repair. c. There is no divergence in pain and quality of life after elective repair compared to watchful waiting. There is no advantage in cost -effectiveness of elective repair compared to watchful waiting. d. Conclusion Watchful waiting for asymptomatic groin hernias is a safe and cost - effective modality in patients who are under 50 years old, have an ASA class of 1 or 2, an inguinal hernia, and a duration of signs of more than 3 months . 1) INCA 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernias for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic inguinal hernia a. Mortality associated with elective hernia repair was investigated as a primary outcomes measure in 11 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 65. Mean mortality associated with elective hernia repair was 0.2% (range 0% to 1.8%) b. Mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was investigated as a pr imary outcomes measure in 13 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 7. Mean mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was 4.0% (range 0% to 22.2%) c. Rate of incarceration and/or strangulation has been investigated by 4 retrospective cohort stud ies as primary outcomes and 2 randomized trials as secondary outcomes. The yearly rate of irreducibility associated with a nonoperative approach was 0.4% (range 0.2% to 2.7%) d. The crossover from watchful waiting to operation has been reported by 2 randomize d trials. Combining these figures, 13% (range 8.0% to 19.5%) of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic inguinal hernia patients assigned to watchful waiting management will cross over for inguinal hernia repair. e. A meta -analysis of long -term follow -up studies co ncerning recurrence is reported by inguinal hernia guideline of the European Hernia Society.Data of all trials with a follow -up of >48 months were reported comparing recurrences after Lichtenstein and endoscopic repair. We converted the observed probabilit ies of recurrence into annual rates, assuming a constant rate of recurrence. Because 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 5 no substantial difference in recurrence rate between the Lichtenstein technique and endoscopic repair was reported, we calculated a mean yearly recurrence rate of 0.9% (ra nge 0.2% to 4.0%). f. Conclusions: the available data suggest that life expectancy for elderly male inguinal hernia patients associated with watchful waiting or operation differs very little. Therefore, the general doubt about operating on mild symptomatic and asymptomatic elderly hernia patients, illustrated by 2 recent randomized trials investigating pre and postoperative pain for these types of management, is justified. In case of asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients, there seems to be no difference i n pain relief between watchful waiting and operation. Ventral hernia repair, watchful waiting vs surgical repair 1) Bellows 2014 , longitudinal cohort study of WW a. N=41 patients i. 11 patients lost to follow up, 7 died of other causes b. 24 patients followed for 2 years i. 1 had incarceration ii. There was no deterioration in the AAS score (baseline vs 24 months 5 28 vs 25, P 5 0.60). There was deterioration of the physical functioning dimension of the SF -36 (baseline vs 24 months 5 40 vs 32, P \\0.01), but the mental func tioning dimension was improved (45 vs 51; P 5 0.01). c. Conclusions: Watchful waiting was a safe option for patients in this study with ventral hernias. 2) Stey 2014 , cohort study of WW vs surgical repair a. N=243 patients i. 80 were observed, 69 underwent repair of an incarcerated hernia, and 94 underwent repair of a nonincarcerated hernia. b. Quality of life as measured by utility score was less at 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 -0.71) in patients who did not undergo repair compared with th ose after repair of a nonincarcerated hernia, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73 of a nonincarcerated hernia was cost -effective with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,646 per quality -adjusted lifeyear. c. Conclusion. The prompt elective repair of ventral hernias is cost -effective. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 6 HERC staff summary ; Based on two large RCTs as well as several meta -analyses, there appears to be a low r ate of progression of inguinal hernia to incarceration or obstruction. When obstruction or incarceration does occur, the complication rate for emergency surgery compared to elective repair appears to be similar. It is important to note that these studies were all done in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, and patients who develope d pain were no longer followed by watchful waiting. In several large studies, the rate of eventual surgical repair, mainly due to the development of pain, was very high. The AHRQ report found that quality of life was significantly improved with surgical r epair. Repair of inguinal hernia was not generally associated with improved function, but the functional measures may have been skewed by the repair of painful hernias . One cost study found no cost -effectiveness advantage in elective repair compared to watchful waiting. Based on several small studies, watchful waiting for ventral hernia appears to be a safe strategy that did not affect disability or quality of life. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Discuss what outcomes would lead to consideration for reprioritization of inguinal hernia repair a. Traditionally have only covered repair for children (higher risk of incarceration or other complication), and adu lts with obstruction, gangrene or otherwise complicated . Evidence still shows that watchful waiting is safe and that emergent repair has little increase in surgical complication compared to elective repair b. Does quality of life, pain, or function constitute an outcome which should lead to consideration for coverage? 2) Make no change in the current non -coverage of repair for ventral hernia a. Good evidence for lack of benefit for repair b. See separate issue for minor guideline clarification VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Ventral hernias Ventral hernias Page 1 Question: Should the complicated hernia guideline be edited for clarity? Question source : Alison Little, MD, Medical Director, PacificSource Issue: There is still confusion about obstructed versus incarcerated ventral hernias and whether they fall on Line 172 or on Line 527. GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non-reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic incarceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation. HERC Staff Recommendation: 1) Modify Guideline Note 24 as follows: GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of intestinal obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non-reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding incarcerated ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic incarceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 1 Questions : 1) Should cervical fusion be included on the upper surgical line with cervical decompression surgery? 2) In what situations should lumbar fusion be included on the upper surgical line with lumbar decompression surgery? 3) Is fusion included on the upper surgical line for treatment of spondylolisthesis? 4) Is radiculopathy that meets the clinical criteria in GN37 eligible for surgery on the upper line? 5) When is spinal surgery emergent for the purposes of the spinal surgery smoking cessation guideline? Question source: HERC staff, OHSU Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery, CCO Medical Directors, HSD Issue: New back surgery guidelines went into effect July 1, 2016 with the new back line changes. The back surgery group at OHSU has had multiple questions and concerns about the new guidelines. Additionally, similar questions have been raised by CCO medical directors and by community based neurosurgeons/orthopedic surgeons and by Health Services Division at OHA. These questions mainly concern when spinal fusion should be covered with decompression surgery. A second question has been raised about when radiculopathy is covered for surgical treatment; specifically, why there is a definition of radiculopathy in GN37 when that particular diagnosis ICD-10 code is not included on the upper surgical line. Additionally, questions have been raised about the spinal cessation prior to spinal surgery guideline and when a surgery is considered urgent enough to justify not requiring smoking cessation. Based on input from the spinal surgery community and the CCO medical directors, HERC staff has drafted revisions to the back surgery guideline and the smoking cessation in back surgery guideline. 1) Regarding coverage for cervical spinal stenosis: the CCO medical directors and OHSU back surgery group felt that the current national neurosurgical guidelines and the evidence support the use of fusion with cervical decompression because of the increase in complications including kyphosis when fusion is not included. 2) Regarding other exceptions to the clause not allowing fusion for spinal decompression: the OHSU back surgery group recommended the following exceptions to the non-coverage of spinal fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: a. If >50% of joint resected for foraminal stenosis, th is creates instability and therefore needs fusion b. Spondylolisthesis c. Scoliosis >10 degrees d. No evidence that multilevel surgery causes lumbar spinal instability. Ok to not have fusion. 3) There is general confusion among the CCO medical directors and surgeons regarding the back surgery guideline in terms of the coverage for spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis. Currently, there is confusing wording about spondylolisthesis which requires spinal stenosis to be present before spondylolisthesis is covered, but then the spinal stenosis clause restricts fusion eve n when spondylolisthesis is present. Experts argue is not standard of care. Review of the Back Pain Lines Reorganization Task Force (BPLRTF) meeting notes finds that the intent was to pair VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 2 spondylolisthesis with decompression AND fusion. The guideline appears poorly worded and should be clarified. 4) GN37 includes a definition of radiculopathy. However, radiculopathy was not included on the upper surgical line intentionally by the BPLRTF. The intent was to not cover surgical correction of radiculopathy unless there was another diagnosis such as spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis. Review of the BPLRTF meeting notes finds that the neurosurgical member, Dr. Keenan, did not feel that this definition was needed, as the diagnoses on the upper surgical line had neurologic complications included by definition. The two surgical lines would be differentiated by diagnosis rather than by a definition of neurologic complication. However, the definition was left in the guideline as the OHP medical directors at that time felt that they would be useful and requested their continued inclusion. The only diagnoses included on the upper surgical line include myelopathy, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or spinal instability. Radiculopathy is only included on the lower back surgery line. The Prioritized List prior to the new back lines contained a GN37 with this definition of clinically significant radiculopathy. This GN37 tied into another previous guideline (GN41), and which defined when spinal stenosis w as clinically significant: \" Clinically significant spinal stenosis is defined as having MRI evidence of moderate to severe central or foraminal spinal stenosis in addition to a history of neurogenic claudication, or objective evidence of neurologic impairment consistent with MRI findings (see Guideline Note 37).\" 5) The OHSU back surgery group was strongly in support of our smoking cessation guideline for spinal surgery. The OHP medical directors ha ve requested clarification on when back surgery should be considered emergent and the smoking cessation requirement waived. The back surgery group at OHSU provided HERC staff with wording regarding when back surgery is considered emergent. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 3 Evidence \u2014Cervical Laminectomy +/- Fusion 1) Yoon 2013 , systematic review of cervical laminoplasty vs laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical myelopathy a. N=4 retrospective cohort studies b. For patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), data from 3 class of evidence III retrospective cohort studies suggest that there is no difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy or pain: 2 studies reported no significant difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy, and 3 studies found no significant difference in pain outcomes between treatment groups. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, one small class of evidence III retrospective cohort study reported significant improvements in myelopathy severity after laminectomy and fusion compared with laminoplasty, but no differences in long-term pain between treatment groups. The overall evidence on the comparative safety of laminoplasty compared with laminectomy and fusion is inconsistent. Reoperation rates were lower after laminoplasty in 2 of 3 studies reporting. However, the incidence of debilitating neck pain was higher after laminoplasty as reported by one study; results on neurological complications were inconclusive, with 2 studies reporting. Results on kyphotic deformity were inconsistent, with opposite results in the 2 studies reporting. After laminectomy and fusion, 1% to 38% of patients had pseudarthrosis. Infection rates were slightly lower after laminoplasty, but the results are not likely to be statistically significant. c. Conclusion. For patients with CSM, there is low-quality evidence that suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy and fusion procedures are similarly effective in treating CSM. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is insufficient. For both patient populations, the evidence as to whether one procedure is safer than the other is insufficient. Higher-quality research is necessary to more clearly delineate when one procedure is preferred compared with the other. 2) Ryken 2009 , systematic review of cervical laminectomy without fusion for the treatment of CSM a. N=26 studies, mostly case series fr om the 1960's and 1970's b. Studies suggested that the incidence of postlaminectomy kyphosis ranged from 14 to 47%. c. Recommendations: i. Indications. Laminectomy is recommended as a surgical treatment option for symptomatic CSM in selected patients in whom the risk of postoperative kyphosis is felt to be minimal (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). ii. Technique. Laminectomy is recommended as a surgical treatment option for symptomatic cervical myelopathy. The limitations of the technique are an increased risk of postoperative kyphosis compared to anterior techniques, laminoplasty, or laminectomy with fusion. However, the development of kyphosis does not appear to diminish clinical outcome (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D) 3) Anderson 2009 , systematic review of cervical laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of CSM a. Three studies compared results of laminectomy and fusion to other surgical techniques. These were all class III studies and had important methodological defects that limited their conclusions VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 4 i. Comparison of results according to surgical method revealed that laminectomy and posterior fusion yielded significantly better neurological recovery compared to all other methods. b. Summary: Class I or II evidence to support the use of laminectomy and fusion for treatment of myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not exist. Class III evidence shows consistently that 70 -95% of patients show postoperative neurological improvement. Laminectomy and fusion consistently results in ventral and dorsal spinal cord decompression. a. Recommendations: i. Indications: Cervical laminectomy with arthrodesis is recommended in the treatment of patients with CSM and OPLL (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). ii. Technique: Cervical laminectomy with arthrodesis is recommended as an equivalent strategy to laminectomy or laminoplasty for functional improvement in the treatment of patients with CSM and OPLL. There is conflicting data as to whether fusion improves functional outcome relative to laminectomy with one study showing arthrodesis superior and one showing equivalency (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). 2) Fehlings 2013 , cohort study of decompression with fusion for cervical myelopathy a. N=260 patients at multiple centers, follow up for 1 year after surgery b. Results: There was a significant improvement from baseline to one year postoperatively (p < 0.05) in the mJOA score, Nurick grade, NDI score, and all SF-36v2 health dimensions (including the mental and physical health composite scores) except general health. With the exception of the change in the mJOA, the degree of improvement did not depend on the severity of the preoperative symptoms. These results remained unchanged after adjusting for relevant confounders in the multivariate analysis. c. Fifty-two patients experienced complications (prevalence, 18.7%) d. Conclusions: Surgical decompression for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy was associated with improvement in functional, disability-related, and quality- of-life outcomes at one year of follow-up for all disease severity categories. Furthermore, complication rates observed in the study were commensurate with those in previously reported cervical spondylotic myelopathy series. e. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level II. Evidence/Society Guidelines \u2014Lumbar Laminectomy +/- Fusion 1) Resnick 2014 , Evidence review and Neurosurgical Society guidelines on spinal fusion for spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis a. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration. Since publication of the original guidelines there have been a significant number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 5 have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion procedure. b. Recommendations: i. Surgical decompression and fusion is recommended as an effective treatment alternative for symptomatic stenosis associated with a degenerative spondylolisthesis in patients who desire surgical treatment. (Grade B) c. Evidence based on 31 articles (5 systematic reviews) 2) Resnick 2014 , Evidence review and Neurosurgical Society guidelines on spinal fusion for spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis a. For those patients [with lumbar stenosis] who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without unde rlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended. b. Recommendations: i. Surgical decompression is recommended for patients with symptomatic neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis who elect to undergo surgical intervention (Level II/III evidence). Grade B recommendation ii. In the absence of deformity or instability, lumbar fusion has not been shown to improve outcomes in patients with isolated stenosis, and therefore it is not recommended. (Level IV evidence). Grade C recommendation c. Evidence based on N=36 studies HERC staff summary of evidence: Based on case series studies, many from the 1960's and 1970's, fusion in addition to laminectomy for cervical myelopathy appears to result in equivalent clinical outcomes to laminectomy alone but has lower risk of complications such as kyphosis. Specialty society evidence-based guidelines recommend laminectomy without fusion for spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis or other instability. For spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis or other instability, these guidelines and expert input support decompression with fusion. VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Back Surgery Guidelines 6 HERC staff recommendations: 1) Discuss possible changes to GN 37 as shown below. Several changes are generally agreed upon by the back surgeons and the CCO medical directors; other changes appear to require further clarification a. Allow fusion with decompression surgery for cervical spinal stenosis b. Clarify that spondylolisthesis grades 2 and 3 that results in spinal stenosis can be paired with decompression and fusion procedures i. There has been a request for clarification of whether grade 1 spondylolisthesis should be paired with fusion procedures c. Allow fusion with lumbar decompression without spondylolisthesis in situations of spinal instability i. Needs further work to better define when spinal instability exists or is created. For example, the medical directors have questions about how to determine when >50% of the foraminal joint is resected, as this is never documented in chart notes d. Consider whether central canal stenosis and foraminal stenosis should be combined together or better separated out e. Consider deleting the definition of radiculopathy, or somehow indicating that this definition applies to foraminal stenosis f. Consider coverage of very limited types of radicular pain without myelopathy 2) Modify GN 100 as shown below a.

VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Mechanical Chest Wall Oscillation 1 Question: should mechanical chest wall oscillation to facilitate lung function (CPT 94669) be included on the Prioritized List? Question source: Kim Wentz, MD, HSD medical director; Hill-Rom Issue : Chest wall oscillation involves using devices/systems for clearing excess mucus from lung airways (bronchi and bronchioles). It is principally used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, but is gaining use in the treatment of other diseases, such as bronchiectasis, COPD , cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy , in which excessive mucus can block airways due to excessive production or impaired clearance. Chest wall oscillation was a new CPT code for 2014. This code was reviewed during the CPT code review in late 2013. At that time, a Cochrane review (Morrison 2011) was reviewed, which did not find good evidence that chest wall oscillation was more or less effective that other treatments (mainly PT). Other major insurers (CMS, Aetna, NHS) were covering this procedure and the initial staff recommendation was for coverage. The VBBS discussion involved the fact that this modality was no more effective that other treatment modalities; a cost-effectiveness comparison was requested. That cost comparison was done in January, 2014, and mechanical chest was oscillation was found to be substantially more expensive that other treatments ($37-45/month rental or $1,100 purchase vs one time PT training for caregivers); although comparable to some therapies ($50/mo for flutter device, $39/mo for PEP device). The VBBS/HERC decision was to add this therapy to the Services Recommended for Non-Coverage List as being less cost effective than equally efficacious therapies . Dr. Wentz has requested reconsideration of coverage for mechanical chest wall oscillation due to multiple requests for this service that have been received by HSD. The cases HSD are seeing are those in which a patient fails other therapy or for whom therapies like home PT are not feasible. The HSD request is for consideration of chest wall oscillation as a second line therapy. Evidence --cystic fibrosis I. Morrison 2014 (update of previous review), Cochrane review of chest oscillation devices for cystic fibrosis (CF) i. N=35 studies (total of 1050 participants) ii. One long-term study (seven months) compared oscillatory devices with either conventional physiotherapy or breathing techniques and found statistically significant differences in some lung function parameters in favour of oscillating devices. iii. One study identified an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure . iv. There were some small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devices. v. Authors' conclusions There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. The findings from one study showing an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscillating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may have significant resource implications. More adequately-powered long-term randomised controlled trials are necessary and VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Mechanical Chest Wall Oscillation 2 outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, patient preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Increased adherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters, such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined with other forms of airway clearance is efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis. II. Main 2013, Cochrane comparison of PT vs other airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis i. N=15 studies (475 participants) ii. There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude any differences, between CCPT and other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function measured by standard lung function tests. Studies undertaken during acute exacerbations demonstrated relatively large gains in respiratory function irrespective of airway clearance technique. Longer-term studies demonstrated smaller improvements or deterioration over time. Ten studies reported individual preferences for technique, with participants tending to favour self- administered techniques. Heterogeneity in the measurement of preference precluded these data from meta-analysis. iii. Authors' conclusions: This review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of CCPT over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. There was a trend for participants to prefer self- administered airway clearance techniques. Limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately powered, long-term trials. Evidence --Bronchiectasis III. Lee 2013 , Cochrane comparison of airway clearance techniques for bronchiectasis ) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008351.pub2/epdf Study not included due to length) i. N=5 studies (51 participants) 1. 4 adult, 1 pediatric 2. Looked at a variety of airway clearance techniques, including mechanical chest oscillation ii. Heterogeneity between studies precluded these data from meta-analysis and the review was therefore narrative. iii. One study on 20 adults comparing an airway oscillatory device with no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low-quality evidence). iv. No data were available to assess the impact of ACTs on the time t o exacerbation, duration of, incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life in both disease-specific and cough-related measures. While based on a small number of participants and the data were skewed, the median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 8.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon), low-quality evidence). v. Two studies reported mean increases in volume of sputum expectorated with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% CI 3.4 to 13.4 mL) VbBS Issue Summary Documents from 10/6/2016Mechanical Chest Wall Oscillation 3 and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02), with no significant effect on lung function. vi. One study reported an immediate reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation in adults with non-positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared to no ACTs. A similar decrease in pulmonary hyperinflation (difference in FRC of 6%) was found in children using an airway oscillatory device for 3months compared to sham therapy. vii. No studies reported on the effects of gas exchange, people's symptoms or antibiotic usage. viii. Authors' conclusions: ACTs appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis, where there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health-related quality of life. The role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. In view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, more data are needed to establish the clinical value of ACTs over the short and long term on patient-important outcomes, including symptoms, on physiological outcomes which may clarify the rationale for each technique and on long-term parameters that impact on disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis. This is necessary in order to provide further guidance of specific ACT prescription for people with bronchiectasis. It may also be important to establish the comparative effect of different types of ACTs in people with bronchiectasis.

[D] 2) Lechtzin 2016 , Impact of High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation on Healthcare Use in Patients with Neuromuscular Diseases a. Cohort study of claims data, patients with a variety of neuromuscular disease b. N=426 patients c.

Inpatient admission costs decreased by $2,392 (41.7%) (P = 0.001), and pneumonia costs decreased by $514 (18.1%) (P = 0.015). d. Conclusions: Total medical costs, hospitalizations, and pneumonia claims were less after than before initiation of HFCWO in a broad group of patients with neuromuscular disease. Subject to the limitations that administrative data did not capture how HFCWO was used and that HFCWO may be a marker of generally better care, our findings lend support to the routine use of this intervention in the care of patients with neuromuscular diseases .

RATIONALE FOR GUIDANC E DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents important uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clinical care Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Coverage guidance development follows to translate the evidence review to a policy decision. Coverage guidance may be based on an evidence -based guideline developed by the Evidence -based Guideline Subcommittee or a health technology assessment developed by the Heath Technology Assessment Subcommittee. In addition, coverage guidance may utilize an existing evidence report produced by one of HERC's trusted sources, generally within the last three years. 2 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenti ng evidence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each eleme nt, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assessment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidence -based Policy . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission. Coverage question: Should bariatri c surgery be recommended for coverage in adults ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations All-cause mortality (Critical outcome) Odds ratio : 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64) Crude event rates 3.6% with surgery and 11.4% without surgery Number needed to treat = 13 Bariatric surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars per surgery, but has been shown to be cost effective across BMI thresholds and surge ry types. Patients would balance surgery and its risks with risks of living with morbid obesity. Many patients who have failed conservative attempts at weight loss may elect surgery. The benefits of decreased mortality, dramatic weight loss, and regression of diabetes are important outcomes that patients and society would The greatest benefit may be with BMI 40 but otherwise specific subpopulations which would benefit the most from bariatric surgery are not well characterized. The pre -operative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the rate of compli cations and need (low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) Major adverse cardiovascular events (Critical outcome ) Odds ratio: 0. 54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.7 0) Crude event rates 2.4% with surgery and 4.0% without surgery Number needed to treat = 62 (low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) 3 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Coverage question: Should bariatri c surgery be recommended for coverage in adults ?

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Rationale: Bariatric surgery appears to lower all -cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in obese adults (low certainty), and significantly reduces BMI, and results in resolution of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The greatest benefit appears to be wit h BMI 40. Though bariatric surgery is costly and carries significant perioperative risks, the clear long -term positive health benefits lead s to a recommendation for coverage. The strength of the recommendation is based on the fact that there is a strong benefit on critical outcomes (particularly in diabetics), and patients desiring surgery would strongly prefer this intervention. For those without diabetes, and other comorbidities are present, the evidence is less clear, leading to a weak recommendation. Recommendation: Coverage of metabolic and bariatric surgery (including Roux -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sle eve gastrectomy) is recommended for: Adult o bese patients (BMI 35 and <40 ) with : o Type 2 diabetes (strong recommendation) OR o at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities : hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea (weak recommendation) Adult o bese patient s (BMI 40) (strong recommendation) Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak rec ommendation).

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations All-cause mortality (Critical outcome ) Insufficient evidence in this population High cost (tens of thousands of dollars) but may be cost effective especially given the long time horizon if weight loss is maintained . However, uncertainty about the long -term balance of benefits and harms could significantly alter estimates of cost - effectiveness. High variability. If conservative treatments have failed, children, adolescents and their parents would be highly motivated to find an effective alternative intervention. Children may have a significant fear of surgery, but the profound social and emotional impact of obesity may override their concerns. Parents are likely to be more concerned about the long term health impacts of obesity than children, and may be concerned about the uncertainty about the long term benefits. Parental involvement in weight management plans is likely necessary to assist the effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet.

Change in BMI (Important outcome ) Mean weighted difference in BMI at 1 year (from baseline): -10.5 to -17.2 kg/m2 (low certainty based on mostly small observational trials) Rationale: Bariatric surgery likely results in significant reductions in BMI (low certainty) and is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (very low certainty). However, coverage is not recommended because of the limited evidence about overall long -term benefits and harms of bariatric surgery in this population as well as the high variability in values and preferences. Recommendation: Bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in children and adolescents (weak recommendation). Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B.

While there are not long term health outcomes available, there is no reason to believe that significant weight loss in the reoperation gr oup would be associated with less future health benefits . Therefore, the subcommittee makes no recommendation that the coverage criteria should be different between reoperation and primary surgery. Surgeons will also evaluate their patients and consider reasons for failure when deciding if the patient is a good candidate for reoperation. Recommendation: No recommendation that coverage criteria for re-operation should be different than for primary surgery. Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix C. 8 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Obesity, generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 in adults or above the 95th percentile of age - and sex -specific BMI growth charts in children and adolescents, is common. Information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 2014 provides estimates of obesity prevalence of 35% of adults, 17% of 2 to 19 year olds, and 8.1% of infants and toddlers (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2014) . Obesity is a risk factor for sev eral medical conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), stroke, cancer, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis and others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death and will likely overtake tobacco use as the leading cause of preventable death within the next decade. Older estimates from 2009 found that medical spending attributable to obesity is between $147 billion and $210 billion annually with at least $60 billio n of those costs accruing to Medicare and Medicaid programs (Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, 2009) . Data from the Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system in 2009 found that the overall prevalence of adult obesity in Oregon is 24%, though t he prevalence of obesity in adult s covered by the Oregon Health Plan is greater at 38%. The Oregon Healthy Teens Survey in 2009 estimated that approximately 11% of 8th graders were obese. The Oregon Department of Public Health estimated that costs of obesi ty related medical care in the Medicaid program alone exceeded $333 million in 2006 (State of Oregon, Department of Human Services, 2012) . There are a number of commonly used medical treatments for obesity including structured programs to promote improved nutrition and physical activity, intensive behavioral counseling for individuals or families, and medications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmaceutical treatments for obesity other medications and herbal supplements are also promoted for weight loss. The FDA also recently approved a weight loss device called the Maestro\u00ae Rechargable System that works by blocking signals along the vagal nerve. Bariatric surgical pro cedures (sometimes also referred to as metabolic surgery) are another treatment option for obesity. Indications Bariatric surgery (alone or in conjunction with non -surgical treatments) is indicated for the treatment of obesity. Guidelines regarding indica tions for bariatric surgery vary based on BMI thresholds and the presence of obesity -related comorbid conditions. Technology description Bariatric procedures commonly performed in the United States include adjustable gastric banding ( AGB VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials duodena l switch (BPD/DS). An excellent overview of the anatomic details of these procedures is available in the executive summary of the Washington Health Technology Assessm ent (WA HTA) report published in April 2015 (WA HTA, 2015) . The use of bariatric surgical procedures is growing , and approximately 179,000 procedures were performed in 2013 in the United States (U.S.) . The distribution of procedure types in the U.S. has sh ifted with greater use of vertical sleeve gastrectomy and declining use of gastric banding. The estimated number and distribution of surgical procedures in the U.S. is summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Estimated number and distribution of bariatric surgical procedures in the United States between 2011 and 2013. 2011 2012 2013 Total 158,000 gastric banding and VSG are procedures that either functionally or anatomically reduce the size of the stomach. Adjustable gastric banding , alone among the bariatric surgical procedures, is completely reversible. Roux -en-Y gastric bypass and BPD/DS are more complicated procedures that reduce the size of the stomach and connect more distal portions of the small intestine to the gastric remnant thus b ypassing varying lengths of small intestine and reduc ing the absorption of nutrients. F or this reason, these surgeries are sometimes referred to as malabsorptive procedures, with the degree of malabsorption correlating to the length of small intestine that is bypassed. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is sometimes performed as part of a two stage procedure for patients with extremely high BMIs (the second stage of the procedure is usually a malabsorptive procedure that is more technically feasible after the initial weight loss achieved by VSG). These procedures can be performed laparoscopically and with robotic assistance. Adjustable gastric banding is sometimes perfor med on an outpatient basis, but the other procedures generally require a hospital stay that varies from one to seven days after surgery depending on the procedure and patie nt- specific characteristic s. Recovery time s vary from one to four weeks. All procedu res require frequent follow -up, but AGB may require a greater number of follow -up visits to make adjustments to the band (done through a port located underneath the skin of the abdomen). 10 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials All of the bariatric surgical procedures entail operative and post -operative risks, though these vary by the type of procedure. Data regarding perioperative mortality, complications, need for reoperation , and serious adverse events reported in four systematic reviews are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that defini tions of complications and adverse events varied widely across studies. Operative risks include bleeding, infection, and damage to various abdominal organs. Nausea and vomiting are common after all these procedures and the malabsorptive surgeries sometimes cause persistent diarrhea. The malabsorptive procedures are associated with an increased risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and certain types of kidney stones may become more common. Gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers occurring at the surgical a nastamoses also occurs. Infections of the subcutaneous port and erosion of the gastric band into the stomach are risks unique to AGB. The overall median complication rates reported in the Washington HTA report range from 8.8% for VSG to 26.9% for BPD (WA H TA, 2015) . Table 2.

For additional details about the review scope an d methods please see Appendix A . 1. Should coverage be recommended for bariatric surgery in each of the scenarios in the table below? (Note that the \"resolution of diabetes\" would not be an applicable outcome in scenarios 4-9) BMI 30 - 34.9 BMI 35 - 39.9 BMI 40 With DM2 Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 W/o DM2 nor other comorbidities Scenario 4* Scenario 5* Scenario 6* DM2 Scenario 7* Scenario 8* Scenario 9* *Resolution of type 2 diabetes isn't a relevant outcome for this population 2. What is the appropriate minimum age for bariatric surg ery? 3. What components and systems of care are associate d with improved health outcomes (e.g. , centers of excellence, surgeon's experience, etc.) ? 4. What preoperative assessments or requirements for preoperative weight loss should be recommended in patients being considered for bariatric surgery ? Critical outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were all -cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. Important outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were weight loss (change in BMI), and remission or resolution of T2DM or hypertension. Evidence r eview General Limitations The literature on bariatric surgery is voluminous. The search conducted by Center staff yielded more than 20 systematic reviews published in the last two years (see Appendix A for a detailed methods description) . These reviews span more than 600 individual studies. It should be noted that there is little consistency in the inclusion of individual studies across reviews and that many of the systematic reviews did not perform meta -analysis, in part due to high levels of heterogeneity. Furthermore, there are important concerns about the quality of much of the published research on bariatric surgery. As the Washington HTA report summarized: While the comparative evide nce base for either head -to-head comparisons of bariatric procedures or comparisons of bariatric surgery to nonsurgical interventions has grown considerably over time, major challenges with the quality and applicability of available studies remains. Of the 179 comparative studies identified for this evaluation, we rated only 26 (15%) to be of good quality, 12 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials based on comparable groups at baseline, comparable duration of follow -up, and limited sample attrition. An additional 74 studies (41%) were rated fair qu ality; issues with comparability, duration of follow -up, and/or attrition were identified in these studies, but attempts were made to control for confounding in the analytic methods (e.g., survival analysis techniques, multivariate regression). However, we considered another 79 studies (44%) to be of poor quality because at least one key quality issue was present and not adequately addressed in e ither study design or analysis. (WA HTA, 2015, p ES -6). Additionally , there are at least nine ongoing trials of bariatric surgery that are expected to publis h results over the next four years. Systematic Reviews Addressing Effectiveness in Adults Eight good quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of ba riatric surgery in adults (Chang et al., 2014; et al. , 2015; WA HTA , 2015). These studies are summarized in Table 3 and discussed below by systematic review. Table 3 .

(2014 ) is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of 164 contemporary studies (37 randomized controlled trials [ RCTs ] and 127 observational studies) of bariatric surgery published between 2003 and 2012. The included studies spanned over 161,000 patien ts with an average age of 45 years and an average pre -surgical BMI of 45 kg/m2. Twenty six percent of the included patients had T2DM and 47% had hypertension. More than two years of follow -up was available for 133,000 of the included patients. Results of R CTs and observational studies were reported separately in the meta - analysis. The review and meta -analysis focused on surgical mortality and complications, change in BMI, and resolution of obesity -related comorbid conditions. The overall rate of mortality within 30 days of surgery was 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 % to 0.24 %) in the RCTs and 0.22% (95% CI 0.14 % to 0.31 %) in the observational studies. The overall complication rate was 17% (95% CI 11 % to 23 %) in the RCT s and 9.8% (95% CI 7.4 to 13.0) in the observational studies. 14 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials The overall mean change in BMI at 1 year was -13.53 kg/m2 in the RCTs and -11.79 kg/m2 in the observational studies. For those studies reporting outcomes at five years of follow -up, the overall mean change in BMI was -11.40 kg/m2 in the RCTs and -14.32 kg/m2 in the observational studies. In the RCTs, the T2DM remission rates in the surgical groups was 92% (95% CI 84.68 to 97.18) compared with a rate of 17.4% (95% CI 0.98 to 69.27) in the control groups. The observational studies found a T2DM remission rate of 86.5%. In the RCTs, the hypertension remission rate was 75% (95% CI 61.52 to 86.35 ) in the surgical groups compared with a rate of 49% (95% CI 0 to 99%). These comparisons are both indirect and imprecise because so few of the included studies compared surgical and non -surgical groups directly. Additionally, duration of follow -up for the studies examining comorbid conditions was unclear. Colquitt (2014) Colquitt et al . (2014) is a good qualit y systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration that includes 22 RCTs, of which 7 studies , comprising approximately 600 patients, compared bariatric surgery to non - surgical controls. Because of differences in the characteristics of participants, interven tions, and comparators, meta -analysis was considered inappropriate, and the results were reported narratively. In terms of BMI, the included studies reported mean changes of -7.4 kg/m2 to -33.3 kg/m2 with surgery to -4.7 kg/m2 in non -surgical controls. The authors conclude that \"the direction of the effect was consistently in favour of surgery\" based on moderate quality of evidence. In terms of remission of T2DM, the included studies reported rates of remission ranging from 42% to 90% at 12 to 24 months in surgical groups (73% to 90% if one study with a more stringent definition of A1c < 6 is excluded) compared to remission rates of 0% to 32% in non -surgical controls. The authors conclude that \"more people experienced remission following surgery\" based on moderate quality of evidence. Three studies included in the Cochrane review also reported on hypertension outcomes. Two studies reported rates of reduction or discontinuation of antihypertensive medications ranging from 49% to 80% between 12 and 24 months in the surgical groups compared to 0% to 70% in non -surgical controls. One additional study reported that the proportion of patients with systolic blood pressure less than 130 mmHg at 12 months was 84% in the surgical group and 7 9% in non -surgical controls. The authors did not draw any conclusions based on these data. Hayes (2014) Hayes (2014) is a good quality systematic review and health technology assessment based on 18 controlled or comparative studies of RYGB in adults with T 2DM published between2007 and 2014. Seven of the included studies (5 RCTs and 2 non -randomized controlled trials) compared RYGB with non - surgical treatments while the remaining 11 compared RYGB with other bariatric surgical procedures. The average follow -up across the included studies was 12 months to 5 years. In patients undergoing RYGB, BMI was reduced by 20 to 33% compared to baseline and T2DM remission was reported in 38 to 90% of patients. In the non -surgical treatment groups, BMI change ranged from -10% to 1%, and T2DM remission rates ranged from 0 to 33%. Based on this, Hayes concluded that RYGB 15 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials is superior to intensive lifestyle or medical interventions for the treatment of T2DM. The authors further conclude that RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy are e qually effective in the treatment of T2DM. Finally, the authors note that preliminary evidence (from a single study) suggests the RYGB may be equally effective for treatment of T2DM in patients with BMI<35 kg/m2 and BMI>35 kg/m2, but that additional studie s are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of RYGB in patients with lower BMIs. Kwok (2014) Kwok et al . (2014) is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of 14 comparative cohort studies reporting mortality and cardiovascular outcomes amongst 29,208 bariatric surgery patients and 166,200 non -surgical controls. The follow -up period of the included studies ranged from 2 years to 14.7 years. The surgical procedures in the studies included AGB, RYGB, SG, banded gastroplasty, as well as other unspecified b ariatric surgical procedures. Most of the included studies reported enrolling patients with BMI >3 5 kg/m2. Of the 14 included studies , 10 were deemed to be at low to moderate risk of bias, while four studies were deemed to be at moderate -high risk of bias due to concerns over loss to follow - up and inadequ ate adjustment for confounding. See Appendix D f or a detailed description of the included studies. In the 14 studies included in the meta -analysis of all -cause mortality, the crude event rate was 1059/29,208 (3.6%) in the surgical group and 18,962/166,200 (11.4%) in the non -surgical control group. The o dds ratio (OR) for mortality in the surgical group compared with the non -surgical group was 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64). Considering only the 10 studies that reported adjusted estimates, the association was consistent but more conservative with an odds rati o for mortality of 0.60 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.74) favoring the surgical group over the non -surgical controls. In the four studies included in the meta -analysis of composite cardiovascular adverse events, the crude event rate was 407/17,262 (2.4%) in the surgic al group and 1108/27,726 (4.0%) in the non -surgical control group. The odds ratio for composite cardiovascular adverse events in the surgical group compared with the non -surgical group was 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70). The pooled estimates for the odds ratio of myocardial infarction and stroke for surgical patient compared to non -surgical controls were 0.46 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.69) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.75) respectively. Overall, the authors conclude that long -term follow -up data from comparative cohort stu dies suggest that bariatric surgery is associated with lower rates of mortality (3.6% vs 11.4% for non -surgical controls, number needed to treat [NNT] = 13) and composite adverse cardiovascular events (2.4% vs 4.0% for non-surgical controls, NNT -Stich et al . (2014 ) is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of studies comparing surgical and medical treatment of T2DM in non -severely obese patients. The systematic review included seven RCTs and six comparative o bservational studies comprising 818 diabetic patients. All of the studies included patients with BMI <35 kg/m2 and eight of the studies were performed exclusively in patients with BMI <35 kg/m2; among the remaining seven studies the highest average BMI was 37.1 kg/m2. The surgical procedures performed in the included studies were AGB, BPD, RYGB, and SG. The follow -up periods ranged from 12 to 36 months. 16 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials In the meta -analysis of studies reporting remission of T2DM, 129 of 280 patients achieved remission in the surgical group compared with 6 of 252 patients in the medical treatment group. The combined odds ratio for T2DM resolution after surgery compared with medical treatment was 14.11 (95% CI 6.67 to 29.86). In the meta -analysis of studies reporting change in BMI, the absolute mean difference in BMI was -5.5 kg/m2 (95% CI -6.7 to -4.3) favoring the surgical group. In the meta -analysis of studies reporting presence of arterial hypertension at the end of the study, the 76 of 274 patients in the surgical group and 101/189 patients in the medical treatment group had arterial hypertension. The combined odds ratio for arterial hypertension after surgery compared with medical treatment was 0.25 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.50). The authors performed a network meta -analysis t o compare the treatment effects of the different surgical procedures. Although point estimates of the odds ratio for T2DM remission compared to medical treatment ranged from 12.23 for AGB to 55.05 for RYGB, the 95% confidence intervals overlapped for all f our included procedures, and all were superior to medical treatment. Overall, the authors conclude that among non -severely obese patients with T2DM bariatric surgery results in greater short -term improvements in diabetes remission, weight loss, and arteri al hypertension when compared with medical treatment. Puzziferri (2014) Puzziferri et al . (2014) is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of 29 studies with long -term follow -up and low rates of attrition. Specifically, only studies of gastric bypass, gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy performed in patients with a BMI of >35 and that reported outcomes with a minimum of two years of follow -up and at least 80% of the original study participants were included in the review. Only 29 studies (of ne arly 8,000 citations reviewed) met the inclusion criteria. Among the included studies were 10 RCTs, one matched cohort, six prospective cohorts, one retrospective cohort, and 11 case series. Weight loss outcomes in this review were reported as percentage o f mean excess weight loss (EWL). The sample size weighted mean EWL was 65.7% after gastric bypass, 64.5% after sleeve gastrectomy, and 45% after gastric banding. Six of the included studies reported on remission of T2DM (defined as glycated hemoglobin <6. 5% without medications). Sample size weighted T2DM remission rates were 66.7% after gastric bypass and 28.6% after gastric banding. Three of the included studies reported on remission of hypertension (defined as blood pressure <140/90 without medications). The reported hypertension remission rate was 38.2% after gastric bypass and 17.4% after gastric banding. Wang (2015) Wang et al . (2015) is a good quality , though narrowly focused , systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials compar ing laparoscopic RYGB sleeve gastrectomy in overweight or obese adults with T2DM. Three RCTs judged to be at low risk of bias and one RCT with an unclear risk of 17 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials bias were included. The average baseline BMI in the studies ranged from 30 to 46 kg/m2. Laparoscopic RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy resulted in similar improvements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, need for any diabetic medication, and BMI. Improvements in HDL and LDL cholesterol were statistically significantly greater in the RYGB group. The ab solute or relative improvements in these outcomes compared to baseline were not included. Overall, the authors conclude that RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy offer equivalent results in terms of weight loss and T2DM remission, but that RYGB affords greater impr ovements in lipid parameters and may thus significantly decrease cardiovascular risk. Washington Health Technology Assessment Report (2015) The WA HTA report (2015) is a good quality systematic review and health technology assessment summarizing results fr om 179 comparative studies (35 RCTs, 59 prospective cohorts, 85 retrospective cohorts). Notably, one large cohort study with long -term follow -up, the Swedish Obese Subjects study, was not included as a primary source for the Washington HTA report because m ost of the patients in that study received a surgical procedure (gastroplasty) that is no longer widely performed. Only 15% of the included studies were judged to be of high quality, with an additional 41% deemed fair quality. When performing meta -analysis , the authors included only good or fair quality RCTs. Overall or cause -specific mortality was not directly addressed in the WA HTA report because none of the included comparative studies reported those outcomes. However, the WA HTA report does note that evidence from at least one recent comparative cohort study found significantly lower all -cause mortality at 1 to 14 years of follow -up in surgical subjects ( hazard ratio [ HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56) (Arterburn, 2015). The comparison of bariatric surgery to non -surgical management included 21 good - or fair -quality studies (14 RCTs, 7 comparative cohorts). These studies reported on RYGB (13 studies), AGB (6 studies), VSG (4 studies) and BPD/DS (3 studies). The non -surgical comparators included diet and life style interventions and/or medical interventions (some variably defined as \"intensive\"). Meta -analytic results were available for weight loss and resolution of T2DM. The pooled mean difference in BMI was 7.4 (95% CI 6.2 to 8.6) favoring surgery, based on 1 0 studies. Resolution of T2DM had a log odds ratio of 3.62 (95% CI 2.49 to 4.73) favoring surg ery, based on nine studies. M eta-analysis of studies reporting resolution of HTN was not done, but the report noted that \"[o]ther individual comorbidities commonly evaluated in these comparative studies included hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In studies evaluating resolution of these conditions and/or discontinuation of relevant medications as a binary variable, bariatric surgery was associated with two - to three -fold reductions in the prevalence of these comorbidities [hypertension and hyperlipidemia] at the end of follow -up, while nonsurgical management resulted in no appreciable change from baseline...\" (WA HTA, 2015, p. 34) . The WA HTA report is the only systematic review staff identified that summarizes key clinical outcomes stratified by procedure and mean pre -operative BMI. Those tables are included in Appendix G. Nine good - or fair -quality RCTs and prospective cohorts comparin g bariatric surgery and non -surgical management enrolled patients with BMI<35. Seven of those studies included presen ce of T2DM or metabolic syndrome as an entry criterion, while two did not report comorbid condition -based entry criteria. The authors concl ude that for those with a mean pre -operative BMI of 30 to 35.9 \" patterns of 18 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials weight loss across procedures were similar to those in st udies of patients at higher BMI \" (WA HTA, 2015, p. ES -41). Furthermore, among studies of patients at lower BMI levels that reported on remission of T2DM at 12 to 24 months the results favored surgery (remission rates of 26% to 73%) over non -surgical treatment (remission rates of 0% to 16% ). Systematic Reviews Addressing Effectiveness in Children and Adolescents Three fair or good quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents (Aikenhead Treadwell, Sun, & Schoelles, 2011). These studies are summarized in Table 4 and discussed below by systematic review. Table 4 . Summary of Systematic Reviews - Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for Children and Adolescents Systematic Review (Quality) Total N No. and Type of Included Studies Population Outcomes of Interest Aikenhead, 2011 (Fair) N = 831 1 RCT 8 cohort studies 14 observational studies 12 case series 19 years old BMI Black, 2013 (Fair) N = 637 1 RCT 22 observational studies Pre-surgical BMI (mean): 46 - 52 5 - 23 years BMI Treadwell, 2008 (Treadwell ) N = 644 18 Observational studies Pre-surgical BMI (mean): 46 - 52 Age: 9 - BMI Abbreviations: BMI - body mass index; RC T controlled trial Aikenhead (2011) Aikenhead et al . (2011) is a fair quality narrative systematic review of 37 studies of effectiveness of bariatric surgery spanning 831 patients age 19 years old or younger. The authors note several general limitations of the pediatric bariatric surgery literature including predominately observational study designs, small sample s izes (the largest of the included trials had 68 patients), and sparse information on low frequency outcomes. Thirteen of the included studies (all but one observational) assessed gastric banding. Twelve of these studies reported mean BMI reductions of 8.5 kg/m2 to 43 kg/m2, while one study (a case report of gastric banding and truncal vagotomy in an adolescent with a rare mutation in a gene implicated in 19 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials regulation of appetite and energy balance ) found an increase in BMI of 2.2 kg/m2. Rates of resolution of com orbid conditions ranged from 11 to 100%. Eight of the included studies (all observational) assessed RYGB. The studies reported mean reductions in BMI of 9 kg/m2 to 25 kg/m2. The authors note that four of the studies reported on comorbid conditions and three of those four studies found 100% rates of resolution for dyslipidemia, degenerative joint disease, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fourteen of the included studies (all observational) reported on other bariatric procedures (sleeve gastr ectomy, BPD/D S, vertical banded gastroplasty ). These studies reported mean BMI reductions of 9 kg/m2 to 24 kg/m2. The authors note that changes in comorbid conditions were reported in 12 of the 14 studies, but additional details are not included. The autho rs' overall conclusion is that \"[i]n the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary prevention or behavioural treatment of obesity, surgical treatment may be advocated as a preferred and cost-effective solution for c ertain children and adoles cents \" (Aikenhead, 2011, p. 18) Black (2013) Black et al . (2013) is a fair quality systematic review and meta -analysis of bariatric surgery for obese children and adolescents. Twenty -three studies (22 observational and 1 RCT ) comprising 637 patients underg oing RYGB, AGB, or included. The -surgical BMI was 52.4 kg/m2 in the RYGB studies, 49.6 kg/m2 in the SG studies, and 46.1 kg/m2 in the AGB studies. The ages of patients in the included studies ranged from 5 to 23 years old. Overall, the ave rage weighted BMI difference from baseline to one year postoperatively was -13.5 kg/m2 (95% CI -15.1 to -11.9). The greatest BMI reductions were observed in patients undergoing RYGB (average weighted difference of -17.2 kg/m2) and the smallest BMI reductio ns were observed in the AGB group (average weighted difference of -10.5 kg/m2). The authors note that they were unable to provide summary estimates of the effect s on comorbidity resolution because the data were of poor quality and adequate definition s of resolution were not provided. The rates of reported resolution of T2D M from base line to follow -up ranged from 0 to 100% in the eight studies that reported this outcome . However, excluding one study with only a single T2DM patient who did not experience resolution, the rate of resoluti on for T2DM would range from 50 to 100%. The rates of reported resolution of hypertension from baseline to follo w-up ranged from 50 to 100% in the 10 studies that reported this outcome. Treadwell (2008) Treadwell et al . (2008) is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of bariatric surgery for pediatric obesity. This review included 18 studies of children ages 9 to 21 years (mean age 16.7 years) with mean BMI ranging from 45.8 kg/m2 to 51.8 kg/m2. In 14 of the 18 studies, patients must have failed a trial of non -surgical weight loss before undergoing bariatric surgery. Only one of the included studies reported a non -surgical control group and significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups we re noted including baseline BMI and comorbidities. Thus, the authors note that, in effect, the included studies were all case series. 20 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ Materials Meta -analysis of change in BMI in six studies of AGB found a 95% CI of -13.7 kg/m2 to -10.6 kg/m2 at mean length of follow -up of one to three years . Two of the studies of AGB repo rted T2DM remission rates of 80 to 100% and three of the studies reported hypertension remission rat es of 50 to 100%. Meta -analysis of change in BMI in six studies of RYGB found a 95% CI of -17.8 kg/ m2 to -22.3 kg/m2 at mean length of follow -up of one to six years. Only one of the studies of RYGB reported remission of T2DM. Three studies of RYGB reported rates of hypertension remission of 50 to 100%. Because of the small number of studies and patients undergoing other procedures, summary information on weight changes or comorbidity resolution was not presented. Overall, the authors conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence that AGB achieves weight loss at one year or longer and weak evidence of resolution of T2DM and hypertension. For RYGB, the authors conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence of weight loss at one year or longer, weak evidence of resolution of hypertension, and insufficient evidence of resolution of T2DM. There was insuf ficient evidence for any outcomes from other bariatric procedures. Systematic Reviews Addressing Bariatric Reoperation Procedures As the use of primary bariatric surgical procedures has increased, so too has the rate of bariatric reoperation. The term \"bariatric reoperation\" captures several types of procedures (conversion, correction, revision, or reversal) that are performed for va rious indications. Inadequate weight loss (commonly, but not uniformly, defined as <50% EWL) is the most common indication for revision or conversion procedures. Reoperation is also performed to address both acute complications (including anastomotic leaks , bleeding, strictures, obstruction, and perforation) and chronic complications (including protein calorie malnutrition, severe GERD, band erosion, late or recurrent leaks, late strictures, and band intolerance.) Reversal procedures are rare, but are somet imes performed to address intractable nausea and vomiting, excessive or uncontrolled weight loss, severe malnutrition, recurrent anastomotic ulcers, severe hypoglycemia, and recalcitrant hypocalcaemia . In general, bariatric reoperation is thought to be mor e technically challenging than primary bariatric surgery, at least in part because of the likelihood of surgical adhesions from the primary procedure. Nevertheless, many reoperative bariatric procedures can still be performed laparoscopically, though the complication rates may be higher when compared with primary bariatric procedures. Five fair quality and one low quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of bariatric reoperative procedures (Brethauer et al., 2014; Small, 2015; Schouten, Japink, Meesters, Nelemans, & Greve, 2 011). These systematic reviews of bariatric reoperation provide very low certainty evidence that revisional or conversion procedures performed after an initial bariatric surgery may achieve additional weight loss (particularly those procedures that convert AGB to RYGB or BPD/DS), but at the expense of a higher rate of complications. The systematic reviews offer no evidence that bariatric reoperation improved co - morbidity resolution. Most of the studies included in the systematic reviews were not methodologically 21 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials rigorous and there are concerns about publication bias in this literature. Furthermore, the indications for bariatric reoperation varied across and within individual studies. Brethauer (2014) Brethauer et al. ( 2014) is a systematic review on indications for and ou tcomes of reoperative bariatric surgery that was conducted by the ASMBS Bariatric Surgery Revision Taskforce. The review was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Covidien, a company that manufactures equipment used in bariatric surgical proc edures. While the review states that 175 articles were included in the systematic review, the majority of these were single center retrospective case series and the evidence tables in the review provide details on only 35 \"selected studies.\" Thus, the degr ee to which the narrative review and recommendations reflect an unbiased inclusion of studies identified in the systematic review is uncertain. Furthermore, the reporting of quantitative outcomes across indications and reoperative procedures was erratic. T he conclusions of the authors, summarized here with the above caveats, are 1) reoperation for inadequate or failed weight loss generally improves weight loss, and 2) complication rates are generally higher with reoperative procedures. Cheung (2014) Cheung et al . (2014) is a systematic review of studies of revisional bariatric surgery following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The review includes 11 studies spanning a total of 218 patients. In most of the studies patients underwent revisional procedures bec ause of insufficient weight loss or weight regain, although the former indication was variably defined. Intractable gastroesophageal reflux disease was an additional indication in 5 of the studies. The revisional procedures included laparoscopic butterfly gastroplasty, laparoscopic omega bypass, re gastrectomy, laparoscopic duodenal switch, and laparoscopic or open RYGB. Nine of the studies were cases series and two studies were case -controls. The largest single study enrolled 40 patients. The primary outcomes were change in BMI at var ious time points. At 24 months or greater, revisional procedures were associated with reductions in BMI. Revision of LSG to gastric bypass resulted in an average change in BMI of -6.2 kg/m2. Revision of LSG to re -sleeve gastric bypass resulted in an averag e change in BMI of - 3.2 kg/m2. Revision of LSG to other surgical interventions (all other conversion procedures) resulted in an average change in BMI of -17.2 kg/m2. In the three studies that examined the effects of revisional procedures on GERD complicati ons, there was a 100% complete resolution rate, though it should be noted that the sample size for this outcome was very small (n=15). The authors note that their review was limited by the small number of studies and patients, the very low methodological rigor of the study designs, and the absence of postoperative complication rates after revision. Coblijn (2013) Coblijn et al . (2013) is a systematic review of studies of revisional bariatric surgery (LSG or LRYGB) after an initial adjustable gastric banding procedure. The review includes 15 studies of LRYGB spanning 588 patients and 8 studies of LSG spanning 286 patients. Not all studies reported the indication for revisional surger y, but in those that did the most common indication was insufficient weight loss or weight regain (approximately 65% of patients). Most of the studies were consecutive case series and there were no randomized controlled trials. The primary outcomes of inte rest were perioperative morbidity and mortality. In the LRYGB studies that reported this outcome there were no perioperative deaths and the 22 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials overall perioperative complication rate was 8.5%. In the LSG studies that reported this outcome, there were 3 periop erative deaths and the overall perioperative complication rate was 12.2%. The rate of reoperation after the revisional procedures was 6.5% for LRYGB and 3.5% for LSG. Though weight loss was not of primary interest for this review, the authors did note that 11 of the 15 LRYGB studies reported mean EWL of 23% to 74%, though the follow -up time was not clear. Weight loss achieved with revisional LSG appeared to be nearly comparable. The authors note several limitations to their review including the very low methodological rigor of the study designs and the possibility of publication bias, particularly for studies reporting on morbidity and mortality. Elnahas (2013) Elnahas et al. ( 2013) is a systematic review of conversion bariatric procedures after failed adju stable gastric banding. The review includes 24 studies reporting outcomes of conversion to LSG (n=106 patients), LRYGB (n=514 patients), and laparoscopic BPD/DS (n=71 patients). Patients in these studies underwent the conversion procedure due to inadequate weight loss or surgical complications with AGB. All of the included studies were retrospective case series. The primary outcome of interest was weight loss measured by change in BMI or percentage EWL. The mean change in BMI at 24 to 48 months after reoper for BPD/DS. weighted mean complication rates for conversion to LSG, LRYGB, and BPD/DS were 4.1%, 10.7%, and 24.4% respectively. The authors note several limitations to their study incl uding the very low methodological rigor of the study designs and significant heterogeneity across studies. Mahaw ar (2015) Mahawar et al. ( 2015) is a systematic review of studies that compare the outcomes of revisional bariatric procedures to the outcomes o f the same primary procedures. The review includes 14 studies comparing revisional and primary RYGB and 7 studies comparing revisional and primary SG. The designs of the primary studies were not made explicit, but all appeared to be case -control or retrosp ective cohort studies. Quantitative cumulative outcomes reported in the studies comparing revisional with primary RYGB included mortality (1.3% revisional leaks (5.8% revisional vs 1.0% primary). Quantitative cumulative outcomes reported in the studies comparing revisional SG with primary SG included mortality (0% revisional vs (1.9% revisional vs 1.5% primary). Weight loss outcomes were not cumulatively analyzed because of heterogeneity in the studies, but the authors do note that most of the studies that reported on we ight loss outcomes found that the weight loss achieved with revisional procedures was either inferior to (10/14 studies of RYGB, 2/5 studies of SG) or not significantly different from the weight loss achieved with primary procedures (4/14 studies of RYGB, 3/5 studies of SG). The authors do not comment on limitations of their review other than noting the absence of any level I evidence on revisional bariatric su rgery. 23 Materials Schouten (2011) Schouten et al. ( 2011) is a systematic review of studies examining reoperat ion following gastric banding procedures. The review included 11 studies of re -banding, 12 studies of conversion to LRYGB, 5 studies of conversion to laparoscopic BPD/DS, and 5 studies of conversion to LSG. Among the 11 studies that examined re -banding, t he most common indications were slippage, erosion, or pouch dilation. Ten of the 11 studies presented level III or level IV evidence, while one presented level II evidence. The follow -up period varied from 8 to 48 months after reoperation. The early compli cation rate ranged from 0% to 11%, the late complication rate ranged from 0% to 41%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 45%. Change in BMI was reported in 6 studies and ranged from +2.4 kg/m2 to - 5.8 kg/m2. Among the 12 studies of conversion to LR YGB, the most common indications were insufficient weight loss, band, erosion, and pouch dilation. Ten of the 12 studies presented level III or level IV evidence, while the remaining 2 presented level II evidence. The follow -up period ranged from 8.3 to 36 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 3% to 36%, the late complication rate ranged from 2% to 23%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 20%. Change in BMI was reported in 9 studies and ranged from -6.1 kg/m2 to -13.2 kg/m2. Percentage EWL was reported in 2 studies and ranged from 33% to 43%. Among the 5 studies of conversion to BPD/DS, the most common indication was insufficient weight loss. All 5 studies presented level III or level IV evidence. The follow -up period range d from 12 to 38 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 8% to 62%, the late complication rate ranged from 20.6% to >23.5%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 20.6%. Percentage of EWL was reported in 3 studies and ranged fr om 44% to 70%. Among the 5 studies of conversion to LSG, the most common indication was insufficient weight loss. Four studies presented level IV evidence while 1 study presented level II evidence. The follow -up period ranged from 12 to 24 months after reo peration. The early complication rate ranged from 0% to 13.8%, the late complication rate ranged from 0% to 10.3%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 10.3%. Percentage of EWL was reported in 2 studies and ranged from 20% to 65.7% while change in BM I was reported in 1 study as -4.4 kg/m2. The authors conclude that adjustable gastric banding should remain a first line procedure with re - banding or conversion to RYGB or BPD/DS as options for managing band failure. Systematic Reviews Addressing Patient Selection One poor quality and two good quality systematic reviews address patient selection criteria (Ochner, Dambkowski, Teomans, HTA, 2015). Ochner (2 012) Ochner et al . (201 2) is a good quality narrative systematic review of 29 studies examining the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on postoperative outcomes. The authors note that heterogeneity in the included studies precluded formal qua ntitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were 24 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials mostly observations and were mixed on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on postoperative weight loss outcomes. As the authors note, \" studies of the relation between pre - and post -operative changes in body weight range from a positive relationship (preoperative weight loss associated with greater postoperative weight loss) to a negative relationship (preoperative weight loss associated with less postoperative weight loss) and ma ny in between (no relationship) \" (Ochner et al., 2012, p. 1381) . The only included RCT deemed \"viable\" by the authors randomized 100 patients undergoing RYGB to a group with a requirement of 10% preoperative weight loss or a group with no preoperative weigh loss requirement. At six months after surgery, patients in the preoperative weight loss group had lost 54% of excess body weight compared to 51% excess body weight loss in the in the group without a preoperative weight loss requirement, but because only 37% of the original sample was analyzed at six months there was insufficient power to detect an effect. The review also examined studies reporting on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on other outcomes including resolution of comorbid conditio ns. One study of 90 RYGB patients found that preoperative weight loss of >5% of excess body weight was associated with shorter operative times (36 minutes on average) but no difference in complications or resolution of comorbid conditions. Another study de monstrated that patients with preoperative weight loss of >5% of excess body weight were less likely to have a postoperative length of stay of >4 days. The RCT referenced above found no difference in the complication rate or resolution of comorbid conditio ns at six months. A fourth study found no correlation between preoperative weight changes and remission of diabetes or hypertension. The authors' overall conclusion is that \" [g]iven the inconsistency and questionable validity of the extant research...on the question of the effect of preoperative weight loss on peri - and postoperative outcomes, it is the opinion of these authors that insufficient evidence is currently available to justify a pre-bariatric surgery weight loss mandate\" ( Ochner et al., 2012, p. 1386) . Thomas (2012) Thomas & Agarwal (2012) is a poor quality systematic review of a preoperative risk stratification tool known as the obesity surgery mortality risk score (OS -MRS). The OS -MRS assigns one point each for age great er than 45 years, male gen der, BMI > 50 kg/m2, hypertension, and known risk factors for pulmonary embolism. Scores of 0 to 1 are considered class A or lowest risk, scores of 2 to 3 reflect class B or intermediate risk, and scores of 4 to 5 are class C or high risk. This review incl uded six studies reporting on 9,382 patients evaluating the validity of OS -MRS to predict postoperative mortality risk. Overall, there were 83 death in the 9,382 patients (0.88%). There were 13 deaths among the 4,912 class A patients (0.26%), 55 deaths amo ng the 4,124 class B patients (1.33%), and 14 deaths among the 346 class C patients (4.34%). The mortality difference between classes were statistically significant at p<0.05. The authors conclude that use of the OS -MRS can stratify mortality risk in patie nts undergoing bariatric surgery (particularly RYGB which was the predominately studied proce dure in the included studies). WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report included a single retrospective comparative cohort study that stratified outcomes by patient adherence to preoperative program recommendations. In the laparoscopic AGB group, patients who did not attend >75% of their pre -procedure appoint ments had attenuated weight loss at 12 months 25 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 follow -up (23% EWL vs 32% EWL in patients with fewer missed appointment, p=0.01). There were no differences in RYGB performance related to pre -procedure appointment adherence. A single study included in the WA HTA report concluded that patients with congestive heart fail ure and cardiac arrhythmias had a significantly increased risk of post -surgical complications compared with the overall cohort (40% vs 13.4% open p -values <0.001). The same study reported that patients with peripheral vascular disease undergoing RYGB had significantly increased complication rates compared to those without peripheral vascular disease (32. 0% vs 8.4%, p<0.001). The WA HTA report also notes that it did not find studies that stratified outcomes by smoking status or psychosocial health that met inclusion criteria. Systematic Reviews Addressing Systems of Care One good quality systematic revie w addresses the effect of systems of care on bariatric surgery outcomes (Zevin, Aggarwal, & Grantcharov, 2012). Zevin (2012) Zevin et al . (2012) is a good quality systematic review of volume -outcome associations in bariatric surgery. The article reviews 24 observational studies comprising almost 460,000 patients. Meta -analysis was not performed due to a high level of heterogeneity that resulted, in part, from diffe rences in duration of follow -up and risk -adjustment. Thirteen studies addressed the relationship between annual surgeon case volume and patient outcomes. Across the five cohort studies that were included, there was consistent evidence of improved outcomes with increasing surgeon volume. The results of lower quality studies (primarily retrospective cohorts) were mixed, but six of the eight studies supported an association betwee n surgeon volume and outcomes. Seventeen studies addressed the association betwee n hospital volume and outcomes. While the two case -control studies that were included did not support an association between facility volume and outcomes, the preponderance of retrospective case series (14/15 studies) that were included found an associatio n between facility volume and outcomes. The authors conclude that there is strong evidence to support the association between surgeon volume and patient outcomes, and that weaker evidence supports the association between hospital volume and outcomes. Overa ll, they conclude that the literature \"supports the BSCOE accreditation and the bariatric surge ry fellowship training programs \" (Zevin et al ., 2012, p . 70). WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report notes that pre -procedure support groups have shown little benefit, but that there is some evidence that patients in postoperative support groups experience improvements in psychological comorbidities and achieve greater weight loss. The WA HTA report cites one RCT of 144 Hispanic - American RYGB patients randomized to \"comp rehensive nutrition and lifestyle support or brief, printed healthy lifestyle guidelines...\" At one year after surgery, patients in the comprehensive support group had greater reductions in BMI (6.48 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Systematic Reviews Address ing Cost -effectiveness WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report (2015) performed a cost -effectiveness analysis based on a model constructed by the authors. This analysis assumed a public payer perspective. The base -case analysis compared RYGB with standard care over a 10 year time horizon; other base -case assumptions included a procedural cost of $24,277, 20% worsening in BMI after 12 months, mean BMI at base line of 40 kg/m2, and a discounting rate of 3%. In the base -case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness of RYGB compared to standard care was $37,423 per quality -adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the increme ntal cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from $5,444 per QALY to $84,971 per QALY. The estimates were most sensitive to changes in the time horizon, the cost of the bariatric surgical procedure, maintenance of weight loss after surgery, and baseline BMI. T he WA HTA cost -effectiveness estimates, stratified by procedure and baseline BMI, are included in Appendix H . There is very sparse evidence on the cost -effectiveness of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents. The only included systematic review whi ch addresses this question is Aikenhead et al. (2011). The conclusions of this review are limited by the small number of studies, use of economic models that are not directly applicable to the U.S., and inferences from cost -effectiveness studies of bariatr ic surgery in adults. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Despite the existence of a large number of studies and systematic reviews, there remain substantial limitations to the evidence regarding bariatric surgery. Differences in patient characteristics, choice of surgical p rocedure, and individual components and intensity of non -surgical management arms make it difficult to summarize effects across studies. Variable measures of weight loss and wide variation in definitions of remission or resolution of comorbid conditions po se additional problems. Many of the studies included in the reviews were non -comparative, and the comparative observational studies suffer from risk of bias related to patient selection and residual confounding. The data from RCTs is limited by questions r egarding proper allocation concealment and the universal absence of blinding. Perhaps the greatest concern is the limited long term follow -up of patients from RCTs and incomplete outcomes data due to high rates of attrition in most studies. Overall, the following conclusions can be drawn based on review of the summary literature: 1. Bariatric surgery is associated with lower rates of all -cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on low certainty evidence from cohort studies with long term follow -up, with study populations consisting predominantly of patients with BMI 35) . 2. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant reductions in BMI in adults, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on m oderate certainty evidence from a mix of observation al and randomized trial s). The effects on weight loss appear to be greatest in patients with baseline BM I 40 based on the BMI stratification provided in the WA HTA report. 27 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials 3. Bariatric surgery is associated with remission or resolution of T2DM and hypertension in adults with BMI 35, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and compl ications (based on m oderate certainty evidence from a mix of observational and randomized trials ). The effects on remission of T2DM appear to be greatest in patients with baseline BMI 40 based on the BMI stratification provided in the WA HTA report. Preliminary evidence suggests that adults with BMI < 35 may also achieve significant reductions in BMI and improvement in comorbid T2DM and hypertension , though the long term effects are not yet clear . 4. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant reduct ions in BMI in children and adolescents, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications ( based on low certainty evidence primarily from small, non -comparative observational trials of bariatric surgery for pediatric obesity ). 5. Bariatric surgery is associated with remission or resolution of T2DM and hypertension in children or adolescents, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on v ery low certainty evidence from a small num ber of trials ). 6. There is no evidence -based minimum age recommendation for pediatric bariatric surgery. Patients as young as five years old were included in the studies reported in the summary literature. 7. There is low certainty conflicting evidence on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements. 8. The obesity surgery mortality risk score (OR -MRS) is a validated preoperative assessment of perioperative mortality risk (particularly for RYGB procedures) and may be useful in selecting patients for surgery or counseling them on surgical risks. 9. Harms of bariatric surgery include a perioperative mortality rate that probably ranges from 0.10 to 2%, and an overall complication rate tha t is probably on the order of 8 to 25%. The estimated reope ration rate is likely between 2 and 13%. There is limited evide nce from a single study that comorbid congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and peripheral vascular disease are associated with higher rates of complications after bariatric surgery. 10. There is low certainty evidence that surgeon experience is a ssociated with improved outcomes and very low certainty evidence that hospital bariatric surgical volume is associated with improved outcomes. 11. There is very low certainty evidence that revisional or conversion procedures performed after an initial bari atric surgery may achieve additional weight loss (particularly those procedures that convert AGB to RYGB or BPD/DS), but at the expense of a higher rate of complications. Systematic reviews offer no evidence that bariatric reoperation improved co - morbidity resolution. 28 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource allocation Bariatric surgery for adults is costly, but improved outcomes compared with non -surgical management may offset these costs. The WA HTA report cites total costs of bariatric surgical procedures as ran ging from $17,483 for gastric banding to $36,160 for biliopancreatic diversion. By comparison, standard non - surgical care has a reported total cost of $3,746. Accounting for reductions in BMI, resolution of comorbid conditions, and complications of surgery and projecting costs and effectiveness over a 10 -year horizon, bariatric surgical procedures are uniformly cost -effective at a willingness -to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. This was true across BMI thresholds and surgical procedures. Excerpts from the economic analysis in the WA HTA report are provided in Appendix H. Bariatric surgery for children is also costly, but improved outcomes may offset these costs, and the beneficial effects could accrue over the longer time horizon afforded by earlie r intervention in children and adolescents. However, there is very limited evidence of cost -effectiveness of pediatric bariatric surgery. The pediatric cost -effectiveness information included in the review by Aikenhead et al . in 2011 used assumptions from Australia that are likely too indirect to influence deliberations on resource allocation. Reoperations for additional weight loss are sometimes requested; a second high cost procedure (tens of thousands of dollars), with a history of prior failure i s unlikely to show a favor able cost -effectiveness ratio. Values and preferences Adults Most people would prefer to avoid surgery and its attendant risks if similar results could be attained through safer and less invasive interventions. However, patients who have failed to achieve adequate weight loss with less invasive interventions may decide that the superior outcomes of bariatric surgery (including long term improvements in all -cause mortality , complete remission of diabetes, and significant weight loss ) outweigh the upfront risks of surgery. Overall, there would be a moderate variability giv en these considerations. Children and adolescents Similar to adults, most children and their parents would prefer to avoid surgery and its attendant risks if similar results could be attained through safer and less invasive interventions. However, patients who may have failed to achieve adequate weight loss with less invasive interventions may decide that bariatric surgery offer s the best chance at weight reduction. The significant social pressures of obesity at a young age may also push children and their parents to have strong interest in an effective treatment . Children though would likely have a great fear of surgery and the associated procedures and loss of social/academic participation. However, a dditional uncertainties related to malnutrition in this age group and its effects on growth, development, and reproductive capacity may make surgery less appealing in children and adolescents (to their caregivers) . Long term r emission rates of morbid obesity 29 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials and recurrence of the comorbidities are unknown ; most studies report outcomes at one year, although a few studies report outcomes at up to three years. Given these considerations, there would be high variability in chi ldren's and parents preferences . Re-operations for inadequate weight loss There would be hi gh variability in patient pref erences regarding reoperation. With a prior failure of the procedure, some patients would be hesitant to try an additional procedure given the burdens of surgery and prior ineffectiveness, but others would be motivated to try a different procedure in hopes that it would work. Patients seeking reoperation likely have no other good option given failure of multiple previous alternatives (e.g. clinical, pharmacological, nutritional, physical activity, surgical) . Other factors Adult s The greatest health benefit s may be with BMI 40 but otherwise specific subpopulations which would benefit the most from bariatric surgery are not well characterized. The pre -operative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the r ate of complications and need for reoperation reported in the summary literature, benefit plans may wish to consider alternative payment methodologies like bundled payments or a pay -for- outcomes approach. Surgeon case volume, and to a lesser extent hospita l case volume, appear to affect outcomes for patients unde rgoing bariatric surgery and requirements regarding surgeon or facility volume may be reasonable. Children and adolescents Parental involvement in weight management plans is likely necessary to assist the effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet. Re-operations for inadequate weight loss It is unclear from the evidence which modifiable patient factors that resulted in surgical failure would predict a high lik elihood of success or failure of a second procedure. 30 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT for 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials POLICY LANDSCAPE SOURCES Quality measures One bariatric surgery -specific quality measure was identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse : Prevention and management of obesity for adults: percentage of patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 40 who have been provided with a referral to a bariatric specialist (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement) Payer cover age policies Medicare (National Coverage Determination [NCD] 100.1 ), Washington Medicaid , Aetna , Blue Cross Blue Shield , and Moda all provide coverage of bariatric surgery. E ach coverage policy outlines specific coverage criteria that must be met prior to bariatric surgery being approved. These criteria are described below and provided in more detail in Appendix E. Age All six payers provide coverage of bariatric surgery for a dults (defined as at least 18 years), and Aetna and Cigna additionally provides coverage for adolescents (defined as an individual with completed skeletal growth). Washington limits the procedure type to LAGB only for individuals aged 18 to 20 years. Body Mass Index For adults, Aetna, Cigna and Moda require individuals have a BMI of greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 with specific comorbidities. Washington and NCD 100.1 cover individuals with a BMI of greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, and Regence BCBS requires that an individual have a BMI of greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 or a BMI of greater th an, or equal to 35 kg/m2 with type 2 diabetes or at least two other specified comorbidities. Washington is the only identified payer that explicitly requires individuals not be pregnant at the time of the surgery. For adolescents, Aetna covers individuals with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 who have serious comorbidities, or individuals with a BMI of greater than 50 kg/m2 with less serious comorbidities. Cigna uses the same BMI criteria as the adult population. Comorbidities Diabetes is the only comorbidi ty specified by all five payers. Payers specify various combinations of other comorbid conditions including coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, lower extremity lymphatic or venous obstruction, mechanical arthopathy in major weight bearing j oint, rare comorbid conditions (e.g., pseudo tumor cerebri), and obstructive sleep apnea. Aetna specifies several less severe comorbidities for adolescents with a BMI of over 50 including gastroesphageal reflux disease, -related stress urinary incontinence. 31 Bariatric 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Pre-Surgical Requirements Five p ayers require individuals to under go a comprehensive psychosocial evaluation an d participate in a formal weight loss program prior to being approved for bariatric surgery (Aetna, Cigna, Moda, Regence BCBS, and Washington ). Three payers require a separate medical evaluation (Washington, Cigna, Moda), surgical evaluation (Washington, C igna), and nutritional evaluation (Cigna, Moda) prior to surgery. The NCD 100.1 requires that individuals have been previously unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. Payers require an individual attend a formal weight loss program within six mont hs (Washington) to two years of surgery (Aetna, Regence BCBS, Moda). The weight loss program must be greater than or equal to three (Cigna) to six months in duration (Washington, Aetna, Regence BCBS, Moda). Both Washington and Moda require that individuals lose 5% of their initial body weight as part of the weight loss program prior to surgery. Aetna's policy states that there can be no net weight gain during weight loss program attendance. Payer coverage policies include a variety of additional required pr ogram components including counseling by a registered dietitian, patient journal of participation, regular face -to-face provider visits, behavior modification, supervised exercise regimen , and hypocal oric diet changes. Provider Requirements Washington Medicaid and Moda state that bariatric surgery is only covered if provided by an approved facility, defined by Moda as a Center of Excellence and by Washington with specific criteria. Bariatric surgery facilities approved by Washington Medicaid must have performed a minimum of 100 bariatric surgical procedures, be under the direction of an experienced board -certified surgeon, been in operation for at least five years, have a 2% or less mortality rate, have a 15% or less morbidity rate, have at le ast five years of patient follow -up data, have an average of at least 50% patient weight loss at five years, and have a reoperation/revision rate of 5% or less. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare have approved six facilities in Oregon to perform bariatric surgery: Bay Area Hospital, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Sacred Heart Me dical Center, Salem Hospital, St. Charles Medical Center - Bend. Repeat Surgery Coverage Aetna, Cigna and Regence BCBS address repeat bariatric surgery and outline specific circumstances under which it is covered. All three payers provide coverage to corr ect complication from the initial surgery, and conversion from gastric banding to sleeve gastrectomy, RYGB or BPD/DS. Aetna and Cigna specify that conversion surgery is covered for individuals who have not lost more than 50% of their body weight two years following the primary bariatric surgery. Cigna will cover the adjustment of the silicone gastric band and repeat surgery for a failed dilation of a gastric pouch. Aetna will additionally cover removal of a gastric band, replacement of adjustable band, and repeat surgery for a failed dilation of a gastric pouch. Non -Covered Procedures Aetna, Cigna, and Regence BCBS outline specific conditions and procedures that are not in the coverage of bariatric surgery. Across all three payers, gastroplasty (\"stomach st apling\"), laparoscopic gastric 10/ 6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials TOGA\u00ae), are not covered. In addition, Aetna and Cigna do not cover gastrointestinal liners (e.g., EndoBarrier), intrag astric balloon, loop gastric bypass, silastic ring vertical gastric bypass (e.g., Fobi pouch), or vagus nerve blocking. Aetna and Regence BCBS do not cover band over bypass surgeries, band or sleeve gastrectomy surgeries, sclerotherapy for the treatment of dilated gastrojejunostomy following bariatric surgery, or for gastroesophageal reflux disease in non -obese individuals. Cigna and Regence BCBS do not cover intestinal bypass (jejunoileal bypass) or restorative obesity surgery (e.g., ROSE). Regence BCBS sp ecifically does not cover vertical banded gastroplasty; Aetna covers this procedure for members who are at increased risk of adverse consequences from Roux -en-Y gastric bypass due to certain gastrointestinal conditions (see Appendix E). The NCD 100.1 does not provide coverage for open adjustable gastric banding, open sleeve gastrectomy, open and laparoscop ic vertical banded gastroplasty, intestinal bypass surgery, and g astric balloon for treatment of obesity. Professional society guidelines Adults The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) (Fitch et al., 2013a) (good quality) , Veterans Administration (VA) ( Management of Overweight and Obesity Working Group , 2014) (good quality) , the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, Obesi ty Society, American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (Mechanic k et al., 2013) (poor quality primarily) , the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (NHMRC, 2013) (good quality) , and the National Institute for Health and Ca re Excellence (NICE) (NICE, 2014) (good quality) provide recommendations on the use of bariatric surgery in adults. The guideline from the American Heart Association /American College of Cardiology /The Obesity Society (Jensen et al., 2014) (good quality) provides a summary of the evidence related to the long -term effectiveness of bariatric surgeries and the long -term effects of these procedures on varying BMI levels with and without comorbidities. The guideline does not provide clinical practice recommendati ons. All identified guidelines consistently recommend bariatric surgery for individuals with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2, or greater than 35 kg/m2with significant comorbidities. There is some variance between guidelines in what comorbidities are considered significant. For example, only two of the five guidelines list gastroesophageal reflux disease as a significant comorbidity. Four guidelines (AAC D/OS/ASMBS, ICSI, NHMRC, NICE) recommend bariatric surgery be considered for individuals with a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m2who have severe comorbidities such as diabetes, and NICE recommends bariatric surgery for individuals of Asian de scent with recent -onset diabetes who may have a lower BMI than other populations. The VA determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the use of bariatric surgery for individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The AACD/OS/ASMBS and NICE guidelines recommend individuals have pre -surgical comprehensive medical and psychological evaluations. The use of multidisciplinary teams consisting of surgical, medical, nutrition, and psychological expertise is recommended by NICE and NHMRC. 33 Metabolic and Bariatric Surger y DRAFT Materials The ICSI (Fitch 2013b) (good quality) , the Australian NHMRC (NHMRC, 2013), and NICE (NICE, 2014) provide recommendations on indications for bariatric surgery in the pediatric population. Both the ICSI and NHMRC guidelines recommend bariatric surgery as an option for adol escents with a BMI greater than 40, or greater than 35 with severe comorbidities. The NHMRC specifies that only laparoscopic gastric banding performed by a specialist bariatric/pediatric surgical team is recommended for adol escents. The guideline from ICSI is the most comprehensive and recommends detailed pre - surgical evaluations, failed attempts at weight loss through formal weight loss programs, and the use of multidisciplinary team at regional bariatric centers of excellence. ICSI further recommends that children have attained Tanner stage 4 or 5 or have bone age of 13 years in girls or 15 years in boys before considering bariatric surgery. Pediatric bariatric surgery is not recommended by NICE except in the case of exceptional circumstances. Assessment of congruence between guidelines and evidence In general, the clinical practice guideline recommendations for adults are supported by the available evidence. Patients with BMI 40 kg/m2 or with BMI 35 to 39.9 with obesity -related comorbid conditions have been well studied in the literature, and the clinical practice guidelines reflect this stronger evidence base. The divergence in the recommendations for patients with BMI 30 to 34.9 probably reflects the smaller number of studies that specifically address this population and the shorter follow -up periods reported in these studies. Recommendations regarding pre -surgical evaluations may reflect expert practice tips, but are not directly supported by the summary literature. Similarly, recommendations regarding preoperative weight loss are based on expert opinion and are not directly supported by the summary literature. The wider variation in the recommendations for bariatric surgery in children reflects greater uncertainty about both the effectiveness and the adverse effects of surgery. When surgery is recommended for children, there is general agreement based on expert opinion that this should be performed at regional centers of excellence .

MORTALITY BENEFIT OUTCOMES FROM KWOK (2014) SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS Several large cohort studies with long -term follow -up comparing bariatric surgery patients to non - surgical controls have demonstrated a consistent reduction in all -cause mortality (as summarized in the meta -analys is in Kwok 2014). In the included cohort studies that performed direct subgroup analysis by BMI, the effects of bariatric surgery appear to be stronger in patients with higher BMI, though other cohorts that report proportional hazard ratios using BMI of 35 -40 kg/m2 as the reference find increasing mortality in BMI groups >40. Only two of the cohorts reported outcomes by baseline comorbidities. In the Swedish Obese Subjects study (Sjostorm, 2012), patients with T2DM may have benefited more than those without T2DM, while patients with SBP <140 may have benefited more than hypertensive patients; however, in both scenarios the 95% confidence intervals overlap. It should be noted that Sjostrom reported on the incidence of cardiovascular events rather than mortali ty and that 70% of the patients received vertical banded gastroplasty, a procedure that is no longer used in the United States. Scott (2013) reports on a cohort of bariatric patients compared to matched controls undergoing either orthopedic or gastrointest inal procedures. There were no significant differences based on the presence of HTN in either group or T2DM in the bariatric -orthopedic comparison; among T2DM patients in the bariatric -GI comparison, there was a slight increase in the proportional hazard o f mortality. Two other cohort studies (Arterburn, 2013 and Johnson, 2013) only included patients with T2DM at baseline. Caution should be exercised in interpreting subgroup analyses from these cohorts given the potentially small number of patients involved . Individual studies with pre -specified inclusion criteria based on comorbidities are more likely to provide accurate estimates of the effects in these groups. On balance, there is insufficient evidence from these cohort studies to conclude that the effect s of bariatric surgery on long -term mortality vary based on pre-operative BMI or the presence of comorbid conditions.

The Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee (H TAS) has performed a detailed assessment of the evidence and developed a Coverage Guidance on bariatric surgery for obesity. The Obesity Task Force met on 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 to discuss clinical interventions for obesity including bariatric/metabolic surgery. They reviewed the draft HTAS Coverage Guidance recommendations and made recommendations to VbBS on changes to the Prioritize d List of Health Services. Current Prioritized List Status: Line: 30 Condition: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (See Coding Specification Below) (See Guideline Notes 8,62,64,65) Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY, gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy) are only included on this line as treatment acco rding to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of E11 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a secondary diagnosis of E66.01, E66.09, E66.2, E66.8 or E66.9 (Obesity); AND, 3) e of Z68.35 -Z68.39 or Z68.4. Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE (See Guideline Notes 8,64,65) NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFI CANT COMORBID ITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 GUIDELINE NOTE 8, BARIATRIC SURGERY Lines 30, 589 Bariatric surgery is included under the following criteria: A) Age 18 B) The patient has 1) a BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes for inclusion on Line 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS; OR 2) BMI >=35 with at least one significant co -morbidity other than type II diabetes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypert ension) or BMI >= 40 without a significant co -morbidity for inclusion on Line 589 C) No prior history of Roux -en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, unless they resulted in failure due to complications of the original surgery. D) Partici pate in the following four evaluations and meet criteria as described. 1) Psychosocial evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed mental health professional) a) Evaluation to assess potential compliance with post -operative requirements. b) Must remain free of abuse of or dependence on alcohol during the six -month period immediately preceding surgery. No current use of nicotine or illicit drugs and must remain abstinent from their use during the six -month observation period. Testing will, at a minimum, be conducted within one month of the surgery to confirm abstinence from nicotine and illicit drugs. c) No mental or behavioral disorder that may interfere with postoperative outcomes1. d) Patient with previous psychiatric illness must be stable for at least 6 months. 2) Medical evalua tion: (Conducted by OHP primary care provider) a) Pre-operative physical condition and mortality risk assessed with patient found to be an appropriate candidate. b) Optimize medical control of diabetes, hypertension, or other co -morbid conditions. c) Female patien t not currently pregnant with no plans for pregnancy for at least 2 years post -surgery. Contraception methods reviewed with patient agreement to use effective contraception through 2nd year post -surgery. 3) Surgical evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed bariat ric surgeon associated with program2) a) Patient found to be an appropriate candidate for surgery at initial evaluation and throughout period leading to surgery while continuously enrolled on OHP. b) Received counseling by a credentialed expert on the team regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure3 and understands the many potential complications of the surgery (including death) and the realistic expectations of post -surgical outcomes. 4) Dietician evaluation: (Conducted by licensed dietician) a) Evaluatio n of adequacy of prior dietary efforts to lose weight. If no or inadequate prior dietary effort to lose weight, must undergo six -month medically supervised weight reduction program. b) Counseling in dietary lifestyle changes Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 3 E) Participate in additional evaluati ons: 1) Post -surgical attention to lifestyle, an exercise program and dietary changes and understands the need for post -surgical follow -up with all applicable professionals (e.g. nutritionist, psychologist/psychiatrist, exercise physiologist or physical ther apist, support group participation, regularly scheduled physician follow -up visits). 1 Many patients (>50%) have depression as a co -morbid diagnosis that, if treated, would not preclude their participation in the bariatric surgery program. 2 All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Qu ality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensi ve, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified b ariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation o f surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as w heel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). 3 Only Roux -en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastri c banding and sleeve gastrectomy are approved for inclusion. Evidence summary (GRADE table from HTAS Coverage Guidance) : Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in adults? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations All-cause mortality (Critical outcome) Odds ratio: 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64) Crude event rates 3.6% with surgery and 11.4% without surgery Number needed to treat = 13 Bariatric surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars per surgery, but has been shown to be cost effective across BMI thresholds and surgery types. Patients would balance surgery and its risks with risks of living with morbid obesity. Many patients who have failed conservative attempts at weight loss may elect The greatest benefit may be with BMI 40 but otherwise specific subpopulations which would benefit the most from bar iatric surgery are not well characterized. (low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 4 Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in adults? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Major adverse cardiovascular events (Critical outcome ) Odds ratio: 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) Crude event rates 2.4% with surgery and 4.0% without surgery Number needed to treat = 62 surgery. The benefits of decreased mortality, dramatic weight loss, and regression of diabetes are important outcomes that patients and society would strongly value. However, there would still be moderate variability because of the risks and costs associated with surgery, as well as the intensive peri - and post -operative follow up. The pre -operative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the rate of complications and need for reoperation reported in the summary literature, benefit plans may wish to consider alternativ e payment methodologies like bundled payments or a pay -for-outcomes approach. Surgeon case volume, and to a lesser extent hospital case volume, appear to affect outcomes for patients undergoing bariatric surgery and requirements regarding surgeon or facili ty volume may be reasonable. ( low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) Type 2 DM remission/resolution (Important outcome ) Odds ratio: 3.6 to 52.4 (favoring surgery) Number needed to treat: 1 to 5 (moderate certainty based on a mix of RCTs and observational studies with consistent but imprecise effects) Hypertension remission/ resolution (Important outcome ) Odds ratio: 2.99 to 3.12 (favoring surgery) Number needed to treat: 4 (moderate certainty based on a mix of RCTs and observational studies with consistent but imprecise effects) Change in BMI (Important outcome ) Mean difference at 1 year: -5.5 to - 33.35 kg/m2 (favoring surgery) Pooled mean difference: -7.4 kg/m2 (favoring surgery) (moderate certainty based on a mix of RCTs and observational studies with consistent but imprecise effects) Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 5 Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in adults? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Rationale: Bariatric surgery appears to lower all -cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in obese adults (low certainty), and significantly reduces BMI, and results in resolution of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The greatest benefit appears to be with BMI 40. Though bariatric surgery is costly and carries significant perioperative risks, the clear long -term positive health benefits leads to a recommendation for coverage. The strength of the recommendation is based on the fact that there is a strong benefit on critical outcomes (particularly in diabetics), and patients desiring surgery would strongly prefer this intervention. For those without diabetes, and other comorbidities are present, the evidence is less clear, leadi ng to a weak recomme ndation. bariatric surgery -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy) is for: Adult obese patients (BMI 35 and <40) with: o Type 2 diabetes (strong recommendation) OR o at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea (weak recommendation) Adult obese patients (BMI 40) (strong recommendation) Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation). Metab olic and bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in: Patients with BMI <35, or 35 -40 without the defined comorbid conditions above (weak recommendation) Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B.

Major adverse cardiovascular events (Critical outcome ) Insufficient evidence in this population time horizon if weight loss is maintained. However, uncertainty about the long - term balance of benefits and harms could significantly alter estimates of cost -effectiveness. parents would be highly motivated to find an effective alternative intervention. Children may have a significant fear of surgery, but the profound social and emotional impact of obesity may override their concerns. Parents are likely to be more concerned about the long term health impacts of obesity than children, and may be concerned about the uncertainty about the long term benefits. effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet. Insufficient evidence Type 2 DM remission/resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of T2DM ranged from 50 to 100% (very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects ) Hypertension remission/ resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of hypertension ranged from 50 to 100% ( very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects) Change in BMI (Important outcome ) Mean weighted difference in BMI at 1 year (from baseline): -10.5 to -17.2 kg/m2 (low certainty based on mostly small observational trials) Rationale: Bariatric surgery likely results in significant reductions in BMI (low certainty) and is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (very low certainty). However, coverage is not recommended because of the limited evidence about overal l long -term benefits and harms of bariatric surgery in this population as well as the high variability in values and preferences. Recommendation: Bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in children and adolescents (weak recommendation). Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B. A GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix C. Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 7 Coverage question: Should reoperative bariatric surgery for inadequate weight loss be recommended for coverage? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Confidence in Estimate of Effect Critical outcomes All-cause mortality Insufficient evidence in this population A second high cost procedure (tens of thousands of dollars), with a history of prior failure may be more costly in total and less effective, however, the cost - effectiveness in this group is unknown. There would be high variability in patient preferences . With a prior failure of a bariatric procedure, some patients would be hesitant to try an additional procedure given the burdens of surgery and prior ineffectiveness. Others would be motivated to try a different procedure in hopes that it would work better. Patients seeking reoperation have likely no other good potential option given failure of multiple previous alternatives (e.g. clinical, pharmacological, nutritional, physical activity, and surgical). There is evidence of greater complications rates with reoperation. There is insufficient evidence in the reoperation group to know if their outcomes would be substantially different that those undergoing their first operation. A significant proportion of these patients would be going from a band to a RYGB (from a procedure with a higher failure rate to a lower failure rate). Insufficient evidence Major adverse cardiovascular events Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Important outcomes Type 2 DM remission / resolution Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Hypertension remission/ resolution Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Change in BMI Mean change in BMI (from baseline): +2.4 kg/m2 to -17.2 kg/m2 (follow -up ranging from 8 to 48 months) (very low certainty based on small case series) Rationale: Reoperation is associated with higher complication rates but also effective weight loss (based on very low quality evidence). While there are not long term health outcomes available, there is no reason to believe that significant weight loss in the reop eration group would be associated with less future health benefits. Therefore, the subcommittee makes no recommendation that the coverage criteria should be different between reoperat ion and primary surgery. Surgeons will also evaluate their patients and c onsider reasons for failure when deciding if the patient is a good candidate for reoperation. Recommendation: No recommendation that coverage criteria for re -operation should be different than for primary surgery. Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix CBariatric/metabolic surgery for obesity 8 HTAS Coverage Recommendations Coverage of metabolic and bariatric surgery (including Roux -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy) is recommended for: Adult obese patients (BMI 35) with o Type 2 diabetes (strong recommendat ion) OR o at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea (weak recommendation) Adult obese patients (BMI 40) (strong recomm endation) Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation). Metabolic a nd bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in: Patients with BMI <35, or 35 -40 without the defined comorbid conditions above (weak recommendation) Children and adolescents (weak recommendation) HERC Staff Assessment: Currently, bariatric surgery only pairs in the funded region of the Prioritized List with diabetes. The Coverage Guidance suggests that coverage should be expanded to those with diabetes or other comorbidities. Therefore, changing the primary indication for bariatric surgery on the List to be for obesity rather than diabetes makes sense and consolidating the bariatric surgery codes to the Obesity line is indicated . Having bariatric surgery codes on the lower obesity line (589) is confusing because of the comorbidity rule, when ther e are clearly defined comorbidities in the new proposed guideline note language. Because the weight loss is less, consider not covering gastric banding as a preferred surgical treatment. Obesity Task Force Phase 1 Recommendations (reflecting 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 task force discussions) : 1) Add bariatric surgery to Line 325 a. Change the Treatment title b. Add bariatric surgery codes (see Code Movement Table) 2) Remove bariatric surgery from Line 30, Type 2 Diabetes a. Change title of the Treatment to not include bari atric surgery b. Remove bariatric surgery codes from line 30 (see Code Movement Table) c. Remove coding specification about bariatric surgery d. Remove reference to Guideline Note 8 3) Remove bariatric surgery from Line 589 a. Change the Treatment title Bariatric/metabolic surgery for obesity 9 b. Remove bariatric surgery codes from Line 589 (see Code Movement Table) 4) Revise Guideline Note 8 a. Expand to BMI >40 without comorbidities, and 35 with specific comorbidities b. Continue to not cover surgery for children and adolescents c. Allow reoperations d. Discuss whether gastric banding should be covered only when there are contraindications or also in women of reproductive age with intent to conceive e. Add freedom from marijuana dependence/abuse to the 6 month contraindications f. Change language around the certification/accr editation requirements from the MBSAQIP g. Make other minor guideline changes Line: 30 Condition: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (See Coding Specification Below) (See Guideline Notes 8,62,64,65) Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy) are only included on this line a s treatment according to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of E11 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a secondary diagnosis of E66.01, E66.09, E66.9 or OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5 ,8, 64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING is recommended for deletion under a separate issue) Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 Notes 8,64,65) Treatment: NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PH YSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS ; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 Bariatric /metabolic surgery (limited to Roux -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding1, and sleeve gastrectomy) is included on Line 325 under when the following criteria are met : A) Age 18 Bariatric/metabolic surgery for obesity 10 B) The patient has obesity with a: 1) a BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes for inclusion on Line 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS; OR 2) BMI >=35 with at least one significant co -morbidity other than type II diabetes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) o r BMI >= 40 without a significant co -morbidity for inclusion on Line 589 1) BMI 40 OR 2) BMI 35 with: a) Type 2 diabetes, OR b) at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea B) No prior history of Roux -en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, or repeat gastric banding or unless they resulted in failure due to complications of the original surgery.

HERC Coverage Guidance - Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy February 2016 Page 1 Table of Contents Commenters ................................ Chapter of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery [Submitted January 18, 2016 ] Public Comments ID/# Comment Disposition A1 \"[W] e would like to applaud the efforts to update the current policy on metabolic and bariatric surgery. We agreed with standardizing the indications for surgery to come in line with current clinical practic e throughout the United States. We agree the information in the areas of adolescent surgery and surgical treatment of BMI less than 35 is incomp lete and rapidly evolving. We believe these two areas should be reassessed in two years. \" Thank you for your comment. The Oregon HERC assesses any new evidence every two years to determine if a new coverage guidance is needed. Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 1 Question: Should the guideline note on bariatric surgery continue to require accreditation through the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP)? Relevant history Prioritized List When bariatric surgery was first covered on the Prioritized List, there was a strong interest i n ensuring quality outcomes. The current guideline note required that the hospitals either be certified by MBSAQIP or in pursuit of certification. It also requires bariatric surgery prog rams to provide yearly data to DMAP. The required regular reporti ng of outcomes to DMAP never occurred. Here is the current Guideline Note 8 Bariatric Surgery excerpt: All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospit al to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in o utpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certificat ion, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive ri sk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). HTAS Coverage Guidance HTAS developed a Coverage Guidance on bariatric surgery. They asked a Key Question: What components and systems of care are associated with improved health outcomes (e.g., centers of excellence, surgeon's experience, etc.)? The Cove rage Guidance includes one systematic review on systems of care (Zevin, 2012) evaluating surgeon and hospital volume. The Coverage Gui dance concludes that \"t here is low certainty evidence that surgeon experience is associated with improved outcomes and very low certainty evidence that hospital bariatric surgical volume is associated with improved outcomes.\" The Washington HTA found limit ed evidence of post -operative support groups. Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 2 The draft Coverage Guidance box language about accreditation is as follows: Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation). Obesity Task Force Ph ase I The obesity task force used the HTAS Draft Coverage Guidance as the basis for developing recommended changes to the Prioritized List. They became aware through expert testimony that there were two types of accreditation (comprehensive center or low acuity center) and thus recommended language limiting surgery to one of these two centers. It was understood at that time that this would include all of the bariatric surgery centers in the state. They suggested editing that section as follows: All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) . , or in active pur suit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). Interim update - Kaiser HERC staff became aware that Kaiser does bariatric surgery through a query raised through HealthShare, Helen Bellanca and Joyce Caramella. From Joyce Caramella , RN, Quality Improvement Coordinator, HealthShare This proposed wording further restricts where OHP members can have this surgery. Currently there are 9 centers in Oregon that qualify, two in Portland that are comprehensive centers (OHSU and Legacy Good Samaritan and one that is a low acuity center. Last case I had regarding this surgery, the member was on a 3 year wait list for his approved surgery at OHSU. Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 3 We had hoped that Kaiser might be considered for approval, they now can do these surgeries on their members and Medicare members, but not OHP member s. This is a lifesaving procedure for these members, and it feel cruel to deny them an approved service for such a long timeframe. From Helen Bellanca, MD, MPH, HealthShare Kaiser is not seeking MBSAQIP certification for several reasons: 1. Having that cer tification would obligate them to be open to anyone in the community seeking the surgery. Because Kaiser is a closed system, they didn't feel they could meet that obligation 2. Standards in bariatric surgery have shifted. It used to be thought that high - volume centers provided the best care, and so these certifications are based on volume. However, that standard was only true when the surgery was new and there weren't that many people doing it. Now that there is way more experience in the field, quality ca n be determined by outcomes (data on complication rates) rather than volume, which is what Kaiser does. 3. It is prohibitively expensive to be certified. Not only are there direct costs to the certification itself, but there are indirect costs to use their s pecific data system, hire more nurses, require the surgeons to alter their call schedule, etc. It was the feeling at Kaiser that the only people who push for certification are the institutions who are already certified, but that their quality data is actu ally not as good as Kaiser's. Kaiser has no internal incentive to seek this certification and they don't feel it reflects the quality of the care they provide. In terms of solutions, they offered this one: They told me that a recent standard for Medicare/ Medicaid elsewhere was for patients to be notified that they have a right to receive the surgery at an MBSAQIP -certified center, that Kaiser was not such a center, but that they could waive this right and have the surgery at Kaiser if they chose. They rec ommend including that language in the HERC guidance. Something like: Patients must be notified of their right to have all surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). Patients may waive this right if they choose, but must sign a consent form indicating that they understand that they are waiving that right in order to get the care at the institution of their choice. Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 4 From Dr. Bruce Wolfe, MD ( HERC appointed expert on the Bariatric Surgery Coverage Guidance The systematic review by Drs. Azagury and Morton identifie d 13 papers that met inclusion criteria. 10 of the 13 found accreditation improved outcomes while 3 did not. The author of one of these and co -author of another, John Birkmeyer, requested a review of the accreditation requirements by CMS, a request that wa s granted as you know. Given the lack of unanimity of the reported analyses and the withdrawal of the accreditation required by CMS, Oregon would be justified in not requiring MBSAQIP accreditation for participation in the care of bariatric surgery patient s covered by Medicaid. The question at the committee meeting addressed by Dr. Halpin and myself was how can administrators of Oregon Medicaid be assured that each provider of bariatric surgical services is performing at an acceptable level? Our answer to t hat question is MBSAQIP accreditation. The key to the accreditation is the accumulation of outcomes among all patients undergoing bariatric surgery at the center and with reporting of the risk -adjusted outcomes in relation to the total MBSAQIP database. In this way, the centers receive analyses indicating what areas of their program require improvement. As reported by Birkmeyer, it is certainly possible for a given center to be performing at a level equivalent to others in the state or nation without necess arily being a part of the accreditation system with data analysis and reporting. Conversely, it is also possible for a given center to not be performing at such a level. Dr. Halpin and I have discussed the matter and have no objection to whatever decisio n you may make as, indicated above, that decision would be supportable by selected evidence. Background about the controversy Blackstone, 2014 1. Commentary, pro/con article that explains history of accreditation and arguments 2. Accreditation started in 2004, and in 2012, the two national accreditation programs ASMBS Centers of Excellence and ACS Bariatric Surgery Center Network merged into the the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program(MBSAQIP). Univ of Michigan/BCBS co llaborative created new model that was adopted. 3. CMS convened an expert panel and decided in 2013 to drop the accreditation requirement. Medical specialty societies were opposed. 4. Argument against accreditation - Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 5 a. Concentrating medicare patients into center s of excellence did not improve outcomes b. Disadvantages minority patients. 17% decline in access to care among minority Medicare patients 5. Argument for accreditation - a. Articles arguing that COE are no better than non -COE have numerous limitations, includin g other 1) simultaneous initiatives in Michigan that would improve outcomes despite non -COE; 2) new adoption of accreditation caused misclassification b. 2 studies found increased mortality in non -COE hospitals c. Studies saying that differential access are self -contradictory Blondet, 2015 1. Summary of historical process and data supporting accreditation 2. No specific methodology identified 3. Strong recommends accreditation based on improved outcomes. Discredits the studies that demonstrate no improvement in morbidity/mortality. Evidence summary Morton, 2014 1. 2010 National wide inpatient sample of 117,478 weighted bariatric patient discharges corresponding to 235 unique hospitals. A total of 72,615 (61.8%) weighted discharges, corresponding to 145 (61.7%) named or AHA identifiable hospitals were included. 2. Among the 145 hospitals, 66 (45.5%) were unaccredited and 79 (54.5%) accredited. 3. Baseline characteristics between accredited and unaccredited hospitals are significant: 4. Patient characteristics also vary significantly between unaccredited and accredited hospitals: a. Procedures b. Race c. Age d. Insurance Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 6 e. Charleston combordity index 5. Results: a. Compared with accredited centers , unaccredited centers had a higher: i. Mean LOS (2.25 vs 1.99 days, P < 0.0001) ii. Total charges ($51,189 vs $42,212, P < 0.0001) iii. Incidence of any complication (12.3% vs 11.3%, P = 0.001) iv. Mortality (0.13% vs 0.07%, P = 0.019) v. Failure to rescue (0.97% vs 0.55%, P = 0.046). b. Accredited centers had higher rates of: i. Deep venous thrombosis (1.43 v 2.12, P Cardiac arrhythmia (2.81 v 3.79, P<0.0001) c. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified unaccredited status as a positive predictor of incidence of complication [odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, P < 0.0001], as well as mortality (O R = 2.13, P = 0.013). d. Teaching hospitals also increased risk of any in -hospital complication OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.26 -1.39, P<0.0001) e. Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 7 f. 6. Author Conclusions : Hospital accreditation status is associated with safer outcomes, shorter LOS, and lower total charges after bariatric surgery. 7. Staff conclusions: The study does suggest that outcomes are better at accredited hospitals. However, t here are significant differences between baseline characteristics of patients and hospitals between unaccredited and accredited that make conclusions more challenging to interpret . For mortality, the highest risk predictor is being unaccre dited . For any complication, the highest system level risk predictors are Medicare insurance (OR 1.69), teaching hospital (OR 1.32 ) then unaccredited (OR 1.09) . High volume centers and private insurance are both protective against complications . For mortality, having private insurance is highly protective (OR 0.22). Zevin, 2012 (from the CG) 1. Systematic review of volume -outcome associations in bariatric surgery; good quality 2. 24 observational studies comprising almost 460,000 patients. 3. Meta -analysis was not performed due to a high level of heterogeneity that resulted, in part, from differences in duration of follow -up and risk -adjustment. 4. 13 studies addressed the relationship between annual surgeon case volume and patient outcomes. Across the 5 cohort studies that were included, there was consistent evidence of improved outcomes with increasing surgeon volume. The results of lower quality studies (primarily retrospective cohorts) were mixed, but 6 of the 8 studies supported an association between surgeon volume and outcomes. 5. 17 studies addressed the association between hospital volume and outco mes. While the two case -control studies that were included did not support an association between facility volume and outcomes, the preponderance of retrospective case series (14/15 studies) that were included found an association between facility volume a nd outcomes. 6. Authors conclusions: There is strong evidence to support the association between surgeon volume and patient outcomes, and that weaker evidence supports the Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 8 association between hospital volume and outcomes. Overall, they conclude that the literature \"supports the BSCOE accreditation and the bariatric surgery fellowship training programs\" (Zevin et al., 2012, p. 70). Other payer policies CMS coverage Effective for dates of service on and after February 21, 2006, these procedures are only covered when performed at facilities that are: (1) certified by the American College of Surgeons as a Level 1 Bariatric Surgery Center (program standards and requireme nts in effect on February 15, 2006); or (2) certified by the American Society for Bariatric Surgery as a Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence (program standards and requirements in effect on February 15, 2006). Effective for dates of service on and after September 24, 2013, facilities are no longer required to be certified. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare have approved six facil ities in Oregon to perform bariatric surgery: Bay Area Hospital, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Salem Hospital, St. Charles Medical Center - Bend. Moda Bariatric surgery is only covered if provided by an approved facility, defined by Moda as a Center of Excellence. Washington Medicaid Bariatric surgery facilities approved by Washington Medicaid must have performed a minimum of 100 bariatric surgical procedures, be under t he direction of an experienced board -certified surgeon, been in operation for at least five years, have a 2% or less mortality rate, have a 15% or less morbidity rate, have at least five years of patient follow -up data, have an average of at least 50% pati ent weight loss at five years, and have a reoperation/revision rate of 5% or less. Aetna No specific requirement Cigna No specific requirement Regence BCBS No specific requirement Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 9 HERC Staff Summary Since the HTAS and Obesity Task Force Phase I reviewed the Bariatric Surgery Coverage Guidance, new information became available that differed from their understanding at the time. The new information is that there is a bariatric surgery program in Oregon that is not accredited. The understanding that all ba riatric surgeons in Oregon were practicing at an accredited center was one (of many reasons) why ongoing accreditation was recommended to be required. Historically, the Prioritized List guideline note dealing with bariatric surgery has required some elemen t of proof of good outcomes from bariatric surgery programs . However, this requirement for data reporting has not been implemented and no guarantee of outcomes has been ascertained despite the fact that this requirement has been in place for many years . Studies generally support impro ved outcomes with accreditation (although there are a few contradictory studies ). There are also a number of other variables associated with worse outcomes that are not excluded from coverage . CMS no longer requires accredit ation. There is at least one system in Oregon (Kaiser) which is not accredited and does not plan to pursue accreditation, however , has OHSU fellowship -trained bariatric surgeons . Including proposed language about informing patients about patients ' needin g to be informed about their right to receive care at a MBSAQIP accredited center seems to be outside of typical Prioritized List territory. Requiring accreditation is not something the Prioritized List requires for other types of surgeries. Given this, it is worth a brief discussion to determine whether requiring accreditation for inclusion on the Prioritized List is still appropriate. HERC Staff Recommendation Discuss whether to: 1. Continue requiring accreditation (one center in Oregon will be excluded) All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) . , or in active purs uit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care f or patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery 10 restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). OR 2. Adopt language similar to Washington, based on the Coverage Guidance finding that addresses the association between surgeon volume and outcomes: All surgical services must be provided by a program with a minimum of 10 0 bariatric surgical procedures and be under the direction of an experienced board -certified surgeon . OR 3. Eliminate accreditation as part of the coverage requirement altogether. All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Met abolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). , or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospit al to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in o utpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certificat ion, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive ri sk).

HERC Obesity T askforce - Overall Summary Obesity T ask Force , Issue #876 Page 1 Question : Does the overall structure of the obesity lines and related guidelines make sense? How should they be modified as part of the HERC biennial review of this topic? Question source : HERC staff , biennial review Issue : Obesity treatments, including pharmacologic, nutritional, behavioral, surgical, and multisector interventions are likely to have changed in the last few years. This topic is being addressed as part of the biennial review of the Prioritized List, to ensure that it is up to date. An Obesity Task Force was created to assist VbBS and HERC with this biennial review topic. Phase I - Clinical interventions Discussion scope: 1. Obesity and overweight , adult and pediatric a. Pharmacologic interventions b. Behavioral inte rventions c. Surgical d. Devices Format: 2 meetings in MARCH 2016 Phase II - Multisector interventions Discussion scope: 1. Evidence supporting multis ector interventions to decrease obesity a. Paraclinical interventions b. Community based c. Regional policy interventions HERC Obesity T askforce - Overall Summary Obesity T ask Force , Issue #876 Page 2 Overall structure of Prioritized List : The obesity lines are currently divided into funded and nonfunded lines. Bariatric surgery is only included on the Type 2 Diabetes line. Obesity was reprioritized during the ICD -10 process to mid-way down the Prio ritized List based on limited efficacy. The lower obesity line has non -intensive nutritional counseling and interventions, bariatric surgery for specific subgroups, and medication management. In practice, non -intensive nutritional counseling is more like ly to be done and less easy to limit than the more effective intensive counseling. There are two groups of codes that are on the lower (unfunded) obesity line and not the higher (funded) line: bariatric surgery without diabetic comorb idity, and medicatio n management codes (99605 -99607). The proposals include removing bariatric surgery from lower line and only placing on funded line (with a guideline) and continuing to not cover pharmacologic treatments of obesity. The loss of the lower obesity line w ould have minimal impact. Obesity Task Force Recommendation s: 1. Delete the lower obesity line, 589 2. Do not change current exclusion of pharmacologic treatments for obesity 3. Add exclusion of devices to the obesity guideline note to clarify intent 4. Move all obesity related interventions including bariatric surgery to the higher obesity line 5. Revise the bariatric surgery guideline to reflect the new HTAS Draft Coverage Guidance 6. Revise the obesity guideline note as it addresses behavioral interventions 7. Add state ment on Multisector I nterventions for obesity to the Prioritized List Behavioral interventions for obesity 1 Question: Should current coverage on the Prioritized List of behavioral interventions for obesity be modified? Issue: As part of the biennial review, OHP coverage of behavioral interventions are being reviewed and evidence updated. Currently, obesity and overweight guideline makes recommendations for intensive counseling on nutrition and physician activity. The Guidelin e Note language is based on USPSTF recommendations. Children are not currently discussed in the guideline. The Obesity Task Force Phase 1 addressed behavioral interventions for obesity. Prioritized List Status: Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE (See Guideline Notes 8,64,65) NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nu trition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) Behavioral interventions for obesity 2 are includ ed on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period.

Clinicians should offer or refer patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. B 2012, currently being updated Children and Adolescents, Age 6 - 18 Years Old The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years and older for obesity and offer them or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to promote improvement in weight status. B 2010, currently being updated Adults who are overweight or obese and have additional CVD risk factors The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight or obese and have additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention. B 2014 General adult population without a known diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi demia, or cardiovascular disease. Although the correlation among healthful diet, physical activity, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease is strong, existing evidence indicates that the health benefit of initiating behavioral counseling in the primar y care setting to promote a healthful diet and physical activity is small. Clinicians may choose to selectively counsel patients rather than incorporate counseling into the care of all adults in the general population.

Behavioral interventions for obesity 9 HERC Staff Assessment: It appears that there is very modest weight reduction as a result of high intensity interventions for weight loss in obese adults and overweight adults with risk factors. While almost all of the outcomes are interme diate, there is limited data that a reduction in diabetes incidence may be associated with intensive weight management. Many types of behavioral interventions are associated with a weight loss that is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Primary care based interventions appear to be ineffective. The characteristics of effective behavioral interventions are most consistently: high intensity programs, multicomponent (diet and exercise), group - based commercial programs, Mediterranean diet, and the following sub -elements -- calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and comparison to peers. The evidence on individual versus group interventions is mixed. In children, multicomponent, high intensity programs appear to result in weight loss that is of borderline clinical significance. Obesity Task Force Phase 1 Recommendations (per their 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 meetings) 1. Add Z71.3 Dietary counseling and surveillance to Line 325 2. Consider making the following changes to the guideline : a. Remove the limit about not exceeding visits once per week as it may hinder pediatric or other multicomponent/ multiple specialty visits. b. Discuss whether to modify the language on maintenance visits or remove it c. Add distinct language about children d. Include language about types of interventions with the most evidence GUIDELINE NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity in adults is limited to accepted intensive , counseling on nutrition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. A multidisciplinary team is preferred , but a single clinician could also deliver intensive coun seling in primary care or other settings . Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 - 2 weeks) are included on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for an additional 6 months (up to 12 months ) as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits at the conclusion of the intensive treatment are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. The characteristics of effect ive behavioral interventions include: high intensity programs ; multicomponent (including at a minimum Behavioral interventions for obesity 10 diet and exercise), group -based commercial programs ; Mediterranean diet ; and the following sub -elements -- calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and comparison to peers. Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight persons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes impaired fasting glucose , or the metabolic syndrome. Medical treatment of obesity in children is limited to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions . For treatment of childr en up to 12 years old, interventions may be targeted only to parents, or to both p arents and children. General Evidence on Behavioral Interventions for Obesity from Systematic Reviews LeBlanc et al, 2011 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of primary -care relevant obesity treatments for adults that was conducted by the Agency for Health Research and Quality to inform the deliberations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The authors identi fied a total of 58 trials of behavioral interventions; 38 trials (n=13,495) examined behavioral interventions alone, 18 trials (n=11,256) examined behavioral interventions plus orlistat, and 3 trials (n=2,652) examined behavioral interventions plus metform in. Sixty percent of trial participants were women and the average baseline BMI was about 32 kg/m2. Slightly more than half the participants in the included trials had clinical or subclinical cardiovascular risk factors. The quality of included trials was mixed with 24% being rated good and the remainder rated fair (mostly due to issues with allocation concealment, blinding, and outcomes assessment. In general most trials found that behavioral interventions, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformi n, resulted in modest weight loss at 12 to 18 months. Specifically, in the meta -analysis behavioral interventions alone were associated with a weight change of -3.01 kg (95% CI -4.02 to -2.01); behavioral interventions plus orlistat with a weight change of -2.98 kg (95% CI -3.92 to -2.05); and behavioral interventions plus metformin with a weight change of -1.52 kg (95% CI -2.82 to -0.21). All groups showed high degrees of statistical heterogeneity. The authors did note that more intensive interventions (12 to 26 sessions) produced greater average weight loss (4 to 7 kg) compared with less intensive interventions (fewer than 12 sessions, average weight loss of 1.5 to 4 kg). The number of sessions appeared to be the only marker of intensity that was associate d with greater weight loss; after adjusting for the number of sessions, other intervention characteristics did not alter the effect size. Finally, the authors note that subgroup reporting was sparse and mixed. On average, behavioral interventions produced less weight loss in black patients and women. Few trials included in the review reported on distal health outcomes like death, cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, or quality of life. Among the few trials that did there were no observed differences in these outcomes between the behavioral intervention and control groups. A small number of trials (n=3) also examined the effect of behavioral intervention on the development of diabetes; these trials did show that behavioral interventions delivered in 7 to 23 sessions over one year reduced incident cases of diabetes by approximately 50% at 2 to 3 years of follow -up. There was very little available information about harms of behavioral weight loss interventions. Bottom line: In a general adult populati on, behavioral interventions are associated with modest reductions in weight at 12 -18 months. More intensive behavioral interventions appear to result in greater weight loss. Behavioral interventions also appear to reduce cases of incident diabetes in high risk populations. Dombrowski, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized or cluster randomized trials examining long - term maintenance (>12 months) of weight loss with non -surgical interventions. The review included 45 trials spanning nearly 8,000 patients. All patients were older than age 18, had BMI>30, and had lost >5% of their body weight in the prior 24 months. Study interventions included behavioral counseling focused on diet and exercise, pharmacologic treatments, food replacements, or combinations of these interventions intended to maintain weigh loss. The primary outcome was weight at 12 months after randomization. Most of the studies (n=28) were U.S. based. The behavioral interventions were varied and were delivered by diverse provider types (physicians, therapist, dieticians, physiotherapists, peer support s, etc...) and in diverse formats and settings (internet, phone, clinic, community, and gym). On average, the behavioral interventions had 3.2 contacts with patients each month. In the meta -analysis, behavioral interventions alone were associated with an average weight loss of 1.56 kg (95% CI -2.27 to - .086) There was low to moderate statistical heterogeneity. Bottom line: In a general adult population, behavioral in terventions result in maintenance of weight loss at up to 12 months after an initial weight loss. Evidence from Pragmatic Trials Hartmann -Boyce, et al, 2014 b This is a systematic review and meta -analysis that was performed in order to examine the effects of multicomponent behavioral interventions for obese adults when implemented in routine, everyday practice. The outcomes that were studied included 12 month weight change, blood pressure, lipids, and glucose. The interventions that were investigated in th e included studies were, a priori, grouped into categories based on intervention type (commercial weight loss programs with and without meal replacements, primary care interventions, and internet based programs). Ultimately, the authors included eight stud ies spanning over 3,700 participants. Half the studies were done in the U.S., and the remainder were done in Western Europe or Australia. Mean BMI in the studies ranged from approximately 30 to 40 kg/m2. Four studies were deemed to be at low risk of bias w hile the remaining four studies felt to be at high risk of bias. Weight loss at 12 months varied by intervention type; commercial programs with meal replacements were associated with an average weight loss of 6.83 kg (95% CI -8.39 to -5.26); group based co mmercial programs without meal replacements were associated with an average weight loss of 2.21 kg (95% CI -2.89 to -1.54); automated internet -based program were associated with an average weight loss of 0.7 kg (95% CI -1.37 to -0.03); and primary care -based programs were associated with an average weight loss of 0.45 kg (95% CI -1.34 to -0.43). At 24 months, weight loss was attenuated in all groups, with only group -based commercial programs, with or without meal replacement, showing statistically significa nt differences in weight compared to control arms. Few studies examined the effects of these interventions on blood pressure or fasting glucose. None of the observed differences between intervention and control groups achieved statistical significance. Bottom line: In routine everyday settings, group -based commercial weight loss programs, with or without meal replacements, appear to be more effective for weight loss than primary care office -based or internet -based behavioral interventions, but this concl usion is based on a small number of studies several of which had high risk of bias. Diabetes Prevention Programs Balk, et al, 2015 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions targeted at both diet and physical activity to pre vent type 2 diabetes mellitus in people at heightened risk. This review was done to inform the recommendations of the Community Preventive Services Task Force. The authors identified 53 studies; 30 studies comparing diet and exercise interventions to usual care, 13 comparing more intensive behavioral interventions with less intensive interventions, and 13 evaluations of single programs. Overall, 33 studies were deemed good quality and the remaining were considered fair quality. The characteristic s of inter ventions are reproduced from the review in Appendix A. All of participants in the included studies were deemed to be at heightened risk of diabetes by various criteria. The average BMI of participants was 31 kg/m2, the average age 39 years, and 65% of part icipants were women. Participants were of varied ethnicities and levels of educational attainment. The follow -up periods ranged from 1 to 23 year s. In the overall meta -analysis, combined diet and physical activity promotion programs were associated with a relative risk of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.66) for incident type 2 diabetes. There was little to no statistical heterogeneity and there was no indication of publication bias. In the overall analysis, the effectiveness did not appear to vary by setting, number of sessions, approach, duration, use of individual goals , or tailored diet plans. The authors concluded that programs with an individually tailored exercise plan may be more effective than those that did not. Among the six studies that directly compared m ore and less intensive interventions, five favored more intensive interventions (RR 0.28 for incident type 2 diabetes) over less intensive interventions (RR 0.56 for incident type 2 diabetes), though only one of the individual studies showed a statisticall y significant difference. More intensive programs were variably characterized by greater numbers of sessions, more intensive diet and exercise plans, goal setting, maintenance phases, individual contact, and use of an exercise physiologist. For the outcom es of incident cases of type 2 diabetes and body weight, there were no significant differences between group and individual interventions. For the outcome of fasting plasma glucose, interventions that included individual diet counseling were associated wit h a small but statistically significant improvement in fasting plasma glucose ( mean difference -4 mg/dL, P=0.02). Only three of the included studies reported distal clinical outcomes including all -cause or cardiovascular mortality but the authors found th at there was \"no consistent pattern of results.\" Similarly, the authors found limited evidence of no significant effects on cardiovascular events, nephropathy, or neuropathy. Bottom line: Behavioral interventions targeted at improving diet and physical act ivity in adults at risk for diabetes are associated with substantial reductions in the risk of incident diabetes. More intensive programs appear to be somewhat more effective than less intensive programs. Interventions in People with Type 2 Diabetes Fran z, et al, 2015 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials of behavioral weight loss interventions in overweight and obese adults who already have type 2 diabetes. The authors identified 11 RCTs (6,754 participants) that m et inclusion criteria including 12 month follow -up and less than 30% attrition rate. Of note, only 3 of the studies compared behavioral interventions with usual care; the remaining trials compared two different behavioral interventions for weight loss. The behavioral interventions were diverse, including meal replacements, reduced energy intake plans, group behavioral weight management programs, intensive physical activity, and diets with various proportions of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. The meta -analytic results are complicated and have high heterogeneity because of the diversity of interventions, but in aggregate behavioral interventions were associated with weight loss of approximately 3% to 9% at 1 year. The greatest percent weight loss was observed in the intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILI, as described in the LookAHEAD trial) and the Mediterranean diet group (8.6% and 7.2% respectively). For the programs with less than 5% weight loss at 12 months, there was no statistically signifi cant change in hemoglobin A1c. The two programs that reported greater than 5% weight loss at 1 year (ILI, Mediterranean diet) were associated with statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c of -0.6% and -1.2% respectively. Bottom line: In obese adults with type 2 diabetes, intensive lifestyle interventions (as described in the LookAHEAD trial) and Mediterranean diet were associated with >5% weight loss at 1 year and significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c. The authors do caution that t he ILI used in the LookAHEAD trial may not be easily adapted to most health care settings. Behavioral Techniques , Combinations, and Delivery Modes Hartmann -Boyce, et al, 2014 a This is a systematic review, meta -analysis, and meta -regression meant to explor e the techniques and modes of delivery that are correlated with successful behavioral interventions for weight loss. The systematic review identified 37 RCTs spanning over 13,000 participants. In the primary meta -analysis, all behavioral interventions were associated with a mean weight loss of 2.84 kg at 12 months (95% CI -3.61 to -2.07) compared to controls. There was a very high degree of heterogeneity. In the secondary meta - analyses programs involving supervised physical activity, more frequent contact, and in -person contact were not associated with program effectiveness. Similarly, effectiveness did not vary by individual or group interventions. In the meta -regression, programs that included calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and behavioral tech niques comparing participants' behavior with others were associated with greater weight loss. No other program characteristics were positiv ely correlated with weight loss. Bottom line: The authors conclude that most behavioral interventions for weight lo ss are successful, but that the program characteristics most correlated with successful weigh loss are calorie counting and dietician contact. Johns, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions for either diet or e xercise compared with combined behavioral weight management programs (BWMPs) in obese adults. The authors identified 8 RCTs (spanning 1,022 participants) that directly compared diet or exercise programs with BWMPs. All but one of the studies were judged to have at least moderate risk of bias. The primary outcomes were short - (3-6 months) and long -term (12 -18 months) weight loss. In the meta -analysis comparing BWMPs with diet -only programs, there was no statistically significant difference in weight loss at 3-6 months. However, at 12 months BWMPs were associated with greater weight loss than diet - only programs (mean difference -1.72 kg, 95% CI -2.80 to -0.64). BWMPs were superior to exercise -only programs at 3 -6 months (mean difference -5.33 kg, 95% CI -7.61 to -3.04), and at 12 -18 months (mean difference -6.29 kg, 95% CI -7.33 to -5.25). Bottom line: Diet-only interventions are comparable to combined behavioral weight management programs in the short term (3 -6 months), but BWMPs produce greater weight loss at 12 months and beyond. BWMPs are superior to exercise -only programs for both short - and long -term weight loss. Primary Care -specific Behavioral Interventions Booth, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions delivered in primary care settings for obese adults. The authors identified 15 randomized or cluster randomized trials spanning 4,539 participants. Ten of the studies were done in the U.S. with the remainder done in Weste rn Europe. Most participants were in their fifth or sixth decades, were women, and had BMIs between 35 and 50 kg/m2. The behavioral interventions were diverse, but were all delivered in outpatient primary care settings. The methodologic quality of the incl uded studies was difficult to assess because of poor reporting of methods. In the primary meta -analyses, primary care - based behavioral interventio ns were associated with small but statistically significant reduction in weight at 12 months (effect size -1.36 kg, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.63) and 24 months (effect size -1.23 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.18) when compared with controls. There was moderate heterogeneity. Bottom line: The authors conclude that primary care -based behavioral interventions are associated with small reductions in weight that may not be clinically significant. Behavioral Interventions for Children and Adolescents van Hoek, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions for obese young children (ages 3-8 years). The authors identified 27 studies, of which 11 were included in the meta -analysis. The 11 studies included in the meta -analysis spanned just over 1,000 participants. In the primary meta -analysis, behavioral interventions were associated with a modes t reduction in BMI z -score of -0.25 (95% CI -.036 to -0.14). general, reductions of <0.5 in the BMI z -score are not considered to be clinically significant. There was a very high level of heterogeneity in the overall meta -analysis. In the exploratory an alysis, the authors found that only moderate or high intensity multicomponent interventions resulted in weight reductions that approached clinical significance (change in BMI z -core -0.46, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.39). Bottom line: While behavioral intervention s for young children appear to result in weight loss, the difference may not be clinically significant. Moderate or high intensity multicomponent behavioral interventions were associated with greater weight loss than other programs. Ewald, et al, 2013 This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared parent -only interventions with parent -child or child -only interventions for the treatment of childhood obesity. The authors identified 10 reports from six randomized trials spanning 4 66 children . Most of the children were between ages of 5 and 12 years and were either >20% overweight or above the 85th percentile for BMI. Methodologic quality was difficult to assess due to unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of every study. Because of a high degree of heterogeneity, the authors did not perform a meta -analysis. In the narrative summary, the authors conclude that parent -only interventions are associated with similar or greater weight loss when compared with parent -child or child -only interventions. Bottom line: Evidence from a limited number of randomized trials shows that parent -only interventions are at least as , and possibly more , effective tha n either parent -child or child -only interventions for weight loss in obese children.

Question source : HERC staff, biennial review topic Issue: Pharmacotherapy for obesity is not in the funded region of the Prioritized List, as stated explicitly in Guideline Note 5. There have been requests to review the efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for obesity and reconsider placement on the Prioritized List. The Obesity Task Force Phase 1 met 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 and reviewed pharmacotherapy. Prioritized List Status Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE Guideline Notes -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nutrit ion and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) are included o n this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on th is line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 2 Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight persons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome. Pharmacological treatments are not intended to be included as services on this line. Evidence summary Cochrane, 2003 a. Systematic review of RCTs b. Sixteen orlistat (n = 10,631), 10 sibutramine (n = 2623) and four rimonabant trials (n = 6365) met inclusion criteria. c. Attrition rates averaged 30% to 40%. d. Compared to placebo a. orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5 to 3.2 kg) b. sibutramine by 4.2 kg (95% CI 3.6 to 4.7 kg) c. rimonabant by 4.7 kg (95% CI 4 .1 to 5.3 kg). e. Patients on active drug therapy were significantly more likely to achieve 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds. f. Orlistat reduced diabetes incidence, improved total cholesterol, LDL -cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered HDL levels. g. Sibutramine improved HDL and triglyceride levels but raised blood pressure and pulse rate. h. Rimonabant improved HDL -cholesterol, triglyceride and blood pr essure levels and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased the risk of mood disorders. i. Conclusions: All three antiobesity agents are modestly effective in reducing weight and have differing effects on cardiovascular risk and adverse effect s profiles. Longer and more methodologically rigorous studies of anti -obesity drugs that are powered to examine endpoints such as mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are required.

Summary of Recommendations 1.0 Care of the patient who is overweight or obese 1.1 We recommend that diet, exercise, and behavioral modification be included in all obesity management approaches for body mass index (BMI)_25 kg/m2 and that other tools such as pharmacotherapy (BMI 27 kg/m2 with with BMI 40 kg/m2) be used as adjuncts to behavioral modificationto reduce food intake and increase physical activity when this is possible. Drugs may amplify adherence to behavior change and may improve physical functioning such that increased physical Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 5 activity is easier in those who cannot exercise initially. Patients w ho have a history of being unable to successfully lose and maintain weight and who meet label indications are candidates for weight loss medications. (1|QQQQ) 1.2 In order to promote long -term weight maintenance, we suggest the use of approved1 weight los s medication (over no pharmacological therapy) to ameliorate comorbidities and amplify adherence to behavior changes, which may improve physical functioning and allow for greater physical activity in individuals with a BMI _ 30 kg/m2 or in individuals with a BMI of _ 27 kg/m2 and at least one associated comorbid medical condition such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and obstructive sleep apnea. (2|QQEE) 1.3 In patients with uncontrolled hypertension or a history of heart disease, we recommend against using the sympathomimetic agents phentermine and diethylpropion. (1|QQQE) 1.4 We suggest assessment of efficacy and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months, then at least every 3 months in all patients prescribed weight loss medic ations. (2|QQEE) 1.5 If a patient's response to a weight loss medication is deemed effective (weight loss _ 5% of body weight at 3 mo) and safe, we recommend that the medication be continued. If deemed ineffective (weight loss _ 5% at 3 mo) or if there ar e safety or tolerability issues at any time, we recommend that the medication be discontinued and alternative medications or referral for alternative treatment approaches be considered. (1|QQQQ) 1.6 If medication for chronic obesity management is prescrib ed as adjunctive therapy to comprehensive lifestyle intervention, we suggest initiating therapy with dose escalation based on efficacy and tolerability to the recommended dose and not exceeding the upper approved dose boundaries. (2|QQEE) 1.7 In patients with T2DM who are overweight or obese, we suggest the use of antidiabetic medications that have additional actions to promote weight loss (such as glucagon addit ion first -line agent for T2DM and obesity, metformin. (2|QQQE) 1.8 In patients with cardiovascular disease who seek pharmacological treatment for weight loss, we suggest using using medications that are not sympathomimetics such as lorcaserin and/o r orlistat. (2|QEEE) August, 2008 Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 6 Endocrine Society Pediatric Clinical Guideline Recommendations: We suggest that pharmacotherapy (in combination with lifestyle modification) be considered in: 1) obese children only after failure of a formal program of intensive lifestyle modification; and 2) overweight children only if severe comorbidities persist despite intensive lifestyle modification, particularly in children with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes or premature cardiovascular disease. In general, children with a BMI below the 95th percentile should not be treated with antiobesity drugs . Pharmacotherapy should be provided only by clinicians who are experienced in the use of antiobesity age nts and aware of the potential for adverse reactions. We suggest bariatric surgery for adolescents with BMI above 50 kg/m2, or BMI above 40 kg/m2 with severe comorbidities in whom lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacotherapy have failed.

(Strong recommendation; very low quality evidence ) For children and youth aged 12 to 17 years who are overweight or obese, we recommend that primary care practitioners not routinely offer Orlistat aimed at healthy weight management. (Weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence ) NICE, 2014 NICE Guidelines, CG 189: Obesity identification, assessment, and management http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189/chapter/1 -recommendations#pharmacological - interventions 1.8 Pharmacological interventions Adults 1.8.1 Consider pharmacological treatment only after dietary, exercise and behavioural approaches have been started and evaluated. [2006] 1.8.2 Consider drug treatment for people who have not reached their target weight loss or have reached a plateau on dietary, activity and behavioural changes. [2006] 1.8.3 Make the decision to start drug treatments after discussing the potential benefits and limitations with the person, including the mode of action, adverse effects and monitoring requirements, and the potential impact on the person's motivation. Make arrangements for appropriate healthcare professionals to offer information, support and counselling on additional diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies when drug treatment is prescribed. Provide informat ion on patient support programmes. [2006, amended 2014] Children 1.8.4 Drug treatment is not generally recommended for children younger than 12 years. [2006] 1.8.5 In children younger than 12 years, drug treatment may be used only in exceptional circumstances, if severe comorbidities are present. Prescribing should be started and monitored only in specialist paediatric settings. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.6 Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 8 In children aged 12 years and older, treatment with orlistat[ 9] is recommended only if physical comorbidities (such as orthopaedic problems or sleep apnoea) or severe psychological comorbidities are present. Treatment should be started in a specialist paediatric sett ing, by multidisciplinary teams with experience of prescribing in this age group. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.7 Do not give orlistat to children for obesity unless prescribed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in: drug monitoring psychological support behavioural interventions interventions to increase physical activity interventions to improve diet. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.8 Drug treatment may be continued in primary care for example with a shared care protocol if local circumstances and/or licensing allow. [2006, amended 2014] 1.9 Continued prescribing and withdrawal Adults and children 1.9.1 Pharmacological treatment may be used to maintain weight loss rather than to continue to lose weight. [2006] 1.9.2 If there is concern about micronutrient intake adequacy, a supplement providing the reference nutrient intake for all vitamins and minerals should be considered, particularly for vulnerable groups such as older people (who may be at risk of malnutrition) a nd young people (who need vitamins and minerals for growth and development). [2006] 1.9.3 Offer support to help maintain weight loss to people whose drug treatment is being withdrawn; if they did not reach their target weight, their self -confidence and bel ief in their ability to make changes may be low. [2006] Adults 1.9.4 Monitor the effect of drug treatment and reinforce lifestyle advice and adherence through regular review. [2006, amended 2014] 1.9.5 Consider withdrawing drug treatment in people who have not reached weight loss targets (see recommendation 1.9.8 for details). [2006] 1.9.6 Rates of weight loss may be slower in people with type 2 diabetes, so less strict goals than those for people without diabetes may be appropriate. Agree the goals with th e person and review them regularly. [2006] 1.9.7 Only prescribe orlistat as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who meet one of the following criteria: Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 9 a BMI of 28 kg/m2 or more with associated risk factors a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. [2006] 1.9.8 Continue orlistat therapy beyond 3 months only if the person has lost at least 5% of their initial body weight since starting drug treatment. (See also recommendation 1.9.6 for advice on targets for people with type 2 diabetes.) [2006] 1.9.9 Mak e the decision to use drug treatment for longer than 12 months (usually for weight maintenance) after discussing potential benefits and limitations with the person. [2006] 1.9.10 The co -prescribing of orlistat with other drugs aimed at weight reduction is not recommended. [2006] Children 1.9.11 If orlistat[ 9] is prescribed for children, a 6 -12month trial is recommended, with regular review to assess effectiveness, adverse effects and adherence. [2006, amended 2014] Cost analysis Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), 2015 1) Methods - used primarily good - and fair -quality (RCTs) and prospective comparative cohort studies. Also derived harms from retrospective comparative cohort studies, and case series of >50 patients (which were also used for long -term benefit. i. Liraglutide ( Saxenda \u00ae) 1. Small net benefit for BMI 27 based on 3 studies of liraglutide + lifestyle modification v lifestyle modification alone. High rates of adverse effects (80 -96%) but low rates of discontinuation (8 -10%). Long term f/u > 2 years unknown. ii. Lorcaserin ( BELVIQ \u00ae) Small net health benefit, based on 3 good quality RCTS, reductions in total body weight were modest, ranging from 4.5 -5.8% among lorcaserin recipients, compared to a 1.5 -2.8% mean decrease among those taking the placebo (p<0.001 for lorcaserin vs. placebo in all studies). A single study reported outcomes related to comorbidity status and found 50.4% of lorcaserin patients versus 26. 3% of placebo patients achieved a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% (p>0.001).5 Discontinuation of lorcaserin from drug -related AEs occurred in 4.3 -8.6% of patients across studies, and approximately 80% of study participants experienced any AE. Only 1/3 studies reported comorbidity benefit, the others just reported on weight. Long term f/u > 2 years unknown. iii. Naltrexone/Bupropion ( Contrave \u00ae) Moderate certainty of small benefit based on 4 RCTS, recipients lost 5.0 - 9.3% of total body weight after 56 weeks follow -up; patients who received a placebo lost 1.2 -5.1% of total body weight. A single RCT reported outcomes related to improvement of comorbidities and found Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 10 that 44.1% of patients taking N/B achieved a target HbA1c <7% compared to 26.3% of placebo patients.6 Dis continuation of N/B from adverse effects occurred in 19.5 -29.3% of patients receiving standard -dose N/B across studies, and 83.1 -90.4% of patients experienced any AE. No studies > 1 year follow up. low certainty for a small net benefit in patients with BMI 30-34.9 and T2DM based on the results of a single RCT in this population. iv. Phentermine/Topiramate ( Qsymia \u00ae) - moderate certainty of small net benefit based on 8 good/fair reports from 5 RCTs. In these trials, patients receiving the recommended dose combina tion (7.5/46 mg) lost 7.8-8.5% of total body weight (vs. 1 -2% for placebo), while the range for those receiving a higher dose (15/92 mg) was 9.2 -10.9%. Patients who received any dose of P/T experienced greater improvement in obesity - related comorbidities s uch as T2DM, hypertension, and sleep apnea. We found no studies that had a patient population with mean BMI <35. Overall, 91 -95% of patients experienced one or more AEs, and 1.3 -16.0% discontinued P/T due to AEs. No data extended beyond 2 years. 2) Conclusion s re: all pharmacologic therapies - benefits are again relatively modest in comparison to conventional weight -loss management. Across all four medications, total weight loss was 3 -7% higher than achieved with placebo or active comparator therapy. In additi on, there are limited data on resolution or improvement in comorbidities, lack of information on long -term weight trends, high rates of discontinuation in many studies, and not -inconsequential concerns about potential to harm (two of the four are scheduled substances). 1. Naltrexone/buproprion - >$100,000 per QALY vs. conventional treatment. 3) CTAF panel conclusion that the evidence was inadequate to distinguish the net health benefit among the reviewed drugs. HERC Staff Assessment There is insufficient evidence to support significant improvements in health outcomes for pharmacologic treatment of obesity. A number of obesity drugs have been pulled off the market due to adverse effects. Given that outcomes are only minimal to moderate reductions in weigh t loss, without evidence of long -term significant morbid ity or mortality benefits, there are numerous adverse effects and safety concerns associated with these drugs, and that some are quite costly, there is little reason to support coverage of these medic ations. Guidelines are mixed with some recommending against the use of pharmacotherapy for obesity, and others offering weak support for their use as an adjunctive therapy. Obesity Task Force Recommendations Recommend continue d noncoverage of pharmacotherapy. There was a proposal to have it be a covered adjunctive treatment, but because of the lack of long -term patient oriented health outcomes, cost, and safety concerns, the group agreed to recommend continued noncoverage. 1) Make no change t o the current noncoverage of pharmacotherapy for obesity. Devices for Obesity 1 Question: Should a variety of devices be included on the Prioritized List in the treatment of obesity? Issue: There are a variety of devices newly approved in the treatment of obe sity including gastric balloons and vagal nerve blockade devices. There is also a gastrointestinal lining device being evaluated for use in the U.S. These are not currently included on the Prioritized List but also not explicitly excluded as many do not have identifiable procedure codes associated with them .

Rapid review on intragastric balloons (ORBERA and ReShape) a. Limitations of the evidence i. Evidence heavily relies on % excess weight loss (EWL) rather than health outcome or other more objective measures of weight loss ii. All trials funded by manufacturers with conflicted authors iii. Few experimental studies Devices for Obesity 2 iv. Study population 90 -95% female. Females have higher fat cont ent, so may be less efficacious in men. b. ORBERATM and ReShapeTM, combined with diet and exercise counseling, are effective at weight loss in the short -term, though weight regain following removal was observed. ORBERATM i. A systematic review and meta -analysis conducted by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) included experimental and observational studies. 82 studies all conducted outside the US, only 3 RCTs for ORBERA , and 2 RCTs for Re Shape. 1. MA: ORB ERATM, the mean % total body weight loss ( TBWL ) at 3, 6, and 12 months was 12.3%, 13.2%, and 11.3%, respectively. At 36 months, %TBWL was reduced to 6.0%. Based on study design, there were no control groups for these analyses. Therefore, the effect of ORBE RATM is likely being overestimated. ii. ReShape 1. 2 US RCTs, one N=30, one N = 326. 2. In the large study, sham endoscopy and diet and exercise counseling compared to ReShape and counseling were found to have statistically significantly greater %EWL at 24 -weeks fo llow -up (25.1% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.004). However, the effect of ReShapeTM on %EWL was reduced by 48 - weeks follow -up (from 25.1% to 18.8%). c. Early removal of device in 7 -8% of patients (they should be removed at 6 months in all patients normally) d. Adverse effects include: nausea (29%), vomiting, abdominal pain (34%), distension, constipation, diarrhea, gastric ulceration, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (18%). Serious side effects include migration (1.4%) and gastric perforation (0.1%). 4 deaths were re ported either due to gastric perforation or aspiration event. In one study 28/326 had serious side effects, with 75% requiring Emergency Department visits. ICER, 2015 1. Technology assessment with experts and public input a. Included RCTs, comparative cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) b. Case series >50 only for harms and long term benefit 2. Temporary intragastric balloon (IGB) insertion was associated with: a. Modest benefits at 1 year of f/u relative to conventional approaches b. Higher -quality studies sho wed incremental BMI changes and percentage weight loss of 1-3 points and 4 -8%, respectively - and also tended to worsen after balloon removal (typically after six months). c. There was great variability in study design, duration of follow -up (particularly af ter balloon removal), and treatment approach (i.e., single vs. multiple balloon insertions). 3. \"Low certainty of a comparable net benefit for temporary IGB insertion relative to either lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery in patients with a BMI 35.\" Devices for Obesity 3 Duodenal -Jejunal Bypass Liner (EndoBarrier\u00ae) ICER, 2015 1. 2 RCTS, 1 good and 1 fair comparing the duodenal -jejunal bypass liner ( DJBL ) to conventional weight -loss treatment. 2. No difference in reduction of mean BMI between control and DJBL 3. Patients in both studies reduced or discontinued anti -diabetic medications; however, data on comorbidities were not reported for control patients in one study, and statistical testing for differences was not conducted in either study. 4. Complications of the DJBL included device or anchor migration, epigastric pain, and sleeve obstruction; 2.9 -20.5% of patients had the device removed prematurely across studies. Finally, enrollment in a large clinical trial of DJBL is currently stopped pending investigation o f a higher - than -expected rate of bacterial liver infection. 5. Conclusion: insufficient evidence to low certainty of no benefit (and possible net harm) and significant adverse effects Vagus Nerve Block (Maestro\u00ae) MED, 2016 1. Rapid review of vagus nerve block (M aestro) 2. 1 RCT (ReCharge) with 2 different articles, one with 12 months and the other with 18 month follow up 3. Results: At 12 - and 18 -months follow -up, the vagal nerve block group, compared to those who received a sham device, had statistically significantly greater percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL) and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL). However, the clinical meaningfulness of these findings is uncertain. For %TBWL, at 12 months, the difference between groups was 3.3% and at 18 months it was 5.0%. The latter finding was a function of differential weight regain among the sham group between 12 and 18 months . 4. Patient oriented health outcomes (dyslipidemia, hypertension , MACE) not examined 5. Limitations of the evidence: mostly female patients, authors wit h conflicts (although did have independent review board), single trial 6. Adverse effects: 8.6% experienced a serious adverse event compared to 0.0% in the sham group. Frequent adverse events included pain at the neuroregulator site, heartburn/indigestion, abdominal and other pain, nausea, dysphagia (i.e. difficulty or discomfort with swallowing), and eructation (i.e. belching) . ICER, 2015 1. 2 RCTs. One with earlier version no longer on the market . 2. After 12 months follow -up in each study, vBloc patients lost 17 -24.4% of excess body weight versus 15.9 -16.0% excess weight loss (EWL) in control patients. 3. No comorbidity outcomes reported 4. \"Low certainty of a small or comparable net benefit for the vBloc device compared to a sham device in patients w ith a BMI 35.\" Devices for Obesity 4 Commercial payers: Aetna, 2015 1. Considers these procedures experimental and investigational because the peer -reviewed medical literature shows them to be either unsafe or inadequately studied: a. Gastric balloon b. Vagus nerve blocking (e.g., vBloc therapy provided by the Maestro Rechargeable System) c. Gastrointestinal liners (EndoBarrier) Cigna, 2015 1. Cigna does not cover the following bariatric surgery procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity, when performed alone or in conjunction with anothe r bariatric surgery procedure, because each is considered experimental, investigational or unproven (this list may not be all - inclusive): a. Intragastric balloon b. Duodenojejunal bypass liner (e.g., Endobarrier) c. Vagus nerve blocking (e.g., Maestro\u00ae) HERC Staff Assessment: The devices for obesity reviewed here : gastric balloons ORBERA and ReShape , the vagus nerve stimulator (Maestro), and the duodenal jejunal bypass liner (Endobarrier) , have insufficient evidence demonstrating long term health outcomes and have high adverse event rates . None of these are recommended for inclusion on the Prioritized List. Similarly, t wo prominent commercial insurers do not cover any of these interventions because they are considered experimental . There are not distinct CPT or HCPCS codes for many of these devices, making addition to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage table logistically difficult. HERC Staff Recommendations: 1. Add an entry to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage table for these devices, even though there are no specific codes for many of them. 2. Add language to Guideline Note 5 making it clear that these devices are not included on the funded obesity line. GUIDELINE NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nutrition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face cont act more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) are included Devices for Obesity 5 on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is eviden ce of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight p ersons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome. Pharmacological treatments and devices ( e.g. gastric balloons, duodenal jejunal bypass liners, and vagus nerve blocking dev ices) for obesity are not intended to be included as services on this line or any other line on the Prioritized List. Multisector Intervention Statement for Obesity Question: How should the multisector intervention report on obesity be applied to the Prioritized List? Question Source: Obesity Task Force, HERC Staff Issue: The obesity task force looked at reviews published in the last five years based on the following scope statement: Population description Overweight and obese patients, including adults, children, and adolescents Population scoping notes: Includes interven tions targeted at parents, pregnant women, and others that impact outcomes in children Intervention(s) Multisector interventions such as community interventions, policy, systems, and environmental change Intervention exclusions: None Comparator(s) No care, usual care, other studied interventions Outcome(s) (up to five) Critical: Morbidity, all -cause mortality Important: Weight loss, remission/prevention of diabetes, remission of hypertension Considered but not selected for GRADE Table: None Key questions What interventions are most effective and most cost -effective at achieving weight loss and improving patient outcomes? Does effectiveness vary by socioeconomic factors such as race, ethnicity, income, and educational attainment? What models of care would allow these interventions to be implemented most effectively and cost -effectively? Summary The Obesity Task Force Phase 2 reviewed a scope statement to approach multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity. The OHSU Center for Evidence - based Policy performed a literature search, limited to English -language systematic reviews published in the last 4 ye ars. They were further limited to the most recent reviews, unless conclusions were divergent. Sixteen systematic reviews were included in the evidence summary . The obesity task force discussed the limitations of the literature, including a lack of data on the critical and some important outcomes, and the need to consider impact on physical activity and improved nutrition instead of only on BMI indices, which are flawed. They also assisted with identifying the policy landscape as well . Ultimately the Ob esity Task Force created a summary document of the literature identified. See the Obesity Task Force Phase 2 summary document. The proposed Multisector Intervention Statement on the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity lists those interventions for which there is at least limited evidence to support their effectiveness. The following have insufficient evidence to demonstrate effectiveness to impact obesity: Intervention Outcome Changes in food voucher policy (changes in WIC benefits and allowing purchase of food from farmer's market using SNAP benefits, among low - income immigrants) (Mayne et al., 2015) Evidence shows no association with reduced BMI, but does show an association with increased purchase, presence in home/home availability, and consumption of healthy foods. Interventions to increase use of stairs (signs, stairwell improvements) (Bellicha et al., 2014) Limited evidence shows a modest effect on stair use; weight -related outcomes not reported. Community -based, multicomponent physical activity interventions (e.g., fitness classes and programs, interactive group sessions, walking groups, counseling, social support, health promotion materials, and/or media campaigns) targeting women 18 -65 years old Evidence support for enhanced physical activity ou tcomes but not for weight -related outcomes Financial incentives to change health habits in terms of physical activity and healthy eating Mixed evidence that incentives increase physical activity or healthy eating at up to 12 months while incentives remain in place Interventions to modify diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, or a combination that target children age 2 -18 in their homes or include significant family involvement Inconclusive evidence on BMI; some studies showed significant improvements in diet or physical activity HERC Staff recommendations: Add a Multisector Intervention statement on Obesity to the Prioritized List MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS: PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OBESITY Limited evidence supports the following interve ntions: School and childcare settings School based interventions to reduce BMI (especially with physical activity focus) School nutrition policy and day care meal standards Family -based group education programs delivered in schools Obesity prevention interventions in childcare settings (nutrition education, healthy cooking classes for 2 -6 year olds , physical activity and playful games) Community level interventions Environmental interventions (social marketing, cafeteria signs, farmers markets, walking groups, etc) Introduction of light rail Community -based group health education and counseling interventions, workplace education interventions Workplace and college interventions to improve physical activity Multiple settings: Interventions to reduce sede ntary screen time (in some studies, also to increase physical activity and nutrition). Multicomponent individual mentored health promotion programs to prevent childhood obesity Parental support interventions for diet and physical activity (group education, mental health counseling) Policy change s Sugar sweetened beverage taxes Elimination of tax subsidy for advertising unhealthy food to children This Multisector Interventions statement is based on the work of the HERC Obesity Task Force and the full summar y of the evidence report is available here: WEBSITE HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OBESITY For HERC/VbBS meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table of Contents Evidence Summary 44 1 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 The interventions listed in the Evidence Summary T able are reviewe d in the evidence summary below and are recommended by a major organization with expertise in public health.

The Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) requested that staff members conduct research on available interventions to address obesity, including interventions outside of traditional health care systems. Increasingly, public and private health care payers, including HERC, recognize that in order to achieve their goals to improve patient experience of care, population health , and the cost -effectiveness of health care, they must consider evidence -based multisector interventions along with individually focused clinical care. In so doing , they can maximize health and economic outcomes. Multisector interventions such as the ones described here can be cost -effective ways to prevent, treat or manage disease at a population level. This report was prepared in consult ation with the Obesity Task Force members (See Appendix B), who served as subject matter experts from a variety of related disciplines. These interventions will directly inform the Prioritized List and are intended to aid coordinated care organizations as they seek to effectively address obesity, and we hope that they will be useful to private health plans and policymakers interested in using the tools at their disposal to prevent and reduce obesity. BACKGROUND Today, more than one in four adults in Orego n are obese, which equates to over 8 00,000 people. In addition, 15% of Oregon's six- to nine -year -olds were obese in 2012 . Children who are obese are more likely to become obese adults , putting them at a greater risk of chronic disease. Obesity can lead to diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure , high cholesterol, arthritis, heart disease , and stroke , taking a toll on families and the health care system. In Oregon, obesity contributes to 1,500 deaths per year. It is second only to tobacco a s a leadin g cause of preventable death. In 2009 n early 73% of adult Oregonians with a history of heart attacks were overweight or obese. According to a 2012 report from the Institute of Medicine, national costs attributed to treating obesity - related disea ses are estimated to be $190 billion , which represent s 21% of all health care spending . Obesity -related chronic diseases cost Oregonians about $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year, with $339 million of that paid by Medicare and $333 million paid by M edicaid. People who are obese are estimated to have annual medical costs that are $1,429 higher than people who are not obese . Clinical strategies to prevent and treat obesity include screening, behavioral counseling, medications, referral to weight -loss p rograms, and surgery. Many of these have limited efficacy and primarily focus on treatment, rather than prevention of obesity. Given the widespread prevalence of obesity and its significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and societal costs, it is importan t to understand the range of effective interventions that can occur inside and outside of a clinical setting . Preventing obesity is likely to be the most cost -effective strategy, and solutions in the community setting have the potential to affect a large number of people. This report on multisector interventions for obesity examines 9 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity that occur in community settings, which can be policies, programs, or environmental changes. EVIDENCE REVIEW General Multisector Interventions Mayne et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of natural or quasi -experimental studies conducted to examine the effects of policy and built environment changes on obesity outcomes. The authors identified 37 studies, but only three of these studies measured weight or body mass index (BMI) outcomes (the remaining studies only examined changes in dietary composition or physical activity). One study of school nutrition policy and day care meal standards involving almost 68,00 0 children in Chile found mixed results for the outcomes of BMI z -score and obesity prevalence , and the initial improvements were not sustained at 24 months. The second study examined the effects of changes in food voucher policy among 72,000 low -income im migrant adults in the United States and found no association between the policy change and BMI. The third study measuring weight - or BMI -related outcomes , which was designed as a longitudinal within -person study of the effects of a new light rail system in Charlotte, North Carolina , found that use of the light rail system was associated with a self -reported BMI reduction of 1.18 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.22 to -0.13) and reduced the odds of incident obesity. The authors did note that weaker study designs are more li kely to report positive findings. Two additional studies, which assessed the association between nutrition and changes in food voucher policy, considered non -weight outcomes . One of these studies found an increase in home availability and consumption of he althy foods associated with changing food voucher -eligible foods among Hispanic and African American mothers and children enrolled in Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) . The other study found an increase in the purchase of healthy foods associated with loc al changes to vendor payment systems (i.e., permitting farmer s markets to accept food vouchers). Bottom line: There is limited evidence from a study in one community that the use of a new light rail system was associated with a small reduction in self -repo rted BMI and incident obesity. The results of nutritional policy interventions were mixed. Amiri Farahani et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of community -based physical activity interventions targeting women ages 18 to 65 years old. The aut hors identified nine studies including four methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Most of the studies were conducted in the United States and involved multicomponent interventions to promote physical activity. Most of the intervent ions involved social support, goal setting, barrier anticipation, and self -monitoring; these were provided in theoretical constructs of social cognitive theory and social marketing theory. One trial involved a combined exercise program for mothers and daug hters and one included a free gym membership. Although seven of the nine studies reported positive effects on physical activity, only four studies reported statistically significant improvements. No studies reported on weight or BMI outcomes. The authors c oncluded that there was \"insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of community - based interventions for enhancing physical activity among women.\" 10 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Several programs found improvements in physical activity, but there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of community -based physical activity promotion programs for weight loss in adult women. Hillier -Brown et al., 2014 a This is a narrative systematic review of interventions applied at various levels to reduce socioeconomic disparities in adult obesity. Interventions were classified as occurring at the individual, community, or societal levels. Five studies at the individual level were included : four examined tailored weight -loss plans delivered via primary care, and the fifth wa s a long -term study of an educational intervention for obesity prevention. The individually tailored weight -loss plans delivered in primary care appeared to be effective at up to 12 months . Several of the studies showed greater effects among African Americ an participants. At the community level, the authors identified 12 studies : eight examined community - based group health education and counseling interventions, two examined workplace education interventions, and two examined family -based group education pr ograms delivered in schools. Overall, the results of the community -based interventions were mixed ; some of the studies of community - based education and counseling programs showed modest reductions in BMI, but only in the short term (3 to 6 months). At the societal level, the authors identified three studies . The first was an initiative involving environmental strategies to encourage healthful eating and physical activity through \"social marketing... stairway signs, cafeteria signs, farmers markets, walking gr oups, challenges, workshops, educational displays, newsletters, project website, project information centre and print materials .\" This study showed modest positive results, but only among the higher -educated participants. The other two societal -level studi es examined the effects of changes in the structure of nutrition assistance programs for poor women; neither study found significant effects on obesity. Bottom line: There is some evidence of effectiveness for individual -level interventions (particularly those involving tailored weight -loss plans in primary care) in reducing inequalities in adult obesity, but there was less evidence for the effectiveness of community - and societal -level interventions. Workplace Interventions Bellicha et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of stairs. Fifty studies, conducted in a mix of workplace and public settings, were included. The primary outcome measure was stair climbing (ascent only ) or stair use (ascent and descent combined). The interventions consisted of a mix of motivational and directional signs with or without stairwell enhancements. The study designs were nearly all pre -post comparisons and none were judged to be high quality. Modest improvements in stair climbing (absolute median increase of about 4%) were noted in most studies during the intervention period. The combination of motivational and directional signs appeared to be more effective than motivational signs alone. Thre e of the four studies of stairwell enhancements showed similar results (absolute median increase in stair climbing of 4.4%) to the motivational and directional signs. The authors note d that elements of external validity (i.e., implementation) were \"largely underreported\" in the literature. No weight, BMI, or health outcomes were reported. 11 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Motivational and directional signs and stairwell improvements probably lead to modest increases in stair use, but the external validity of these studies remai ns uncertain. Malik et al., 2014 This is a narrative systematic review of health promotion interventions in the workplace to increase physical activity. The authors identified 58 studies including exercise interventions (6 studies), counseling and support interventions (13 studies), and informational or health promotion message interventions (39 studies). The primary outcomes were measures of physical activity. The exercise intervention studies were mostly RCTs or cluster randomized trials. Two of the six studies showed statistically significant increases in physical activity (increased step counts in both of the positive studies); the remaining studies did not demonstrate an effect. The counseling and support interventions, which included telephonic counse ling and peer support programs, used mostly RCT and quasi -experimental designs , but there were substantial issues with blinding, use of intention -to-treat, baseline group differences, and attrition. Of the 13 studies , 8 showed statistically significant inc reases in measures of physical activity or total energy expenditure. The informational and health promotion message interventions were diverse and mostly studied using RCT and quasi -experimental designs, but as with other included studies there were method ologic al flaws in most trials. Of the 39 studies , 22 showed statistically significant increases in physical activity; programs that included stage -of-change matched informational materials were more likely to report significant results. Weight, BMI, and health outcomes were not reported. The authors' conclusion was that the evidence for workplace health promotion interventions was mixed and inconclusive. Bottom line: Evidence that workplace health promotion interventions lead to increased physical activity is mixed. Gudzune et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of workplace or college -based interventions to prevent weight gain. The authors identified seven workplace and two college -based studies using randomized, cluster - randomized, or quasi -experimental designs. The age, gender, and other participant characteristics varied by study site. The studied interventions were diverse and included environmental changes, health promotion and informational programs, educational programs (including a 4 -month college course on preventing weight gain), supported self -management programs, or some combination of the interventions. Five of the workplace studies and both college -based studies reported BMI outcomes at 12 to 24 months. At 24 months, one of the wo rkplace studies showed that intervention group participants had a BMI 0.3 kg/m2 lower than the control group. Another showed that the intervention group had a BMI 0.2 kg/m2 higher than the control group at 12 months. Both of these results were statisticall y significant . Three other studies showed no difference between intervention and control groups. In both of the college -based programs , the intervention group had a lower BMI at 12 months ( -0.5 kg/m2 and -1.6 kg/m2), although only the former result was statistically significant. Overall, the authors deemed the evidence for BMI reduction to be low strength because of issues with bias in the nonrandomized trials and inadequate blinding of outcomes assessors. The authors concluded that there was limited evi dence for workplace and college -based interventions to prevent weight gain. Bottom line: There is mixed evidence that workplace interventions are effective to prevent weight gain. There is limited evidence that college -based interventions are effective. 12 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Sugar -sweetened Beverage Taxes Cabrera Escobar et al., 2013 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of the effects of sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes on SSB demand and obesity. Nine studies, six from the US and one each from Mexico, Brazil, and France were included. The primary outcomes were own -price and cross -price elasticity (measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded), and change in obesity rates or BMI. All studies showed negative own -price elasticity ranging from -0.85 to -4.45 with a meta estimate of -1.3 (95% CI - 1.089 to -1.509). These results suggest that the demand for SSBs is elastic and that SSB price increases are associated with reduced demand. Cross -price elasticities meant to measure the effects of SSB price increases on demand for other beverages were studied in five of the nine studies. The overall estimate is that SSB price increases result in slightly increased demand for fruit juice and milk and slightly lower demand for diet beverages. Meta -analysis coul d not be performed for the effect of SSB taxes on obesity and BMI. One study estimated that a 10% increase in SSB price would lead to a reduction in the point prevalence of obesity of -0.34% for men and -0.05% for women. A second study estimated that a 20% increase in the SSB price would reduce the point prevalence of overweight by -0.045% and obesity by -0.03%. A third study estimated that a 20% increase in the price of SSBs would reduce BMI by -0.065 kg/m2. A fourth study reported that 1% grocery soda tax es and soft drink vending machine taxes would increase BMI by 0.012 kg/m2 and 0.011 kg/m2 respectively, although neither result was statistically significant. The fifth study found that a 1% increase in SSB price would produce only small effects on BMI of -0.0031 kg/m2 for adults and -0.015 kg/m2 for children and adolescents. Overall, the authors conclude d that SSB taxes or price increases may benefit health. Bottom line: SSB prices are elastic and SSB taxes can reduce demand, but the estimated effects of S SB price increases on obesity prevalence and BMI are modest. Long et al., 2015 This is a modeling study of the cost -effectiveness of SSB taxes in the U.S. Key assumptions of the model are 1) an own -price elasticity for SSBs of -1.22 , 2) a reduction of SSB consumption of 8 oz/day leads to weight loss of about 1 kg in children , and 3) a reduction of 12 oz/day leads to a BMI change of -0.39 kg/m2 for adults. Health gains were estimated for a 10-year period using a Markov cohort model. The model accounts for d ownstream changes in a variety of obesity -related illnesses to produce estimates of quality -adjusted life years and disability -adjusted life years. The model also estimated differences in health care expenditures using inputs from the Medical Expenditure P anel Survey. Based on the model, a national SSB excise tax of $0.01/oz would lead to a 20% reduction in consumption , which in turn would reduce an average adult 's BMI by 0.08 kg/m2 and a youth 's BMI by 0.16 kg/m2. The prevalence of obesity among adults and children would decrease by 0.99% and 1.38% respectively. In the 10 -year period between 2015 and 2025, the SSB excise tax would lead to 871,000 quality -adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained and reduce health care costs by $23.6 billion. Thus, the intervention was deemed cost -saving, a finding that was maintained across varied inputs in the sensitivity analysis. Bottom line : This modeling study suggests that a national SSB excise tax of $0.01/oz would reduce the prevalence of obesity by about 1% and avert near ly $25 billion in health care costs in a 10-year period . 13 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Financial Incentives Mantzari et al., 2015 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of financial incentives for changing health -related behaviors. The review identified 15 studies examining the effects of financial incentives on markers of healthier eating and physical activity and two studies on physical activity alone. Most of the studies were conducted in the U.S. in a variety of settings including workplaces, communities , health care, and academia. The magnitude and duration of the financial incentives varied greatly across studies , and some studies used financial incentives with other interventions such as counseling. The studies were a mix of randomized and cluster rand omized designs. Financial incentive s targeted at indicators of healthier eating and physical activity showed positive results at up to 12 months (OR for attainment of target behaviors 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88), but the improvements were not sustained afte r removal of the financial incentive (OR 1.11, CI 0.76 to 1.63). The authors observe d that higher -value financial incentives were more effective than lower -value incentives for smoking cessation , although they did not observe this effect in the diet and ph ysical activity trials. Bottom line: Financial incentives to change eating and physical activity habits are effective at up to 12 months, but the effects are attenuated beyond 12 months and appear to not be sustained after the incentive is removed. Note: A separate systematic review and meta -analysis ( Giles et al., 2014 ) included studies of financial incentives for smoking cessation, vaccinations, and physical activity, although the authors identified only one study on physical activity. Across all the stu dies, the relative risk for attainment of target behaviors was 1.62 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.91), but the authors observed that the effect size decreased at post -intervention follow -up. Their overall conclusion was that financial incentives are more effective than usual care. General Multisector Interventions for Children Ramsey Buchanan et al., 2016 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of interventions to reduce recreational sedentary screen time. It was prepared for the Centers for Disease Control and P revention (CDC) Community Guide. The authors identified 49 studies; 12 studies focused on reducing screen time only, and 37 studies examined interventions to reduce sedentary screen time and improve physical activity or nutrition. The interventions in the studies were diverse and included classroom -based education, tracking and monitoring of screen time, coaching or counseling, and family or peer social support. Additional intervention components were devices to monitor and limit screen time, media and educ ational campaigns, and contingent rewards (i.e. , screen time as a reward for physical activity). The authors defined high -intensity interventions as those that included electronic monitoring and limitation of screen time and at least three personal or comp uter -based interactions. Reported outcomes of interest included BMI, BMI z -score, and obesity prevalence. For children, two screen time -only and twelve screen time -plus studies showed an aggregate decrease in BMI z -score of -0.13 (interquartile interval [ IQI] -0.23 to -0.01). adults, showed BMI reductions of -0.18 kg/m2 and -0.19 kg/m2. In terms of obesity prevalence, 10 high -intensity screen time -plus interventions were estimated to decrease median obesity prevalence by -2.1% (IQI -3.9 to - 1.1, baseline obesity prevalence of 10.3%). Four studies of low -intensity screen time interventions 14 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 were estimated to reduce median obesity prevalence by -4.6% (IQI -7.6 to -1.1, baseline obesity prevalence of 12.3%). Among five studies that stratified an alysis according to socioeconomic status, four found greater effectiveness for reducing BMI and obesity prevalence among low -income participants. Bottom line: Interventions to reduce screen time are effective in reducing BMI and obesity prevalence. This effect has been observed mostly in children younger than 13 years old, but a smaller number of studies also support the effectiveness of these interventions in adults. Interventions that include electronic monitoring and control of screen time appear to be more effective. The results also suggest that screen -time interventions may reduce socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence in children with high and lo w socioeconomic status . Kader et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of parental support interventions to promote dietary changes and increase physical activity . The authors identified 35 studies and divi ded the parental support interventions into four categories: individual counseling, group education, informational -only, and individual telephone counseling. Of the 35 studies , 16 reported on weight outcomes for children, but most of these studies were not powered to detect changes in BMI. One of the four studies of in-person counseling found a decrease in the prevalence of obesity among girls but not boys , and those results were not sustained at later follow -up. Four of the seven studies involving group ed ucation showed improvement in weight -related outcomes. Information -only programs appeared to be ineffective. One of the two studies on telephone counseling showed a reduction in BMI z -score. The authors conclude d that for weight -related outcomes, group edu cation programs appear ed to be more effective than other universal parental interventions. Among five studies conducted exclusively in low socioeconomic status or minority populations, 6 to 12 group education sessions for parents of preschool -age children were associated with \"desirable effects on weight status.\" Bottom line: Group education programs appear to be more effective than other types of parental intervention for weight outcomes, especially for low -socioeconomic status and minority children. Hilli er-Brown et al., 2014b This is a narrative systematic review of interventions applied at various levels to reduce socioeconomic disparities in childhood obesity. Interventions were classified as occurring at the individual, community, or societal levels. T he authors identified four studies at the individual level, 17 studies at the community level, and one study at the societal level. Among the individual interventions, screen - time reduction and mentored health -promotion programs showed the most promise for reducing disparities. The authors concluded that the evidence for community -level interventions was inconclusive , with mixed results in studies of school - and community -based health -promotion programs. The single societal -level study of environmental chan ges in Swiss preschools showed no significant differences in BMI or overweight prevalence, but there was a \"trend towards more beneficial effects in higher SES [socioeconomic status] children.\" There was no evidence that any of the interventions worsened i nequalities in obesity outcomes. The authors conclude d that there was limited evidence , but that some individual - and community -level interventions may be effective in reducing disparities in obesity -related outcomes for children. 15 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Some individ ual interventions (screen -time reduction and mentored health -promotion programs) show promising results for reducing disparities in childhood obesity, and reported outcomes for community interventions were inconclusive or mixed. Showell et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of home -based interventions on childhood obesity. The authors identified six studies including combined physical activity and diet interventions ( three studies), diet - only interventions ( one study), interventions spanning h ome, school , and primary care settings ( one study), and interventions with primary care and consumer health informatics components ( one study). Overall, none of the studies showed statistically significant reductions in BMI or obesity prevalence, although three studies showed improvements in diet or physical activity. The authors judged the evidence quality to be low or insufficient and called for better studies of home -based interventions. Bottom line: There is insufficient evidence that home -based interve ntions are effective for reducing BMI or obesity prevalence in children. School -based Interventions Sun et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of trials examining school -based direct delivery of physical activity interventions. The authors ide ntified six large, high -quality RCTs of high -dose physical activity in schools. Three of the six studies found statistically significant reductions in BMI; the three remaining trials did not find statistically significant effects. Overall, the authors obse rved that high -dose direct delivery of physical activity in schools was associated with improved fitness measures, but that the effects on BMI, body fat, and waist circumference were inconclusive. Bottom line: High -dose physical activity interventions in schools improve fitness measures, but do not have a clear effect on weight -related outcomes. Lavelle et al., 2012 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of school -based interventions to reduce BMI. The authors identified 43 RCTs, cluster -randomized, and quasi -randomized trials of school -based interventions that reported on BMI outcomes. These interventions were diverse (targeting physical activity, sedentary behavior, and nutrition) and varied in terms of which components were included: direct physic al activity, nutrition and activity education, self -management and self -esteem building, and environmental changes (i.e. , school meal changes or removal of vending machines). As expected, there was a high degree of heterogeneity. Two -thirds of the studies showed reductions in BMI ; 16 of those demonstrated statistically significant differences. In the meta -analysis, the estimate of BMI reduction was -0.17 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.26 to -0.08). Notably, in the stratified analyses, the results were only statistically significant for girls. Among the studies in which interventions were only targeted at overweight and obese children, the meta -analysis showed a reduction in CI - 0.58 to -0.12). Bottom line: School -based interventions, particularly those that contain a physical activity component, are associated with a statistically significant reduction in BMI and the effect is greatest in overweight and obese children. 16 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Childcare -based Interventions Zhou et al., 2014 This is a narrative systematic r eview of obesity prevention interventions delivered in childcare settings. The authors identified 15 randomized, cluster randomized , and nonrandomized controlled trials that reported on adiposity outcomes. The study participants were two- to six-year -old children in preschool childcare centers in several countries; about half the participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged. The interventions were varied and included structured age -appropriate nutrition education, healthy cooking classes, physical act ivity, and playful games. Several programs also included a component of parental education. The interventions lasted from six months to two years. Overall, the results were mixed : 7 of the 15 studies reported improvements in measures of adiposity including BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, or decreased prevalence of overweight compared to controls. All of the studies with positive results included both nutrition and physical activity components. Among the remaining studies , many reported positi ve effects on measures of physical activity or nutrition, but did not show improvements in adiposity outcomes. Bottom line: There is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in childcare settings to reduce obesity. Studies with po sitive results for this outcome all included combined physical activity and nutrition interventions. OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource Allocation A recent artic le in Health Affairs (Gortmaker et al., 2015) summarized research on seven interventions to reduc e childhood obesity. The study estimated the effects of each of the seven interventions using an evidence review protocol. A microsimulation model was developed to calculate the costs and effectiveness of the interventions through their impact on BMI chang es, obesity prevalence, and obesity -related health care costs in a 10 -year period (2015 -2025). Three of the interventions were found to save more in health care costs than they cost to implement : Sugar -sweetened beverage excise tax of one cent per ounce Nutrition standards for food and beverages sold in schools outside of meals Elimination of the tax subsidy for advertising unhealthy food to children The other studied interventions cost more to implement than they save on health care costs , but are likely still cost -effective : Restaurant menu calorie labeling Nutrition standards for school meals Improved early childhood education policies and practices, including the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self -Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) program Four -fold increase in the use of bariatric surgery among adolescents . In particular, increasing adolescents' access to bariatric surgery was found to have a negligible impact on obesity prevalence. 17 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 POLICY LANDSCAPE Recommendations from others The following recommendations are from these major public health organizations: The Community P reventive Services Task Force The Institute of Medicine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Association of State and Territorial Health Officials World H ealth Organization White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity The Community Preventive Services Task Force \u2014Obesity Prevention and Control: Interventions in Community Settings 1. Behavioral interventions that aim to reduce recreational sedentary screen tim e among children Definition: These are behavioral interventions that aim to reduce recreational (i.e., neither school - related nor work -related) sedentary screen time by teaching behavioral self -management skills to initiate or maintain behavior change. Interventions may be screen -time only interventions as well as interventions that combine a focus on reducing recreational screen time with increasing physical activity and improving diet. Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in August 2014 and recommended behavioral interventions to reduce recreational sedentary screen time among children aged 13 years and younger. This finding is based on strong evidence of effect iveness in reducing recreational sedentary screen time, increasing physical activity, improving diet, and improving or maintaining weight -related outcomes. Evidence includes studies of interventions that focus only on reducing recreational sedentary screen time (screen -time -only) and studies that focus on reducing recreational sedentary screen time and improving physical activity and/or diet (screen -time - plus). Limited evidence was available to assess the effectiveness of these interventions among adults. 2. Worksite interventions Definition: These are a suite of interventions operating on both individual and systemic levels through a combination of policy and system change, as well as individual encouragement. Components include: Informational and educatio nal strategies that aim to increase knowledge about a healthy diet and physical activity (e.g., educational software or lectures) Behavioral and social strategies target the thoughts (e.g. awareness, self -efficacy) and social factors that affect behavior changes (e.g., individual or group counseling and skill building) Policy and environmental approaches aim to make healthy choices easier and target the entire workforce by changing physical or organizational structures (e.g., improve access to healthier options in cafeterias, provide on -site facilities for exercise, employers cover health club membership) 18 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Worksite weight control strategies may occur separately or as part of a comprehensive worksite wellness program that addresses several health issues (e.g. , smoking cessation, stress management, cholesterol reduction). Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in 2007 and recommended worksit e programs intended to improve diet and/or physical activity behaviors based on strong evidence of their effectiveness for reducing weight among employees. 3. Technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions to reduce weight and ma intain weight loss Definition: Technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions use technology to facilitate or mediate interactions between a coach or counselor and an individual or group, with a goal of influencing weight -related behaviors or weight -related outcomes. These interventions often also include other components, which may be technological or non -technological (e.g., in -person counseling). Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in 2009 and recommended technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions intended to reduce and maintain weight loss on the basis of sufficient evidence that they are effective in improving weight -related behaviors or weight -related outcomes. The Institute of Medicine \u2014Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention Goal 1: Make physical activity an integral and routine part of life Recommendation: Communities, transportation officials, community planners, health professionals, and governments should make promotion of physical activity a priority by substantially increasing access to places and opport unities for such activity.

Communities should participate in community coalitions or partnerships to address obesity. Association of State and Territorial Health Officials \u2014Recommendations for Preventing and Reducing Obesity 1. Support Infrastructure for State and Territorial Health Agencies to Address Obesity. Partnerships Promote partnerships across state, territor ial, federal, and local governments, private sector partners and businesses, community groups, and healthcare systems that provide safe, culturally competent, and appropriate programs. These partnerships should transform communities by affecting policy and implementing initiatives, cross -cutting programs, and consistent targeted messages. Promote partnerships within state and territorial health agencies to support coordination among all programs, such as nutrition and physical activity, heart disease and st roke prevention, injury and violence prevention, diabetes prevention and control, maternal and child health, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and other related chronic disease prevention programs. Promote partnerships across state and terri torial health agencies that support obesity prevention policy and environmental change in cooperation with agencies overseeing education, transportation, housing, agriculture, healthcare, and other sectors. Coordination Foster engagement among multiple sec tors, including state health agency leadership and to provide comprehensive systematic change to address issues such as food deserts, which encourage unhealthy eating and are most often found in low -income, rural, and minority neighborhoods. Address health y eating and active living policies and programs with an effective, coordinated, sustainable infrastructure within state health agency programs. Coordinate chronic disease programs to provide infrastructure for all programs in order to have adequate and co ordinated leadership that supports communication, evaluation, surveillance, and management of related programs. Leadership Adopt comprehensive healthy workplace policies within health agencies and throughout state government with the support of state leadership, including implementing health risk assessments; healthy food procurement policies that include agency food purchasing, events and meetings, vending machines, and cafeterias; and other incentives for employees to improve their health. 2. Support Policy and Environmental Changes across the Lifespan. National Guidelines 24 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Implement policy, programmatic, and other system changes in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to ensure that he althy food and physical activity is accessible to all populations and consider regulatory approaches to implement and enforce obesity prevention measures. (For example, breastfeeding policies in government nutrition programs, such as the Women, Infants, an d Children program and Adult Care Food program; encouraging and supporting hospitals to pass Baby -Friendly Hospital practices; and supporting adequate time and space for breastfeeding or expressing milk in all workplaces.) Promote the food marketing princi ples developed by the U.S. Interagency Working Group that guides the food industry in determining which foods would be appropriate and desirable to market to children ages 2 to 17 to encourage a healthful diet and which foods the industry should voluntaril y refrain from marketing to children. Encourage and enforce nutrition labeling in restaurants and similar establishments and vending policies that provide consumers with appropriate information at the point of purchase and encourage support for state healt h agencies to provide the regulatory structure to enforce these policies. Education Support early childhood education policies that describe access to healthy foods and beverages through the Child and Adult Food Care Program and state child care licensing standards that include nutrition and wellness guidelines, age -appropriate physical activity time and intensity, limited screen time, and meals and snacks that meet nutrition guidelines. Support education policies that encourage healthy students through coo rdinated K -12 school health programs, adequate time and intensity of physical education and activity, access to healthy foods and beverages through the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program and throughout the school day that meet updated standards de veloped by USDA and the Dietary Guidelines 2010, and implementation of school wellness policies, farm to school programs, and joint use agreements. Improved Industry Standards Promote worksite wellness policies and accreditation programs that encourage a h ealthy work environment, such as incentive programs for individuals to maintain healthy weight; inclusion of preventive services in routine clinical practice, including reimbursement for proven clinical preventive services; healthy foods and physical activ ity at meetings and events, and healthy foods in vending machines; and policies for breastfeeding or expressing milk in the workplace. Work closely with business and private sector partners to support efforts for spread and sustainability. Support agricult ure policies that shift federal subsidies; support less processed foods; increase access to affordable fresh fruit and vegetables through commodity programs; create agriculture policies that support healthy foods in food assistance programs; expand farmers markets and encourage the use of electronic benefit transfer at farmers markets; increase access to fresh fruit and vegetable through distribution to schools; and address the problem of food deserts. Support transportation policies that boost partnerships with planners, transportation, and developers; support mixed -use, healthy communities that meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities; support key walking and biking programs and access to public transportation; support Safe Routes to Schools progr ams; encourage Complete Streets policies; and increase the use of Health Impact Assessments to analyze policies and programs. 25 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 3. Support Outreach and Education to Inform and Prepare Providers. Incentives Identify opportunities to assist and advocate for financial incentives for healthcare professionals and institutions, such as physicians, nurses, and other clinicians, hospitals, accountable care organizations, and insurers that track body mass index (BMI) and other health indicators. Offer evidence -based nutrition and physical activity counseling (including breastfeeding), develop targeted and culturally appropriate interventions, and provide leadership in community -based obesity prevention efforts. Provide training, educational materials, and technical assistance to communities, worksites, early care and education, and schools interested in offering healthy eating and physical activity programs and policies, especially targeting health disparities and other social determinants of health. 4. Support the Evaluation of Obesity Efforts Data Collection Practice routine data collection and use of public health surveillance data, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, electronic health information, and hospital discharge data to identify jurisdictions' most pressing needs and efficiently target scarce resources. Conduct collection of community design data as communities redesign environments to promote physical activity and access to nutritious foods . Gather state -level quantitative and qualitative data on obesity disparities and the social and environmental factors that contribute to them to identify and prioritize populations with the greatest need. Analysis and Tracking Track progress of obesity ra tes in populations, schools, worksites, communities, and states and territories through public health metrics, including vital statistics, hospital discharge data, and health surveillance systems. Utilize clear benchmark goals and measurement of overall ra tes of obesity according to the best attainable average level of \"goodness\" and the smallest feasible differences in obesity rates among individuals and groups, or \"fairness.\" Evaluation Engage state leadership in the development of robust health informati on exchange with the clinical sector to improve public health and clinical services.

METHODOLOGY Scope Statement Populations Overweight and obese patients, including adults, children, and adolescents Population scoping notes: Includes interventions targeted at parents, pregnant women, and others that impact outcomes in children Interventions Multisector interventions such as community interventions, policy, systems, and environmental change Comparators No care, usual care, other studied interventions Outcomes Critical: Morbidity, all -cause mortality Important: Weight loss, remission/prevention of diabetes, remission of hypertension Key Questions 1. What interventions are most effective and most cost -effective at achieving weight loss and improving patient outcomes? 2. Does effectiveness vary by socioeconomic factors such as race, ethnicity, income, and educational attainment? 3. What models of care would allow these interventions to be implemented most effectively and cost - effectively? Search Strategy A sea rch of MEDLINE\u00ae was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, and guidelines related to reducing obesity that were published since 2011. Search terms included \"Weight Reduction Programs\"[Mesh], \"Diet, Reducing\"[Mesh], and physical activity. In addition, a Google search was conducted for guidelines or recommendations related to obesity control. Systematic reviews were excluded if they did not report on at least one of the following outcomes: morbidity, mortality, weight loss, remission/prevent ion of diabetes, remission of hypertension. The included interventions were those that were not limited to clinical settings, such as community interventions, policy, systems, and environmental change. Due to the large number of systematic reviews for some interventions, the most recent and/or comprehensive review was used unless the overall conclusions of the reviews were divergent. 44 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 APPENDIX B.

Currently, coverage guidances are considered either \"approved\" or \"retired,\" and all \"approved\" coverage guidances are rescanned every two years. Recommendation s: Add a new status for a coverage guidance, \"Passive Monitoring,\" for which additional evidence searches are unlikely to change coverage policy. Such coverage guidances may be cases where evidence is already strong, or the prior recommendation to cover a service would require evidence of ineffectiveness or harm. For these topics, staff would not update the scope statement or perform a new evidence search every two years. Rather these topics would be rescoped and have a new evidence search only if stakeholders request a review or if staff becomes aware of a significant new piece of evidence which might substantially change the Coverage Guidance . If so, the scope statement would be posted for a 7 -day public comment period and brought to EbGS or HTAS. Then, an updated evidence search would be performed and staff would bring a recommen dation to EbGS or HTAS about whether to update the coverage guidance as is done during the normal monitoring process. Then if a rescan is in order, the topic would be prioritized with other topics during the annual coverage guidance topic prioritization pr ocess. If a coverage guidance is in need of an update but is not prioritized for development, it may be retired. The new status of a Coverage Guidance would therefore be either: 1) Active monitoring - 2 year standing rereview. Earlier review is possible if there is a dramatic change in the literature. 2) Passive monitoring - do not rescan the literature on a regular basis unless a specific concern is raised 3) Retired Section 4.0 Coverage Guidances 1 RHEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) COVERAGE GUIDANCE : NONINVASIVE TESTING FOR LIVER FIBROSIS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS C DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 HERC Coverage Guidance If a fibrosis score of F2 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C , the following are recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) : Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) (Virtual T quantification, ElastPQ) Shear wave elastogr aphy (SWE) (Aixplorer \u00ae) Blood tests (only if imaging tests are unavailable) : Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) Fibrometer FIBRO Spect \u00ae II If a fibrosis score of F3 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C , one or more of the following are recommended for coverage (strong recommendation ): Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) Shear wave elastography (SWE) Magnetic resonance elastography is recommended for coverage for F2 or F3 only when at least one imaging test (FibroScan, ARFI, and SWE) has resulted in indeterminant results, a second one is similarly indeterminant, contraindicated or unavailable, and MRE is readily available (weak recommendation).

RATIONALE FOR DEVELOP MENT OF COVERAGE GUI DANCES AND MULTISECTOR INTERVEN TION REPORTS Coverage guidances are developed to inform coverage recommendations for public and private health plans in Oregon as they seek to improve patient experience of care, population health and the cost - effectiveness of health care. In the era of the Affordable Care Act and health system transformation, reaching these goals may require a focus on population -based health interventions from a variety of sectors as well as individually -focused clinical care. Multisector intervention reports will be developed to address these population -based health interventions or other types of interventions that happen outside of the typical clinical setting. HERC selects topics for its reports to guide public and private payers based on the following principles: 3 Noninvasive Testing for Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Represents a sig nificant burden of disease or health problem Represents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is o f high public interest Our reports are based on a review of the relevant research applicable to the intervention(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on clinical interventions and modes of care, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. For more information on coverage guidance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat or manage disease at a population level. For some conditions, the HERC has reviewed evidence and identified effective interventions, but has not made coverage recommendations, as ma ny of these policies are implemented in settings beyond tradition al healthcare delivery systems. 4 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the s teps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop t he recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assessment of two independent reviewer s from the Center for Evidence -based Policy . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission.

It could be equally appropriate to do a second imaging test versus going straight to liver biopsy depending on the institution and availability of nearby alternatives.

However, in clinical practice, these tests are used to replace liver biopsy.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Balance of benefits and harms : Given the good (F2) and excellent (F3) performance of the recommended imaging tests and the potential harms of liver biopsy, the balance is strongly in favor of offering these tests as an option for patients for whom Hepatitis C direct -acting antiviral therapy is being considered. Because these tests sometimes return inconclusive results, additional testing including liver bi opsy may still be required for some patients. Though they are inferior to the recommended imaging tests, blood tests also have a good performance at the F2 threshold and have a favorable balance when imaging tests are unavailable and biopsy is not required. Rationale: The diagnostic operating characteristic of the recommended imaging tests are good to excellent (defined as an AUROC 0.8). Patient - oriented health outcomes are not available. However, given the characteristics of the tests, the strong values and preference s for noninvasive tests when results are comparable, and th e improved individual -level resource allocation, these tests are recommended for coverage . The strong recommendation for imaging tests when the cutoff is F3 is due to the excellent performance at this level of cutoff (defined as an AUROC 0.9) and the othe r factors in favor of their use. The weak recommendation at the F2 c utoff is based on \"good\" but not \" excellent \" performance, and the high societal cost of treating patients at levels of fibrosis who are not at short -term risk . The diagnostic operating ch aracteristics of the blood tests are variable. Though tests recommended at the F2 threshold can accurately assess the fibrosis stage F2 or higher, they are inferior to the imaging tests at this level, and expert input suggests less clinically reliable, and so are recommended only when imaging tests are unavailable. No existing blood test can accurately distinguish between F2 and F3 . Therefore, blood tests cannot be recommended (alone or in combination with noninvasive imaging tests) when the treatment plann ing re volves around an accurate diagnosis of F3. Many of the non-recommended blood tests have fair to poor operating characteristics regardless of the treatment threshold . MRE is much more expensive than the other imaging tests and thus is only recommende d when available after two other imaging tests f ail to return useful results. Recommendation: If a fibrosis score of F2 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C, the following are recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) : Imaging tests: 10 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Coverage question: Should noninvasive testing for liver fibrosis for chr onic hepatitis C be recommended for coverage?

A GRADE Evidence Profile is provided in Appendix B. 11 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease in the United States, and chronic hepatitis C infection is the leading indication for liver transplantation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016). The CDC estimates that 3.5 million people in the United States are currently infected with HCV, though the precise number is not known. One study cited by the CDC estimated that around 15,000 deaths were attributable to HCV in 2007. Well established modes of transmission for HCV infect ion include injection drug use and receipt of blood products prior to 1992 . According to the CDC, the prev alence of HCV infection among injection drug users ranges from about 30% for younger users (aged 18 to 30) to 70 -90% for older injection drug users. The natural history of HCV infection is variable, and 15 -25% of people will clear the infection and not develop chronic hepatitis C. Between 5% and 20% of those with HCV i nfection will develop cirrhosis, generally over the course of 20 to 30 years, and between 1% and 5% will die from HCV -related liver disease (CDC, 2016). There are no highly accurate tools to predict which individuals with chronic hepatitis C will go on to develop cirrhosis. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends b irth-cohort screening for hepatitis C for anyone born between 1945 and 1965 . HCV testing is also recommended fo r those in high risk groups included people with a history of injection drug use, those who received blood products before 1992, those with HIV infection, and those born to HCV -positive mothers (CDC, 2016). Before 2013, treatment for chronic hepatitis C re lied on interferon and ribavirin, sometimes with the addition of a protease inhibitor in the case of genotype 1 infections. These treatments were long (24 to 48 weeks), entailed a high burden of adverse effects, and response rates were highly variable. The advent of direct -acting antiviral treatments (i.e. sofosbuvir, simeprevir, and others) appears to have improved the success rates (as measured by the surrogate marker of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks) and acceptability of treatment, though at c onsiderable cost. Traditionally, staging of chronic hepatitis C infection was done by examining histologic specimens from liver biopsies of the liver for evidence of fibrosis. The METAVIR fibrosis stage is the most commonly used measure for assessing the histologic degree of hepatic fibrosis: F0 = No fibrosis F1 = Portal fibrosis septa F2 = Portal fibrosis with few septa = fibrosis with = Cirrhosis Progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis is associated with complications of end -stage liver disease including portal hypertension, portosystemic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis have developed as an alternative to biopsy for staging chronic hepati tis C infection. 12 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Indications In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, the likelihood of progression is closely correlated with the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (Chou et al., 2013). Thus, tests to diagnose the presence and ascertain the degree of fibrosis are indicated in the staging of patients with chronic hepatitis C, particularly when that information is relevant to decisions about HCV treatment. For instance, accurate determination of fibrosis stage is essential when treatment eligib ility decisions are made on the basis of fibrosis severity. Beyond decisions about HCV treatment, tests to determine the presence of cirrhosis may be indicated in order to ensure appropriate supportive care and screening for complications of cirrhosis for these patients. Until recently, the only options for staging fibrosis in hepatitis C patients was histological examination of the liver by percutaneous or laparoscopic surgical biopsy. However, biopsy entails procedural risks (including bleeding, infection, and pain), and the results are prone to sampling and interpretation errors. Despite these drawbacks, liver biopsy remains the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis (Chou et al., 2013). The accuracy of n oninvasive tests of liver fibrosis are measured against the reference standard of the results from a liver biopsy, using these definitions: Sensitivity refers to the proportion of patients who actually have the condition in question who have a positive test result. Specificity refers to the proportion of patients who really do not have the condition in question who have a negative test result. Positive likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a patient with the condition to the probability of a positive test result in a patient without the condition. Likelihood ratios are most useful when the pre -test probability of t he condition is known and the post -test probability at which treatment would be recommended is well established. Negative likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in a patient with the condition to the probability of a negative test in a patient without the condition. The receiver operating curve (ROC) is a graphical illustration of the trade -off between sensitivity and specificity for an index diagnostic test (specifically for a test that has continuous rather than binary, or y es/no results) compared to a reference standard. The \"index\" test refers to the test that we are looking at to see how good it is. The reference standard has sometimes been referred to as the \"gold standard,\" but given that some reference standards are not themselves perfectly accurate the terminology has s hifted to \"reference standard.\" The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) is an overall measure of how well the index test compares to the reference standard across a range of possible cutoffs. An index test that has cutoff value that allows perfect sensitivity and specificity (i.e. perfect classification of those with and without the condition) would have an AUROC of 1.0, while an AUROC of 0.5 represents a useless test (no better than a coin fli p, on average). A test with an 13 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 AUROC of 0.8 0-0.89 is generally regarded as a good test, while tests with an AUROC >0.90 are regarded as excellent tests . These distinctions are conventional, but arbitrary. Technology description Noninvasive techniques for staging liver fibrosis include imaging and blood tests. Five types of imaging tests are available: transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI), shear wave elastography (SWE), magnetic resonance elastography -time tissue elastography (RTE). Transient Elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) measures the velocity of a low -frequency (50 Hz) elastic shear wave propagating through the liver. The velocity of the wave indicates the tissue stiffness, with the stiffer the tissue, th e faster the shear wave propagates. The patient lies supine during the procedure, which takes less than five minutes. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (Virtual T ouch tissue quantification, ElastP Q) measures the speed of short -duration acoustic pul ses that propagate shear waves and generate localized displacements in liver tissue. Commercial ultrasound machines can be easily modified to implement ARFI. Shear wave elastography (Aixplorer\u00ae Supersonic Imagine) creates ultrasonic beams that are focused on liver tissues, and a very high frame rate ultrasound imaging sequences monitors the transient propagation of the shear waves in real time. This procedure can be implemented on commercial ultrasound machines. Magnetic resonance elastography images the pr opagation characteristics of a shear wave in the liver using a modified phase -contrast method. Almost the entire liver can be analyzed with MRE, and it can be used effectively in patients with obesity or ascites. This procedure is more costly and more time consuming than the other imaging techniques. Real -time tissue elastography constructs elasticity images of the liver by measuring the tissue strain induced by compression from a high -frequency ultrasound scanner. Tissue compression produces strain in the tissue, where the strain is smaller in harder tissue than in softer tissue. Five proprietary blood testing protocols are available in the U.S., which use a combination of biochemical markers and patented algorithms to determine fibrosis stage. There are 2 5 additional blood tests that are not proprietary. The components of these blood tests are shown in Table 1 below. The most common components of the blood tests are platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). About half of the tests include patient's age in the algorithm. 14 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Table 1: Blood Tests f or Measuring Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Hepatitis C Blood tests Components of test/algorithm Proprietary tests ELF Test (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis ) Hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of age and gender FIBROSpect\u00ae II Hyaluronic acid, (GG T), and patient's age and gender ActiTest\u00ae is similar, with the alanine Age-platelet index Platelet and patient's (ALT), p rothrombin 15 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Blood tests Components of test/algorithm Fibrosis probability index (Sud index) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol, insulin resistance, alcohol intake, and patient's age Fibrosis-protein index 2-macroglobulin and (GGT), cholesterol, and s Globulin and prothrombin index HALT -C model (Hepatitis C Antiviral Long -Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis ) Platelet count, (AST), international normalized ratio and index Platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and inhibitor 1 (TIMP - and patient's Adapted from Chou & Wasson (2013) Key Q uestions and Outcomes The following key questions (KQ) guided the evidence search and review described below.

What is the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests for the diagnosis and management of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C? 2. Does the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C vary based on: a. Duration of infection b. Fibrosis score c. Body habitus d. Operator/interpreter training or experience e. Co-existence of other etiologies of liver disease (e.g., non -alcoholic steatohepatiti s) 3. What are the comparative diagnostic operating characteristics of tests of liver fibrosis? 4. What is the evidence for the timing of the initial testing for fibrosis and intervals for subsequent reassessment of fibrosis? Critical outcomes selected for inclu sion in the GRADE table were hepatitis -related morbidity/progression, need for liver biopsy, and quality of life . Important outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were testing -related adverse events and change in treatment plan (especially a decision to begin antiviral therapy) . Evidence r eview We identified no randomized controlled evidence on the use of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis compared to liver biopsy with respect to clinical outcomes in hepatitis C infection. We identified a poor quality systematic review and meta -analysis of six studies reporting on the relative prognostic value of liver biopsy, FibroTest \u00ae, FIB -4, and APRI for predicting overall survival. All of the tests offered statistically significant prognostic value for over all survival with AUROCs of 0.58 for APRI (95% CI 0.53 to CI to 0.95). The authors did not describe the methodologic rigor of the included studies. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies (for example, in one study of APRI and FIB -4 in HCV patients, 68% of the patients had HIV co -infection). Lastly, the review was authored by the inventor of the FibroTest \u00ae and two employe es of the company that market the test. A more recent study (Verg niol et al., 2014) examined the prognostic value of evolving measurements of liver stiffness. In this study, about 1,025 people with chronic hepatitis C and two recorded measurements of liver stiffness (separated by >1,000 but <1,500 days) recorded between 2004 and 2008 were included. The average age of included patients was 52 years, half were men, the average BMI was 25 kg/m2, and about 12% reported excessive alcohol consumption. During the mean follow -up period of three years (after the second measurement of liver stiffness), 16% of patients achieved sustained virologic response from HCV treatment. Survival data was available for 95% of patients; of those, 35 patients had died and 7 had unde rgone liver transplantation. Twenty -one of the deaths were from liver - related causes. In the univariate analysis, several factors were associated with statistically significantly increased hazard ratios for death: age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06), male s ex (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.43), baseline liver stiffness measurement (HR 4.27, 95% CI 2.94 to 6.22), follow -up liver stiffness measurement (HR 5.47, 95% CI 3.82 to 7.84), and change in liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.25, 95% CI 17 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 1.16 to 1.36). Unusuall y, alcohol abuse appeared to have a protective effect in this study (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97). In the multivariate analysis, baseline liver stiffness measurement (HR 5.76, 95% CI 3.74 to 8.87), change in liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1. 11 to 1.28), and achievement of SVR (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.80) were statistically significant independent predictors of death. Overall, the authors concluded that patients with low -baseline liver stiffness measurements, those who achieve SVR, and those with non -cirrhotic baseline liver stiffness measurements and stable or decreasing measurements at follow -up all have an excellent prognosis. Conversely, patients with cirrhotic baseline liver stiffness measurement or those with advancing significant fibro sis have a poorer prognosis. Cross -sectional data has correlated liver stiffness measurements by TE with the presence of portal hypertension (Kim et al ., 2013), but TE has not been demonstrated in prospective studies to predict clinical outcomes related t o portal hypertension in hepatitis C patients. A prospective cohort study of nearly 900 Japanese patients with HCV investigated the correlation between liver stiffness measurements by TE and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over a mean fol low-up of 3 years (Masuzaki et al., 2009). Compared to a reference value of less than 10 kilopascals (kPa), various cut-offs of liver stiffness were assoc iated with relative risk of HCC ranging from 16 to 45. The remainder of the identified systematic revi ews summarized diagnostic accuracy studies of various tests compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy. Most of these studies report diagnostic performance by way of sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC. A test that perfectly matches the diagnoses assigned by the reference test would have an AUROC of 1. Conventionally, tests with an AUROC of 0.9 to 1 are considered excellent, 0.8 -0.89 are good, 0.7 -0.79 are fair, and below 0.7 are poor, and though widely used, these distinctions are arbitrary. Magneti c Resonance Elastography Singh et al ., 2015 This is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of patient -level data to determine the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) compared to liver biopsy as the reference standard . The use of patient -level data in the meta -analysis allowed them to perform stratified analyses to determine if the diagnostic performance of MRE varied based on sex, obesity, or the etiology of the liver disease, and also allowed the authors to reduce th e risk of spectrum bias and standardize diagnostic cut-offs for various fibrosis stages. The authors included 12 studies that met inclusion criteria and for which they were able to obtain the individual participant data (n=697). Overall, the included studi es were judged to be at low to moderate risk of bias. Three of the studies did not adequately report on blinding procedures, raising the possibility of review bias. Among the included patients, the average age was 55 years old, the majority were males (60 %), and the average BMI was 27. Nearly half of the participants had HCV -related liver disease (47%), with smaller numbers of patients with HBV, NAFLD, ALD, AIH, or other miscellaneous etiologies. The distribution fibrosis level on biopsy and 29.7% F4. The operating characteristics of MRE from the meta -analysis , including both positive and negative likelihood ratios, are reported in Table 2 below . 18 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Table 2: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of MRE Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) Sensitivity Specificity 4.79 0.11 In the subgroup and sensitivity analysis, the diagnostic performance of MRE did not significantly vary based on sex, presence of obesity, or etiology of liver disease. In this review, MRE had a failure rate of about 4%, and this was most commonly due to interference from hepatic iron overload. Overall, the authors concluded that MRE was highly accurate for diagnosing fibrosis and cirrhosis regardless of BMI or the etiology of chronic liver disease. Transient Elastog raphy Steadman et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality, comprehensive technology assessment of transient elastography (TE) for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis in adults with chronic liver disease. Overall, 57 studies reporting diagnostic performance of T E compared with liver biopsy were included. The results were stratified by the etiology of liver disease, and 13 of the included studies were in patients with HCV. The included studies were methodologically rigorous with the authors rating nearly 80% of th em as high quality. The diagnostic operating characteristics of TE (in HCV patients only) from the meta -analysis are reported in Table 3 below . Table 3: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of Transient Elastography Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) (0.92 - 0.96) 0.85 0.91 9.4 0.16 19 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 The authors also performed a basic economic analysis to calculate the incremental cost per correct diagnosis gained by liver biopsy over TE. In the subgroup of patients with HCV, the incremental cost per correct diagnosis using biopsy ranged from $1,861 fo r patients with F2 disease to $3,260 for patients with F3 disease. The authors were careful to note that their economic modeling does not account for the practice of monitoring progression of liver fibrosis and observe that the common practice in Alberta, Canada is yearly TE and biopsy every 3 -5 years. Overall, the authors concluded that TE was an accurate method for diagnosing fibrosis or cirrhosis and was less costly than liver biopsy. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging Nierhoff et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of the diagnostic operating characteristics of ARFI in patients with chronic liver disease using liver biopsy as the reference standard. The authors included 36 studies (both published manuscripts and a bstracts) of nearly 4,000 patients. Among the included studies, 7 examined only patients with HCV as the etiology of their liver disease while another 18 studies reported on populations with mixed etiologies of chronic liver disease, including HCV. The methodologic quality of the included studies was mixed , and about half of the studies had potential flaws related to spectrum bias (bias introduced because the range and distribution of disease severity in the study is not rep resentative of the overall popula tion of people with the condition ) and review bias (bias introduce when the interpreter of the index test is already aware of the result of the reference test, or vice -versa ). The main reported measure of diagnostic performance was AUROC. The results of the meta -analysis of the HCV only and mixed etiology studies are reported in Table 4 below . Table 4: AUROC of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging Tests Fibrosis Stage AUROC - HCV only studies (95% CI) (0.89 - 0.93) One possible explanation for the poorer diagnostic performance in the mixed studies is the finding in subgroup analysis that higher BMI is associated with reduced diagnostic accuracy and a higher failure rate for testing. Overall, the authors concluded that the diagnostic performance of ARFI is good to excellent for detecting fibrosis and cirrhosis. The au thors also note that their findings are consistent with those of an earlier, smaller meta -analysis of ARFI using individual participant data. 20 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Acoustic Radiation Force Elastography ( TE) Bota et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of studies comparing ARFI and TE to a reference standard of liver biopsy for the evaluation of fibrosis. The authors included 13 trials; 10 of the trials reported diagnostic accuracy of ARFI and TE for the diagnosis of s ignificant fibrosis ( F2), and all the trials reported diagnostic accuracy for cirrhosis (F4). The etiology of liver disease in each study was variable, and all but one study included patients with chronic hepatitis C. The authors observed that failure rat es (i.e. inability to obtain any valid measurements) were higher for TE (6.6%) than ARFI (2.1%) , and five of the trials only included patients with valid ARFI and TE. The authors' risk of bias assessment for most studies was low. The results of the meta -analysis are reported in Table 5 below . Table 5: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of ARFI and TE Test and Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) Sensitivity Specificity Positive 0.87 6.79 0.13 Overall, the authors concluded that there were no significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI and TE. They note that while the higher failure rate for TE is concerning, new and more sensitive probes may mitigate this limitation. Blood Tests Dozens of blood tests and related interpretive indices or scores have been proposed for the diagnosis of fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with HCV. The components of these tests are discussed in detail in the technology description section of this report. Chou & Wasson, 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review of blood tests for the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with HCV. The authors did not perform a meta -analysis but present results for measures of diagnostic accuracy as medians and ranges. The number of studies for each test and the authors' GRADE assessment of the strength of evidence are provided in Tab le 6 below . The results of the review of these tests are also summarized in Table 6. Because of the large number of tests as w ell as the various cut-offs used for each test, only the AUROC (median and range) are presented in this table. 21 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Table 6: Studies of Blood Tests for Liver Fibrosis Test Number of studies Strength of evidence Fibrosis (F2) AUROC median (range) Cirrhosis AUROC median (range) 18 0.71 (0.38 - 0.94) 0.89 (0.64 - 0.99) Hyaluronic acid 8 Moderate 0.75 (0.65 - 0.88) 0.90 (0.80 - 0.97) 0.79) 0.86 (0.58 - 0.95) 0.84 (0.54 - 0.97) AST-ALT ratio 32 High 0.59 (0.50 - 0.82) 0.72 (0.52 - 0.91) 0.74 Moderate NR (0.61 - 0.91) Pohl index 12 Low 0.52 (0.52 - 0.53) 0.65 (0.64 - 0.66) The Chou & Wasson review also summarized the results of trials making direct comparisons between APRI or FibroTest \u00ae and various other blood tests. Very few of these direct comparisons showed substantial differences in the median AUROC for fibrosis, but median differences in excess of 0.05 are reported in Table 7 below . Only one of the direct comparisons (APRI vs. AST-ALT ratio) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis exceed a median difference in AUROC of greater than 0.05; in those studies APRI was more accurate than the AST -ALT ratio. 22 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Table 7. Studies of Direct Comparisons between Two Blood Tests Number of studies Test A AUROC median Test B AUROC median Median difference (range) 13 APRI 0.76 AST-ALT ratio 0.58 0.17 0.78 FibroIndex 0.72 0.08 (0.02 to 0.10) The authors also include 9 studies that report on the use of combinations of blood tests or indices. Four studies reported on diagnostic performance of the Sequential Algorithm for Fibrosis Evaluation that combines results from APRI and FibroTest \u00ae. In two studies of patients with fibrosis (F2), the algorithm had an AUROC of 0.90 and 0.94. In 3 studies of cirrhosis, the algorithm had a median AUROC of 0.87. The remaining combinations of tests or indices were only studied in single trials. The authors point out several limitations of the review, the most important of which is the binary interpretation of presence or absence of clin ically significant fibrosis. As they note, \" Measures that incorporate the accuracy of tests at each fibrosis stage would therefore be more informative than estimates based on dichotomized classifications.\" Additionally, because nearly all the included stud ies grouped patients with both lesser stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis, it was not possible to ascertain the diagnostic performance of blood tests for less severe fibrosis independent from the diagnostic accuracy of the full spectrum o f significant fibrosi s, and distinguishing between F2 and F3 is not possible . Overall, the authors conclude that a variety of blood tests are moderately useful for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis in patients with HCV. Shear Wave Elastography Li et al ., 2016 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of real -time shear wave elastography (SWE) for staging liver fibrosis. The authors identified eight studies with a total of 934 patients comparing SWE to a refere nce standard of liver biopsy. Most patients in the included studies had chronic viral hepatitis, but the precise breakdown was not provided. The included studies were general ly at low risk of bias, though three were judged to be susceptible to disease prog ression bias because of the time difference between the two tests. The diagnostic operating characteristics from the meta -analysis are reported in Table 8 below . 23 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Table 8. Diagnostic Operating Characteristics for Shear Wave Elastography Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% 0.88 7.25 0.15 The authors note that the primary limitations of their review include the small number of studies and the inability to perform subgroup analysis by etiology of chronic liver disease. The authors observe that compared with reported diagnostic accuracy of other modalities, SWE is com parable to TE and ARFI for diagnosis of cirrhosis, and comparable to ARFI but better than TE for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis ( F2). Overall, the authors conclude that the diagnostic accuracy of SWE for fibrosis staging is good. Real -Time Tissue E lastog raphy Kobayashi et al ., 2014 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of real -time tissue elastography (RT-TE) compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy. The authors identified 15 trials includi ng over 1,600 patients. Ten of 15 studies included patients with HCV. The authors expressed concerns over the risk of bias in several included studies related to patient selection bias and t he absence of pre -specified cut-off values for the index tests. Th ey also identified possible publication bias in their funnel plots. The meta -analytic results for sensitivity and specificity are reported in Table 9 below . Table 9. Diagnostic Operating Characteristics for Real -Time Tissue Elastography Fibrosis Stage AURO C (95% CI) Positive LR (95% CI) (95% authors conclude that , \"RTE is not highly accurate for any cut -off stage of fibrosis.\" 24 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Direct Comparisons of FibroTest\u00ae, FIB -4, APRI, and TE Houot et al ., 2016 This is a poor -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of trials making direct comparisons between FibroTest \u00ae, APRI, FIB -4, and TE compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy . The authors identified 71 trials, of which 37 included onl y patients with HCV. The main purpose of the review was to determine whether there were differences between the AUROC of these tests for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (defined here as F2) or cirrhosis. The review did not provide information on the me thodologic quality of the included studies. The authors applied three meta -analytic methods to ascertain whether the differences in test performance were statistically significant : an indirect pooled AUROC difference, a standard pooled AUROC difference, an d a Bayesian pooled AUROC difference. Among the HCV -only studies, the differences in AUROC for most comparisons were generally small (<0.05). In the indirect pooled analysis, only one comparison showed a statistically significant difference in favor of TE over APRI for diagnosis of cirrhosis. In the standard pooled analysis FibroTest \u00ae was favored over TE and APRI for diagnosis of fibrosis; TE and FIB -4 were favored over APRI for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. In the Bayesian , FibroTest \u00ae ored over APRI for the diagnosis of fibrosis and TE and FIB -4 were favored over APRI for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. This review is subject to potential conflict of interest as the senior author is the inventor of FibroTest \u00ae and the study was funded in par t by BioPredictive, the company that markets FibroTest \u00ae. Factors Influencing Accuracy of TE Perazzo et al ., 2015 This is a narrative review article that summarizes research on various factors that influence the accuracy and interpretation of transient elas tography. The authors identify four factors that are associated with overestimation of fibrosis by TE: heightened necroinflammatory activity as denoted by alanine transaminases greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, extrahepatic cholestasis and h epatic congestion, non -fasting status, and the presence of severe steatosis. The authors also note that the reliability of TE measurements is modified by operator experience and propose a definition of an experience d operator as greater than 100 examinatio ns. Similarly, large ranges of inter -observer variability are reported in the literature and discrepancies between assessments of adjacent fibrosis stages are more common . The authors suggest that longitudinal follow -up and examination by the same experienced operator may prove most accurate. We did not identify any evidence that addresses the question of initial timing of staging or the appropriate intervals for re -staging using non -invasive tests. The systematic review of TE did observe that the common practice in Alberta, Canada is to perform non -invasive tests to assess fibrosis stage every 3 to 5 years. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Although an imperfect test itself, liver biopsy rem ains the reference standard by which noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are judged. There is no direct comparative evidence that examines the effects of different diagnostic strategies on the predetermined clinical outcome s: 25 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Hepatitis -relate d morbidity/progression Need for liver biopsy Quality of life Testing -related adverse events Change in treatment plan Furthermore, t here is only sparse evidence on the value and reliability of prognostic information obtained from noninvasive tests. However, there are a large number of studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis to the reference standard of liver biopsy. Many of these studies (see Appendix D) demonstrated good or excellent performance of no n-invasive tests for the detectio n of various levels of fibrosis; in general, imaging studies appear to have greater ability to distinguish between intermediate stages of fibrosis (i.e. between F2 and F3), while blood tests appear to be suitable for establ ishing the presence of significant fibrosis ( F2) or cirrhosis (F4) . OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource Allocation The price of noninvasive tests is generally significantly less than liver biopsy and avoids the costs associated with harms from liver biopsy . However, noninvasive testing is likely to be done at a higher frequency than liver biopsy and the increased number of total procedures may somewhat reduce the cost-savings associated with avoiding liver biopsy. The more significant cost driver is the impa ct noninvasive testing may have on determining the eligible population for treatment with hepatitis C. Health plans have prioritized treatment of hepatitis C patients with the newer expensive medications both because of the high cost of these medications a nd the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C infection in the general population. The cutoff point for some plans in Oregon include only treating persons with a score of F3 or above. This requires testing that can accurately distinguish between the cutoff poin ts for treatment. If a test has a high false positive rate, that would lead more people into a hepatitis C treatment pathway (increasing overall costs of the population in the near term). If a test has a high false negative rate, then people with more adva nced fibrosis who may particularly benefit from treatment would not qualify for treatment (decreasing health system costs, but at the expense of fewer eligible people receiving appropriate treatment). Values and preferences Patients would highly value avoiding an invasive procedure as long as the information provided by a noninvasive test was comparable. There would be minimal variability in this preference. From a population perspective, it would be very important that these tests can accurately distinguis h between those persons who would benefit the most from the very expensive treatment versus others who may be able to delay or avoid treatment altogether. 26 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 POLICY LANDSCAPE Quality measures No quality measures were identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse . Payer coverage policies The Oregon Medicaid fee -for-service Approval Criteria for Hepatitis C Direct -Acting Antivirals require s liver fibrosis staging by either >3.25), or clinical evidence (ascites, portal hypertension) of cirrhosis The Washington Health Care Authority outline s the treatment policy for patients with HCV , with the accepted diagnostic tests for liver damage including imaging procedures (FibroS can\u00ae, AR FI, SWE) and blood tests (FibroS ure\u00ae, APRI). The Table 10 below shows the allowed tests and cutoffs used to stage liver fibrosis to determine hepatitis C treatments. Table 10: Washington Health Care Authority Accepted Diagnostic Tests and Procedures to Stage Liver Damage in Patients with Chronic HCV - 2.33 m/s 0.58 - 0.74 1.5 - 1.9 F2 F2 7.1 - 9.5 kPa 1.38 - 2.0 m/s 0.49 - 0.57 F1/0 F1/0 7.0 kPa 1.37 m/s 0.48 0.9 On May 27, 2016, a United States District Court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Washington Medicaid program to cover direct -acting antiviral medications for Medicaid clients with hepatitis C, regardless of the extent of liver fibrosis. Coverage policies for non invasive tests of liver fibrosis were searched for four commercial payers: Aetna is by three of these payers: Aetna, Cigna, and Moda. MRE for staging liver fibrosis is cover ed by only Moda . None of the other imaging tests are covered by these pay ers. Three of the four payers do not cover the blood tests for staging liver fibrosis. Moda Health covers direct -acting antivirals require the staging of liver disease by liver biopsy, METAVIR scores, FibroScan\u00ae score, APRI score, radiologica l imaging consistent with cirrhosis (i.e., evidence of portal hypertension), or physical findings or clinical evidence consistent with cirrhosis as attested by the prescribing physician . The Regence Medical Policy Manual states that, \"Liver biopsy is 27 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 typically recommended prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy .\" Coverage policies for direct -acting antivirals for Cigna and Moda do not indicate specific methods for staging of liver fibrosis . For Medicare, no National Coverage Determinations or Local Coverage Determinations related to noninvasive tests for liver fibrosis were identified. Professional society guidelines American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) Guideline, 2016 The AASLD and IDSA guideline endorses the use of biopsy, imaging, and/or noninvasive markers to evaluate advanced fibrosis in HCV patients for treatment planning and to ascertain whether additional screening and managemen t of cirrhosis is needed (Class I, Level A). It also endorses the continued monitoring of liver disease in those who defer treatment, but does not specify the use of noninvasive tests or provide an optimal interval for re -assessment. Regarding noninvasive tests, the AASLD and IDSA guideline makes the following statements: \"No single method is recognized to have high accuracy alone and each test must be interpreted carefully. A recent publication of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found eviden ce in support of a number of blood tests; however, at best, they are only moderately useful for identifying clinically significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.\" \"Vibration -controlled transient liver elastography is a noninvasive way to measure liver stiffness an d correlates well with measurement of substantial fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. The measurement range does overlap between stages.\" \"The most efficient approach to fibrosis assessment is to combine direct biomarkers and vibration -controlled transient liver elastography. A biopsy should be considered for any patient who has discordant results between the 2 modalities that would affect clinical decision making. For example, one shows cirrhosis and the other does not. The need f or liver biopsy with this approach is markedly reduced.\" \"Alternatively, if direct biomarkers or vibration -controlled transient liver elastography are not available, the AST -to-platelet ratio index (APRI) or FIB -4 index score can help, although neither test is sensitive enough to rule out substantial fibrosis. Biopsy should be considered in those in whom more accurate fibrosis staging would impact treatment decisions. Individuals with clinically evident cirrhosis do not require additional staging (biopsy or noninvasive assessment).\" 28 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver and Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericano para el Estdio del H\u00edgado (ALEH), 2015 This is a comprehensive clinical practice guideline on the use of noninvasive tests for evaluating liver disease across a variety of etiologies. In general, EASL/ALEH endorse the use of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis. Specific recommendations and statements include: \"Non -invasive tests should always be interpreted by specialis ts in liver disease, according to the clinical context, considering the results of other tests (biochemical, radiological and endoscopic) and taking into account the recommended quality criteria for each test and its possible pitfalls (A1) .\" \"TE is a fast, simple, safe and easy to learn procedure that is widely available. Its main limitation is the impossibility of obtaining results in case of ascites or morbid obesity and its limited applicability in case of obesity and limited operator experience (A1) .\" \"TE should be performed by an experienced operator (>100 examinations) following a standardized protocol with the patient, fasting for at least 2 hours, in the supine position, right arm in full abduction, on the midaxillary line with the probe -tip placed in the 9th to 11th intercostal space with a minimum of 10 shots (A1) .\" \"Although alternative techniques, such as pSWE/ARFI or 2D -SWE seem to overcome limitations of TE, their quality criteria for correct interpretation are not yet well defined (A1) .\" \"MR e lastography is currently too costly and time consuming for routine clinical practice use and seems more suited for research purposes (A1) .\" \"When compared in HCV patients, the different patented tests have similar levels of performance in diagnosing signif icant fibrosis and cirrhosis (A1) . Although non -patented tests might have lower diagnostic accuracy than patented tests, they are not associated with additional costs, are easy to calculate, and are widely available (A2) .\" \"Among the different available st rategies, algorithms combining TE and serum biomarkers appear to be the most attractive and validated one (A2) . In patients with viral hepatitis C, when TE and serum biomarkers results are in accordance, the diagnostic accuracy is increased for detecting s ignificant fibrosis but not for cirrhosis. In cases of unexplained discordance, a liver biopsy should be performed if the results would change the patient management (A1) .\" 29 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 The EASL/ALEH guideline includes the following proposed algorithm for noninvasive testing in HCV patients. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2015 NICE issued medical technology guidance on the use of Virtual Touch Quantificatio n (VTq, a proprietary system for performing ARFI) for diagnosing and monitoring liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and C. The panel endorsed the use of VTq as an option for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B or C. They concluded that VTq is as accurate as transient elastography and cost modelling suggested that VTq would lik ely to be cost saving compared to transient elastography and liver biopsy. 30 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), 2013 SIGN published a comprehensive guideline on the management of hepatitis C in 2013 including recommendations regarding the us e of noninvasive tests for diagnosing fibrosis and cirrhosis. The SIGN guideline state s that while biochemical markers may be able to distinguish cirrhosis from less degrees of fibrosis, \"intermediate stages are not distinguishable.\" Thus, SIGN recommends that biochemical markers should not be considered an alternative to biopsy for staging intermediate levels of fibrosis, but may be used in place of biopsy to diagnose cirrhosis (B recommendations, 2++ evidence). The guideline does offer that measurement of liver stiffness by noninvasive testing may be considered a \"recommended best practice based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.\" Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference Statement, 2015 This consensus conference statement (Barr et al., 2015) asserts that elastography (using either ultrasound or magnetic resonance techniques) can be used to diagnose liver fibrosis in patients \"without overt decompensated cirrhosis.\" The panel stated that elastography should be used to group patients into three categories: those with minimal fibrosis (F0 or F1), th ose with a high likelihood of cirrhosis (F4), and those with values in between suggesting moderate to severe fibrosis (F2 and F3). The panel also proposed consensus diagnostic thresholds which are reproduced in Table 11. Table 1 1: Consensus of Suggested Th resholds in Patients with Hepatitis C Device No Clinically Significant Fibrosis: METAVIR Stage < F2, Unlikely to Need Follow -up Advanced Fibrosis and/or Cirrhosis: METAVIR Stage of F4 and Some Stages shear modulus, while U .S. elastography techniques are reported in Young modulus. The Young modulus is three times the shear modulus. World Health Organization, 2014 The WHO released a comprehensive guideline in 2014 focused on management of hepatitis C in resource limited settings. In general, the guideline state s that noninvasive tests should be favored over liver biopsy and \"in resource -limited settings, it is suggested that aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI) or FIB4 be used for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis rather than other noninvasive tests that require more res ources such as elastography or Fibrotest.\" (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence) 31 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 REFERENCES Evidence Sources Bota, H., Sporea, I., Salzl, P., Sirli, R., Neghina, A. - analysis: ARFI elastogr aphy versus transient elastography for the evaluation fibrosis.

GRADE INFORMED FRAMEWORK - ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confide nt that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that th e desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that t he undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating ac ross studies for the treatment/outcome1 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limit ations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recomme ndation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issue about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 35 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 Low : The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low : The su bcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across stu dies. 36 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 APPENDIX B.

METHODS Scope Statement Populations Adults and children with chronic hepatitis C infection Population scoping notes: None Interventions Noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis (e.g., acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, transient elastography, magnetic resonance elastography, biochemical tests with predictive algorithms) Intervention exclusions: None Comparators Liver biopsy, other interventions listed above Outcomes Critical: Hepatitis -related morbidity/progression, need for liver biopsy, quality of life Important : Testing -related adverse events, change in treatment plan (especially d ecision to begin antiviral therapy) Considered but not selected for the GRADE table: None Key Questions 1. What is the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests for the diagnosis and management of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C? 2. Does the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C vary based on: a. Duration of infection b. Fibrosis score c. Body habitus d. Operator/interpreter training or experience e. Co-existence of other etiologies of liver disease (e.g., non -alcoholic steatohepatitis) 3. What are the comparative diagnostic operating characteristics of tests of liver fibrosis? 4. What is the evidence for the timing of the initial testing for fibrosis and intervals for subsequent reassessment of fibrosis? Search Strategy A full search of the core sources was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, technology assess ments, and clinical practice guidelines using terms for each of the studied interventions .
