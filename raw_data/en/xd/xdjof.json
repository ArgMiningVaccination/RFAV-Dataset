Nikhil K. Mull, MD (CEP) Lead analyst: ............................. Matthew D. Mitchell, PhD (CEP) Keywords: COVID -19, vaccine, healthcare workers Summary Mass vaccination is seen as a crucial intervention to control and end the COVID -19 pandemic, especially in the setting of healthcare facilities and congregate residential settings. Safe and effective vaccines against the SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus were introduced in late 2020, but a substantial number of people are refusing to be vaccinated. As a result, there have been proposals to make vaccination mandatory for healthcare workers and other groups of people. Such mandates could be imposed as a matter of law or as a condition of continued employment. The legal status of such mandates has not been tested, and is discussed in several articles cited in this Annotated Bibliography. Other articles discuss ethical iss ues surrounding a vaccine mandate. Relevant articles found in our search include a systematic review of studies on vaccine acceptance and refusal, and a review of strategies to increase acceptance of flu vaccine among healthcare workers. Additional referen ces are provided on interventions to build trust in healthcare institutions and increase public confidence in the benefits of vaccination, including in groups of people where vaccine skepticism or refusal runs high. A CEP Annotated Bibliography is an expe dited search for evidence and a presentation of selected articles intended to address a particular issue for Penn Medicine stakeholders. Searches are systematic but not necessarily comprehensive, and the results must not be taken as definitive. Additiona l studies may exist, including studies whose findings may differ from those cited in this report or identify significant limitations in their clinical applicability. Some citations may be to material supplied by drug or devi ce manufactur - ers, published on line, or in \"grey literature.\" Readers should be aware that such material is not peer -reviewed, and CEP does not assess the methodological quality of studies cited in this report.

Controlling and halting the pandemic is the necessary first step towards global recovery. The first vaccines against the SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus were introduced in late 2020 and they are now in mass production. Clinical trial evid ence has shown that these vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious COVID -19 disease and reducing the overall burden of COVID -19 disease. Vaccination is particularly important for protecting vulnerable people in healthcare facilities and in long-term care and other congregate living settings. Vaccination campaigns are now going on throughout the United States and in most other countries, but a substantial number of people have refused to be vaccinated . Vaccine refusal is particularly high among some ethnic and religious minority groups, placing those communities at continued risk from the virus. Some public health specialists have suggested that to defeat the pandemic, vaccination may need to be made m andatory, either for the entire population or for specific segments such as children, healthcare workers, and persons living or working in congregate living settings. The purpose of this Annotated Bibliography is to identify articles in the peer -reviewed literature that address the feasibility, legal status, and ethics of mandatory vaccination. Previous CEP Reports In December 2020, CEP published an Evidence Review on adverse effects of mRNA vaccines and a Rapid Guidance Summary on SARS -CoV -2 vaccination f or women who are pregnant or lactating (Table 1). These reports may be viewed and downloaded at https://www.uphs.upenn.edu/cep/COVID/indexCOVID.html Table 1. Previous CEP reports on related topics Date Topic Findings Dec. 2020 Adverse effects of mRNA vaccines There is not sufficient evidence to support any conclusions on the comparative safety of different mRNA vaccines. Direct evidence on the comparative safety of mRNA vaccines and other vaccines is lacking . Systemic adverse events such as fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and chills are common ; sev ere systemic events were reported by 5 to 10 percent of trial subjects . Localized adverse events such as pain at the injection side are common. Both systemic and local adverse eve nts usually are resolved within one or two days . Dec. 2020 COVID -19: Vaccination for women who are pregnant or lactating Two major US specialty societies recommend shared decision -making to best balance the risks of vaccination with the risks of remaining unvaccinated. They do not consider pregnancy or breastfeeding to be an absolute contraindication to vaccination. Most U S medical centers that have taken a position on COVID -19 vaccination endorse the US societies' recommendations for shared decision -making and will offer vaccination to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Am J Public Health 2021. https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2020.306166 When the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decided to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) for the first two vaccines for COVID -19, the United States' r esponse to the pandemic entered a new phase. Initially, the greatest challenge is having enough doses of vaccine and administering them to all who want it. Yet even while many wait expectantly for their turn to be vaccinated, a significant minority of Amer icans are hesitant. Lack of information or misinformation about the vaccine, a long -standing and well -entrenched antivaccination movement, distrust of public health officials, and political polarization have left many people ambivalent or opposed to vaccin ation. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation taken in late November and early December 2020, 27% of respondents surveyed stated that they would \"probably\" or \"definitely\" not be willing to be vaccinated.1 Reflecting the sharp partisan divide that has characterized views about the pandemic, Democrats (86%) were far more likely than Republicans (56%) to be vaccinated. 5. Schumacher S, Salmanton -Garcia J, Cornely OA, Mellinghoff SC. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare worker s: a review on campaign strategies and their effect. Infection 2020 Dec 7; 1 -13. https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010 -020-01555 -9 PURPOSE: Increasing influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare worke rs is a challenge. Especially during the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, high vaccination coverage should be attained. This review analyzed strategies to increase influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers., METHODS: A literature search using PubMed was conducted and 32 publications on influenza vaccination campaigns for healthcare workers were reviewed for key interventions and resulting vaccination coverage., RESULTS: Among key interventions analyzed, mandatory vaccination policies or multifaceted ca mpaigns including a vaccinate -or-wear -a-mask policy as well as mandatory declination reached vaccination coverage in healthcare workers of over 90%. Although campaigns solely based on education and promotion or on -site-vaccination did not regularly exceed an absolute vaccination coverage of 40%, a substantial relative increase in vaccination coverage was reached by implementation of these strategies., CONCLUSION: Mandatory vaccination policies are effective measures to achieve high overall vaccination cover age. In clinics where policies are infeasible, multifaceted campaigns comprising on -site vaccination, vaccination stands and educational and promotional campaigns as well as incentives should be implemented. Lessons learned from influenza campaigns could b e implemented in future SARS -CoV -2 vaccination campaigns. 11. Lin C, Tu P, Beitsch LM. Confidence and receptivity for COVID -19 vaccines: a rapid systematic review . Vaccines (Basel) 2020 ;9(1): 16. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010016 While COVID -19 continues raging worldwide, effective vaccines are highly anticipated. However, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Survey results on uptake intentions vary and continue to change. This review compared trends and synthesized findings in vaccination receptivity over time across US and international polls, assessing survey design influences and evaluating context to inform policies and practices. Data sources included academic literature (PubMed, Embase, and P sycINFO following PRISMA guidelines), news and official reports published by 20 October 2020. Two researchers independently screened potential peer -reviewed articles and syndicated polls for eligibility; 126 studies and surveys were selected. Declining vac cine acceptance (from >70% in March to <50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides was observed. Perceived risk, concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness, doctors' recommendations, and inoculation history were common factor s. Impacts of regional infection rates, gender, and personal COVID -19 experience were inconclusive. Unique COVID -19 factors included political party orientation, doubts toward expedited development/approval process, and perceived political interference. Ma ny receptive participants preferred to wait until others have taken the vaccine; mandates could increase resistance. Survey wording and answer options showed influence on responses. To achieve herd immunity, communication campaigns are immediately needed, focusing on transparency and restoring trust in health authorities.

Evidence -based strategies for clinical organizations to address COVID -19 vaccine of vaccination programs is contingent upon irrefutable scientific safety data combined with high rates of public acceptance and population coverage. Vaccine hesitancy, characterized by lack of confidence in vaccination and/or complacency about vaccination that may lead to delay or refusal of vaccination despite the availability of services, threatens to undermine the success of coronavirus disease 201 9 (COVID -19) vaccination programs. The rapid pace of vaccine development, misinformation in popular and social media, the polarized sociopolitical environment, and the inherent complexities of large -scale vaccination efforts may undermine vaccination confi dence and increase complacency about COVID -19 vaccination. Although the experience of recent lethal surges of COVID -19 infections has underscored the value of COVID -19 vaccines, ensuring population uptake of COVID -19 vaccination will require application of multilevel, evidence -based strategies to influence behavior change and address vaccine hesitancy. Recent survey research evaluating public attitudes in the United States toward the COVID -19 vaccine reveals substantial vaccine hesitancy. Building upon effo rts at the policy and community level to ensure population access to COVID -19 vaccination, a strong health care system response is critical to address vaccine hesitancy. Drawing on the evidence base in social, behavioral, communication, and implementation science, we review, summarize, and encourage use of interpersonal, individual -level, and organizational interventions within clinical organizations to address this critical gap and improve population adoption of COVID -19 vaccination. 14. Gur -Arie R, Jamr ozik E, Kingori P. No jab, no job? ethical issues in mandatory COVID -19 vaccination of (HCP) could maximise vaccine uptake, but risks exacerbating breakdowns in trust between HCP and their institutions. Ethical arguments for mandating COVID -19 vaccination of HCP appeal to their duties t o 'do no harm' and to care for patients, but the fulfilment of these duties requires a safe working environment. We argue for policies aimed at strengthening HCP's trust in healthcare systems by addressing HCP concerns, including the institutional factors that have put them at risk of infection throughout the COVID -19 pandemic, before considering a COVID -19 vaccine mandate. 17.

Br J Nurs. 2021 ;30(2):116 -121. https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2021.30.2.116 The COVID -19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the UK, as well as many other countries around the world, affecting all aspects of society. Nurses and other health and care professiona ls are a group particularly exposed to the virus through their work. Evidence suggests that vaccines form the most promising strategy for fighting this pandemic. Should vaccination against be mandatory for nurses and other health professionals? This articl e explores this question using an ethical framework. CEP Annotated Bibliography: Mandatory vaccination \u00a9202 1 Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.
