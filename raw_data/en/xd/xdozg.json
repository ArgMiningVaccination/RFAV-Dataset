You are worthy of that!! What is Kambo? \\ In short... \\ Kambo comes from the venom of the Giant Monkey Frog of the Amazon rainforest. \\ Kambo empowers the immune system, rousing the body's defence systems to their natural functions so that existing health problems are improved or resolved and future ones are less likely to occur. In spiritual terms, Kambo works in a mystical fashion as a light that opens the way, helping us to overcome obstacles and release blockages on an emotional level. It clears our energy field and realigns the chakras enabling us to break negative habits and live and think more naturally. \\ For those of you interested in coming for a Kambo treatment or simply want to know more, here is a link with important information you will need before hand.
