We begin by following the recent etiological perspectives that suggest a natural predisposition of a part of individuals with ASD towards hypersensitivity and the reduced influence of cognitive priors (i.e., event schemas). Following this perspective, these two characteristics should be considered as a sort of phenomenological a priori that, importantly, could predispose people with ASD towards a spiritual experience, not intended in its religious meaning, but as an attribute of consciousness that consists of being aware of and attentive to what is occurring in the present moment. Potential clinical implications are discussed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-07-10", "cleaned_text": "A Neuro-Phenomenological Perspective on the Autism Phenotype epidemiological data attest to the presence of this disorder in 1 out of 54 subjects [ [2](#B2-brainsci-11-00914), [3](#B3-brainsci-11-00914)], effectively freeing ASD from being a rare disease to ascribe it to a condition with high social impact. The etiology of ASD remains unknown to date, although scientific data confirm that the cause is to be found in a complex multifactorial relationship [ [4](#B4-brainsci-11-00914)]. [5](#B5-brainsci-11-00914)], at least two other interrelated peculiarities delineate the autistic phenotype. The first is hypersensitivity [ [6](#B6-brainsci-11-00914)] and the second is the reduced adherence to cognitive priors [ [7](#B7-brainsci-11-00914)]. Both of these characteristics, as we shall see, are those that can allow us to reflect on the relationship between ASD and spirituality [ [8](#B8-brainsci-11-00914), [9](#B9-brainsci-11-00914)]. 2. Hypersensitivity [10](#B10-brainsci-11-00914)] traced the recognized attention to detail exhibited by people with ASD to sensory hypersensitivity. To explain sensory hypersensitivity, Mottron and Burack [ [11](#B11-brainsci-11-00914)] developed the model of enhanced perceptual functioning in persons with ASD to emphasize their superior bottom-up perceptual processing. Studies using questionnaires such as the Sensory Profile have revealed sensory abnormalities in over 90% of people with ASD [ [6](#B6-brainsci-11-00914), [12](#B12-brainsci-11-00914), [13](#B13-brainsci-11-00914)]. Regarding vision, Bertone and Faubert [ [13](#B13-brainsci-11-00914)] showed that individuals with ASD are more accurate on visual discrimination tasks. Regarding the auditory modality, higher discrimination and processing ability has been found in individuals with ASD compared to control groups consisting of individuals without autism [ [14](#B14-brainsci-11-00914), [15](#B15-brainsci-11-00914), [16](#B16-brainsci-11-00914), [17](#B17-brainsci-11-00914)]. In the area al. [ [18](#B18-brainsci-11-00914)] showed hypersensitivity to vibrotactile stimulation at a frequency as low as 200 Hz. Two studies have investigated olfaction in ASD, and unlike the research on the other senses that consistently find hypersensitivity, both of these studies reported deficits in odor identification [ [19](#B19-brainsci-11-00914), [20](#B20-brainsci-11-00914)]. However, viewing the two studies more closely, both required participants to accurately identify the odor from a choice of responses, and therefore this task involved both executive function and memory. Sensory hypersensitivity could result from a difference in processing at various levels that could include hypersensitivity of sensory receptors, dysregulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, or increased speed of neural processing. In this line of research, Belmonte et al. [ [21](#B21-brainsci-11-00914)] have hypothesized that the peculiar sensory hypersensitivity found in people with ASD seems to be due to a neural hyperconnectivity at short distance as opposed to a hypoconnectivity at long distance. [22](#B22-brainsci-11-00914)] showed that the findings from subsequent research have been inconsistent, with a lack of agreement about the nature of any high-frequency disturbances in ASD brains. Based on the application of new techniques using more sophisticated measures of brain synchronization and direction of information flow, and invoking the coupling between high- and low-frequency bands, they propose a framework which could reconcile apparently conflicting findings in this area and would be consistent both with emerging neurocognitive models of ASD and with the heterogeneity of the condition. 3. Reduced Adherence to Cognitive Priors [23](#B23-brainsci-11-00914)], that in people without ASD, knowledge of the world is organized around perceptual gestalts, or rather our brain tends to process an overall meaning rather than perceive the details that contribute to create the whole [ [24](#B24-brainsci-11-00914)]. Frith and Happ\u00e9's [ [23](#B23-brainsci-11-00914)] central coherence deficit hypothesis was the first to suggest that nonsocial symptomatology in ASD could be explained by a perceptual style that privileges details and individual parts. People with ASD have a natural tendency to perceive details rather than the figure as a whole [ [25](#B25-brainsci-11-00914)]. [26](#B26-brainsci-11-00914)]. We tested this hypothesis within the action domain in children with and without ASD using a behavioral paradigm comprising a familiarization and a testing phase. During familiarization, children observed videos depicting a child model performing actions in diverse contexts. Crucially, within this phase, we implicitly biased action-context associations in terms of their probability of co-occurrence. During testing, children observed the same videos but drastically shortened (i.e., reduced amount of kinematics information) and were asked to infer the action unfolding. Since during the testing phase, movement kinematics became ambiguous, we expected children's responses to be biased to contextual priors, thus compensating for perceptual uncertainty. While this probabilistic effect was present in controls, no such modulation was observed in children with ASD, overall suggesting an impairment in using contextual priors when predicting other people's actions in uncertain environments. [24](#B24-brainsci-11-00914)]. Perceptual studies continue to provide evidence for a perceptual style that is detail-based rather than ensemble-based and suggest that in people with ASD, superior perceptual ability in detail discrimination may interfere with the development of other abilities and be influenced by the reduced adherence to cognitive priors. 4. Between Spiritual Dimension and Phenomenological Experience [27](#B27-brainsci-11-00914)]. [28](#B28-brainsci-11-00914)], in the person with ASD, the spiritual experience in the phenomenological sense seems to constitute a biological predisposition, an a priori, rather than a conscious challenge to the obvious. In other words, while for the phenomenologist, the epoch\u00e9, defined by Husserl [ [28](#B28-brainsci-11-00914)] as a total suspension of presuppositions and of the being-already-given-of-the-world (i.e., cognitive priors) and as a fundamental step for reaching the transcendental level [ [29](#B29-brainsci-11-00914)], is neither an intellectual artifice nor a mystical enlightenment but constitutes a methodical and laborious operation, for the person with ASD, the epoch\u00e8, so understood, could be considered as a natural predisposition. Following this hypothesis, some people with ASD could already be predisposed not to have strong and universal constraints in perception, and therefore, they appear less influenced by the being-already-given-of-the-world (i.e., cognitive priors). In this sense, the person with ASD does not need to neutralize the complex of mental habits (i.e., cognitive priors) that in subjects without ASD could represent an interruption of contact towards the spiritual experience in a phenomenological sense. [30](#B30-brainsci-11-00914)]. [27](#B27-brainsci-11-00914)], an important quality of mindful awareness is the promotion of non-judgmental awareness of the self in which activated self-feelings, thoughts, and sensations are not attempted to be changed by the perceiver but are instead observed and accepted (i.e., epoch\u00e8). Mindfulness awareness, and its cultivation through meditation, would operate through erosion of habitual patterns of responding (i.e., cognitive priors) and of the use of evaluative language and thinking; this would promote self-insights and a greater acceptance of one's internal states, including intuitive feelings, potentially leading to the transformation of implicit self-attitudes and perhaps to a better tuning of one's implicit and explicit self-representations. 5. Conclusions [31](#B31-brainsci-11-00914), [32](#B32-brainsci-11-00914), [33](#B33-brainsci-11-00914)]. Rather, the complexity and the extreme variability of ASD have been viewed in light of new etiological perspectives that have highlighted a neurophysiological predisposition for hypersensitivity and reduced influence of cognitive priors/schemas.
