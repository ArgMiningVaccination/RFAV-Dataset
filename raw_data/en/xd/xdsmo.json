New Data Offers Clues ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/why-is-omicron-a-superspreader-new-data-offers-clues/) The omicron variant has been found to infect 70 times faster than the delta or original covid strain -- but causes less severe disease -- in a study from the University of Hong Kong. Why? Researchers observed that the virus takes stronger hold in the airways rather than the lungs. [ NPR: What Makes Omicron Spread So Quickly? A New Study Offers A Tantalizing Clue ](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/12/15/1064597592/a-tantalizing-clue-to-why-omicron-is-spreading-so-quickly) Why is omicron such a superspreading variant? Preliminary data, published online Wednesday, gives us the first look at how omicron may behave inside the respiratory tract \u2014 and the data offers a tantalizing clue as to why this heavily mutated variant is spreading so fast and even outcompeting delta. The omicron variant multiplies about 70 times faster inside human respiratory tract tissue than the delta variant does, scientists at the University of Hong Kong report. The variant reaches also higher levels in the tissue, compared to delta, 48 hours after infection. (Doucleff, 12/15) [ Reuters: Omicron Thrives In Airways, Not Lungs; New Data On Asymptomatic Cases ](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/omicron-thrives-airways-not-lungs-new-data-asymptomatic-cases-2021-12-15/) Major differences in how efficiently Omicron and other variants of the coronavirus multiply may help predict Omicron's effects, researchers said on Wednesday. Compared to the earlier Delta variant, Omicron multiplies itself 70 times more quickly in tissues that line airway passages, which may facilitate person-to-person spread, they said. But in lung tissues, Omicron replicates 10 times more slowly than the original version of the coronavirus, which might contribute to less-severe illness. (Lapid, 12/16) [ Bloomberg: Omicron Infects 70 Times Faster But Is Less Severe, Study Says ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/omicron-infects-70-times-faster-but-is-less-severe-study-says) The omicron variant infects around 70 times faster than delta and the original Covid-19 strain, though the severity of illness is likely to be much lower, according to a University of Hong Kong study that adds weight to the early on-ground observations from South African doctors. The supercharged speed of omicron's spread in the human bronchus was found 24 hours following infection, according to a Wednesday statement from the university. The study, conducted by a team of researchers led by Michael Chan Chi-wai, found that the newest variant of concern replicated less efficiently -- more than 10 times lower -- in the human lung tissue than the original strain which may signal \"lower severity of disease.\" (Kay, 12/15) [ Keeping Up With Omicron Will Be Tough On Labs, Hospitals ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/keeping-up-with-double-surge-will-be-tough-on-labs-hospitals/) The \"double surge\" of omicron and delta infections will stretch the ability of the U.S. health care system to research, test for and treat covid this winter. [ The Boston Globe: Omicron Is Spreading Faster Than Labs' Ability To Track It ](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/15/metro/omicron-is-spreading-faster-than-labs-ability-track-it/) New evidence suggests that the Omicron variant may be charging across New England and the rest of the country at a breakneck pace, threatening to push legions of additional patients into hospitals already overwhelmed with patients sick from the Delta variant, the flu, and other illnesses. Boston on Wednesday reported three new cases in young adults, who had mild symptoms. And researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which does the lion's share of COVID testing in the state, told the Globe they have reported about 15 Omicron cases to Massachusetts and federal public health agencies. But the Baker administration has so far reported only a single Omicron infection in the state, and declined to answer questions from the Globe about cases linked to the new variant.

The White House on Wednesday insisted there was no need for a lockdown because vaccines are widely available and appear to offer protection against the worst consequences of the virus. But even if omicron proves milder on the whole than delta, it may disarm some of the lifesaving tools available and put immune-compromised and elderly people at particular risk as it begins a rapid assault on the United States.

The \"variant of concern\" has been detected in at least 36 states and agency data based on national genomic sequencing analysis showed the omicron variant is estimated to represent around 3% of coronavirus cases in the U.S., including higher estimates in New York and New Jersey.

There is an increase of coronavirus cases, driven by the Delta variant, across the country, and CDC director Rochelle Walensky has said that the number of Omicron cases is \"likely to rise.\" (Gonzalez, 12/15) In other news about the spread of omicron \u2014 [ The Atlantic: What To Do When You Get An Omicron Breakthrough Infection ](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/12/omicron-breakthrough-vaccine-testing/621014/) If only the official guidance were this straightforward. Rebecca Wurtz, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told me that people are perplexed \"partly because, I think, the guidance is confusing.\" The CDC's guidelines are limited: Isolate if you've either tested positive in the past 10 days or are experiencing symptoms, and end your isolation after 10 days only if you've gone 24 hours with no fever (without the use of Tylenol or other anti-fever drugs) and your other symptoms are improving\u2014not counting the loss of taste and smell, which could take a couple of weeks to return. \"They're unclear as they're stated, and they're a little too complicated in any case,\" Wurtz said.

Experts say that Covid will likely lose its \"pandemic\" status sometime in 2022, due largely to rising global vaccination rates and developments of antiviral Covid pills that could become more widespread next year. Instead, the virus will likely become \"endemic,\" eventually fading in severity and folding into the backdrop of regular, everyday life. Various strains of influenza have followed a similar pattern over the past century or more, from the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 to the swine flu pandemic in 2009.

[ CNN: Flu And Covid-19 Cases Rising In Much Of The US ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/15/health/flu-covid-increase-cdc/index.html) US health officials are bracing for a trio of public health concerns this winter: more infections from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, surging infections with the Delta variant, and a \"slow but steady\" comeback of the flu. There is growing concern that a rise in Omicron cases, paired with climbing Delta cases and an increase in flu cases, could overwhelm health systems this winter, as well as possibly leading to a need to ramp up Covid-19 testing capacities, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), told CNN on Wednesday. (Howard, 12/15) [ Philadelphia Inquirer: Flu Cases In Pennsylvania And New Jersey Are Also Rising ](https://www.inquirer.com/health/flu-high-pennsylvania-new-jersey-covid-testing-20211215.html) Omicron and delta may be hogging the headlines, but flu is spreading, too, raising the possibility that the \"twindemic\" of flu and COVID-19 that public health leaders wrongly predicted last year might actually happen this year. In its latest weekly report on flu, the Pennsylvania Department of Health characterized flu activity during the week ending Dec. 11 as high and increasing. A total of 8,583 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases have been reported so far in all but two of the state's 67 counties. That includes 2,466 cases in Philadelphia and the four suburban counties. It is surely an underestimate, the state said, because most people with flu do not see a doctor or seek testing.

But in the reproductive lives of women (and transgender and nonbinary people who can become pregnant) across America, abortion is not uncommon. The latest estimate, from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights, found that 25 percent of women will have an abortion by the end of their childbearing years.

[ AP: UK COVID Cases Hit Record; Top Doctor Warns Of Worse To Come ](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-europe-london-boris-johnson-c0cc2eda79f94bde2762d946744285fa) The U.K. recorded the highest number of confirmed new COVID-19 infections Wednesday since the pandemic began, and England's chief medical officer warned the situation is likely to get worse as the omicron variant drives a new wave of illness during the Christmas holidays. Professor Chris Whitty described the current situation as two epidemics in one \u2014 with omicron infections rising rapidly even as the country continues to grapple with the older delta variant, which is still causing a large number of infections. Public health officials expect omicron to become the dominant variant across the U.K. within days. Omicron already accounts for a majority of cases in London.

The study, which will include about 14,000 volunteers, will serve a dual purpose by also evaluating its effectiveness against the omicron coronavirus variant, according to a joint statement from the Covid-19 Prevention Network and the South African Medical Research Council. It \"is the first to specifically evaluate the efficacy of a Covid-19 vaccine in people living with HIV, including those with poorly controlled infections,\" the groups said. \"In addition to examining the efficacy of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines in people living with HIV, the study investigators seek to identify the optimal regimen for this population.\" (Sguazzin, 12/15) [ AP: Beijing Olympic Athletes And Their Garbage Face Restrictions ](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-winter-olympics-sports-health-beijing-d66fcf3d006a4012afd798b5660443ff) Beijing Winter Olympics organizers say measures to prevent cross-infections between athletes and the outside world are being extended to holding their garbage inside the bubble dividing the two. Officials said on Thursday that a team of special workers will be deployed to collect and transfer garbage inside the bubble to prevent the risk of coronavirus leaking out into the outside world.

So have supplies of dozens of essential drugs. The staff, unpaid for months, still shows up for work, but they are struggling to make ends meet at home. This is the plight at the Afghan-Japan Hospital for communicable diseases, the only COVID-19 facility for the more than 4 million people who live in the capital of Kabul. While the coronavirus situation in Afghanistan appears to have improved from a few months ago when cases reached their peak, it is now the hospital itself that needs life support.

[ ScienceDaily: Experimental MRNA HIV Vaccine Safe, Shows Promise In Animals ](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/12/211209124236.htm) An experimental HIV vaccine based on mRNA -- the same platform technology used in two highly effective COVID-19 vaccines -- shows promise in mice and non-human primates, according to scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Their results, published in Nature Medicine, show that the novel vaccine was safe and prompted desired antibody and cellular immune responses against an HIV-like virus. Rhesus macaques receiving a priming vaccine followed by multiple booster inoculations had a 79% lower per-exposure risk of infection by simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) compared to unvaccinated animals. The research was led by Paolo Lusso, M.D., Ph.D., of NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation, in collaboration with other NIAID scientists, investigators from Moderna, Inc. and colleagues at other institutions.

The study is published in Pediatrics. Short hospital stay was defined as one or two nights for vaginal births and three or fewer for cesarean births. Infant rehospitalization within 1 week of discharge was also compared from the pandemic period (Mar 1 to Aug 31, 2020) to prepandemic periods (Mar 1 to Aug 31 in 2017, 2018, 2019).

Emerging data from clinical trials and observational research support the benefits and safety of blood pressure treatment during pregnancy. Continued investigation is critical to determine which blood pressure levels, during- and post-pregnancy, both for starting therapy and as treatment goals, are beneficial for the mother and safe and beneficial for the fetus.

If you haven't experienced it, you might not know the contours of this purgatory, but I can tell you what it's like. Almost exactly seven years ago, the face of my obstetrician fell while performing an ultrasound for a very wanted pregnancy, and our collective mood shifted in an instant from buoyant to somber.

Our provider inboxes are full of messages from families (and patients) requesting resources after calling multiple therapists and finding that, at best, they can be added to a waiting list, but more frequently that none have openings for new clients. Professionals with expertise in caring for the psychological needs of children and adolescents are in high demand with extremely limited supply. Pediatric providers like me are desperate to help but have too few tools in our toolbox. (Yolanda Evans, 12/13) [ The Star Tribune: Mental Health Teams Roll In Minneapolis ](https://www.startribune.com/mental-health-teams-roll-in-minneapolis/600127472/) Minneapolis has finally launched a long-awaited program to help citizens experiencing mental health crises. Beginning this week, the city can send unarmed mental health professionals instead of police officers to certain kinds of calls. Creating this service is an important step toward moving some responsibilities out of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) so that sworn officers can focus more on violent crime, investigations and building relationships with the community. The essential change can prevent injuries and save lives.

Some of these things have been potentially harmful, including hydroxychloroquine, which he once touted would be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of COVID. This assertion has been thoroughly debunked. He's built a tremendous following around his lucrative but evidence-free advice. So, are we surprised that Oz is running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania? No, we are not. Misinformation-spouting celebrities seem to be a GOP favorite. This move is very on brand for both Oz and the Republican party.

Big questions related to the role of companies or government in providing for the health of the public have gotten short shrift. (Fred D.

Just check the lengthening lines that have formed again as people scramble to get vaccinations and booster shots. Don't be dismayed if you can't get a vaccine right away. That hassle actually is a good sign for the region. The omicron variant appears far more contagious than earlier COVID-19 strains. Within days of the state Department of Health's Dec. 4 announcement omicron had been discovered locally, the University of Washington's virology team reported it comprised 13% of COVID-19 case samples collected Dec. 8. The same day those samples were collected, Pfizer was offering the world a good-news update that \"booster\" third doses of its vaccine successfully inhibit omicron.
