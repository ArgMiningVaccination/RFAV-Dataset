We previously demonstrated that HLA-A2-restricted epitopes derived from AFP are immunogenic in vitro and in vivo despite high circulating levels of this oncofetal antigen. In order to test a more broadly applicable, HLA-unrestricted, inexpensive, cell-free vaccine platform capable of activating tumor antigen-specific CD8+and CD4+T cells, we tested full length AFP in a plasmid DNA construct in combination with an AFP-expressing replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) in a prime-boost vaccine strategy. Methods: HCC patients who had an AFP+tumor and previous treatment for HCC were screened and two patients received vaccination with three plasmid DNA injections followed by a single AdV injection, all delivered intramuscularly (i.m.). Results: The vaccine was well tolerated and safe. Both patients showed immunologic evidence of immunization. The first patient had a weak AFP-specific T cell response, a strong AdV-specific cellular response and recurred with an AFP-expressing HCC at nine months. The second patient developed a strong AFP-specific CD8+and CD4+ cellular response and an AdV neutralizing antibody response, and recurred at 18 months without an increase in serum AFP. Conclusions: The AFP DNA prime-AdV boost vaccine was safe and immunogenic. Circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies at baseline did not prohibit the development of AFP-specific cellular immunity. The patient who developed CD8+and CD4+AFP-specific T cell immunity had more favorable progression-free survival. The observations with these two patients support development of this vaccine strategy in a larger clinical trial. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00093548 Keywords: Alpha Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with an incidence of over 600,000 new cases per year. While the majority of cases are primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Asia, it is also the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death of males in the United States (US) [1]. Within the past 30 years, the incidence and mortality rates for HCC havetripled in the US [2]. The primary risk factors for devel- oping HCC are cirrhosis (independent of its etiology), and chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the US, it is estimated that 47% of HCC cases are attributed to chronic HCV with an additional 15% to HBV [3]. HBV infection is endemic in South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is a global pandemic of HCV infection. Chronic HCV infection likely accounts for the increased incidence of HCC in several Western countries, where incidence has risen to 5-20/100,000 (Spain, Italy and Greece), and to 1 - 3.6/100,000 (the UK, Canada and the US) [1]. Diabetes and obesity are also risk factors, hence HCC is expected to* Correspondence: butterfieldl@upmc.edu 1University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, 5117 Centre Avenue, PA, Pittsburgh 15213, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2014 Butterfield et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Once diagnosed, HCC has a dismal prognosis. Small, lo- calized tumors are potentially curable with surgery (resec- tion and liver transplantation), however, less than 20% of HCC patients are eligible for these procedures becausemost patients have advanced disease at diagnosis or have liver dysfunction limiting aggressive treatment [5]. Local- regional therapy is largely palliative and includes (RFA), microwave ablation, ethanol injection and transarterial embolization (TAE). TAE relies largely on obstruction of the hepatic arterybranches to the tumor in order to induce subsequent tumor necrosis. HCC is resistant to chemotherapy and other systemic treatment approaches. The multi-targetedtyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, which improves sur- vival by 2.3-2.8 months, is the only systemic agent found to increase survival in patients with advanced HCC and iscurrently the standard of care [6,7]. A number of other molecularly targeted approaches, all of which target sig- naling pathways activated in HCC, are under investigation[7]. However, the drug-metabolizing properties of the liver, in addition to elevated levels of multi-drug resistance pro- teins expressed by HCC cells, likely contributes to the lim-ited efficacy of chemotherapeutics and small molecule drugs in the treatment of HCC [8]. Overall, however, the median survival for patients with advanced stage, unre-sectable HCC is less than one year [5]. Immunotherapy represents an attractive alternative to these traditional therapies based on the sensitivity andspecificity of the immune system. While HCC is not generally considered an \"immunogenic \"tumor, patients whose tumors contain lymphocytic infiltrates show lon-ger survival and lower risk of recurrence [9]. AFP is an oncofetal antigen and the most abundant serum protein in the fetus [10]. At birth, levels drop to 30 -100 mg/ml and the adult level of AFP is 1 -3 ng/ml. Forty to 80% of HCC express AFP, and serum assays play an important role in diagnosis and monitoring responses to treatment.Levels >20 ng/ml are generally considered abnormal, and >200 ng/ml are specific for HCC in patients with cirrhosis [5]. The normal biologic function of AFP is still unknown. It has been hypothesized to play a role in the transport of serum components, including fatty acids,steroids, and heavy metals [11]. There have also been re- ports of an immune suppressive role of AFP [12]. Studies in HCC patients indicate that circulating AFP- specific T cells can be activated ex vivo and can recognize tumor despite high circulating serum levels of this antigen [13-17]. Polyclonal AFP-specific T cells canalso be detected in the livers of chronically infected HCV +and HCC patients [18]. Furthermore, elimination of AFP-specific T cells in HCC pa-tients [19]. Importantly, AFP expression in HCC tumorcells is associated with increased tumor proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and it is expressed in CD45 CD90+ putative HCC cancer stem cells, supporting its targeting as a biologically relevant tumor-associated antigen [20]. Two clinical trials have been conducted testing MHC class I-restricted peptides derived from AFP either emulsi-fied in [14] or pulsed onto autologous DC demonstrated that AFP peptide epitopes were immunogenic in vivo IFN -producing antigen-specific CD8 +T cells in patients with very high serum levels of AFP. In the second trial, 10 patients (with stage III-IV disease) wereimmunized and 6 showed AFP-specific T cell increases by MHC tetramer, and 6 had increased frequency of IFN- - producing, AFP-specific T cells by ELISPOT [15,21], againdemonstrating immunological activity of AFP-based vaccine. Two peptide/DC vaccinated patients experi- enced transient decreases in serum AFP. In order to provide cognate CD4 +Tc e l lh e l pt os u p p o r t CTL activity, in addition to direct activation of multiple epitope-specific CD8+Tc e l l s[ 2 2 , 2 3 ] ,a n dt oe l i m i n a t e HLA-restriction requirements, we previously tested a full length AFP strategy in a murine model. Murine AFP- encoding model [13]. This strategy was immuno- genic, and had strong antitumor activity. Based on thismodel, and other promising data on heterologous prime- boost strategies [24], we cloned human AFP into a simple plasmid backbone (pVAX1), and created a human AFP-expressing AdV [25]. These AFP constructs, in addition to a plasmid encoding human GM-CSF, were prepared to good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade (NCI RAIDProject #176), and tested in two patients with previously treated AFP-expressing HCC. Here we present the clinical and immunologic outcomes of these patients receiving theAFP DNA-prime-AdV boost vaccine. Materials and methods Patients Enrollment inclusion criteria included patients 18 yearsand older, with a history of AFP +HCC, stage II-IVa, after locoregional therapy status 70%, and conserved liver function (Child-Pugh class A or B). Exclusion criteria included acute infection (other than HBV or HCV), HIV infection, organ allografts, or chemotherapy or steroidtherapy in the last 30 days. The first patients screened were excluded for: lack of HLA-A2 positivity (the first screened patient; a criterionlater eliminated), very high levels of circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies (patients 2 and 3), early progression (patients 2 and 4), or other non-HCC-related conditions.Butterfield et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:86 Page 2 of 9 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/86Patient 7, the first vaccinated, was male, 80 years, Caucasian, HBV/HCV, with stage II HCC and was vaccinated between 11/2010-2/2011. Patient 8, the sec-ond vaccinated, was female, 81 years, Caucasian, was stage II HCC with cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was vacci- nated between 12/2010-3/2011. Further clinical detailsare presented in the Results. Vaccines The vials of plasmid DNA (pAFP and pGM-CSF) and the AdV (AdVhAFP) were prepared to GMP by the NCI BRB RAID program (Stephen Creekmore, Chief), and under-went stability testing at months 3, 6, 12 and then annually at the SAIC Frederick, Inc. Vials were stored at 80\u00b0C in a temperature controlled and monitored freezer in the Uni-versity of Pittsburgh Immunologic Monitoring and Cellu- lar Products Laboratory (IMCPL). For each vaccination, vials were transported to the clinic on wet ice, thawed,and drawn into syringes for intramuscular deltoid injec- tions. Before vaccination, patients received 650 mg acet- aminophen and 50 mg diphenhydramine. For each of thethree monthly plasmid injections, 2.5 mg of pAFP and 2.5 mg of pGM-CSF were mixed together in the syringes before injection. For the dose of 10 9pfu of AdVhAFP , the virus was diluted in sterile saline in the IMCPL before pre- paring the syringe for injection. Clinical assessments All patients were presented at a weekly multi-disciplinary Liver Tumor Board at the University of Pittsburgh Med-ical Center and deemed eligible for the clinical trial. All patients consented to participate in the AFP vaccine trial which was IRB-approved by the University of PittsburghMedical Center. Patients underwent routine history and physical examination, laboratory work, and serum AFP level. Radiologic evaluation consisted of triphasic abdom-inal CT scan or liver MRI with contrast. Serial imaging was done every 3 -4 months after treatment. HCC recur- rence was documented by rise in AFP level and CT/MRIimaging showing a recurrent tumor meeting HCC criteria. Blood processing Blood samples were transported to the IMCPL on the dateof draw immediately were processed according to labora- tory SOPs. Serum was isolated from red top vacutainers (BD) by centrifugation after clot formation and frozen inaliquots at 80\u00b0C. After removal of whole blood for fresh flow cytometry, PBMC were isolated from the green top vacutainer tubes containing heparin via Ficoll gradi-ents, and PBMC were cryopreserved in aliquots and stored in liquid nitrogen vapor. Viability was 92-98% upon thaw.Immunologic monitoring To determine the immune status of the patients and theeffects of vaccination, peripheral blood was tested as fol-lows in the IMCPL. All procedures followed SOPs and included healthy donor (HD) controls. Adenovirus ELISA F16 Maxisorp Nunc Immuno plates were blocked coated with AdVLacZ at 4 108pfu/ml for 18-24 hours at 4 C. Sera were thawed, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at RT, washed 4 times, developed with rabbit anti-goatIgG-peroxidase, and read on a Dynex MRX plate reader. Negative control was HD serum with known low anti- AdV antibody levels, the positive control was HD serumwith known high levels of anti-AdV antibodies, and the standard was goat anti-human AdV antibody. Adenovirus neutralizing antibody flow cytometry serial dilutions of serum (1:4 to 1:512) cultured with an in-dicator line, A549 (ATCC), followed by transduction with an enhanced Green Flourescent Pro- tein (AdVeGFP), as described [26]. The cells were testedfor the MFI of eGFP by flow cytometry. Controls included no AdVeGFP and no serum (positive). IFNELISPOT The IFN ELISPOT assay to detect AFP and AdV- specific T cell responses was standardized with PBMCfrom three HD. Responder T cell subsets were purified before plating (CD8 +, CD4+, Miltenyi Biotec). There were no detectable baseline AFP-specific CD8+or CD4+ T cells, and 1 of 3 HD had detectable AdV-specific CD8+ T cells, while 2 of 3 HD had AdV-specific CD4+T cells. Backgrounds were 0, and PMA/ionomycin positive con-trols >1,000 spots/10 5CD8+or CD4+Tc s . Multi-screen HA plates (Millipore, MAHAS4510) were coated with 4 ug/mL of Ab anti-human IFN (1-D1K, MabTech), in PBS over- night at 4\u00b0C. After blocking the plates with RPMI/10% AB (1 h, 4\u00b0C), CD8+or CD4+T cells were plated at 105 cells/well triplicate wells. Autologous DC (0.5-1 \u00d7 105well) were pulsed with peptides (AFP 158,A F P 137,A F P 325,A F P 542(University of Pittsburgh Peptide Synthesis Facility)) loaded with protein (cord blood-derived AFP) or transduced with AdV, rinsed and plated. Control wells contained T cells (alone or with1 ng/mL PMA + 1 M ionomycin), and T cells with unloaded DC. Cells were removed and captured cytokine was detected by corresponding biotinylated mAb(MabTech) at 2 PBS/0.5% BSA. After washing, Avidin Peroxidase Complex (Vectastain Elite Kit) was added for 60 min. After rinsing, peroxidase staining wasButterfield et al.

Spot numbers were automatically determined with Immuno-Spot imaging system from Cellular Technology, Ltd (Immunospot analyzer software version 5.0). To calculate the number of responding T cells, the mean number ofspots detected with DC alone were subtracted from mean spot numbers induced by antigen-loaded DC. A \"positive \" response was considered 2x over baseline. Serum luminex Sera were thawed assay (30-plex, Invitrogen) MIG, any potential cross-reactivity by the manu- facturer. Controls included the kit standard curve and Multiplex QC standards (R&D Systems). Flow cytometry Whole blood was utilized for flow cytometry to deter-mine the frequencies and phenotype of T cells, NK cells, NK/T cells, Treg and MDSC. Blood was processed and stained automatically per manufacturer 's instructions on a TQ-PrepPlus2 (Beckman Coulter), cytometer using CXP v2.1 (Beckman Coulter) software. Results Patients At baseline, patient 7 was free of active disease (CT scan), had normal AFP (1 ng/ml), Karnofsky perform- ance status of 100%, was and had undetectable levels of anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies. At baseline, patient 8 was free active disease but positive for cirrhosis, had normal AFP (5 ng/ml),had Karnofsky performance status 80%, was Child-Pugh A, HLA-A2 +, and had intermediate detectable levels of anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies which were in the ac-ceptable range for trial enrollment. Clinical cases and outcomes Vaccinated patients had no clinically significant adverse events. Patient 7 is an 83 year old male who underwent laparoscopic partial right hepatic lobectomy for HCC on1/18/07. His background liver was normal, and path- ology confirmed a 4.5 cm moderate to poorly differenti- ated HCC with negative margins. His pre-operativeserum AFP level was 2,168 ng/ml, and it normalized to < 2 ng/ml post-resection. He developed a 2 cm HCC recurrence in his liver and underwent laparoscopic ra-diofrequency ablation (RFA) on 2/19/10 which was 37 months after his initial HCC surgical resection. Liver biopsy at that time confirmed well-differentiated HCCjust prior to the RFA. His AFP increased to 14 ng/ml at the time of recurrence, and normalized to 1 ng/ml post- RFA. He received his first AFP vaccine injection on 11/17/10 which was 46 months after his initial liver resec- tion and 9 months after his RFA. He recurred on 8/11/ 11 when liver MRI showed a new enhancing liver tumor.This was 56 months after his initial liver resection, 19 months after his RFA, and 9 months after his first AFP vaccine injection. His AFP level was in the normalrange at 5 ng/ml on 7/25/11. He was started on Sorafenib therapy. His AFP remained in the normal range until 6/7/ 12 when his serum AFP level increased to 98 ng/ml. Itpeaked at 508 ng/ml on 11/12/12, and he was treated with yttrium 90Theraspheres on 11/12/2012. His AFP normal- ized to 2.5 5/7/13, and remained normal at1.9 ng/ml on 8/20/13. He is still alive as of 10-10-13. Patient 8 is an 84 year old female who underwent lap- aroscopic partial right hepatic lobectomy for HCC on11/6/09. Her background liver was grossly cirrhotic, and surgical pathology of the resected tumor confirmed a 2 cm moderately differentiated HCC with negative mar-gins. Her pre-operative serum AFP level was 61 ng/ml, and it normalized to 4 ng/ml post-resection. She re- ceived her first AFP injection on 12/22/10. She hadHCC recurrence in her liver documented by CT scan on 6/6/12 which was 31 months after her liver resection, and 18 months after the first AFP vaccine injection. HerAFP level remained in the normal range. She was treated with a brief course of Sorafenib, followed by observation. Her AFP increased to 13 ng/ml on 9/25/13. She is stillalive as of 10-10-13, which is 47 months from her resec- tion, and 34 months after the first AFP vaccine injection. Cellular immune responses to AdV and AFP detected CD8+and CD4+T cell responses to the AFP antigen and AdV vector were tested by direct IFN ELISPOT at every time point, and assays were batched to reduce assay variability. HD did not have detectable IFN -producing AFP-specific T cells, and 2 of 3 of HD had detectableAdV-specific T cells (>10 spots/10 5cells) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Patient 7 had AFP-specific CD4+Tc e l l sa t baseline, but no AFP-specific CD8+T cells (Figure 1A). The AFP-specific CD4+T cell frequency fluctuated through the vaccination period, and declined during fol- low up (d168) but did not increase with vaccination. Alow frequency of AFP-specific CD8 +T cells were only de- tected at d168. A very low frequency response to the HLA-A2-restricted AFP 325peptide was detected after theButterfield et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:86 Page 4 of 9 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/86first and third pAFP injections, and responses to other characterized AFP epitopes were not detected (notshown). Overall, the AFP-specific immune response to vaccination was very weak in patient 7. Patient 7 also had detectable baseline CD4 +T cells spe- cific to AdV, at almost 2/103T cell frequency. These levels were maintained through the plasmid DNA injections, but increased after the AdV boost. A strong induction ofAdV-specific CD8 +T cells was detected at d140 data indicate that the intramuscularly-delivered (i.m.) AdVhAFP was immunogenic and capable of broadlyactivating a polyclonal T cell response to AdV antigens. Patient 8 had a very different cellular response to the vaccination regimen (Figure 1B). Her AFP-specific CD8 + and CD4+T cell response predominated, and her min- imal baseline AdV-specific response decreased and was not increased with the AdVhAFP boost. Her AFP-specific CD4 +T cell response was low at baseline, but strongly increased after the third pAFP injection, and remained above baseline through d168. The AFP-specific CD8 +T cells were minimally induced by the first two pAFP injections, but highly positive after the AdVhAFP boost, and still high at d168. Responses to in-dividual HLA-A2-restricted AFP peptides were not de- tected (data not shown). These data demonstrate thatthe prime-boost regimen could induce high frequencies of circulating AFP-specific T cells, even with a relativelylow dose of 10 9AdVhAFP viral particles. These different cellular responses may have been im- pacted by the levels of circulating anti-AdV neutralizingantibodies in each patient, which might influence the ability to respond to the i.m. injected AdVhAFP boost. Therefore, we examined both anti-AdV neutralizingantibodies and total AdV-specific antibodies in each patient. Humoral immune responses to AdV were detected Patients were initially screened for trial eligibility to ex- clude those with very high levels of circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies. Ten HD were tested to standardize the assay, and to identify the range of antibodies likelyto be detected (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Most donors had detectable antibodies, 1 of 10 had high levels (pink squares). Interestingly, patient 7 did not have detectable anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies (Figure 2A), and there was no in- duction of an antibody response after AdVhAFP injection.In contrast, patient 8 did have a detectable level of neu- tralizing antibodies (Figure 2B). The level was stable through pAFP injections, was boosted after the AdVhAFP050100150200250 baseline cell responses to AFP and AdV. Patient PBMC from all time points were thawed and batch tested by direct IFN ELISPOT for recognition of autologous DC alone (background), DC transduced with AdVLacZ (for AdV responses) or co-cultured with AFP protein. Responses were also tested to HLA-A2 restricted peptides pulsed onto T2 cells (not shown). The spot counts after background (T cells + DC alone) per 105T cells is shown. A: Patient 7 responses are shown. Thin arrows indicate blood draws one month after each plasmid DNA injection and the thick arrow shows the blood draw one month after the AdV boostb.

Journal of Translational Medicine 2014, 12:86 Page 5 of 9 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/1/86injection, and then stably higher through d168. These data suggest that the lack of anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies in patient 7 does not explain the limited activation ofAFP-specific T cells, and that a higher level of anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies in no way inhibited development of an AFP-specific cellular response in patient 8. Total AdV-specific antibodies were also tested by ELISA. Patients 7 and 8 had levels that were in a similar range with other screened HCC patients and HD (Figure 3). Pa-tient 7 had lower levels and patient 8 had higher levels(similar to their relative neutralizing antibody levels, Figure 2). These total AdV antibodies were not detectably modulated Fresh flow cytometry was performed at each time pointto detect changes in activated T cells and NK cells, as well as frequencies of suppressive cells MDSC and Treg.

Differences in several cellular subsets were detected, however it is impossibleto draw firm conclusions from the two different patients (Additional file 3: Figure S 3). Of note, patient 8 did have a lower frequenc y of monocytic CD11b +/CD33+ MDSC, and higher frequencies of activated NK cells (CD56+/CD69+), which could be examined in future trials to determine whether these subsets are potentialimmune biomarkers. Serum cytokines, chemokines and growth factors tested for a variety of cytokines, chemo- kines serum biomarkers of response Patient 8had 7. Patient 8 also had agreater increase in IL-15 than patient 7. There were de- tectable but at very low levels that did not change with vaccination. IL-12p40/p70, IL-1RA and IL-2R were de-tected at somewhat higher levels, but also showed no change with vaccination. These data serve to suggest specific analytes which may be worthwhile to examine ina larger trial. Discussion In this report, we present data on two previously treated HCC patients receiving a novel DNA prime-AdV boost vaccine to promote an AFP-specific cellular response.Both patients were at a similar advanced age, and were stage II HCC patients with AFP-positive tumors which were previously treated. There were no treatment-related toxicities observed. The dose of AdVhAFP boostthat they received, 10 9particles, was proposed as the low dose cohort level. This dose appeared to serve as a boost for both AFP-specific and AdV-specific T cell re-sponses. It also boosted the level of circulating anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies in one patient. It was not a suffi- cient dose to promote detectable anti-AdV neutralizingantibodies in the other patient. It is possible that 10 10or 1011AdVhAFP particles would be a stronger boost, bet- ter able to promote antitumor immunity (and antiviralantibody responses) than the 10 9dose. Importantly, the presence of anti-AdV neutralizing antibodies at baseline, and boosting the antibody levelby AdV injection, did not negatively impact AFP-specific T cell responses, as seen in patient 8. This finding im- plies that it might be possible to give additional boostsof AdVhAFP to further increase T cell responses, be- cause a single injection may not result in detectable neu- tralizing antibody titers (patient 7), or may result in aneutralizing antibody titer that does not block down- stream T cell activation and expansion. Both patients were successfully vaccinated, but patient 7 expanded only AdV-specific T cells and recurred earl- ier with an AFP-positive tumor. Patient 8 expanded AFP-specific T cells and anti-AdV antibodies, but hadminimal AdV-specific T cells and recurred at a later time, with an AFP-negative tumor. These data suggest that activation of an AFP-specific, type 1 T cell responsemay have therapeutic potential and should be examined in a larger trial. The additional immunologic assess- ments presented also shed light on possible mechanismsof the different outcomes of the patients. Patient 8 had fewer CD11b +/CD33+MDSC and more activated CD56+ NK cells at baseline, and also had a more favorable type 1 cytokine/chemokine/growth factor milieu in her serum. These observations suggest assessments that should be included in future studies of this vaccineregimen. 110100100010000 BASELINE DAY 1 postDNA1 postDNA2 postDNA3 postAdV DAY 168 BASELINE DAY 4 Multiplex serum cytokine, chemokine and growth factor assessment.
