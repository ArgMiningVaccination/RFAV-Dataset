Due to a growing body of research on side effects and long-term impacts of conventional CVD treatments, focus is shifting towards exploring alternative treatment approaches such as Ayurveda. However, because of a lack of strong scientific evidence, the safety and efficacy profiles of such interventions have not been well established. The current study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses to explore the strength of evidence on efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia. Methods: Literature searches were conducted using databases including Medline, Cochrane Database, AMED, Embase, AYUSH research portal, and many others. All randomized controlled trials on individuals with hypercholesterolemia using Ayurvedic herbs (alone or in combination) with an exposure period of  3 weeks were included, with primary outcomes being total cholesterol levels, adverse events, and other cardiovascular events. The search strategy was determined with the help of the Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group. Two researchers assessed the risk of each study individually and discrepancies were resolved by consensus or consultation with a third researcher. Meta-analysis was conducted using the inverse variance method and results are presented as forest plots and data summary tables using Revman v5.3. Results: A systematic review of 32 studies with 1386 participants found randomized controlled trials of three Ayurvedic herbs, Allium sativum (garlic), Commiphora mukul (guggulu), and Nigella sativa (black cumin) on hypercholesterolemia that met inclusion criteria. The average duration of intervention was 12 weeks. Meta-analysis of the trials showed that guggulu reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels by 16.78 mg/dL (95% C.I. 13.96 to 2.61; p-value = 0.02) and 18.78 mg/dL (95% C.I. 34.07 to 3.48; p = 0.02), respectively. Garlic reduced LDL-C by 10.37 mg/dL (95% C.I. 17.58 to 3.16; p-value = 0.005). Black cumin lowered total cholesterol by 9.28 mg/dL (95% C.I. 17.36, to 1.19, p-value = 0.02). Reported adverse side effects were minimal. Conclusion: There is moderate to high level of evidence from randomized controlled trials that the Ayurvedic herbs guggulu, garlic, and black cumin are moderately effective for reducing hypercholesterolemia. In addition, minimal evidence was found for any side effects associated with these herbs, positioning them as safe adjuvants to conventional treatments.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-05-28", "cleaned_text": "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Ayurvedic Herbal Preparations for Hypercholesterolemia [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060546](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57060546) [The /journal/medicina/special_issues/Integrative_Medicine )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-57-00546)]. High blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, and smoking are the key risk factors for CVD and about 49% of Americans have at least one of the three [ [2](#B2-medicina-57-00546)]. Hypercholesterolemia (hyperlipidemia/hyperlipoproteinemia/or dyslipidemia) is a condition characterized by an elevation of any or all parameters of lipid profile or lipoprotein levels in the blood [ [3](#B3-medicina-57-00546)]. Hypercholesterolemia generally means high levels of total cholesterol or LDL-C with normal or low levels of HDL-C. The guidelines of National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) suggests LDL-C level < 100 mg/dL, as optimal, above optimal, borderline high, and high, respectively. It also suggests that the LDL-C should be the primary target of any cholesterol reducing therapy [ [4](#B4-medicina-57-00546)]. As with other types of CVD, genetics, age, and gender are some of the non-modifiable risk factors for hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia is one of the most significant contributors to the development of CVD, and if managed properly, is directly responsible for reducing risk of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD [ [5](#B5-medicina-57-00546), [6](#B6-medicina-57-00546)] (The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial results I and II). The burden of hypercholesterolemia is also reflected by recurring acute cardiovascular events [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-00546)] and higher healthcare costs [ [8](#B8-medicina-57-00546)]. Hypercholesterolemia is one of the top 10 costliest medical conditions in 2008 in the US adult population [ [9](#B9-medicina-57-00546)]. 1.1. Treatment Approaches [4](#B4-medicina-57-00546)]. Although emphasis is given to lifestyle modifications, a majority of people are required to take drugs to have an adequate reduction in LDL-C levels [ [10](#B10-medicina-57-00546)]. At present, the main drug class of choice for hypercholesterolemia is statins. Studies have suggested that statins can reduce the chance of heart attack and prevent consequent death by 30-40% and reduce LDL-C levels by 25-40%. Other alternatives to statins are fibrates, nicotinic acids, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as ezetimibe [ [4](#B4-medicina-57-00546), [10](#B10-medicina-57-00546)]. While these cholesterol-reducing drugs are generally considered safe, they are not free from side effects [ [10](#B10-medicina-57-00546)]. It is well established now that statin use is highly associated with adverse events and their manifestations such as myositis, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, cognitive loss, neuropathy, pancreatic and hepatic dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00546)]. In fact, statin use is also known to increase the risk of new-onset diabetes from anywhere between 28-43% [ [12](#B12-medicina-57-00546)]. Many times, drugs such as statins and ezetimibe do not even reach the desired reduction in LDL levels, with residual CVD risk still persisting [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00546)]. Adverse events associated with conventional treatments is also one of the reasons why a large percentage of the US population does not treat hypercholesterolemia despite being aware of the condition [ [14](#B14-medicina-57-00546)]. Such issues have prompted researchers to explore alternative/integrative treatment approaches and multiple new therapies are emerging in that area [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00546)]. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments have shown significant benefits among individuals with hypercholesterolemia [ [15](#B15-medicina-57-00546)]. One of the CAM therapies that has shown promising results for hypercholesterolemia is Ayurveda [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-00546)]. 1.2. Ayurveda [17](#B17-medicina-57-00546)]. The wisdom of Ayurveda is based on three major classical texts, namely Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya, plus six minor texts. These ancient texts give detailed descriptions of over 700 herbs and 6000 formulations in addition to descriptions of various diseases, diagnostic methods, and dietary and lifestyle recommendations [ [18](#B18-medicina-57-00546)]. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring the balance of the disturbed body-mind matrix through diet and behavioral modifications, administration of drugs, and detoxification and rejuvenation therapies. The branch of Ayurvedic science that deals with herbs and their qualities is called Dravyaguna vigyan. Ayurvedic formulations are prepared based on this knowledge and largely comprise herbs. Classical and proprietary Ayurvedic formulations may consist of a single herb or mixtures of many herbs in any form, viz., juice, extract, powder, tablet, or decoction. [19](#B19-medicina-57-00546), [20](#B20-medicina-57-00546), [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546)]. The authors of this paper looked into the most common Ayurvedic products used for high cholesterol. Either used alone or in combination with other herbs, these three herbs are found in most of the Ayurvedic formulations with some additional ingredients. The list of additional ingredients used in combination with the above-mentioned herbs may trials on Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia have presented some evidence that these formulations are effective in reducing cholesterol [ [19](#B19-medicina-57-00546), [20](#B20-medicina-57-00546), [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546)]. However, many times, such RCTs are often limited by their study designs, sample sizes, or lack of validity and/or generalizability [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-00546)]. Recently, researchers have also been encouraged to apply principles of evidence-based medicine to Ayurveda [ [17](#B17-medicina-57-00546), [23](#B23-medicina-57-00546)]. 1.3. Need for Study [20](#B20-medicina-57-00546), [24](#B24-medicina-57-00546), [25](#B25-medicina-57-00546), [26](#B26-medicina-57-00546), [27](#B27-medicina-57-00546)], there is a strong need to conduct a review to systematically summarize the available evidence as well as identify the strength of this evidence. Our preliminary search yielded one systematic review on the use of Ayurvedic herbs for Hyperlipidemia. Singh et al. (2007) [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-00546)] conducted a systematic review on Ayurvedic herbs and collateral treatments for hyperlipidemia and concluded that a significant number of researches show strong efficacy of Ayurvedic herbs for hyperlipidemia, with minimal reports of side effects. Despite its comprehensiveness, the review was limited by the use of randomized and quasi-randomized studies, arbitrary scoring methods to categorize studies, and a lack of systematic summarization of results using meta-analyses. With the current study, we aim to critically analyze the available evidence on potential benefits and harms of Ayurvedic herbs for hypercholesterolemia using Cochrane guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The current study adds on the systematic review of Singh et al. (2007) by providing strong conclusions using statistically accurate methods to establish unambiguous evidence. 2. Materials and Methods [28](#B28-medicina-57-00546)], and a protocol was previously published with the Cochrane database [ [29](#B29-medicina-57-00546)] for systematic reviews and meta-analysis [ [30](#B30-medicina-57-00546)]. 2.1. Search Strategy - The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform- [http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/](http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), accessed on 1 December 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, and Europe PubMed Central. A MEDLINE (via Ovid platform) email alert service was continuously applied to identify newly published studies using the same search strategy as described for MEDLINE. If any additional relevant key words were detected during any of the electronic or other searches, the electronic search strategies were modified to incorporate these terms and document the changes. - Clinical Trial Registry India, AYUSH research portal (Evidence Based Research Data of AYUSH Systems at Global Level, Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India), Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha, The Journal of Research & Education in Indian Medicine (JERIM), AYU (publication of Gujarat Ayurveda University, India), The International Journal for Ayurveda Research, Journal of Drug Research in Ayurveda, Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, Ancient Science of Life, International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research, A Bibliography of Indian Medicine (ABIM), Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA), Indian Heart Journal. - Other resources. Every effort was made to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessment reports. In addition, study authors of included trials were contacted to identify any further studies that may have been missed. [28](#B28-medicina-57-00546)]. For studies fulfilling inclusion criteria, key participant and intervention characteristics were abstracted and data on efficacy outcomes and adverse events were reported using standard data extraction templates as supplied by the Cochrane Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group and Cochrane Hypertension Group. Efforts were made to find the protocol of each included study, and primary, secondary, and other outcomes are reported in comparison with data in publications in a joint appendix, \"Matrix of study endpoint (publications and trial documents)\". Duplicate studies, companion documents or multiple reports of a primary study, and yield of information was maximized by collating all available data, and the most complete dataset aggregated across all known publications was used. In case of doubt, priority was given to the publication reporting the longest follow-up associated with primary or secondary outcomes of these studies. - (a) - Ayurvedic herbal preparations. These include extracts from mixtures of herbs, single herbs, Ayurvedic proprietary medicines, or a compound of herbs that are prescribed by an Ayurvedic practitioner. All the available interventions under this category, regardless of their mechanism of action, were included; - (b) - Ayurvedic herbal preparations in addition to standard care. Studies with Ayurvedic herbal medicines and conventional treatment for cholesterol (for example statins) as an intervention were also included as long as both the arms of the randomized trials received the conventional treatment. 2.1.1. Comparison Groups - Placebo compared with (a) or (b); - Usual care compared with (a) or (b); - Non-pharmacological intervention (for example diet, exercise, or both); - No intervention. 2.1.2. Outcomes Primary Outcomes - Total cholesterol levels; - Adverse events; - Major adverse cardiovascular events such as MI, stroke. Secondary Outcomes - Serum triglyceride levels; levels; - Changes in body mass index (BMI) and body weight; - Morbidity and or mortality; - Health-related quality of life; - Socioeconomic effects. [31](#B31-medicina-57-00546)]. The level at which randomization occurred was closely monitored, such as cross-over trials, cluster-randomized trials, and multiple observations for the same outcome. 2.1.3. Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies [29](#B29-medicina-57-00546), [32](#B32-medicina-57-00546)]. The following criteria were assessed for this purpose: - Random sequence generation (selection bias); - Allocation concealment (selection bias); - Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias); - Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias); - Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). [29](#B29-medicina-57-00546)]. [33](#B33-medicina-57-00546)]. If 10 or more studies were included investigating a particular outcome, funnel plots were used to assess small study effects. Several explanations can be offered for the asymmetry of a funnel plot, including true heterogeneity of effect with respect to trial size, poor methodological design (and hence bias of small trials), and publication bias. Therefore, results were interpreted carefully [ [34](#B34-medicina-57-00546)]. 2.1.4. Data Analyses [35](#B35-medicina-57-00546)]. Random-effects meta-analyses were interpreted with due consideration of the whole distribution of effects by presenting a prediction interval [ [36](#B36-medicina-57-00546)]. A prediction interval specifies a predicted range for the true treatment effect in an individual study [ [37](#B37-medicina-57-00546)]. Statistical analyses were performed according to the statistical guidelines in the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ [29](#B29-medicina-57-00546)]. 2.2. Subgroup Analysis and Investigation of Heterogeneity - Age; - Ethnicity; - Geographical location; - Diet pattern (Indian diet and Western diet, salt-restricted diet and salt-unrestricted diet, etc.) 2.3. Sensitivity Analysis - Restricting the analysis to published studies; - Restricting the analysis by considering risk of bias, as specified in [Section 2.1.3](#sec2dot1dot3-medicina-57-00546)(Assessment of Risk of Bias in Included Studies); - Restricting the analysis to very long or large studies to establish the extent to which they dominate the results; - Restricting the analysis to studies using the following filters: diagnostic criteria, imputation, language of publication, source of funding (industry versus other), and country. 2.4. Including Non-Randomized Studies [29](#B29-medicina-57-00546)] (p. 397). 3. Results [Table 1](#medicina-57-00546-t001). An adapted PRISMA [ [28](#B28-medicina-57-00546)] flow-chart of the study selection appears in [Figure 1](#medicina-57-00546-f001). [59](#B59-medicina-57-00546)], 50% withdrawal was reported and the explanation was given as \"unavoidable circumstances\". In another study [ [48](#B48-medicina-57-00546)], 39 out of 64 participants in the treatment group and 34 out of 59 participants in the control group completed the study. Since many of the studies did not provide information on their protocol, it is hard to say if selective outcome reporting bias existed. However, based on the methods in the studies, all but three of the studies did not seem to have selective outcome reporting bias. A table of risk of bias assessment is given in [Table 2](#medicina-57-00546-t002). 3.1. Effects of a forest plot of the meta-analysis, shows that the most effective intervention is Lashunadi Guggulu (garlic + guggulu), with 55.11 to 21.14; 2.61; p = 0.02) or almost 8.5% of borderline high TC levels. The third most effective intervention for reducing high TC was found to be garlic. Analysis of findings from 11 studies comparing 404 participants taking garlic with 409 participants on a placebo showed that garlic reduces TC by 12.45 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 18.68 to 6.22, p < 00001). Finally, the intervention with the least effect was found to be Nigella sativa, reducing TC by 9.28 4](#medicina-57-00546-t004)and [Figure 3](#medicina-57-00546-f003), (95% C.I.: 17.58 to 3.16; p = 0.005). This result is nearly 8% of the borderline LDL-C levels. The heterogeneity between garlic studies was 66%. As compared to the placebo, guggulu was found to LDL-C by 18.78 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 34.07 to 3.48; p 0.02). Unlike the results for total cholesterol, Nigella sativa did not have significant effects on a reduction in LDL-C (2.12 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 7.85 to 3.6; p = 0.47)), as shown in [Figure 3](#medicina-57-00546-f003). Altogether, these studies included 163 participants, of which 84 people were in an intervention group and the remaining 79 were in the control group. 3.1.3. Triglycerides (mg/dL) [Table 5](#medicina-57-00546-t005)and [Figure 4](#medicina-57-00546-f004)) garlic to be the least reducing raised TG levels (3.1 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 16.63 to 10.42; p = 0.65)), as shown in [Figure 4](#medicina-57-00546-f004). N. Sativa was found to be the most effective intervention, where the meta-analysis of three studies showed that it reduces TG by 21.09 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 44.96 to 2.77; p value = 0.08). Although the confidence interval of the effect size is wide and the p value of the final effect is 0.08, the heterogeneity among the studies was fairly low at 28%. Lashunadi guggulu, according to the combined results of two small studies, reduces TG levels by 13.23 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 28.53 studies on guggulu, when meta-analyzed, showed that guggulu helps to reduce by 7.35 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 23.29 to 8.59; p value = 0.0.37). Here, two studies that showed positive results in other cholesterol levels are negative and opposite in one study. 3.1.4. HDL (mg/dL) [Table 6](#medicina-57-00546-t006)) suggest the statistically non-significant effect of Ayurvedic interventions on HDL-C. Guggulu alone and when mixed with garlic, however, showed positive and statistically significant results in increasing HDL-C. Analysis of end results from five RCTs in guggulu involving 264 total subjects showed that, as compared to the placebo, guggulu increased HDL-C by a small but significant difference of 2.19 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 0.27 to 4.12; p value = 0.03). On the other hand, results from a single study showed that Lashunadi guggulu was found to be raising HDL-C levels by mg/dL (95% C.I.: 5.87 to 14.13; p < 0.00001). N. sativa also did not seem to have a significant effect on HDL-C. Results of the meta-analysis of three studies showed that it raised HDL-C levels by 1.92 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 1.62 to 5.45; p = 0.29). These studies involved a total of 163 participants. Garlic was also found to have no significant effect on HDL-C levels. Among 12 studies involving 736 participants, five studies claimed that garlic reduces HDL-C, and one study by Gardner et al. [ [51](#B51-medicina-57-00546)] found out that garlic neither reduces nor increases HDL-C. The studies were also highly heterogeneous with a high 97% I2 statistic. Though it may not even be relevant to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of garlic on HDL-C, it is presented in the forest plot to show the current evidence ( [Figure 5](#medicina-57-00546-f005)). 4. Discussion 4.1. Commiphora Mukul (Guggulu) [66](#B66-medicina-57-00546)] seems to have had a big influence on the overall effect of this intervention. Heterogeneity among these seven studies was 75%, which still allowed the conduction of the meta-analysis. Likewise, as compared to a placebo, guggulu reduced TG levels by 7.35 mg/dL (95% C.I.: 23.29 to 8.59; (95% C.I. 0.27 to 4.12; p-value = 0.03). This effect size counts for a reduction in TC and LDL-C by nearly 6.5% and 10%, respectively. This finding is of clinical significance, as it is associated with a 38% reduction in the risk of coronary events at age 50 (Law et. al, 1994) [ [69](#B69-medicina-57-00546)]. The risk of coronary events is dependent on other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and age. In addition, it is also understood that a 10% reduction in LDL-C levels helps minimize the risk of coronary and vascular events [ [70](#B70-medicina-57-00546)]. Out of eight trial arms included in analysis, all but two studies [ [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546), [47](#B47-medicina-57-00546)] were conducted in the Western population with a typical Western diet. When a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding these two studies, then the effect size was 22.85 (95% C.I.: 40.74, 4.97). Another possibility is that the discrepancies are due to the dietary habits of Indian and Western populations. Another postulation could be that this native Indian plant is better suited to natives of India\u2014as the Vedic scriptures say, \"local plants and herbs are best suited to the local people\" [ [71](#B71-medicina-57-00546)]. [66](#B66-medicina-57-00546)] and shows a bigger effect size. However, this study included patients with a baseline total cholesterol level of 275 mg/dL or more or triglycerides levels of 200 mg/dL. Thus, there is a possibility that guggulu is more effective when the baseline cholesterol and triglyceride levels are high. Moreover, Verma (1988) describes the process of purification of guggulu. Purification of guggulu is also associated with its chances of posing any side effects. Although there were no serious adverse events posed by guggulu, a small proportion of participants did experience diarrhea, headaches, and skin rashes. These side effects are minimal when compared to the threats posed by conventional drug therapy. Purified guggulu seems to have fewer side effects. The study by Szapary et al. [ [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546)], which showed negative effects of guggulu, did not mention if the product was purified as per the Ayurvedic protocol or not. Additionally, the study included an extracted version of guggulu prepared by a commercial manufacturer. Thus, there is an inherent chance of bias despite the fact that it was the first methodologically sound randomized controlled trial conducted on guggulu in the West. When asked for further comments, no response was received from the principal author [ [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546)]. [26](#B26-medicina-57-00546)]. This fraction A guggulu has been used in some trials. Extracting the active ingredient of guggulu is not an Ayurvedic practice, so it might be a plausible reason for this observation. Guggulu has been qualitatively reviewed by few several groups of researchers in the past [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-00546), [26](#B26-medicina-57-00546), [72](#B72-medicina-57-00546)]. So far, none of the reviews conducted a meta-analysis of guggulu studies. This work is first of its kind and thus cannot be compared with any previous meta-analysis. In summary, guggulu is moderately effective in terms of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C, and there is a strong evidence to this end. Thus, it can be recommended as an adjuvant to cholesterol-lowering pharmacological therapy or as a supplement to a healthier diet and lifestyle for those who have borderline cholesterol levels. 4.1.1. Garlic [69](#B69-medicina-57-00546), [70](#B70-medicina-57-00546)]. [73](#B73-medicina-57-00546)]. [74](#B74-medicina-57-00546), [75](#B75-medicina-57-00546), [76](#B76-medicina-57-00546)]. In previous literature, the effect of garlic on cholesterol levels has been a debatable topic. Time and again, many individual trials of garlic have reported diverse therapeutic effect size of garlic on cholesterol levels. The study by Stevinson et al. [ [76](#B76-medicina-57-00546)] was one of the earliest meta-analysis of garlic on hypercholesterolemia and included 13 trials, whereas the recent and most updated study, by Ried et al. [ [74](#B74-medicina-57-00546)], included 39 studies. The studies by Stevinson et al. and Ried et al. both suggest that garlic reduces TC levels by approximately 15 mg/dL, whereas the study by Reinhart et al. [ [75](#B75-medicina-57-00546)] suggests its effect size is nearly half of what was observed by previous studies, i.e., 7.34 mg/dL. They attribute this smaller effect size to including newer studies, which exhibit more modest effects than older studies. However, the recent and most updated meta-analysis on garlic by Ried et al. [ [74](#B74-medicina-57-00546)] seems to be the most comprehensive one. [71](#B71-medicina-57-00546)]. From a pharmacological point of view, it is believed that the active compound called allicin, a garlic derivative, is responsible for reducing cholesterol levels and for the distinctive smell of garlic [ [77](#B77-medicina-57-00546)]. Allicin is a volatile compound and is responsible transiently for cardiovascular effects [ [77](#B77-medicina-57-00546)]. However, the exact ingredients and their mechanism of action still remains unknown. On the other hand, Ayurveda has been using garlic for treating Hridroga, an Ayurvedic term for cardiovascular diseases [ [71](#B71-medicina-57-00546)]. In Ayurveda, garlic, which possesses all five tastes except sour taste, is capable for clearing channels and all the coverings (avarana) because of its pungent and piercing qualities [ [71](#B71-medicina-57-00546), [78](#B78-medicina-57-00546)]. [79](#B79-medicina-57-00546)]. When taken together, garlic preparations can be considered as a general heart tonic with cholesterol regulating properties. It can also be used as a preventive agent in borderline cholesterol levels, with a higher safety and tolerability profile than statins. 4.1.2. Nigella Sativa [80](#B80-medicina-57-00546)]. The difference between the current study and [ [80](#B80-medicina-57-00546)] is the inclusion criteria; the present study only included studies with whole seed powder, whereas Sahebkar et al. [ [80](#B80-medicina-57-00546)] included other versions of Nigella sativa such as seed oil and also had no restriction on baseline total cholesterol levels for the inclusion criteria, which limited the number of studies in this meta-analysis. 4.1.3. Adverse Effects [21](#B21-medicina-57-00546)] reported that one patient each from experimental group and control group had serious side effects and Joseph (2012) reported that one participant in the active control group withdrew due to a five-fold increase in serum creatinine level. Other minor adverse events such as gastrointestinal upset, skin rashes, nausea, and bad odor of breath and body were also reported in few other studies [ [47](#B47-medicina-57-00546), [56](#B56-medicina-57-00546)]. [55](#B55-medicina-57-00546), [56](#B56-medicina-57-00546), [57](#B57-medicina-57-00546)]. A Pakistani study by Zeb et al. [ [81](#B81-medicina-57-00546)] examined the impact of garlic powder, coriander powder, and a mixture of the two on lipid profile as compared to a placebo. Garlic powder was found to be the most effective in reducing TC and LDL and increasing HDL, as compared to all other groups. The latest study by Iskander et al. [ [82](#B82-medicina-57-00546)] showed that a nutraceutical combination including g gugguluipid showed a significant reduction in TC and LDL levels after 8 weeks of consumption in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Another study by Kuchewar et al. [ [83](#B83-medicina-57-00546)] found beneficial effects of Triphala on the lipid profile of patients with dyslipidemia. Many other herbs such as Amla [ [84](#B84-medicina-57-00546), [85](#B85-medicina-57-00546)] have also shown promising results for controlling lipid parameters among patients with hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia. However, these studies failed to meet the inclusion criteria of the current review. 5.
