Bradbard, Winthrop University D. Keith Robbins, Winthrop University Charles Alvis, Winthrop University ABSTRACT Winegar University confronts the increasingly hostile budgeting environment presented by the most significant economic recession since the gr eat depression. State assisted universities have limited means of compensating for decreased st ate and federal funding. Underlying the budgeting scenarios are complexities such as tuition price discrimination elasticity of tuition pricing,admission acceptance standards, and faculty to student ratios. This case presents instructors with an opportunity to demonstrate how spreadsheets can assist managers with respect to their planning, budgeting, and decision-making responsibilities.The specific spreadsheet skills covered involve the construction of one- and two-dimensional data tables. By using this case, instructors are enrich ing students MIS repertoire within a context with which they should be intimately familiar: college tuition pricing. The case will illuminate the utility of spreadsheet tools in support of fundamental management decision making activities. INTRODUCTION This case is intended for introductory principles of management or finance course required in most undergraduate business curriculum. Student s should quickly warm to discussions of such sensitive issues as tuition price increases, student user fees, tuition price discrimination (e.g., like airline seats if you polled five students in a cla ssroom you'd find that no two pay the same tuition), net present value estimates for college education, f aculty salaries, and faculty student ratios or class sizes. Students and their parents confront these issues on a year-to-year and semester-to-semester basis. Many students are incurring debt as a means to invest in their financial future. Two areas where the case is relevant include: (1) mana gerial responsibilities with respect to planning, budgeting, and controlling and (2) managerial decision making with the assistance of a decisionsupport system (i.e., a spreadsheet set up for what-if analysis). The case can be assigned as soonas these topics have been covered. With respect to area one, the objective of the cas e is to put students in real life setting where they can experience the difficulties of pla nning, budgeting, and decision-making in a real life situation that is relatively familiar to students. Regarding area two, the objective is to show students effective spreadsheet techniques (i.e., what-if anal ysis) that can be used for planning, budgeting, and decision-making situations. By using what-if anal ysis, students can systematically change the input variables to determine the effects on the output variables. page 2 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2The case employs several features from the Excel spreadsheet program that are usually considered advanced topics. These include one- and two-variable data tables. Instructors can findmaterial on these topics in books that specialize in Excel (e.g., Oja, D., Parsons, J, Carey, P., &Ageloff, R., 2010; Winston, 2004). SYNOPSIS OF THE CASE The organizational setting for the case is a moderately sized public university with a total enrollment of 6,500 students. The major players are the Vice President of Finance (PercyBradshaw) and the Director of A cademic Computing and User Suppor t (Gerald Radner). It is early summer and Percy is attempting to finalize the university's budget for the coming academic year.His task is complex for several reasons. First, the state legislature has not completed deliberations with respect to allocations of funds for the comi ng year. Second, there was a budget shortfall in the current fiscal year that was covered by the university's reserve funds. The university president hasstated that this cannot happen again. Percy must present the president with a draft of the budget and as a result of the complexities of this situation he is feeling overwhelmed. Fortunately at this crucial decision time, Percy has a chance meeting with Gerald. As a result of this m eeting, Gerald offers to show Percy several tools from Excel that might make Percy's task easier. Percy needs a way to present the budget so that it can quickly be revised as the situation changes. In the dialog that follows, Percy explai ns the major variables related to expenses and revenue. Based on this discussion, Gerald shows Pe rcy a way to systematically vary in-state tuition revenues to examine the effect of this variable on the budget. As state support for universities has declined, most state schools have responded by increasing tuition to offset the diminished funds fr om the state. Public state universities generally enroll both in-state and out-of-state students. Us ually, state universities charge in-state students a lower tuition rate than out-of-state students. The higher tuition paid by out-of-state students provides an incentive for schools to enroll more out-of-state students. Pedagogical Implications This case provides instructors with an op portunity to put the planning, budgeting, and decision-making responsibilities of managers in a real world context reasonably familiar to students.The case setting also enables students to extend th eir analytic and spreadsheet skills by introducing advanced topics such as one- and two-variable da ta tables. As an added bonus, utilization of cases such as this provides a strong example of how to integrate concepts from different parts of the curriculum. Students should employ spreadsheet software so they are aware managers have powerful tools for examining complex environmental situati ons. Budgeters and strategists are instantly able to depict outcomes associated with different estimates of key factor trends. Facility with data tables is a first step toward understanding the power of these tools. The university setting depicted in this case is one students find painfully (in terms of their purse strings) relevant.

Secondary issues exam ined include marketing strategy, human resource management, and operations management in the small fa mily business. The case is appropriate for junior and senior level undergraduate courses. The case is designed to be taught in one class hour and is expected to require approximately three hours of outside preparation by students. The events described in this case are based on real world experiences. CASE SYNOPSIS Jeff Kleinpeter, fourth generation CEO of Kleinpeter Farms Dairy, has boldly led his family's business into a new product/market area, specifically the production and distribution of ice cream. For nearly one hundred years, Kleinpeter Farms Dairy has served the south Louisiana area as the leading milk processor and distributor, but now the company has invested millions of dollars in a new, but related product. Jeff seeks to build on the loyalty and goodwill generated amongconsumers because of Kleinpeter's excellent reputa tion for high quality milk products in the south Louisiana area. Kleinpeter appeals to local customers through cross-branding other Louisianaproducts, such as Ponchatoula strawberries, Berger on pecans, and Elmer's Gold Brick Eggs. After the new product is launched, the company experiences challenges in marketing, operations, andhuman resource management.Allied Academies International Conference page 5 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009STOLEN DATA AND FRAUD: THE HANNAFORD BROTHERS DATA BREACH Danial L. Clapper, We stern Carolina University ABSTRACT As more and more personal and financial informa tion is stored online, data breaches - the unintentional exposure of confidential informati on - are becoming an increasing concern for both the organizations which must keep that data safe and the customers who may become victims of credit card fraud or identity theft if they fail to do so. Unfortunately, the number of data breaches is on the rise: according to one report, 2008 was the biggest year ever for data breaches - withmore customer records compromised than the prior four years combined. One of the most publicized victims of a 2008 data breach was the Hannaford Brothers grocery chain. On March 17, 2008 Hannaford Brot hers Company announced that it had been the victim of a data breach caused by a malware attack it characterized as \"new and sophisticated\" which resulted in over 4.2 million credit and debit card numbers being compromised. In each of its over 300 grocery stores in the northeast and Florida the malware had intercepted customercredit and debit card data during the authorization process and then sent the stolen data to a remotesite overseas. The stolen credit card data was fr audulently used in at least 1,800 cases in the U.S. as well as Mexico, Bulgaria and Italy. This case will examine the details of the Hannaford Brothers case, including a timeline of theft, discovery and response, the nature of the stolen data and how the criminals engineered this data breach. In the process of this examination stude nts will get a closer look at the nature of credit card data, how stolen data is used to commit fraud, the industry security standards in place to keep that data secure, and how they were circumvented for this data breach to occur. Finally, therepercussions and costs to Hannaford Brothers will be detailed.page 6 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2SEARS HOLDINGS CORPORATION: DETERMINING THE RETAILER'S FUTURE ONE MANAGEMENT TRAINEE AT A TIME Kasia Firlej, Purdue University Calumet CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concer ns the fate of Sears and its image with the customers and its employees. The case is based on the experience of a management trainee who has recently interned with the company. Some issues explored in the case are those of retailing strategy, human resource management in a retail structure and the all-important customer satisfaction. The case has a difficulty level of three, appropriate for junior level students. The case is designed to be taught in one class hour and is expected to require no more than two hours of preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS The iconic retailer Sears has undergone a major transformation from a stalwart of the American dream and a retailer where Baby Boomers furnished their lifestyle under the thriving post WWII economy. Fast forward to the twenty first century and the year 2005; Eddie Lambert ishailed \"Warren Buffet\" a maverick investor who pledges to turn the fate of the struggling outdatedretailer. ESL investments, headed by Lambert acqui res Kmart stores in order to compliment Sears' mall locations with that of Kmart's freestandi ng ones. All eyes are on Lambert as he begins desperate cost cutting measures by elimina ting unprofitable lines and firing redundant employees, as well as outsourcing some operations. This case examines the experience of a college intern which mirrors the continued erosion of brand equity and consumer satisfactions causing Sears' profits to slump. CASE Ellen has just landed a great summer internship. Her employer is one of the biggest retailers in the United States, second only to such giants as Wal-Mart and Home Depot. She is excited about her prospects as a management trainee. In additi on to learning how to manage different departments she has landed a job that will pay her a gener ous $15.00 per hour, and will allow her to earn some extra money during the long summer break. Ellen hopes that landing an internship with such aniconic retailer will help launch her career. The reality of Ellen's internship hit her in the first week. Th e management trainee internship was obtained by Ellen through her local university where she is a business management student.Sears selected an appropriate pool of students through the internship coordinator at the local business school and Ellen was chosen as the best candidate. Allied Academies International Conference page 7 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009The store manager forgot that she was to arrive . Besides, the store manager was out to lunch and did not return for about three hours. Ellen didn't let that deter her. She warmly greeted the storemanager and announced that she was the new manage ment trainee ready to learn and willing to help with anything; \"and a lot help we need around her e\" announced the store manager. Ellen was asked to work with Diane, a department manager in charge of soft lines. What struck Ellen as odd at first were all of the clothes that hadn't been put on racks. \"Oh, those need to be zeroed out\" or \"r eturned to vendor\" announced Diane, the soft lines manager. Ellen inquired as to why the merchandise hadn't been displayed on the shop floor. The response was \"we are simply short-handed and can't keep up with the amount of new merchandise that has to be tagged and displayed. \"Besides\" remarked the soft lines manager \"just between us, the more merchandise we have on the shop floor the more of it we have to keep on marking down\". One ofEllen's primary activities in the soft lines department was marking down merchandise. Ellen alsofound herself dealing with many customer complaints that ranged from unavailable fitting roomsand cash wraps to long checkout lines and being out of stock on advertise merchandise. She was not worried, however, as the schema tic provided by the corporate office outlines the progression of her internship. According to the mandate from the headquarters Ellen would rotate between the different departments and acquire all of the necessary skills to become adepartment manager. Ellen's second week as a manager trainee looked hopeful. She was scheduled to be transferred to the electronics department. The management trainee was familiarized with thedepartment's specific layout and was given a list of schematics which to follow when displaying sales merchandise called planograms. Ellen soon learned that the planograms were issued by the headquarters and didn't take into account the sligh tly different layout of the store and the physical barriers that prevented the products from being prope rly displayed. There seemed to be a shortage of associate and the customer complaints continue d. Ellen was scheduled to meet on a regular basis with the department manager, but the appointment was never kept. By the third week Ellen was schedule to arrive at the home and garden department, however the store manager informed Ellen that the Softlin es Department sorely needed help in getting merchandise out on the shop floor. Ellen noticed that the Sales Clerks were at times standing behind the cash wraps with nothing to do. Ellen suggested that maybe the Sales staff could help in theretagging and restocking efforts, but she was told th at there was a strict di vision of labor and MCAs or the Merchandise Customer Associates were in charge of those activities. The problem was that MCAs were not paid as well as the cashiers and often failed to show up for work. This left the Softlines Department with piles of returned, abandoned merchandise that failed to make it to thedisplay racks. The customers often expressed thei r frustration with not be ing able to find clothing that they saw advertised in the circulars. Some customers were confused when they came in lured by the Lands' End brand and could not locate it anywhere in the store. The customers were notmade aware that not all Sears Mall locations carried the Land's End brand. For the next ten weeks things didn't change much. Ellen continued to be astounded by the level of apathy which her coworkers demonstrate d. She was taught in her Organizational Behavior courses about such concepts as empowerment and motivation and was surprised that they were hard to come by during her management trainee days at S ears. Ellen was aware that the company is large and diverse. It employs over 300,000 people and like all retailers has been deeply affected by thepage 8 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2recession that has been eroding the buying power of the very consumers it has been targeting. However, Ellen was shocked when at the end of her management trainee program she was invited to a posh conference center near the Sears headquarters. During her two day retreat she met many other management trainee interns like herself from all over the country. Ellen was cautious toappear positive about her experience when asked for f eedback. She wanted to minimize the fact that the detailed schedule of her twelve week internship had not been followed. Ellen also did not want to share with the crowd the fact that she had s een apathetic employees, frustrated managers and a lack of commitment to customer service. When the interim CEO and President of Sears Holdings, W. Bruce Johnson spoke to the crowd of management trainees he called them \"the future of our company\". Mr. Johnson expressed the company's commitment to excellence and changing withthe times. Everyone nodded politely. Ellen was reluctant to share her less than ste llar experience with the other interns and mainly kept quiet. However, upon here return to the hotel she heard many comments from the experiences of other interns that were quite similar to hers . The young college students described the stores as outdated, disorganized and said that the personnel l acked morale. None of the management trainee program participants appreciated the great expe nse that Sears Holding Corporation had undertaken in order to provide them with this management training opportunity. Most of them expressed nodesire to ever work for Sears in the future. THE HISTORY OF SEARS Sears traces its rich history back to the year 1886 when Richard W. Sears founded the company based on a successful operation of selling watches. Alvah Roebuck joined the company in 1988. That year the company published its first catalog and moved its operations to Chicago.The watch selling operation was later sold and the business evolved into a diversification ofofferings with strengths in its catalog and financial offerings. Sears Roebuck and Company continued its grow th, reaching sales of upwards of $1 billion in 1945. The retailer became the icon for all who aspired for the middle class status offeringproducts as diverse as modular homes and delighti ng customers with incredibly knowledgeable staff and successful private brands such as Craftsman, Kenmore, Diehard and many others. The Sears retailing strategy has positioned the retailer at one time with the motto \"Shop at Sears and Save\", then cam e the famous marketing campaign \"The Softer Side of Sears\" and the current tagline reads \"Life. Well Spent\". The tide of the retailer really seemed to turn when Wal-Mart, currently the world's largest retailer began to successfully appeal to the same ta rget market and aggressively continued to expand and innovate. Then, at the turn of the century came the lawsuits. The first was a lawsuit thatbrought negative attention to the company when Sears agreed to pay out close to $160 million to eleven million people for violating terms agreed upon with the customers regarding interest rateincreases. Other lawsuits regarding product misrepresentation followed further tarnishing the imageof the retailer.Allied Academies International Conference page 9 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009FAST FORWARD TO TODAY... Sears is a diverse retailer with a combination so 3,900 full line and specialty retail stores in the United States, as well as in Canada. Sears' product offerings range from home appliances,electronics, tools, lawn equipment to automotive products and services as well as the \"softer sideof Sears\" representing health and beauty produc ts, apparel, footwear and accessories. The Sears retail presence is also enriched by its network of commercial and sales se rvices, as well as the Lands' End business. Sears also is using the multichannel retailing model in presenting offerings on Sears.com - a transactional website serving in lieu of the discontinued Sears catalog that made the retailer so famous. Sears is currently run by Edward (Eddie) Lamp ert, who in 2005 took over the helm of Sears and merged it with Kmart. The company is currently known as Sears Holdings and its majoritystake is owned controlled by ESL Investments, headed by Lampert. ESL controls around 55% of the shares of Sears holdings that currently owns a total of (Jonathan R. Laing, WSJ, August 24 th 2009). Sears has been criticized for using \"total re turn swaps\", which take big risks in leveraged investments without actually having to spend the money without actually purchasing them. These \"total return swaps\" also carry tax benefits, make the balance sheet look good and boost the liquidityof an investment. All of the a bove are benefits that ESL Investme nts is pursuing in order to revive the value to debt ratio of the two struggling retailers: Sears and Kmart. Eddie Lampert is seeking to diversify his strategy in the struggling world of retail by leveraging its poor performance with some savvy investments in other areas. He is also trying tointroduce more efficiency by slashing slow moving inventory. Furthermore Sears has gone to great lengths to update its website. A large portion of its hard goods' sales come from the Sears website. The customer has an added convenience in using the many brick and mortar retail outlets to return and exchange products obtained via the website. Some have criticized the new Sears management of concentrating too much on enhancing its portfolio rather than caring about the needs of their customers. Sears customer base has been getting progressively older. The retailer's image suffers with the younger consumers. One of the objectives of the management trainee program th at Sears Holdings Corporation implemented was to help revive that image. Ellen sat in her retailing class wondering whether the company believed that they had successfully achieved that objective.

James, California State University - Los Angeles CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case c oncerns changes in accounting for consolidated entities and the convergence of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) with U.S.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The case focuses on the effect of the changes on financial statements of global entities, as well as strategic decisions made by companyexecutives. Secondary, conti nuing significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS and future potential developments in accounting for consolidated multinational entities are explored.This case has a difficulty level of three to four and can be taught in about 50 minutes. Approximately two hours of outside preparation is necessary to fu lly address the issues and concepts. This case can be utilized in an Advanced Accounting course, either on the graduate or undergraduate level to helpstudents understand changes in and differences betw een U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Two sets of questions address U.S. GAAP and IFRS and include some resear chable questions that are especially useful for a graduate level course. The case has analytical, critical thinking, conceptual, and researchcomponents and can enhance students' oral and written communication skills. CASE SYNOPSIS Financial reporting in the U.S. is changing drama tically. Consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commissions's proposed \"Roadmap\" (SEC, 2008), the U.S. likely will join the more than 100 nations worldwide that currently utilize In ternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and require the use of IFRS in the U.S. Because of the globally widespread use of IFRS, multinational entities with subsidiaries that prepare IFRS-based financial statements already have to be knowledgeable about IFRS as well as the current differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Fortunately, the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are workingtogether to bring about convergence between the two sets of accounting standards. Recently, FASB and the IASB issued new and revised several existing standards that eliminate many differences between U.S. GAAP and I FRS with respect to business combinations and consolidated financial statements. However, some significant differences persist. Until the SECmakes a final decision regarding mandatory use of IFRS and during the proposed multi-yeartransition period, current and future accounting professionals must continue to keep abreast ofchanges in U.S. GAAP, be knowledgeable about differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and, atAllied Academies International Conference page 11 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009the time, prepare for the likely transition to IFRS. In addition, company executives should be cognizant of developments that may affect their st rategic decisions as the U.S. moves toward a likely adoption of IFRS during the next five years. This case focuses on the effect of changes in financial reporting for consolidated entities. Changes as well as continuing differences betw een U.S. GAAP and IFRS are explored. Secondarily, strategic decisions arising from the changes and the likely future adoption of IFRS are addressed. This case, which can be utilized in Advanced Accounting on either the graduate or undergraduate level can enhance students' analytical, technical, critical thinking, research, and communicationskills. KLUGEN CORPORATION - CASE * * This is a fictitious case. Any similarities with r eal companies, individuals, and situations are solely coincidental. Irma Kuhn, CPA, CMA holds the position of Ch ief Financial Officer (CFO) of Klugen Corporation, a global telecommunications company. Klugen is a consolidated entity headquartered in the U.S. with four majority-owned European subsidiaries. The company has expanded primarily by acquiring majority interests in European co mpanies and holds between 51% and 70% of the outstanding voting stock of its subsidiaries. Consistent with current accounting rules, Klugen consolidates all four of its subsidiaries. In addition, Klugen also holds financial interests in several unconsolidated entities and accounts forthose as investments. Klugen's European subsidiaries currently prepare their financial statements consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS ), which are promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Klugen, the parent company, issues consolidated financialstatements, which include the results of its majority-owned subsidiaries in conformity with U.S.GAAP. Preparation of Klugen's consolidated financ ial statements requires that Irma and her staff convert the subsidiaries' IFRS-based financial stat ements into U.S. GAAP prior to consolidating the numbers. This process is quite complex and requi res many of the accounting departments' resources. Irma is well aware of efforts between the FA SB and the IASB to bring about convergence between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. She expects that c onsistent with the SEC's \"Roadmap,\" (SEC, 2008) within the next five years, U.S. public companie s likely will have to apply IFRS, rather than U.S. GAAP. Irma welcomes this development and believes that in the long-run, use of IFRS by the parent company as well as its subsidiaries will preserve and strengthen the company's global financialcompetitiveness. In addition, she believes that it will simplify the accounting and consolidation process significantly and, in the long-run, reduce fi nancial reporting costs. She is aware, however, that in the short-run many challenges, such as conversion of the accounting and IT systems andextensive staff training will increase costs. Know ing that the SEC's Roadmap proposes a phased-in adoption by public companies between 2014 and 2016, Irma plans to recommend adoption of IFRS at the earliest permitted time. As the person who ultimately is responsible for financial reporting, Irma is very knowledgeable about current and proposed changes in U.S. GAAP as well as IFRS. She knows thatpage 12 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2the IASB and FASB have issued new and revised st andards applicable to business combinations that affect the company's consolidated financial statem ents. After in depths analysis of the new and revised standards she determined that many of the past differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS where eliminated when the FASB issues FAS 141R \"Business Combinations\" and FAS 160\"Non-controlling interest in consolidated financia l statements\" (FASB, 2007) and the IASB revised IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" and IAS 27 \"Cons olidated and Separate Financial Statements\" (IASB, 2008). She also realizes that some signifi cant differences still persist. Klugen Corporation has properly adopted FAS 141R and FAS 160 for th e 2009 fiscal period and its forthcoming annual report will reflect those changes. Irma regularly conducts in-house seminars to instruct her accounting staff regarding new developments in financial reporting. Since in about five (5) months, Klugen Corporation will issue its consolidated financial statements, which will, for the first time, incorporate FAS 160 and FAS 141R, Irma decides to schedule a seminar on \"Business Combinations - Consolidated FinancialStatements\" for October 15, 2009. The seminar will be highly beneficial for staff members who are currently involved or planning to become involved in critical aspects of financial reporting and also for those who want to develop their knowledge of IFRS. The CPE Seminar Irma discusses the most important changes in accounting and financial reporting for consolidated entities consistent with FAS 141R and FAS 160. She prepares a handout consisting of a comparative table that contrast the new rules (e ffective for the 2009 financial statements) with the prior rules for the seminar participants. Table I Recent Changes to U.S. GAAP - effective 2009 - FAS 141R and FAS 160 Issue Effective 2009 Financial Statements Pre-2009 Financial Statements Subsidiaries' assets and liabilities Are fully revalued to fair market value at acquisition date.

Next, Irma highlights continui ng significant differences betw een U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This information is particularly important for staff invol ved in the consolidation process and also for staff who wish to prepare for the future adoption of IFRS. The following table represents a handout basedon Irma's PowerPoint presentation: Table II Summary of Differences Between U.S. GAAP and IFRS Issue U.S. GAAP IFRS Definition of control Defined as \"controlling financial interest\" usually interpreted asmajority voting interest.focuses on the \"power to govern financial and operating policies\"(IFRS 3, 19) Shares considered for determining controlOnly existing voting rights May include exercisable shares Calculation of non-controlling interest Non-controlling interest is measured at fair value of total netassets.Choice between (1) fair value and (2) proportionate share of fair valueof identifiable net assets.

At the end of the seminar, many questions aris e from the staff and some from the CEO, who attended the second half of the se minar. Irma answers as many questions as possible and promises to provide a short question/answer briefing sheet to all those who were present. During the seminar she summarizes the following questions as shown in the assignments section of the case. ASSIGNMENTS U.S. GAAP Questions: 1. How will adoption of the new accounting sta ndards (FAS 141R and FAS 160) affect Klugen Corporation's financial statements in (a) the forthcoming reporting period and the (b)long-run? 2. What key financial ratios will be affected by FAS 141R and FAS 160? What will be the likely effect? 3. What additional estimates have to be made consistent with the new accounting standards? 4. Could any of the recent changes affect the company's acquisition strategies and potentially its growth? 5. What were FASB's primary reasons for issuing FAS 141R and FAS 160? (Research question) 6. FASB and IASB issued an updated memorandum of understanding. Retrieve the memorandum and identify several issues that the two standard setting boards are jointlyfocusing on. (Research question). IFRS Questions: 1. From the consolidation perspective, what w ould be the likely overall effect of adopting IFRS on the company's financial statements? 2. What potential effect would arise if Klugen we re to select the option under IFRS 3 to value non-controlling interest at the proportionate share of its subsidiaries' net identifiable assets? 3. Do you believe that an impairment of goodw ill would be more likely under IFRS or under U.S. GAAP? Why, or why not? 4. What opportunities and challenges would aris e for the accounting staff if the company adopts IFRS? 5. As indicated in the case, Irma previously highlighted some other significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP.

Jesswein, Sam Houston State University CASE DESCRIPTION This case requires the student to examine how a significant change in accounting principle will likely affect the financial condition and future funding situation of Thiel Machinery.Specifically, the student will look at how the probable abolition of the LIFO inventory costing method (as the U.S. moves towards acceptance of the International Financial Reporting Standard) will affect various financial ratios of the com pany, most notably the Altman Z-score. The student must make pro forma adjustments to the company's existing financial statements that account forthe elimination of LIFO and calculate the expected change in the Z-score. Because the company is currently privately-held, the student will also n eed to estimate the market value of the company's equity using a free cash flow valuation model and examine how reduced cash flows from higher tax payments affect not only financial ratio calculations but potentially the value of the company itself. CASE SYNOPSIS Thiel Machinery, a successfully growing mach inery company, is grappling with the potential impact of losing the ability of using LIFO costi ng methods on its current and future funding sources.

Allied Academies International Conference page 17 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009BRIDGING THE GENERATIONAL GAP BETWEEN \"SENIORS\" AND \"BABY BOOMERS\": THE SUCCESS OF VIAGRA'S PROMOTIONAL STRATEGIES Virginie Khare, University of Tampa Karen Popovich, St Michael's College, Vermont Dan Kaufman, University of Tampa ABSTRACT How can companies bridge generational gaps, especially in cases where product customization is not possible? Viagra is a grea t example of how Pfizer modified its promotion strategies to target different generational groups. When Pfizer first came out with the drug in the late 1990s, its primary target market (males 50 and above) were mostly from the mature market. Since then, however, Pfizer has had to redirect its communications towards the baby boomergeneration, a group of consumers who, unlike their el ders, have been found to be more self-centered, individualistic, economically optimistic, skeptical, suspicious of authority, and focused on thepresent. This was accomplished mostly through superior targeted strategies in advertising,sponsorships, and public relations. Essential to thes e strategies were also their choice of the right spokespeople to appeal to the desired generations. This case reviews Viagra's communicationstrategies from its initial release under the endorsement of Bob Dole, to today's sponsorships ofNASCAR and the MLB. Advertising themes and styles are also compared and their appeal to such different generational groups. page 18 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2ST. LOUIS CHEMICAL: COST OF CAPITAL David A. Kunz, Southeast Missouri State University Benjamin L. Dow III, Southeast Missouri State University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case c oncerns the issues surrounding a firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Case provides a revi ew of cost of capital issues. The case requires students to have knowledge of accounting and finance, thus the case has a difficulty level of three (junior level) or higher. The case is designed to be taught in one class session of approximately 1.25 hours and is expected to require 2-3 hours of preparation time from the students. CASE SYNOPSIS The case tells the story of Don Williams, Pres ident and primary owner of St. Louis Chemical. By most measures, the performance of St. Louis Chemical has been very good over the last threeyears, with sales and income increasing each year Business growth has b een steady but a recent increase in demand has placed a strain on existing operations. To keep pace with demand, thecapacity of the current warehouse and packaging operati ons need to be increased. The cost of the facility expansion has been estimated to be $900,000 by St. Louis Chemical's operation manager. Since beginning operations, Williams has been reluctant to borrow funds. He has been content with limited growth, financed with internally generated equity. Recently hired Edison Hesselbach, the co mpany's first finance professional, has recommended borrowing the required funds. Williams indicated he may be willing to consider achange in his long-standing policy against debt, but wants more information regarding using debt in the firm's capital structure. BACKGROUND St. Louis Chemical is a relatively new regi onal distributor of liquid and dry chemicals, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The company, founded by Don Williams, has been serving primarily eastern Missouri and western Illinois for four years and has developed a reputation as areliable supplier of industrial chemicals. Williams' previous business experience provided him witha solid understanding of the chemical industry and th e distribution process. As a general manager for a chemical manufacturer, he had profit and loss (P&L) responsibility, but until beginning St.Louis Chemical, he had limited exposure to company accounting and finance decisions. The company reported small losses during its early years of operation, but performance in recent years has been very good. Sales have grown, new product lines have been added and reportedprofits have been steadily increasing. The grow th has required the acquisition of additional land, equipment, expansion of storage capacity and an increase in work force. Williams has proven toAllied Academies International Conference page 19 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009be an expert marketer, and St. Louis Chemical has developed a reputation with its customers of providing quality products and superior service at competitive prices. Despite its business success, St. Louis Chemical is still a \"large\" small business with Williams making all important decisions. He recognized the need to develop a professionalmanagerial staff, particularly in the area of fi nance. Recently, he hired Edison Hesselbach as the company's first finance professional and placed him in charge of the company's accounting and finance activities. St. Louis Chemical's board of directors is composed of Williams, his father and the company's attorney. The board's existence satisfi es state regulatory requirements for corporations but provides little, if any, input to business operations. CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION A chemical distributor is a wholesaler. Op erations may vary but a typical distributor purchases chemicals in large quantities (bulk - barge, rail or truckloads) from a number ofmanufacturers. They store bulk chemicals in \"tank farms\", a number of tanks located in areas surrounded by dikes. The tanks can receive and sh ip materials from all modes of transportation. Packaged chemicals are stored in a warehouse. Other distributor activities include blending,repackaging, and shipping in smalle r quantities (less than truckload, tote tanks, 55-gallon drums, and other smaller package sizes) to meet the needs of a variety of industrial users. In addition to the tank farm and warehouse, a distributor needs access to specialized delivery equipment (specialized truck transports, and tank rail cars) to meet the handling requirements of different chemicals. Adistributor adds value by supplying its customers w ith the chemicals they need, in the quantities they desire, when they need them. This requires maintaining a sizable inventory and operatingefficiently. Distributors usually operate on very thin profit margins. RMA Annual StatementStudies indicates \"profit before taxes as a percen tage of sales\" for Wholesalers - Chemicals and Allied Products (Standard Industrial Code Number 5169) is usually in the 3.0% range. In addition to operating efficiently, a successful distributor will possess 1) a solid customer base and 2) supplier contacts and contracts which will ensure a complete product line is available at competitive prices. THE SITUATION Because of his lack of finance expertise and his desire to maintain St. Louis Chemical's annual dividend, Williams has taken a conservative a pproach to growing the business, avoiding any action perceived as potentially risky. Capital expend itures have been tightly controlled, and this has, at times, restricted St. Louis Chemical's ability to take advantage of growth opportunities. Business growth has been steady but a recent increase in demand has placed a strain on existing operations.To keep pace with demand, the capacity of th e current warehouse and packaging operations need to be increased. The cost of the facility expa nsion has been estimated to be $900,000 by St. Louis Chemical's operation manager. In addition to avoiding risky capital expenditures, Williams has also followed a conservative financing policy. Since beginning operations, he ha s been reluctant to borrow funds, content withpage 20 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2limited growth, financed with internally gene rated equity. The only long-term debt on the company's balance sheet reflects vehicle financing. If the facility is to be expanded, additional external financing will be necessary and the current shareholders are reluctant to invest additional funds. Hesselbach, using input from an investment-b anking firm, has estimated the company's cost of equity to be 14%. A St. Louis bank has i ndicated a long-term bank loan can be arranged to finance expansion at an annual interest rate of 10%. The bank would require either loan to be secured with expansion and other company assets. The loan agreement would also include a number of restrictive covenants, including a limitation of dividends while the loans are outstanding. Only a small amount of long-term debt is included in th e firm's current capital structure, the firm's debt ratio at the end of 2009 was 21% and long-term debt was only .28% of total assets. Hesselbachcalculated that if a long-term bank loan was used to obtain the needed $900,000, the firm's debt ratio would increase to 30%. He believes a 30% debt and 70% equity capital mix would be conservative and a starting point for introducing long-term debt in to the firm's capital structure. Last year the company's federal-plus-state income tax rate wa s 35%. Hesselbach does not expect the income tax rate to change in the foreseeable future. Hesselbach has recommended borrowing the required funds. Williams indicated he may be willing to consider a change in his long-standing policy against debt, but wants more information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the firm's capital structure. THE TASK Assume the role of Hesselbach to answer the following questions.1) Prepare a presentation for Williams regarding th e concept of a firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 2) Calculate St. Louis Chemical 's WACC using a 30% debt and 70% equity capital structure. 3) Recalculate St. Louis Chemical's WACC (r ound to the nearest whole number) using a 40% debt and 60% equity capital structure. 4) Explain the difference between your answer to questions 2 and 3.5) What arguments should be made to convin ce the Williams of the advantage of using long-term debt in the firm's capital structure? What are the disadvantages? 6) Explain why an accurate WACC is important to a firm's long-term success.

CASE SYNOPSIS As Brian McPherson gazed out of his corn er-office window he reflected on the changes to his family's business. The family business was star ted in 1857 by his great, great, great grandfather, Cyrus McPherson. Cyrus McPherson had made his presence known in every aspect of the earlycompany's business. He could be seen on the production floor examining parts, giving orders tooperators on how to set up the equipment, and holding the reins of a horse-driven cart to distribute sewing machines to his customers. The elder McPherson was a demanding tyrant with anunyielding perseverance to insure that the family business grew and survived for future generations of McPherson's. Today, McPherson produces six models of sewing machines: a basic model and five specialty models each with its own dedicated pr oduction assembly line. While the growth potential for each model varies, all of the models requir e significant promotional efforts. In some cases, models need to be redesigned in order to become more competitive. Three models operate at75-80% of capacity, one at 30-35%, while two m odels operate at 15-20% of their capacity. As Brian reflected on his heritage, he knew that he must continue this family tradition for the generations of McPherson's to come. However, he also knew that the 21st century environment was significantly different than t hat the Cyrus' day. Brian was wrestling with such questions as: Should the company continue to produce all six m odels? Should some models be eliminated or consolidated with other models in production? When would issues of capacity force a decision about possible changes? Brian kn ew that his answers to these que stions would determine whether McPherson Manufacturing Company remained viable for future generations. McPHERSON MANUFACTURING COMPANY Brian McPherson gazed from his corner-o ffice window overlooking the Charles River and reflected on the changes to his family's business. The historic red-bricked building built in 1857 by his great, great, great grandfather, Cyrus Mc Pherson, was one of Boston's most distinctivepage 22 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2landmarks. Currently, the building houses the cor porate headquarters of McPherson Manufacturing Company, one of the major sewing machine manufact urers in the country and the center of the company's manufacturing operations. Cyrus McPherson, an immigrant Scotsman, made his presenceknown in every aspect of the early company's bus iness. He could be seen on the production floor examining sewing machine parts, giving orders to his operators on how to set up the equipment, and holding the reins of a horse-driven cart to distribute sewing machines to his customers in the hotsummers and cold winters of New England. The elder McPherson was a demanding tyrant with an unyielding perseverance to insure that the family business grew and survived for future generations of McPherson's. As Brian reflected on his herita ge, he knew that he must continue this family tradition for the generations of McPherson's to co me. However, he also knew that the 21st century environment was significantly different than that the Cyrus' day. The Global Industry: For the first half of the 20th century, sewing machine sales were steadily increasing in the United States; the latter ha lf of the 20th century, sales remained relatively flat. However, the reverse of this trend in the second half of the 20th century for overseas marketssaw a significant increase in sales specifically in the Asian-Pacific region. Led by a strong growth in Japan and subsequently China in 1998, the exports of Japanese and Chinese sewing machinessuperseded that of the United States. The majo r competitor in the United States is Singer, while SVP Worldwide is the global leader in all product categories. Historically, global pr ice increases range from 3%-5% on the high end products and 5%-10% on the low-end products. These global prices increases are due to the increases in costs for energy, raw materials, packaging, transportation, labor and currency exchange fluctuations. SVPWorldwide, the global leader of sewing machines reports on their website \"tightening credit markets and consumer postponement have combined to cause a ripple effect that has reached the globalsewing machine industry. Typically, the sewing, quilting, and embroidery markets have beenrelatively immune to recessionary periods, however, it is not the case with this current recession and is possibly the beginning of a protracted period of substantial contraction\" (SVP Worldwide, 2008). However, according to Consumersearch (2009, May) \"sewing is making a comeback, owing to the reality show hit \"Project Runway\" and the trend toward DIY crafting. The economy may also beinfluencing more people to try sewing and mending their clothing.\" Sales and Marketing: For the past 10 years, the sales of McPherson's sewing machines averaged about 100,000 units per year [See Table 1]. The distribution of company sales in theUnited States and overseas markets currently is 80% and 20% respectively. The product line mixconsists of 6 different products: Model A (basic m odel, lower cost, less product features); 3 specialty models (B, C, and D); and Products E and F ( both are the most expensive and have the most features). Models A, B, C, and D are expected to be most popular and have the highest demand. Models E and F, on the other hand, are expected to have limited demand. While the growth potential for each model varies, all of the models require significant promotional efforts. In some cases,models need to be redesigned in order to become more competitive. Model A [Basic Model]: standard line, starter model, best seller at 30% current domestic sales; potential for significant growth if promoted sufficiently to highlight its distinctiveness in overseas markets, specifically the home market; limited growth in domestic market; promotionshould focus on creating an awareness of the product to penetrate the overseas markets.Allied Academies International Conference page 23 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009 Model B [specialty model]: good seller; needs pr omotion and redesign to become more competitive; currently 28% of sales; potential for significant growth. Model C [specialty model]: relatively new product (5 years); requires a substantial marketing effort by a more experienced marketing manager to achieve product awaren ess; currently 11% of sales; potential growth possible. Model D [specialty model]: a version of th e basic model for a niche segment of the specialized commercial markets; possible expansi on but would require significantly more resources; 25% of current sales. Model E [specialty model]: one of the oldest products in the portfolio; perceived as outdated and stodgy; receives very little attention by sales personnel; redesign could make this product more attractive to customers; this model is often used as a \"hook\" that draws customers who may thenswitch to Models B or C for actual purchase; 3% of current sales; potential for some growth. Model F [specialty line]: little marketing activ ity; high cost to manufacture; limited growth in domestic market only; considered by some top managers as a \"staple line;\" 2% of current sales;considered the most vulnerable of the 6 products. Production: All production occurs in a single location in western Massachusetts. The rated capacity of this plant is 95%; Models A, B, and D operate at 75-80% of capacity, Model C isoperating at 30-35% of capacity, while Models E a nd F operate at 15-20% of their capacity. Rated production capacity for each product is based on the 2008 sales data. Each product has its owndedicated production assembly line. The only compatibility of production capability with minor equipment changes is production lines A, E, and F. All other production lines (B, C, and D) are unique in the production of their respective produc ts. The manager of the \"E\" production line is a long-term employee. The \"F\" production line is headed by a new employee who shows signs of bringing new ideas and methods to the slate of methods used in the past. Growth in the \"F\" production line is the manager's goal, and efforts are being made to increase domestic sales and some promotional activities have already taken pl ace. It is possible, however, that a capital investment of $50,000-$100,000 for changeover parts and employee retraining could enable theconsolidation of some of the 6 lines. If some of the lines were consolidated, the challenge to production management would be developing feas ible production schedules both aggregate and short-term and managing inventory levels and costs. To changeover or set up a production line it takes 10 workers per line. The compensation for the production workers is $16 per hour and benefits are a factor of 1.3. Each line changeover takes approximately 2 hours to complete. Inventory holding costs average $.60 per unit. As Brian finished his reflection of the stor ied history of the McPherson clan and the company intimately associated with his family, he be gan to turn his attention to the future of the company. Brian pondered whether McPherson Manuf acturing Company should change to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and if so, how? He knew that he would have to make difficult decisions as to whether the company should produce all 6 models in the future or eliminate some products and if so which one(s)?page 24 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Table 1 Sales Data for Each Product for Years 2000-2009 Year/Product A B C D E F TOTAL 2000 19,000 18,000 5,000 17,000 2,000 1,200 62,2002001 18,000 20,000 6,000 15,000 2,000 1,200 62,2002002 20,000 21,000 5,000 20,000 2,400 1,200 69,6002003 20,000 20,000 6,000 18,000 2,000 1,000 67,0002004 22,000 25,000 6,000 20,000 2,000 1,400 76,4002005 20,000 16,000 7,000 20,000 2,100 1,400 76,5002006 28,000 26,000 8,000 23,000 2,500 1,500 89,0002007 25,000 25,000 7,000 25,000 2,000 2,000 86,0002008 25,000 25,000 10,000 24,000 3,000 2,000 89,0002009 30,000 28,000 11,000 25,000 3,000 2,000 100,000 TOTAL 227,000 234,000 71,000 207,000 23,000 13,900 Source: McPherson Manufacturing Company Sales DepartmentAllied Academies International Conference page 25 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009ACTIVE INSURANCE, INC. John Leaptrott, Georgia Southern University J. Michael McDonald, Georgia Southern University William McCartney, Georgia Southern University CASE SYNOPSIS Jeff Ryan, owner of Active Insurance, Inc., is facing an important decision concerning the future growth of his business. Ward Stevens, the owner of Ward Stevens Insurance agency, is considering retirement has talked to several individuals, including Jeff, about acquiring his company. Jeff has discussed the possible acquisiti on with his accountant and together they have several concerns about the potential transaction. Jeff's primary concern is the difference in th e business models used by the two companies. Jeff started Active Insurance ten years ago and the age ncy has grown steadily to the point that it currently employs fifteen agents. Jeff has worked hard to make Active Insurance a customer-orientedfirm and has established policies that make it easy for customers to visit his office and to access products and services. Additionally, Jeff uses agency management software and has implemented several innovative personnel policies that he believes are key to his success. Jeff is committed totraining and development and is proud of the fact that he has taken a progressive approach tomanaging his business. On the other hand, the Stevens agency is a mo re traditional, slow changing company. The company is well established, with eighteen agent s who operate with a great deal of autonomy. However, the agency has not grown materially for a number of years. Mr. Stevens has not updatedhis operational or personne l practices since he started the firm and does not get involved in the day-to-day functions of the agency. Customer service, employee training and outside financial advisors all receive low priority from Mr. Stevens. His management philosophy is \"if it isn't broke, don't fix it\". So Jeff has to decide. Does he make the acquisition and deal with the operational and cultural differences in the two firms or does he forget the acquisition and focus on internal growth?page 26 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2CHIROPRACTIC MARKETING: MARKET SEGMENTATION & GROWTH STRATEGY Jeanny Y. Liu, University of La Verne Stephanie N. Van Ginkel, University of La Verne CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns changing trends within the chiropractic industry in which the Segmentation-Targeting-Positioning (STP) process becomes the mainemphasis for understanding consumer behavior as well as assessing markets. Secondary issuesexamined include: competitive advantage, differentiati on, social trends, and consumer behavior. The case has a difficulty level appropriate for senior l evel. The case is designed to be taught in two (2) class hours and is expected to require three (3) hours of outside preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS In January 2008, Roseville Chiropractic changed its name to Roseville Family Chiropractic (RFC) to provide a more family-oriented chir opractic and health wellne ss appeal in an uprising, metropolitan area of Sacramento, California. Being in practice for close to 10 years, RFC's stifling growth brought about a need for rethinking the ma rketing strategy. High volumes of competition are beginning to encroach on the market and RFC is in need of differentiating its services in order to secure their market share. Kevin Sherwood, RFC's current Director of Marketing, is looking to discover the environmental and behavioral changes of its consumers as well as identify potentialtarget markets for future sust ainability. Based on the researched information, he is expected to recommend segmentation, positioning, and communication st rategies to the partners of the practice. The following case study provides a thorough look for discussion of the chiropractic industry, a niche, but fragmented industry that is interesting to explore. It emphasizes and exploresSTP concepts that are essential for entreprene urial and marketing students to understand in order to be competitive in today's markets. This study includes the major marketing concepts arisingwithin study today, such as: c onsumer behavior and social trends among different generations, traditional marketing converging on digital and social networking techniques, the need for strategic repositioning to attract new markets, and the development of differentiating elements in order toassist in sustaining market share. INTRODUCTION Kevin Sherwood has been assisting his wife, Jennifer Cox, with her chiropractic practice doing various tasks from marketing to management since opening its doors in 1999. In 2008, thepractice added \"Family\" to the original Roseville Ch iropractic name in an effort to increase patient awareness on adopting chiropractic care for the entire family. Also occurring in 2008, one of theAllied Academies International Conference page 27 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009practitioners left the practice, leaving only Dr. Jennifer Cox and Dr. Juli Rodrigues as the lead chiropractors available for patient care, in which they now emphasized as one of the few practices regionally that had multiple and only female practiti oners. However, this was not the first time that a practitioner had left the practice. Frustration, ine fficiencies, and loss of revenue continued to build with a negative aura among the staff and confusion am ong the patients as to the type of services that were offered in the practice. Both practitioners ag reed that after the last practitioner left, it should be only themselves in the partnership and re-b randing of the practice along with Kevin's help to build-up the practice. (Sherwood, 2009) When Kevin started working full-time for the practice, he began to do a number of tasks from suggesting new ways to increase productivity and visibility to developing a general marketingstrategy for the practice. Kevin also began to thi nk of all the redundancies and inefficiencies there were in the current marketing plan. He realized nothing was ever marketed \"jointly\" or cohesivelyamong the practitioners. He also knew to compete among the industry competition locally andregionally, he would have to reintroduce the practice to the current target market and determinewhich additional or potential target markets to r each out to. Kevin also had to provide realistic segmentations of the current and potential new markets as well as determine the need for repositioning the practice in order to stay compe titive for future growth. A new marketing strategy was needed immediately to show the practice's differentiation qualities in order to sustain it abovethe competition as well as capture new market share. (Sherwood, 2009) THE CHIROPRACTIC INDUSTRY \"Chiropractic is the largest, most regulated, and best recognized of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professions. It is the third largest doctoral-level health care professionafter medicine and dentistry\" (American Chiropr actic Association, 2008). The chiropractic industry has been considered as an alternative treatment to those with disorders of the spine, pelvis, and joints (Weeks, 2005). According to the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (1996), \"the purpose of chiropractic is to optimize health\" and \"...is a h ealth care discipline which emphasizes the inherent recuperative power of the body to heal itself wit hout the use of drugs or surgery\". In 2006, there were 53,000 chiropractors employed in the US with a 14 percent change expected by 2016, in which 60,000 chiropractors are expected to be employed; a change that is faster than any otheroccupational average (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2007). Of all alternative medicine services, whichinclude chiropractic care, there is a projected growth of 88 percent be tween 1994 and 2010 - which is 72 percent higher than the expected growth of physician care during the same period (Stevens,Mansfield, & Loudon, 2005). The overall industry is considered a niche industry at best, however, it is a growing one due to the physical demands many have in their daily liv es as well as a distinction of a wellness need to many. To show this growth, \"in 2002, approximately 7.4 percent of the population used chiropractic care - a higher percentage than yoga, massage, acupuncture or other diet-based therapies\" (TheAmerican Chiropractic Association, 2008). Chiropract ors do not just focus \"...on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on generalhealth,\" but \"more than 40 [percent] of chiropractic patient visits were initiated for the purposes ofpage 28 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2health enhancement and/or disease prevention\" (American Chiropractic Association, 2008; Painter DC, 2008). There are many perceptions of chiropractors and of the overall industry, negative and positive. Chiropractors see themselves as \"...qualified as primary care providers...\", althoughpatients do not always match this perception, th erefore, affecting practice success (Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research, 2007). A st udy completed in 2005 showed that when asking a group of 250 non- and practicing c onsumers of chiropractic care whether chiropractors were a part of the medical profession or not, 79 percent felt chiropractors were and 91 percent felt chiropractors were not (Stevens, Mansfield, & Loudon, 2005). In addition, not all patients know exactly what chiropractors specifically practice. In a resear ch survey conducted, 1-in-5 saw chiropractors as dealing with aliments not specific to their trai ning, such as broken bones and blood disorders. Some even saw a chiropractor's training as being combin ed with such direct practices as reflexology, chiropody, and acupuncture (Carluccio, Norton, & Vasickova, 2004). PATIENT'S (CONSUMER) BEHAVIOR Traditionally, the medical industry has been based upon the face-to-face interaction of the physician-patient relationship. However, \"interacti ons between doctors and patients are inherently complex, and events in recent years have further compounded these relationships...[and] the Internetand related technologies [has added] to an already doctor-patient relationship\" (Friedewald, 2000). Patients have now become \"empowered\" by utilizing the Internet for theirinstant gratification of information by knowing wh at potentially could be ailing them, how to cure it, and other alternatives, now available 24-7 without waiting in an office. \"Inevitably, the mostimportant Internet-generated change in the physic ian-patient relationship will be the reduced need for face-to-face contact (Friedewald, 2000). The chiropractic industry is just as affected by thisincreasing social relationship trend. With chiropractic as an alternative medicine, this trend is alsoan advantage for tech-savvy practices to shift elemen ts of their marketing strategy to the Internet to capture the market looking for alternatives to traditional managed care. Social trends change constantly, challenging businesses in all industries to stay abreast of consumer behavior changes in order to stay comp etitive. The observable trend in medical businesses is the development of hybrid-practices that not only have traditional care, but also combine alternative or luxury-based care, i.e. plastic surgery, holistic care, massage therapy. This trend is notrecent and has been developing for almost tw o decades, with \"...the horizontal and vertical integration between health care facilities. Combining practices of complementary or differentspecialties can centralize a large number of needed services and provide customer convenience - a golden rule in service marketing\" (Hanna, Kiz ilbash, & Wagle, 1991). Chiropractors are seeing this trend and beginning to capture it by not only offeri ng the traditional services, but instituting wellness and alternative health prevention services as well. \"Keeping up with a market driven by client demand keeps business owners on their toes\" (Travis, 2006). Allied Academies International Conference page 29 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009PATIENT PROFILE According to statistics from the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (2005), most patients who seek chiropractic care had chief comp laints of pain in the low back/pelvis (23.6 percent), neck (18.7 percent), headache/facial (12 percent), and mid-back (11.5 percent). Approximately 20 million Americans use chiropractic services each year and spend at least $50billion per year on back pain (Homola, 2000; American Chiropractic Association, 1994). Of chiropractic patients, 60 percent are female, 56.7 percent are Caucasian, and 66 percent havegraduated or attended college (NBCE Publicati ons, 2005; MPA Media, 2009). In a research study, people indicated that they do not use chiropractic treatment because they believed that chiropractic treat was ineffective, produced negative side effects, and/or practitioners were not available inaccessible locations (Astin & Jain, 2001). Additiona lly, the study further indicated that the people who are less likely to use complementary alternative treatments (CAM), which include acupuncture,physical therapy, herbal remedies, and chiropractic care, are more likely to be male, in good health,believe therapies are ineffective or inferior, and do not have adequate knowledge of CAM. The demographics of RFC's patients are lifestyle s of desk-bearing jobs that are of a typical 8:00 am to 5:00 pm schedule to multi-tasking mothers who are highly active with their children.Many of these patients come to RFC due to stress, concerns about their health, fatigue, overwork, and pain. The chief complaint is pain, in order of frequency: headache, low back, neck,injury-related (car, personal, recreation, and work) and pregnancy; these cases are the most often seen. The average RFC patient is a Caucasian, fe male, 30 to 54-years-old, married, working in a professional/technical status, earning $30,001 to $50,000 annually, and having chiropractic care often at approximately 6 to 10 times per month. (Roseville Family Chiropractic, 2008) SERVICES PROVIDED BY ROSEVILLE FAMILY CHIROPRACTIC A variety of services and treat ments are offered for a wide range of patients by RFC. This includes primary and adjunctive chiropractic therapy. In addition, RFC offers services such as majorinsurance carriers for patient utilization, referrals, secondary evaluations, and Foot Levelersproducts. One of their major offerings is their in -practice wellness boutique that allows patients to learn more about and utilize simple tools for bette r personal wellness as well as products that aid in their consistent wellness while they are at home, work, and/or play. (Roseville Family Chiropractic, 2008) RFC also creates a specific ambiance among all its patients with the objective of becoming a part of the overall family's wellness from gra ndparents to children. This is done not only through the comradely within the office during patient visits, but the communication and communityinvolvement outside of the office with participation in city even ts to sending messages to patients for special events. RFC does not just want to be a nother \"medical visit\", but rather a family outing that improves the wellness of each person throughout their life. (Roseville Family Chiropractic,2009) page 30 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS Current advertising for RFC consists of local yellow pages, a website via a third-party hosted and designed website, a newsletter subscription that is given to all walk-in patients, a monthly events calendar available for all patients, and raffles. Word -of-mouth and patient referrals are a large source of marketing promotions as well. Coupons, free initial examinations, and trade shows are of thehighest preferred method of sales promotions. A limited budget hampers major marketing and salespromotions as well as additional advertising opportunities. RFC measures their success throughrevenues received and tracked on their specialized client database and billing system. (RosevilleFamily Chiropractic, 2008) RFC also holds and participates in many community events for their patients, such as Downtown Tuesday Nights, $20 Tuesdays, and Wa lking Wednesdays. Weekly and monthly themes are developed for their patients with certain da ys having specific discounts for specific segmented markets, i.e. 55 and older. RFC utilizes such prac tices in order to provide a sense of community not only with their current patient-base, but also w ithin the community they provide a service to, a means of \"giving back\". (Roseville Family Chiropractic, 2008) COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS In addition to the increase competition from lo cal competitors, RFC also faces threats from acupuncturists and massage therapists, which are gr owth venues for chiropractors in today's market. Approximately 85 percent of chiropractors provide massage therapy sessions directly or throughcertified massage therapists while 20 percent perform acupuncture and other related techniques.Acupuncture treatments are utilized for many disorder s, such as fibromyalgia, headache, and some chronic musculoskeletal syndromes. Natural produc ts, as well as the use of homeopathic products within the practice, such as herbals, vitamins , and food supplements, are also growing. Although it may be reasonable for chiropractors to seek various methods in alternative medicine, there is adanger for chiropractors in moving too far from their core knowledge. (Cooper & Heather, 2003) The major competitors around RFC offer not only basic chiropractic care, but also specialty services that may give them a competitive advant age among target markets that RFC is attempting to capture. One such practice offers cellular detoxification and the latest technology in spinalcorrection in a rehab setting (Chiropractic Health Centre, 2009). Another practice offers six specialtymassage treatments by a certified therapist while a chiropractic clinic offers physiologicaltherapeutic services, such as ultrasound a nd cryotherapy (Zawada Chiropractic, 2008; Jennings Chiropractic Neurology Clinic, Inc, 2009). CRITICAL DECISIONS Being in practice for close to 10 years, RFC's growth has developed a need for a comprehensive marketing plan in order to: gain a stronger presence in their main target market, expand to new markets, and build healthier reve nue generation. With high volumes of competition encroaching, RFC is in need of bringing out a ll their competitive advantages. Timing was crucialAllied Academies International Conference page 31 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009and focus on the right marketing tools was needed. Kevin knew digital advertising and Internet presence was the future for business success, but unknow n for RFC. Social trends within the medical industry, specific to wellness prevention, were e xpanding as traditional service-only business plans were decreasing. The need to expand to new markets was an important element for RFC. This wasdue to potentially repositioning the practice while u tilizing differentiated services that would allow RFC to stay highly competitive among the market . If the right opportunities were not executed at the right time with weaknesses solved, any stre ngths would soon weaken and the threats would supersede their goals. Competition would continue to strengthen around them and their patient-basewould diminish. Kevin began to gather all the relevant information and prepared to make recommendations. He wanted to explore other target markets in or der to build the patient-base, while both practitioners were seeking to re-brand the practice and accentuat e the \"family\" appeal. He understood that their marketing budget was limited, which increased the need to use their resources on the correctmarkets. There were many questions that need to be addressed: What should RFC's role be to the patients? Should they expand their services? Should they seek to position themselves as the wellness expert for the entire family? How could they market their message effectively to increase theirpatient-base? A number of factors would have to be considered, in addition to how to approach the new marketing strategy, if any, as well as culminate all the new elements needed to revamp RFCsuccessfully.page 32 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2AUSTRALIAN DREAM: AN AMERICAN DREAM Stephen L. Loy, Eastern Kentucky University Steve M. Brown, Eastern Kentucky University Mark Case, Eastern Kentucky University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary focus of this case is on how a sm all business that has been successful selling an over-the-counter arthritis cream in a regional market can refocus to compete in a national market. The secondary issues include marketing, strategic management, entrepreneurship ande-commerce issues. Students are provided a scenario of a small bus iness that is on the ver ge of taking off. The case requires students to do a SW OT analysis, analyze the market environment using Porter's five forces model, and to analyze the business ph ilosophy and practices of an emerging company. Students should develop a plan for moving the consumer product from a local/regional market toa national market in order to generate sufficient sales to stay on the major chain store shelves. The case has a difficulty level of four and is appropriate for senior level classes or higher. It can be taught in two hours of class time, w ith students spending six to twelve hours of outside preparation. At the request of the company, this case does not contain any detailed financial data or financial strategy. CASE SYNOPSIS Phil and Mark Maddox formed a small company , Nature's Health Connection (NHC), to market a skin cream that was being sold through Phil's pharmacy. NHC purchased the small company that made the skin cream. The distinguish ing ingredient in the cream was emu oil. In 2000, an new ingredient was added to the cream to crea te Australian Dream\u00ae Arthritis Relieving Cream (AD). Over the past ten years, the attempt to grow the company has been difficult and at times nerve racking. However, growth has been steady due to a trial and error decision-making process, a little luck, and the sheer determination of the brothers. They make a good team by complimenting each other's strengths. The initial strategy was to market ADARC to independent pharmacies in the southeast United States. The product has a high price relative to its competitors, but provides an attractive profit margin for the pharmacies. Advertising was limited to in-store displays and local newspaper ads. The product has a loyal customer base and appea rs to be recession proof, but sales volume has not grow much until recently. Recently, Walgreens began selling ADARC in many of its stores across the country. Once this happened, ADARC was quickly picked up by othe r large chain stores. The investment required to keep these national accounts almost caused Phil to throw in the towel. Going national requiresAllied Academies International Conference page 33 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009costly changes in advertising strategy that seemed insurmountable. However, they are adapting quickly. NHC's growth has gotten the attention a broker wanting to know if NHC is for sale. Phil, the entrepreneur and risk taker, strongly believes NHC will be worth a lot more if they can create a national brand image, introduce other products , and expand their distribution through other national and regional chains. The big question facing NHC is: How to do it? INTRODUCTION Nine months ago Phil Maddox almost called it quits. He was getting very discouraged with the way things were going at Natures Health Connection (NHC), a company he helped co-found with his brother Mark in 1998. Phil's vision has always been to grow NHC into a viable nationalcompany. Since that time, a series of shrewd pr omotional moves have instilled new life into their sales despite the national economy nose diving into the worst recession since the 1930s. According to Phil, the journey over the past ten years has been filled with plenty of bumps, pitfalls and sleepless nights. Daily operations and progress has been hard, grinding and at timescaused him to think about quitting. The company ha s grown through a series of steps -- rapidly at times and more slowly at other times. However, through trial and error, calculated decisions, and sometimes sheer luck, the Maddox brothers have managed to grow the sales of their primary product, Australian Dream\u00ae Arthritis Relieving Cream (ADARC) from a local market to a regional market, and now to the national market. The growth of ADARC has caught the eye of a business broker w ho wanted to if the Mattox brothers were interested in selling NHC. Instead of selling out, Phil and Mark want to develop astrategy to double, even, triple sales of ADARC. ISSUES \"Hard work and perseverance are keys to our success. We have experienced numerous setbacks, but we learned from them and move d forward. Our first manufacture had undisclosed financial problems, and our second one couldn't meet shelf life requirements resulting in majorinventory losses. We have had to redesign our pack aging to meet shipping and display restrictions, we have had problems with our sales reps, our Web site needed to be redesigned, and we have had to experiment with our advertising to get it to work. I like being creative and problem solving, but all of this is time consuming and nerve wracking for me.\" \"I'm a risk taker, and Mark is risk adverse, probably because of his back ground as an attorney. Sometimes I wished I owned 51 percent of the company. Then I could do what I want. But, I'll have to admit that Mark has saved us from moving down a disastrous path more than once. Like the time I wanted to dump a lot of money into TV advertising. We actually make a good team\" \"Recently I made a decision to put a lot of my own money in to NHC because Mark had cold feet. This was about in the time I was ready to throw in the towel. We had come to a point wherewe had an opportunity to the company to a new level by going national or just remaining a regionalcompany. Walgreens offered us a deal to market ADARC throughout their entire chain. But, wewould have to meet certain volume bench benchmarks or be dropped after a trail period.\" page 34 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2\"We knew one of the keys to our past succes s was advertising at the local level through newspapers. We tried to do what we did locally at the national level. It just didn't work. It was ridiculously expensive. I felt we could get sim ilar results through placing ads in nationally read magazines, but this was also very expensive and Mark dug his heels on taking this risk. I floated the cost on my own, and it appears to be working. Ev ery time we run ads in the magazines all of our sales increase.\" \"Even though we are in midst of a major recession, our Walgreen sales have remained steady. Walgreens recently cut 10 per cent of their shelf items, and we survived the cut. It appears that we are on the verge of meeting their volume re quirements. I attribute this to the fact that we have a good product, and that our ma gazine ads are working. If this trend continues, I feel strongly that we will be able to land the CVS account, othe r national grocers like Kroger, plus large regional pharmacies and grocers\" \"With this kind of volume, we should be able to establish a national brand image and become a household name like Icy-Hot and Bengay. We ar e already considering launching a new product using our current business model. It would be relatively easy and fa irly inexpensive. By making a slight change in the formula of our skin cream, we could to turn it into an anti-wrinkle cream that could be piggybacked to ADARC since it could be made by the same outsource manufacturer, target the same demographic group, and use the same dist ribution channels and promotional strategy. But do we really to grow by expanding our product lin e before ADARC is firmly established as a national brand?\" Recently, we got a feeler from a business broker asking if we are interested in selling our company. The amount of money he mentioned was p eanuts compared to what we could make from creating a national brand with mass distribution. It's tempting to think about cashing out and building another company, but now isn't the right time. Getting the capital to for a big campaign turn ADARC into a mass market brand name won't be easy. One option is to turn NHC into a publicly held corporation, but I really don't want to do th at. I like the freedom to make decisions without worrying about stockholders.\"Allied Academies International Conference page 35 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009CHANGING AUDITORS-THE CASE OF CALLAWAY GOLF COMPANY AND ITS FOUR DIFFERENT AUDITORS IN ONE YEAR Brad J. Reed, Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville CASE DESCRIPTION This case requires the student to research the professional literature regarding auditor changes. Students are required to research Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS)regarding changing auditors. Additionally, students are required to research the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) rules regarding disclo sure of changing auditors on Form 8-K. The case is appropriate for senior level and/or graduat e level auditing courses. The difficulty level of the case is 3/5. The suggested final product of this case is a short memo where the student evaluatesthe possible reasons why a company may change auditors as well as the required responses from the auditor. The student is also asked to evaluate and discuss the required auditing the impact ofthe recommended solution on the company's financial stat ements. It is also possible to use the case as a vehicle for discussion when presented by the professor in a class setting. The case is adapted from Callaway Golf Company's 8-K filing where a disagreement between Callaway Golf Company and their auditor is discussed. Additional information is taken from Callaway Golf Company's 10-K filing. As such, this case exposes students to a real-world situation. CASE SYNOPSIS How could a publicly held company that is in the public's eye and whose stock is traded on the NYSE have four different auditors in approximatel y one year? This case details the strange set of events that led Callaway Golf Company (Callaway) to have four different auditors in a shortperiod of time. The culminating event of the case is a disagreement between Callaway and the auditing firm of KPMG Peat Marwick (KPMG) re garding the appropriate accounting treatment for a financial statement item. While most companies and auditors go to great efforts to keep anyaccounting dispute private, both Callaway and the auditor in this case were willing to make the details of the dispute public. As such, this case provides some interesting details on the relationship between a company and its auditor and how accounting standards are often open to differentinterpretations. Callaway is known for making numerous types of golf equipment, including clubs, putters, balls, and drivers. In March of 2002, Arthur Ande rsen was dismissed by the Board of Directors of Callaway because the audit committee was concer ned about the future of the accounting firm. Callaway hired KPMG to replace Arthur Ande rsen. In December 2002, Callaway Golf dismissed KPMG due to disagreements with management about accounting for Callaway's warranty reserves.page 36 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Callaway thought that the change in the warranty re serve should be treated as a change in estimate, while KPMG thought that the change should be trea ted as a correction of an error. Callaway felt so strongly about this accounting issue, that when Callaway and KPMG could not agree on the appropriate accounting treatment, Callaway dism issed KPMG and hired a replacement auditor. HISTORY In 1991 Callaway introduced the Big Bertha driv er. The Big Bertha was the first wide body stainless steel \"wood\" introduced in the golf ma rket. The founder of Ca llaway Golf, Ely Reeves Callaway Jr., is credited with the idea of a stainle ss steel golf club taking its name from a World War I German cannon known for its long-distance capabilitie s. In 1991 Mark Brooks was the first PGA Tour player to use the Big Bertha to win a PGA tournament at the Greater Greensboro Open. The Big Bertha was an instant success and the following year the company went public on the NYSEunder the ticker symbol ELY (Callaway website). PricewatherhouseCoopers LLP had been the company's auditor since Callaway's IPO, but the firm was released in 2001 because the audit committee believed that having a new auditor would enhance the auditor's independence. Arthur Andersen LLP was appointed as the new auditor in2001. In March 2002, Arthur Andersen was dismissed due to concerns about the future of Arthur Andersen and KPMG was hired. In December 2002, KPMG was dismissed due to a disagreement over an accounting issue involving the company's warranty liability and Deloitte & Touche was appointed as the new auditor. It is import ant to note that Callaway had always received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements (Callaway 8-K, 10-K). Required:1. What are some of the reasons a company may change auditors?2. What is the relevant section of GAAS that discusses a change in auditors? What does GAAS require of the new auditor when there is a change in auditors? 3. What is a Form 8-K. What is its purpose? What are the rules regarding 8-K's when there is a change of auditors.

Robert J. Routman, University of South Carolina Upstate Jeff Smith, University of South Carolina Upstate CASE DESCRIPTION This case focuses on the difficulties of delineation between charitable organizations chartered with tax-exempt status for the purpose of serving the good of the public and theclassification of a business entity operating in th e capacity of supplying a product in demand in the market. It is designed for use in Advanced Accounting, New Business Enterprise and/or Entity Taxation courses. CASE SYNOPSIS Few regulatory resources are committed to monitoring the mission, purpose and operations of organizations after they initially receive tax-exem pt status from the IRS and their charter from the office of the Secretary of State in which it resides. Avenues potentially exist for non-profitorganizations to operate as a business and reap the financial benefits of being organized as an eleemosynary entity, exempt from the burden of income tax, sales tax, and property taxes. BACKGROUND In 1986, Upward began in Spartanburg, SC as a youth basketball program at First Baptist Church. Subsequently, it was formally organized in 1995 as Upward Unlimited, a South Carolinanon-profit corporation. Upward is qualified as an IRC \u00a7501(c)(3) charitable organization. Its published mission statement is \"to introduce children to Jesus Christ by creating opportunities toserve through sports.\" Their materials frequently list their emphasis on non-competitiveparticipation, with the motto \"every child is a wi nner.\" Two thirds of the stated 506,000 participants in the leagues and programs play basketball, while the remainder participate in cheerleading, flag football and soccer. Upward's revenues now exceed $28 million annually. THE MODEL Upward provides uniforms, administrative materials (time sheets, forms, etc.) and handbooks (both coaching handbooks and player handbooks) which churches in various communities then use to organize basketball leagues. For example, starter kit items for a basketball team includeregistration brochures, brochure display, upward bask etball director's manual, advertising posters, prayer reminders, and a coach training kit. The coach's items for a basketball team include, coachplaybook with DVD, coach shirt, referee DVD, pare nt orientation flyer, referee handbook, scripturepage 38 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2learning cards, award stars, gospel pack, t eamupward.com basketball welcome card and a teamupward.com coach introduction card. Upward states: \"Our goal is to free you up to focus on ministry. Upward provides everything you need to administer your league and everything your coaches need to lead their teams. Upward also provides a variety of items, including jerseys, for each of your participants that they get to keep even after the season is complete. These items are pre-packaged by team and labeledwith each child's name for easy distribution.\" The individual churches provide, without cost to Upward, the manpower (coaches, referees, league commissioners, etc.) and the facilities (gymnasiums, electricity, basketballs, etc.). In thebasketball leagues, players pay a $99 fee directly to Upward, and receive a uniform which consists of shorts and a reversible jersey. Players also receive a handbook, as do the coaches. A new member church commences organization of an Upward sports league by paying $400 for up to four representatives to attend an Upwa rd Leadership Training Conference in Spartanburg, SC. Additional attendees cost $100 each and a dditional training conferences may optionally be attended. Upward's philosophy is to organize league structure and team structure so as to equalize talent and to insure all participants receive equal playing time. The emphasis is on a Christianatmosphere while participating in sports, with Bibl e lessons during halftime. Players receive \"stars\" for their participation, with no individual being rewarded or credited for individual accomplishmentsor achievements athletically. Upward's mission statement purports to be a relig ious ministry through sports. A corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes is exempt from taxation under IRC\u00a7501(c)(3). However, IRS Publication 598 explai ns that a tax exempt organization may still be subject to taxation on unrelated business income de fined as \"income from a trade or business that is regularly carried on by an exempt organization and that is not substantially related to theperformance by the organization of its exempt purpos e or function ,except that the organization uses the profits derived from the unrelated business.\" Activities do not lose their \"identity as a trade or business merely because it is carried on within a larger group of similar activities\" by the exempt organization as when an exempt hospital's pharmacy engages in sales to the general public. Id. To be substantially related to an organization's ex empt purpose, a business activity must contribute importantly as determined by \"the size and extent of the activities involved in relation to the nature and extent of the exempt function that they inte nd to serve.\" Id. If \"an activity is conducted on a scale larger than is reasonably necessary to perform an exempt purpose, it does not contributeimportantly.\" Id. \"The part of an activity that is more than needed to accomplish the exempt purpose is an unrelated trade or business.\" Id. FINANCIAL RESULTS The following is a compilation from the last 3 years corporate tax returns (Form 990) filed by Upward:Allied Academies International Conference page 39 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 20092007 2006 2005 Sales of inventory 28,360,132 24,166,205 21,833,035 (EOY) 27,036,123 21,057,748 18,006,730 Changes in net assets for non-profit entities is e quivalent to net income in the profit world. These changes in net assets are the equivalent to retained earnings in the business world. Non-profits do not distribute any \"earnings\" as dividend distributi on; therefore all changes in net assets directly increase or decrease the fund balance.

Schneider, Quinnipiac University Aamer Sheikh, Quinnipiac University Kathleen Simione, Quinnipiac University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case con cerns earnings management to achieve income smoothing. Secondary issues examined include the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and accounting practices in the home building industry. Th e case has a difficulty level of four or five and can be used in upper-division financial accounting cou rses. The case is designed to be taught in two class hours and is expected to require four hours of outside preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS This case provides students with a real world example of alleged income smoothing and its consequences. Students are asked to analyze the earnings management techniques used and discussthe implications for management of the use of income smoothing. ABOUT BEAZER HOMES Beazer Homes builds and sells predominately si ngle-family residences in 17 states across the United States. In recent years, the company has been ranked consistently as one of the top ten residential home builders in the country, based on number of homes built and sold (Beazer Homes,2002; Beazer Homes, 2005; Beazer Homes, 2008). The company started as Beazer PLC, a home builder in the United Kingdom. Beazer Homes entered the U.S. residential housing markets in 1985 with the purchase of Atlanta home builder, Cohn Communities.The Koppers acquisition, financed completely with bank loans, gave BeazerHomes a strong presence in the U.S. construction market, but saddled the company with substantialdebt just in time to face the declining housing markets in both the United Kingdom and the United States in the early 1990s. After se veral years of negotiating with banks regarding repayment plans for this debt, the company was acquired by Hanson PLC, a British company. Hanson PLC spun offBeazer homes in 1994 and the company went public later that year as an independent, U.S.-onlyhome construction conglomerate (Lurz, 1994; New York Times, 1994). As the U.S. real estate markets improved, Beazer Homes made additional acquisitions were made that expanded Beazer Homes into new regions in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and West. By 2000 the company was selling about 8,000 homes each year and by 2005 they were selling morethan 18,100. However, the real estate crisis, the general recession, and the near-collapse of the financial markets hit all major home builders hard. Beazer Homes was not immune to these industrypage 42 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2trends and the company's sales dropped dramatically to 7,700 homes in 2008 (Funding Universe, 2009). INCOME SMOOTHING Companies with volatile earnings are considered by investors to have higher degrees of inherent risk than companies that report earnings that grow in a steady pattern, showing regular increases every year. Because of th e increased level of risk perceive d as inherent in companies with volatile earnings increases and decreases, the stock of those companies trades at a discount relative to the stock of companies with smooth and st eady earnings growth (Brigham and Ehrhardt, 2007). Income smoothing is the result of carefully mana ging earnings (net income) to show a smooth, steady growth in earnings each year rather than volatility (Buckmaster, 2001). Earnings management can also be used to understate earnings in good years and overstate earnings in bad years. This income smoothing strategy reduces variability in reported earnings. Revenues and expenses are shifted between acc ounting periods. Firms report higher revenues and/or expenses in some periods and lower in other peri ods, effectively shifting net income from successful periods to less successful periods. THE SEC INVESTIGATION The SEC began an informal i nquiry into violations of Federal securities laws at Beazer Homes that became a formal order of investigati on in 2007 (Wall Street Journal, 2007). The alleged accounting irregularities stemmed from abusive earnings management that resulted in fraudulentmisstatements of net income over a multi-year pe riod. Specifically, the SEC alleged that improper recording of Beazer's cost of goods sold for la nd development and house costs and improper revenue recognition in accounting for sale-leaseback transactions caused a material and fraudulentmisstatement of net income (Corkery, 2008). By the time the SEC had completed their investigation, Beazer found itself charged with submitting materially false company filings fo r years 2001 through 2007. Specifically, Beazer was charged with the fraudulent misstatement of net income for the purpose of improperly managing its quarterly and annual earnings. Although never admitting or denying the SEC allegations, BeazerHomes did reach a settlement with the government. As part of that settlement, Beazer adjusted and restated its financial statements for the fis cal years 1998 through 2006 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2007 (Corkery, 2008). The company also consented to the entry of a cease and desist order for future violations. The SEC noted both Beazer's remedial actions and its cooperation asfactors in reaching the settlement (SEC, 2008). The consequences for Beazer Homes of these problems have been si gnificant, especially when combined with the general malaise in the home building industry. Beazer's stock price reached a high of $79.12 on January 13, 2006; in 2009, the stoc k consistently traded below one dollar per share, hitting a low of $0.25 on March 9, 2009. Beazer Homes announced that its chief accounting officer (CAO), Michael T. Rand, was terminated as a result of his alleged efforts to destroydocuments related to the SEC investigation. The SEC filed a separate complaint against Rand aftersettling the charges with Beazer Homes (SEC, 2009). The SEC alleges that Rand's misconduct ledAllied Academies International Conference page 43 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009to inflated reserves and other accrued liabilities in earlier periods. Further, the complaint alleges that Rand's conduct was intended to maximize bonuses and meet or exceed analysts' expectations. Ineffect, the SEC in this complaint is holding Rand accountable for all of the charges made against the company. According to SEC (2009), Rand's scheme to manage the earnings of the homebuilder was multi-faceted. The first part of the scheme i nvolved manipulation of the land inventory accounts. As Beazer constructed its subdivisions, costs accumulated in the land inventory accounts wereallocated to individual home lots. When the home wa s later sold, the allocated costs in the account were expensed as a cost of sale. From 2000 to 2005 Beazer over-allocated land invent ory costs in material amounts that gave it excessive reserves and other accrued liabilities in violation of GAAP. This caused Beazer to understate income by a cumulative total of $42 million between 2000 and 2005. Beginning in 2006, the over-allocations were reversed, causing an ove rstatement of income of $17 million in 2006 and the first two quarters of 2007 (SEC, 2008; 2009). In the time under investigation that pr eceded 2006, Beazer owned most (70-80%) of its model homes. The models it did not own were financed using sale-lease back arrangements withthird parties. Revenue on these transactions was r ecognized in full at the beginning of the lease term. Near the end of 2005, however, Beazer entered into se veral sale-leaseback transactions that included written side agreements in which Beazer retained th e right to a percentage of the appreciation on the home up through the time of its eventu al sale. Beazer's independent auditor advised Beazer that the substance of these transactions outweighed their form and that Beazer would have to account for them as financing transactions, which would pr eclude Beazer from recording the sales as revenue at the beginning of the lease term. To avoid th is accounting treatment, Beazer is alleged to have included the appreciation rights in oral side agreements, which it allegedly did not disclose to itsauditors (SEC, 2008; 2009). QUESTIONS Most of these questions will require that you do research beyond reading the case. You can use the resources of your library and the Web, especi ally the SEC Web site, to conduct this research. Your instructor might recommend specific resources for particular questions. 1. Did any of the officers of Beazer Homes, othe r than the CAO, face consequences as a result of the company's settlement with the SEC? 2. Why did Beazer Homes' management fire th eir CAO for destruction of documents rather than for carrying out the alleged accounting irregularities? 3. What are the most likely reasons that Beazer engaged in the alleged accounting irregularities? 4. Is it possible to identify a pattern of earnings management in Beazer's restated earnings?5. What were the specific effects on the financial statements of the restatements to which Beazer agreed?page 44 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2DISCLAIMER This case was written using publicly available information to provide a setting for student learning.

Sigmar, Sam Houston State University Rene\u00e9 Gravois-Lee, Sam Houston State University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter for this case involves the sales approach of a kiosk vendor, selling nail and skin care products, in a suburban American mall. The dialogue contains diversepersuasive appeals and customer responses. This case was designed for use in undergraduatebusiness communication, marketing, or personal selli ng courses, particularly courses that address analysis of persuasive appeals and/or personal se lling techniques, and development of persuasive communications. The case could be taught in two 50-minute or one 75-minute session(s) and is expected to require two hours of outside preparation by student s. It can be used as a follow-up to class discussion of persuasive appeals or a range of personal selling techniques, or as a preliminaryassignment to a written persuasive appeal or persuasive role play. CASE SYNOPSIS While shopping at a local mall, Lana Thomps on is approached by a young woman dressed in a white dress shirt, black slacks and black apron, who offers Lana a slice of colorful soapwrapped in tissue paper. Lana slows her pace, accepts the gift, smells the soap fragrance, thenturns toward the kiosk that features a variety of skin and nail products. The sales associate, Salima, selects another colorful soap sample from her tray and offers it to Lana who st ops to accept it. This \"hook,\" effective in its appeal to the senses, entices the customer, and the ensuing sales exchange focuses on the exclusive, mineral-rich beauty products from the Dead Sea. The sales call alsodemonstrates a number of other classic persuasive appeals, including scientific, emotional,rational, character, comparative, vanity and sensory. The dialogue also stim ulates class discussion of selling techniques including the hook, non-verbal and verbal selling techniques, features and benefits, customer care, responding to objections, and closing the deal. CASE DIALOGUE It was a leisurely Sunday afternoon in Augus t, and Lana Thompson decided to go shopping at the Centerville Mall for nothing in particular. Her first stop, upon arrival, was the Java KingCoffee Shop for her usual-a medium vanilla latt\u00e9-a nd as she strolled slowly down the mall's spacious and carpeted concourse, Lana enjoyed slow and indul gent sips of her favor ite beverage. She paid little attention to the various kiosks strategically positioned at intervals along her way, and focused her attention on the extravagant window displays of clothing and jewelry. page 46 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2As Lana slowly approaches the Atlantis Sp a Products kiosk, she is awakened from her reverie by an attractive sales representative appro aching her with a shy smile. Salima, dressed in black slacks, a crisp white shirt and black apron, is holding a tray of colorful soap samples. Shegracefully selects a sliver of colorf ul, translucent soap wrapped in ti ssue paper, and offers it to Lana. THE HOOK Salima: Please... (Offers a soap sample to Lana as she passes by the kiosk.) Lana: (Lana pauses, takes the sample, and smells.) Oh, thank you. M mmmm...this smells wonderful.Salima: Would you like another?Lana: (Lana stops and turns toward the kiosk.) Yes, thank you. This one smells good, too.Salima: Yes. (Smiles and nods in agreement.) I am Salima. What is your name?Lana: Lana.Salima: Lana. Is such a beautiful name. Where are you from, Lana?Lana: I live here in Centerville.Salima: I am from Jordan, in a city called Amman. Lana: You're a long way from home.Salima: (Smiles.) Yes, I have been here only for six months. How is my English? You can understand me?Lana: Oh, it's fine. You speak very well for only being here six months.Salima: Lana, can I ask you something? It's a little personal.Lana: Well, yes.Salima: May I see your hands?(Lana holds out her hands. Salima studies them intently, then nods her head knowingly.)Salima: Hmmm...You go to the nail salon sometimes?Lana: Yes.Salima: Do you mind if I ask...About how much do you spend there?Lana: Oh, it costs me about $30 for a manicure.Salima: So, $30 for manicure, then maybe a nother $30 for a pedicure if you get that, too? Plus, you have other costs, too, like your tip a nd your gas to get there. So, about $80 twice a month is what most women pay to go to the nail salon. Lana: (Nods in agreement) Yes, the expenses do add up pretty quickly. THE \"MAGIC\" Salima: May I show you something for your nails? May I take your hand? (Lana extends her hand, and Salima inspects it.) Are you doing your own nails?Lana: Yes. And sometimes I go to the salon.Salima: Hmmm. See these ridges? See how dull? Now, I have something amazing here.I will show you on one finger. Don't look until I am finished. (Salima buffs Lana's fingernail using a four-sided buffing block, talking as she buffs). Allied Academies International Conference page 47 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009This side of the block is for the ridges a nd for cleaning the nail, and you see I buff five seconds, one...two...three...four...five. Now, this side is for the circulation. This brings up all the natural oils and stimulates blood circulation and massages the nail so it growsfaster, one...two...three...four...five. Now, I buff this time with the magic side,one...two...Now don't look until I am done...three...four...Lana: What is on the magic side?Salima: (Lowers her voice to a whisper.) Is pure silk. (Salima continues buffing) So, three...four...five with the silk side. Now, don't look ye t (Salima holds her finger over Lana's fingernail). You see, all you need is to buff with three sides for five seconds each.This cleans your nail, brings all the natural o ils up to the surface, and helps it grow faster. Saves you time. Saves you money. Are you ready to see difference in your nails?Lana: (Now curious.) Yes. (Salima positions Lana's hand under the kiosk light and ceremoniously removes her finger from Lana's nail.)Lana: Wow! What a difference. Salima: (Smiles knowingly). Ye s. And it will stay shiny for the next two weeks. Look at what was before (points to Lana's other nails on that hand) and what is after (points to the buffed nail). So you know that this is good? You see all the lines and ridges here in this nail? But in this nail that we just buffed-gone. And you see how easy? Use this side of the buffer for five seconds, this side for five sec onds, and the magic side for five seconds. Easy. And so much difference. Just look at the difference.Lana: You're right. This nail is really shiny. THE HEALING MINERALS OF THE DEAD SEA Salima: Now, let me show you something else amazing. This... (Lana picks up a bottle filled with clear liquid.)... is a cuticle oil made from minerals from the Dead Sea. You see all the dry, dead skin around your nail? (Salima holds Lana's hand, pointing to her cuticles.) Now, we justmassage this oil into your cuticle-it is full of nutrients. Then we are going to see really shine! (Salima massages the cuticle oil into th e top of Lana's nail.) And again we count. One...two... three...four... five... and look!Lana: Wow, what a difference. My skin actually feels better and softer on that finger. Salima: Yes...and really simple, one...two...thr ee...four...five. And look at the difference from your other cuticles that are dry. It's lik e your lips. When you have dry lips, what do you do? You moisturize them. Your nails need that moisture, too.Lana: (Nods.) Mmmm-hmmm.Salima: And you do your nails by yourself-fast and easy-without having to go to the salon.How much is it at nail salon did we say, about $80 for twice a month? That's almost $160 a month, or over $1,000 a year for your hands and feet, right? This is so much cheaper. Andyou know the best thing? (Long pause.)Lana: (Curiously.) What?page 48 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Salima: (Salima lowers her voice.) The lifetime warranty. Lana: What do you mean?Salima: (Peels off sides of the nail buffer.) These sides of the buffer, you get them anytime from us, free. You use them, you need more, you come see me in the mall and I replacethem. I give you my phone number and my e-mail. How much for nail salon each month?$160 or more! How much is that a year? (Lana rolls her eyes.) Oooooooo - more than $1,000in a year. For you, this package, with all the Dead Sea minerals for your nails, only $79! For whole year's supply. That's a lot cheaper than one visit to nail salon! And inside you get four things...(Salima carefully opens the package of na il products and shows Lana the four products inside. ) You get the buffer with lifetime warranty, whic h you can bring to any of the malls and you get replacement free. No charge. Or you call me anytime, and you say you wantreplacement, I mail it to your home. Free. Also you get the cuticle oil. And this nail file. And a lotion with minerals from the Dead Sea.Lana: I think $79 is pretty expensive for a manicure set. Salima: Well, remember that these products w ill last the whole year for you. So easy to use and saves you so much money. And look at this. (Gently, almost reverently, Salima picks up Lana's hand again and points to her buffedfingernail.)How shiny is this? And you know how proud I am of these products? Because five days from now, your nail will still be shiny. Ten days from now your nail will be shiny. And soeasy. Buff with this side first, then this, then this, and look. Or, if you need to go even faster, just use the white side-the silk side-and buff one...two...three...four...five, and look, everything is so simple, you cannot imagine. You go to the nail salon and everything is so expensive and the products are made fromchemicals, not natural. Don't go to the nail sa lon. Our products are safe and natural. With our products, you get a professional manicure. And you don't have to go to the nail salon, the nail salon comes to you. And look -- (Again, Salima points to Lana's nail) -- this is the natural shine of your nail - no chemicals. What do you think? You like the way your nail is so smooth and shiny and natural?Lana: Yes.Salima: The set comes with lotion from the Dead Sea, too. Which of these lotions do you like best? (Lana points to four lotion bottles, each labeled with the na me of the fragrance.) Lana: Let me smell the Sea Breeze one and the Blue Sky one.Salima: (Salima open the two bottles and gives them to Lana.) Which fragrance do you likebest?Lana: I think Sea Breeze. It smells so fresh. Salima. Here, I put on your hand. (Salima put s a drop of lotion on Lana's hand and rubs it in slowly.) It leaves your skin relaxed a nd hydrated. You like the smell and feel of the lotion? Lana: This lotion is nice. It makes my skin feel so silky.Allied Academies International Conference page 49 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009Salima: That's because of the minerals in the sea, it's all very fresh all of the time. All natural. Not made in China, not made in Japan. It's made in Jordan from the waters of the Dead Sea. Not with chemicals. (Salima hands Lana a bottle of the Sea Breeze lotion.) Have you heard of the Dead Sea? Do you know where it is?Lana: (Hesitates.) I think it's in the Mediterranean? Salima: The Dead Sea is a salt lake in the Jordan Valley, between Jordan, where I am from, and Israel. It's very tranquil in the Dead Sea, and very rich in minerals. Since early times, women have known about the medicinal propertie s of the Dead Sea. Have you ever heard of Cleopatra? (Lana nods). She was Queen of Egypt. Very beautiful. Ve ry smart woman. She used the water and mud to keep herself youthful. She knew of the mir aculous and healing effects of these minerals on skin. Today, I will show you these secrets. Salima: Millions of people use the mud and wate r of the Dead Sea. Why? For good health. Medical research shows us that the Dead Sea salts and minerals have healing properties.These products are very exclusive. And milli ons of people spend a lot of money every year to travel to the Dead Sea. Now we bring the Dead Sea to you. No jet lag. No dehydration or circulation problems while in the airplane! (Pauses.) So Lana, do you know what are the benefits of the Dead Sea? Lana: Not really. Salima: Some say the Dead Sea minerals are magical. Not magical, but very healthy to us. Science proves this.(Salima holds up her hand, looks directly at Lana, and begins to count off each finger.) Many scientific studies show the number one be nefit: Dead Sea minerals are great for your body and skin. They help to balance the water and moisture level in your skin. Numbertwo: They heal your skin tissue which is damaged by sun and chemicals. Number three:They make the skin anti-allergic. Number four: You know environmental factors like pollution that affect our skin? These products pr otect our skin against these pollutants in the air. Number four: You know the toxins our bodies produce? These products neutralizethese toxins. And number five is best of all: These products help you relax. They relievestress. (To emphasize the point, Salima points to a phot ograph of a beautiful, bikini-clad woman floating serenely on the surface of the Dead Sea.) Lana, do you have stress in your life? Lana: (Nods.) Yes I do. Salima: The salts and minerals from the Dead Sea truly do have healing properties and can help you with stress, or fati gue, and even sleeplessness. Or maybe you have arthritis or aches or poor blood circulation? Our products are good for these problems as well.Mud from the Dead Sea contains minerals that heal wounds, wake up hair roots andeliminate dermatitis and dandruff. Some people say it can even stop headaches and migraines.page 50 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Maybe you have skin allergies, Lana, yes? Dead Sea minerals can even stop eczema and skin rashes-even dandruff. And just look at your hands. These minerals make your skin more beautiful and elastic. Ourproducts are all made with the healing waters a nd minerals of the Dead Sea. People from all over the world come to Jordan for these products and now we bring them to you.The nail products contain these natural minerals. The cuticle oil and the lotion we put onyour hands - they are made from the Dead Sea and they will help to heal and strengthen your hands and nails. You like how your nails look after using these products?Lana: Yes, but $79 is still too expensive. Salima: Even though the products contain natura l and healing minerals, and will last for an entire year?Lana: Yes, I'm afraid so.Salima: (Salima pauses for a long time, and squints her face in intense concentration.) Itell you what I'm gonna do for you. If you take two manicure packages, I sell you the first one for $59, the second one you pay only $29. You like these products? Lana: Yes, but I'm still not sure about the price. THIS PRODUCT WILL CHANG E YOUR LIFE SERIOUSLY Salima: It's gonna be o.k. Here, you take this bag. (Salima hands Lana a bag with the two manicure packages.) These are for you. I'm gonna change your life today. Lana, this (Salima holds up small bottle) is gonna make you look \"Wow\"! This is an eye serum. This is gonna change your life seriousl y. Most women worry about the circles under their eyes. Is that something that bothers you?Lana: Yes, of course.Salima: This eye serum will totally fix that. I can help you remove those circles. Come, please, sit here (Salima gestures towards a chair) and I will show you.(Lana sits).Salima: Why is it that this eye serum can rem ove the circles? Because of the minerals from the Dead Sea. Minerals are something your body needs and recognizes in one second. Lana: Hmmm.Salima: I tell you the truth. Seriously. Don't look at my shoes. What color shoes do I have?Lana: Black?Salima: Do you know or is it a guess?Lana: It's a guess. Salima: Yes. Because it's not important the colo r of my pants or my shoes, or your pants or your shoes. (Salima covers her eyes.) Lana, what color are my eyes?Lana: Blue.Salima: Yes. Yes. Yes. (Salima uncovers her eyes.) Blue. Blue. Blue. Blue. So, moreimportant than our clothes or what we wear, is our face. You l ook at my eyes. It is the most important thing. Someone looks at your eyes. It is the most important thing. When you metAllied Academies International Conference page 51 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009your husband, you fell in love with his eyes. A nd his mouth. And his whole face. Not his clothes or shoes. Your face is your first impressi on. Your face is your business. It is your calling card. I want to tell you something. See this line? (S alima points to wrinkle on Lana's forehead.). In one second today, there is not going to be th is line. I will show you something that will change your life. This woman has been here an hour (Salima gestures to a customer on the opposite side of the kiosk who is with another Atlantis sales associat e.). She knows. Look how many products she's buying today. (The woman Salima points to has five small bagsfull of bottles and tubes). May I show you something, Lana? Your face is most important. It is what people notice. Not your clothes or your shoes, your face. (Pause.) Look at the skin on your face andaround your eyes. (Salima gives Lana a hand mirror.) What do you notice?Lana: Dark circles. Puffiness under my eyes.Salima: Right, like most women. Why do you think that is?Lana: I'm tired. And I'm getting older.Salima: No. You are using eye creams, yes?Lana: Yes. How did you know?Salima: (Wrinkling her face with concern.) Many women make mistake of using heavy creams under their eyes, which causes the skin to sag and makes us look older. What kind of cream are you using?Lana: I use the department store creams...Est\u00e9e Lander.Salima: These creams are expensive, yes? But even more, these creams are bad for thissensitive skin here (points to skin under Lana's eyes). The creams are heavy and make the eye tissue sag. You should never, ever use th is heavy cream around your eyes. Use a lighter eye serum. Do you know how many minerals are in this serum? (Salima gives Lana a tube of eye serum to hold.) Lana: No.Salima: This is a very special formula and c ontains 21 minerals. It is really good for this area under your eyes and the wrinkles at the co rner of your eyes. It will make the lines disappear and you will look younger. Would you like for me to show you?Lana: It will make me look younger? Yes!Salima: It is ok to touch you? I have to ask everyone that question. I will put the serumaround one eye and you will see amazing difference in one minute. (Lana nods. Salima begins gently applying th e serum with her ring finger to the \"laugh lines\" on the side of Lana's left eye, underneat h the eye, and to the \"scowl\" lines on one side of her eyebrows. She talks as she works.) Lana, these minerals heal this damaged skin tissue. They are essential for cell metabolism.Just relax your facial muscles. Do you feel the cooling? I am soothing your skin. This serum is also a natural disinfectant. We are removing built-up layers of sun damage. Now, Lana, you try to apply. (Salima puts a drop of the eye serum on Lana's finger and points to where she should apply it.)page 52 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Gently, gently. That's it. Very good. A nd this serum also protects against UVA and UVB rays. This also balances the skin moisture. This has linoleic acid and alpha-linoleic acid,which are the essential fatty acids for younger-looking skin. Now we will wait anotherminute, and I am going to show you the difference.(As Salima has been applying the product, two other women walking by have stopped at the kiosk to watch the process.)Salima: (Salima beckons to the two women.) Come, see the difference.Now, Lana, while the eye serum is working, I will apply anti-wrinkle cream to this curved line around your mouth, the one shaped like a parenthesis. This line tells your age. (Salima gives Lana the container of anti-wri nkle cream and, speaking for the benefit of Lana and the two other women, slowly dabs cream on the parenthesis line from Lana's nose to her mouth.) Now promise me, Lana, you are going to throw all your other creams away. And I tell you why. This anti-wrinkle cream has a combination of 21 minerals from the Dead Sea and contains beta carotene-very healthy, comes from carrots-and Vitamin A. You like to take care of yourself and eat healthy, be healthy, yes?Lana: Yes, of course.Salima: Now, Lana, you apply cream now. (Salima puts a drop of the anti-wrinkle cream on Lana's finger and indicates where she should apply it.) Yes, that's it-just in the crease. This cream , you will see, restores your skin's elasticity and keeps it soft and smooth. It firms skin, here , so line is not as noticeable, makes you look younger, fresher and has anti-aging properties. You will see. Now we wait a few more moments.Salima: (Stands in front of Lana,). You' re gonna promise me you'll throw all your other creams away? (Lana nods in assent.) Lana , do you know these people? (Salima gestures to the two passersby.)Lana: No.Salima: They will tell you. You will see. This will change your life. Cover this side of your face-the side that I have just treated with the cream-with your hand. (Salima moves aside and speaks to the two wome n.) Now, look at side that did not have cream.(The two women look at the untreated side of Lana's face.) Now, Lana, move your hand and show them the side I treated with special cream. (Lanamoves her hand. The two women's eyes light up and they murmur in amazement about thedifference before and after treatment. Salima gives Lana a hand mirror.) Salima: Now you will look.Lana: (Looks in mirror.) Oh my! I can't believe it. The wrinkles are really diminished!Salima: (Confidently.) Yes, of course. And all natural. No chemicals. You use these products regularly and you look ten years younger. And if you look younger, it's gonna make you feel better. In a little bit, I will do your other si de of your face so you don't look uneven. Now are you gonna throw your old creams away?Lana: How long would I need to use your eye serum and face cream? Is this a permanentthing? Or will I need to keep it up the rest of my life?Allied Academies International Conference page 53 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009Salima: No, No. You use them regularly-on ce, twice a week-for the first month and then from time to time, whenever you need. (The two other women nod goodbye to Lana and Salima and leave the kiosk.) A FULL YEAR'S SUPPLY Lana: How much is the eye serum? Salima: This size bottle will last you for one year. It costs only $179. Lana: (Gasps.) Did you say $179?Salima: Yes, of course. How much do you pay for all your cosmetic creams? This eyeserum and the face cream - these products are a ll you are ever gonna need again. This is a full year's supply.Lana: How much is the face cream?Salima: The cream is only $239. (Lana gasps ag ain.) You get this entire jar which is gonna last you a year. After that, you're not gonna need any more cream. You not gonna needcosmetic surgery. You will have natural and mo re beautiful skin. And is also good for this area sagging under your neck. People are gonna think you had a face lift! (Lana laughs) Look at these photos-one photo before of woma n's neck. And this one after. See the difference! (Salima places an empty paper bag in Lana's hands.)Salima: So you like these products? Which ones will you use?Lana: (Lana nods, still speechless at the price.) Well, I liked the nail buffer.Salima: You like the nail products? Saves you lots of money. Very smart. (Salima placesthe nail care package with all four products in Lana's bag.) Only $59 for you. No more need to go to nail salon. You can do your nails yourself-fast.You like the eye serum, yes? (Hands Lana the mirror again and plac es eye serum in the bag.) Only $179 for a year's supply-maybe it lasts you longer than that.You like the cream? This serum and cream make you look ten years younger! Don't take my word for it. Those other two women sa w difference, too! Your friends will see difference. The cream is only $239. (Salima places cream in bag.) And I'm gonna give you my e-mail address. You write me anytime you need help with these products. Or e-mail mepictures. You have any questions, I am here for you. And you can give me your e-mailaddress and phone number so I can get in touch with you and see how you are doing withthese products. Let me get a piece of paper so I can write down your information. (Salima walks over to the register. Lana follows, bag in hand.)Lana: (Gives Salima the bag of products). Thank you for all of your help and all of your time, but I can't spend this kind of money. This is over $400! Salima: Yes. But is so good for you-all natu ral-and makes you look better-and lasts all year. Much cheaper than facelift and you do this for yourself. How often you pamper yourself? Lana: (Admits.) Not very often.Salima: So you pamper yourself now with these products. Save yourself lots of money. Do something nice for yourself.Lana: I really can't. This is just too much money.page 54 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2MORE DEALS Salima: (Slumps, bends head with her hand on her forehead giving the appearance of intense concentration and deep thought, like Rodin's The Thinker.) You know, Lana, I like you. You are nice lady. (Gives Lana the bag with the nail carepackage, eye serum, and anti-wrinkle cream.) Are you gonna use these products? O.K.Here's what I'm gonna do for you. You buy the nail buffer, the cuticle oil, the lotion, and the file. All of these products for you for only $59. The second p ackage I give you for a friend for $29. You buy the eye serum for $179. You see the change around your eyes yourself,yes? (Gestures towards Lana's eyes.) (Salima lowers voice.) Don't tell anyone I to ld you this. For you, only you, I throw in the cream. As my gift to you. $239 dollars. Gift. Because I am the manager, I can do that for you. In exchange, you send your friends to me, but don't tell them that I gave you this cream for free. You tell people about these pr oducts. They're gonna see how good you look, you advertise for me. I can give you the cream at no charge. (Salima, complicit now with Lana, gives her a triumphant smile.). Now you pamper yourselfon me. My gift to you.Lana: But this is still over $200. Thank you, but I simply can't afford to do this.Salima: (Incredulous, holding open palms out.) But you are worth it. I know this. It is your skin. Not your clothes. Skin is very important. Your health is very important.Lana: It's just too much money for me.Salima: (Downcast eyes, intense concentration) What is money? This is your skin we're talking about. I'm gonna help you. You have a friend, yes? You take two nail care packages, one for you and one for her, you can have for only $59 and $29. I still give you the cream. Come closer, Lana. The eye serum, (lowering voice) I give you for $139, myemployee discount. Let me help you. Allied Academies International Conference page 55 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009NPV SIMULATION: TECHNICAL ASSOCIATES, INC. Robert Stretcher, Sam Ho uston State University Michael McLain, Hampton University CASE DESCRIPTION The primary subject matter of this case concerns a decision on an expansion project for Technical Associates, Inc. The firm is aware of th e possible risk effects i nherent in the project, and desires a net present value distribution rather than a discrete number on which to base a decision. Secondary issues examined include the process of creating a simulation using an excel spreadsheet. The case has a difficulty level appropriate for senior level finance or analytical business courses or for graduate courses in busine ss. The case is designed to be taught in three class hours and is expected to require six hours of outside preparation by students. CASE SYNOPSIS This case has proven to be an indispensible analytical tool for the creation of informational justification of go/no-go decisions in the profe ssional business environment. Students experience the value of \"number crunching,\" realizing that informed decisions in business almost always require analysis of risk and return impacts on a firm's shareholders. Without appropriate information from the analysis, a manager is simply making an uninformed decision. The NPVdistribution resulting from the analy tical methods required in this case is necessary at higher levels of management where the manager must accept res ponsibility for the long term effects of their capital budgeting decisions. Bryan Meltzer looked at the email from the CEO with disgust. It was Friday, a fair weather weekend, and 34 minutes left in the working day. And then this email: Exhibit 1: Email from Rick Burton. Kittrel Bid Burton, Richard [rick.burt@%*#:=.com] Sent: Tuesday, September 1, 2009 pm To: Meltzer,Bryan; more... Attachments: B451092.pdfpage 56 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2Please assess a bid from Kittrel Ebusiness. I want to have a meeting Monday afternoon to see what you have come up with. Attached are estimates of input data and othe r items of interest. The Board of Directors will meet on Tuesday evening at the Hyatt, and I would like to give them a brief presentation of our analysis of the project, with an idea of how the variability of inputs might affect the project's value to the firm. A simulation of, say, 10,000 iterationswould prove useful if the Board has questions. Thanks to all! Rick Bryan had been with the firm for three years, and Rick had sprung projects on the financial staff before. Bryan knew that his weekend plans were shot now, si nce time was of the essence. He had to admit, though, Rick had rewarded the financial team generously in the past when he hadencroached on their time. Bryan still dreaded the a nnouncement he had to make to his staff of six analysts. He walked to the analysts' suite. \"Well what plans did you used to have for the weekend?\" he asked. There was a unanimous groan from the room. \"Remember the big bonuses we got last year? This weekend we're working on the next one. I know that doesn't make you any ha ppier, but we have a project proposal. It's big, and Mr. Burton wants to have a complete presentation for the board meeting Tuesday evening.\" The room was silent. All of the analysts knew th at this was part of th e job, but none were the least bit happy about it. \"I'll compile some things and get them to you guys tonight,\" Bryan said. \"Why don't you take a look at this at home tonight, and we'll dive in tomorrow morning at, say 10:00 am. That will, at least, give you some flexibility tonight. One of the analysts, Krista Grindell, spoke up. \"How many input distributions are we looking at? And... do we have sales and cost estimates alrea dy, or do we need to coordinate with marketing and accounting?\" \"Good question. Open Rick's attachment, and we'll see. I forwarded it to all of you just a minute ago,\" replied Bryan. Krista opened the bid file. \"We have the mark eting estimates, but we need to get operating cost estimates still,\" she said. Bryan picked up the phone, and called Steve Gene ro, a cost accountant with the firm. All of the analysts were listening. Bryan thought to himself, \"I should have gone back to the office to call, but we're so pressed for time...\" Steve answered. \"Steve - Bryan. Did you have plans tonight?\" Steve was Bryan's college roommate, and the two were good friends. The room listened to one side of the conversation: \"Yes, once again....We can go to the lake some other weekend...No, this time it's asimulation...All I need you to do is stay late toda y, and do some operating cost estimates. Oh - and I need an exact marginal tax rate, as a percent of EBIT...Can't use the old one - this will change the income levels... Yes, that 's all... No, I need to be here tomorrow to do this. You guys have fun... Later - bye\" Bryan hung up. \"Good call, Krista. He was going to leave in a bout a half hour,\" Bryan said. \"OK, folks, anyone have extreme issues?\" Bob Denton spoke up, \"Well, I was going to have brain surgery, but it can wait, I guess.\" \"Funny!\" said Bryan. \"Any real issues?\" No one said anything. \"Alright, guys, see you in the morning. Don't forget to take a preliminary look tonight.\"Allied Academies International Conference page 57 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009The group resumed their end-of-day activities. Br yan left the room and headed to Steve's office. THE ANALYSIS By 10:00 the next morning, the analysts had reassembled. Jennifer McElroy, one of the analysts, had not only taken a preliminary look, but had already started work on the project.Everyone was impressed. \"You could have waited until this morning,\" Bryan said. \"No way!\" exclaimed Jennifer. \"I have a date tonight! I don't want this to be a two-day marathon. Let's get busy!\" Jennifer had summarized the large lot of info rmation that the group had been provided, and handed out her summary to all of the analysts. Krista had already started on the simulation - in Microsoft Excel 2007, because she hated the statistical software some of the others liked to use. She figured if she did the set-up in Excel, the others would not want to start from scratch again. She quickly projected her spreadsheet on the screen for everyone to see. \"I have completed the inputspage, except for the operating cost inputs and tax stuff.\" \"OK fellas, the opposing gender has one up on y ou!\" he kidded. \"Here is the cost and tax data, Krista. Why don't you email the file to everyone ?\" Bryan really preferred Excel as well, since it was easy to integrate the output into word docum ents for reports and into presentation software for projection. \"We seemed to have the most success last time working in pairs and then comparing results. Let's do that again.\" The analysts paired off and be gan the day's task. Jennifer's head start had saved at least half a day, and Bryan figured she might be able to keep her date that evening, after all. Exhibit 2. Jennifer's summary. 2009 Sales estimate (as if the project were already up and running): $25,928,900 Expected sales growth 8%, 95% of time between 1.336% and 14.664% for years 1-5. (Translates to a mean of 8% and a st andard deviation 3.4%, in years 1-5) Expected sales growth 5%, 95% of time between 1.864% and 8.136% for years 6-10. (Translates to a mean of 5%, and a st andard deviation 1.6%, in years 6-10) Cash expenses expected to be 47% of sales, 95% of time between 40.532% and 53.486% (Translates to a mean of 47% and a 3.3% standard deviation) $64,235,000 Asset Expansion, depreciated on a 7- year MACRS schedule, with a 10-year life MACRS 7-year Depreciation Percentages per year: year 1 14.29%year 2 24.49%year 3 17.49%page 58 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2year 4 12.49% year 5 8.93%year rates expected: of on average, 95% of time between 28.344% and 42.456% (Translates to a 35.4% mean with a 3.6% standard deviation, based on highe r income levels after the expansion and expected political action concerning tax policy) Appropriate discount rate for project: 18% Exhibit 3. Jennifer's \"Parameters\" worksheet. THE TASK This simulation will i nvolve many rows of calculated data. Spreadsheets, by default, recalculate the entire workbook when any equation is entered. Wait time may become problematic when 10,000 iterations times seven pages is recalcu lating. To speed things up a bit, you may want to turn off Autocalculation. This is done in Excel 2003 by selecting Tools... Options... Calculate from the toolbar and Select \"Manual\" or in Excel 2007 by selecting Formulas... Calculation Options... \"Manual.\" The user can then recalculate the workbook at any time by pressing F9. Managers are likely to easily give a range of da ta in which they expect 95% of the values to be framed, and this was management's response in the case (see Exhibit 1). The 95% confidence Allied Academies International Conference page 59 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009interval needs to be converted into a standard deviation. This is done by dividing the specified deviation above or below the mean (they should be equal since the data is thought to be normallydistributed) by 1.96 (almost 2 standard deviations). Jennifer did this in her summary. You might also benefit from some guidance on how to specify random numbers or normaly distributed random numbers: The \"Math and Trig\" function RAND() generates uniformly-distributed random numbers. Random normally-distributed numbers with, for example, a mean 100 andstandard deviation 20, can be generated usi ng the \"Statistical\" function NORMINV, specifying Uniform random number inputs RAND () within the NORMINV Formula: NORMINV(RAND(),100,20)). This can be specified by Selecting Formulas... More... Statistical... NORMINV and entering RAND(), 100, and 20, as the specifications. For a bit more orderly analysis, set up a standard workbook with seven worksheets: Parameters, Sales, Cash Expenses, Depreciation, EBIT, NCF, and PVNCF. IMPORTANT NOTE: For each of the steps in the analysis, if Autocalculation is off, you can Manually Recalculate (by pressing F9) the data in order for the workbook to be updated. The \"Parameters\" worksheet (Jennifer's Exhibit) lis ts the parameters of the model. In the rest of the worksheets, it is most conve nient to put the data in \"row form\" - see Exhibit 4 for an example sales worksheet. The Sales worksheet generates data as a simple random growth rate model. Specifically, Salest+1=Salest*(1+gt). For each cell of data, th e growth rate is normally distributed, with mean and standard deviation specified in the \"Parameters\" worksheet. Since each year's sales may beserially correlated, the sales figure for each year should be based on the prior year's sales times (1+gt). Using this information, construct a row of estimated Sales data (with each columnrepresenting a specified year). Your own resu lt will differ from Exhibit 4 since you will have different randomly selected inputs for years one and two. Although only two ro ws of data are shown as an example here, your spreadsheets will have 10,000 rows of data per sheet. The remainingworksheets are constructed in a similar fashi on, with 10,000 rows each by 10 years of projections (2010-2019) in the columns. Exhibit 4. Sales Worksheet Visual. The COGS and Expenses worksheets contain values calculated simply as percentages of estimated Sales. For convenience, base the COGS in a specified cell on the same column and row specified cell from the sales sheet, and the same for the other sheets. In this simple model, EBIT is calculated as: EBIT t=(Salest - Cash Expensest - Depreciationt) page 60 Allied Academies International Conference Las Vegas, 2009 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2and Net Cash Flow (NCFt) is calculated as: EBITt *(1-T) + Depreciationt The last is Value of NCFt. Recall that: PV(NCFt) = NCFt/[1+](t-2009) Construct a single column of data fo r PV(NCF) within the PVNCF worksheet.Allied Academies International Conference page 61 Proceedings of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 16, Number 2 Las Vegas, 2009INCOME INFLATION: ABSORPTION COSTING VS. VARIABLE COSTING Geri B. Wink, Colorado State University - Pueblo Laurie J. Corradino, Colora do State University - Pueblo ABSTRACT Robert had no idea how much his life was about to change. He t hought he had acquired a \"forever\" career with a financially strong company. What he had not considered, though, was theeffect his new supervisor could have on his career. This case examines the income inflation opportunities available to unethical managers. These opportunities arise when production exceeds sales and occurs as a result of the differencesbetween absorption costing and variable costing. An absorption costing income statement is provided at three different sales levels with production remaining constant. The case asks students to use that information to prepare a variable costing income statement at those same levels assuming production remains constant. The case also asks students to differentiate between fixed and variable costs, to discuss ethical choices, and to discuss the \"tone at the top\". The full case along with teaching notes for three different levels of classes; beginning, intermediate and graduate are "}
