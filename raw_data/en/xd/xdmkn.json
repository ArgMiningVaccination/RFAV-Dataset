Women of Greater Faith in Christ, Sister Patricia THE STUDENT MANUAL This manual is a collection of student readings for two institute of religion courses: Religion 234, \"Preparing for an Eternal Marriage\" Religion 235, \"Building an Eternal Marriage\" PURPOSE OF THE MANUAL The student readings are a collection of teachingsabout dating and marriage, as taught by past andpresent prophets, leaders of the Church, and thescriptures. This manual gives students theopportunity to read the assigned talks before eachclass period so they can prepare to better participate inand contribute to classroom discussions and activities. Through understanding and living by the teachings of prophets about dating, marriage, and family life,students will be better prepared to govern their liveswith correct principles and follow the Lord's greatplan of happiness. The guiding principle for selectingteachings for this manual came from \"The Family:A Proclamation to the World.\" The proclamationstates: \"Happiness in family life is most likely to beachieved when founded upon the teachings of theLord Jesus Christ\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). ORGANIZATION OF THE MANUAL The student manual is organized topically inalphabetical order, similar to an encyclopedia. Itcontains an index that cross-references articles thatcover more than one topic. Several types of quotations are listed under the topical headings. The first is \"Selected Teachings,\"portions of talks or quotations that relate to thattopic. These quotations are often presented undersubheadings that relate to the main topic.The second type of quotation is a complete talkabout the chosen topic. Most topics have selectedteachings and one or more complete talks. This typeof organization emphasizes to the reader the powerof the law of witnesses. Elder Henry B. Eyring,a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles,taught the importance of the law of witnesses: \"In our own time, we have been warned with counsel on where to find safety from sin and from sorrow.One of the keys to recognizing those warnings isthat they are repeated. For instance, more than oncein these general conferences, you have heard ourprophet say that he would quote a preceding prophetand would therefore be a second witness andsometimes even a third. Each of us who has listenedhas heard President Kimball give counsel on theimportance of a mother in the home and then heardPresident Benson quote him, and we have heardPresident Hinckley quote them both. The Apostle Paulwrote that 'in the mouth of two or three witnessesshall every word be established' (2 Corinthians 13:1).One of the ways we may know that the warning isfrom the Lord is that the law of witnesses, authorizedwitnesses, has been invoked. When the words ofprophets seem repetitive, that should rivet ourattention and fill our hearts with gratitude to live in such a blessed time. \"Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1997, 32; or Ensign,May 1997, 25). LIVING BY GOSPEL PRINCIPLES Governing Our Lives with Principles President Ezra Taft Benson counseled: \"One of themost important things you can do . . . is toimmerse yourselves in the scriptures. Search themdiligently. Feast upon the words of Christ. Learn thedoctrine. Master the principles that are foundtherein\" (\"The Power of the Word,\" Ensign, May 1986, 81). Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, stated: \"As you seek spiritualknowledge, search for principles. Carefully separatethem from the detail used to explain them.Principles are concentrated truth, packaged forapplication to a wide variety of circumstances. Atrue principle makes decisions clear even under theI teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves. \u2014The Prophet Joseph Smith ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALix most confusing and compelling circumstances. It is worth great effort to organize the truth we gather tosimple statements of principle\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1993, 117; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86). Knowing and living by correct principles is essentialto a happy life and a happy marriage. Gospelprinciples include doctrine, commandments,covenants, ordinances, and precepts. In thismanual, however, the term principle refers to a gospel truth that gives us counsel and guidance forconduct. We Must Do Our Part Principles can often be divided into two main parts:ifand then. The ifpart is a statement of general counsel from the Lord. The then part is the promised results of obeying or disobeying thatcounsel. God called the Word of Wisdom \"a principle with promise\" (D&C 89:3). The if part is the counsel to keep our bodies physically and spiritually pure. Thethen part promises health, wisdom, strength, and other blessings. The Lord keeps His promises: \"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do notwhat I say, ye have no promise\" (D&C 82:10). We must do our part to qualify for the blessings (seeD&C 130:20-22). We should also remember thatGod determines the then part according to His wisdom and not according to our expectations. Principles are not always taught or written in the if-then format. For example, General Authorities do not always say \"if you have faith, then you will have the Lord's power in your life.\" Instead, they mayrelate examples that illustrate faith or motivate usto be faithful. Gospel Principles Are Universal Gospel principles are universal\u2014they are true in allsituations in all cultures at all times. The principlesrevealed to Adam in the beginning of the world arejust as true in these latter days. We have prophets,scriptures, and the influence of the Holy Ghost tohelp us see and apply correct principles. Summary A principle is an enduring truth, law, or rule youcan adopt to guide you in making decisions.Principles help us apply the doctrines of the gospelto everyday living. They give us a light toilluminate the path before us in an increasinglyconfused and wicked world. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPREFACEABORTION SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"Abortion is a growing evil that we speak against. Certainly the terrible sin of premeditated abortionwould be hard to justify. It is almost inconceivablethat an abortion would ever be committed to save faceor embarrassment, to save trouble or inconvenience,or to escape responsibility. How could one submitto such an operation or be party in any way byfinancing or encouraging? If special rare cases couldbe justified, certainly they would be rare indeed. Weplace it high on the list of sins against which westrongly warn the people. \"'Abortion must be considered one of the most revolting and sinful practices in this day, when weare witnessing the frightful evidence of permissivenessleading to sexual immorality.' ( Priesthood Bulletin, February 1973, p. 1.)\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1974, 8; or Ensign, May 1974, 7). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Question 3: What is your position on abortion?\"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 1,200,000 abortionsperformed in 1995 in the United States alone. Whathas happened to our regard for human life? Howcan women, and men, deny the great and preciousgift of life, which is divine in its origin and nature? \"How wonderful a thing is a child. How beautiful is a newborn babe. There is no greater miracle thanthe creation of human life. \"Abortion is an ugly thing, a debasing thing, a thing which inevitably brings remorse and sorrow andregret. \"While we denounce it, we make allowance in such circumstances as when pregnancy is the result ofincest or rape, when the life or health of the motheris judged by competent medical authority to be inserious jeopardy, or when the fetus is known bycompetent medical authority to have serious defectsthat will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. \"But such instances are rare, and there is only a negligible probability of their occurring. In thesecircumstances, those who face the question are askedto consult with their local ecclesiastical leaders andto pray in great earnestness, receiving a confirmationthrough prayer before proceeding. \"There is a far better way.\"If there is no prospect of marriage to the man involved, leaving the mother alone, there remains thevery welcome option of placing the child for adoptionby parents who will love it and care for it. There aremany such couples in good homes who long for achild and cannot have one\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1998, 91-92; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 71). \"You who are wives and mothers are the anchors ofthe family. You bear the children. What an enormousand sacred responsibility that is. I am told thatbetween 1972 and 1990 there were 27 millionabortions in the United States alone. What ishappening to our appreciation of the sanctity ofhuman life? Abortion is an evil, stark and real andrepugnant, which is sweeping over the earth. I pleadwith the women of this Church to shun it, to standabove it, to stay away from those compromisingsituations which make it appear desirable. Theremay be some few circumstances under which it canoccur, but they are extremely limited and for themost part improbable. You are the mothers of thesons and daughters of God, whose lives are sacred.Safeguarding them is a divinely given responsibilitywhich cannot be lightly brushed aside\" (\"Walkingin the Light of the Lord,\" Ensign, Nov. 1998, 99). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"Whatever the laws of man may come to tolerate, the misuse of the power of procreation, the destroyingof innocent life through abortion, and the abuse of little children are transgressions of enormousproportion. For cradled therein rests the destiny ofinnocent, helpless children\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1986, 21; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 18). \"Nowhere is the right of choice defended with morevigor than with abortion. Having chosen to act, and a conception having occurred, it cannot then Abortion is an evil, stark and real and repugnant, which is sweeping over the earth. \u2014President Gordon B. Hinckley ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL1be unchosen. But there are still choices; always a best one. \"Sometimes the covenant of marriage has been broken; more often none was made. In or out ofmarriage, abortion is not an individual choice. At a minimum, three lives are involved. \"The scriptures tell us, 'Thou shalt not . . it' (D&C 59:6; italics added). \"Except where the wicked crime of incest or rape wasinvolved, or where competent medical authoritiescertify that the life of the mother is in jeopardy, orthat a severely defective fetus cannot survive birth,abortion is clearly a 'thou shalt not.' Even in thesevery exceptional cases, much sober prayer is requiredto make the right choice. \"We face such sobering choices because we are the children of God\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1990, 108; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 85). \"I know of no sins connected with the moralstandard for which we cannot be forgiven. I donot exempt abortion\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1992, 95; or Ensign, May 1992, 68). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Abortion, which has increased enormously, causes one to ask, 'Have we strayed so far from God's secondgreat commandment\u2014love thy neighbor\u2014that ababy in a womb no longer qualifies to be loved\u2014atleast as a mother's neighbor?' Even so, violence toan unborn child does not justify other violence!\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1993, 94-95; or Ensign,May 1993, 76). Elder Russell M. Nelson \"Regrettable as is the loss of loved ones from war, these figures are dwarfed by the toll of a new warthat annually claims more casualties than the total number of fatalities from all the wars of this nation.\"It is a war on the defenseless\u2014and the voiceless. It is a war on the unborn. \"This war, labeled 'abortion,' is of epidemic proportion and is waged globally. Over 55 millionabortions were reported worldwide in the year 1974alone. Sixty-four percent of the world's populationnow live in countries that legally sanction thispractice. In the United States of America, over1.5 million abortions are performed annually. About25 to 30 percent of all pregnancies now end inabortion. In some metropolitan areas, there are moreabortions perfor med than live births. Comparable data also come from other nations\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1985, 13; or Ensign, May 1985, 11). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"The ultimate act of destruction is to take a life. That is why abortion is such a serious sin. Our attitudetoward abortion is not based on revealed knowledgeof when mortal life begins for legal purposes. It isfixed by our knowledge that according to an eternalplan, all of the spirit children of God must come tothis earth for a glorious purpose, and that individualidentity began long before conception and willcontinue for all the eternities to come. We rely onthe prophets of God, who have told us that whilethere may be 'rare' exceptions, 'the practice ofelective abortion is shalt . . like unto it\" (Doctrine and Covenants59:6)' (1991 Supplement to the 1989 General Handbookof Instructions, p. 1). \"Our knowledge of the great plan of happiness alsogives us a unique perspective on the subject ofmarriage and the bearing of children. In this wealso run counter to some strong current forces incustom, law, and economics\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1993, 99-100; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 74). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABORTION 2ABUSE SELECTED TEACHINGS Abuse Defined \"Abuse is the physical, emotional, sexual, or spiritual mistreatment of others. It may not only harm thebody, but it can deeply affect the mind and spirit,destroying faith and causing confusion, doubt,mistrust, guilt, and fear\" ( Responding to Abuse: Helps for Ecclesiastical Leaders, 1). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I have in my office a file of letters received from women who cry out over the treatment they receivefrom their husbands in their homes. They tell ofthe activity of some of these men in Churchresponsibilities. They even speak of men holdingtemple recommends. And they speak of abuse, bothsubtle and open. They tell of husbands who losetheir tempers and shout at their wives and children.They tell of men who demand offensive intimaterelations. They tell of men who demean them andput them down and of fathers who seem to knowlittle of the meaning of patience and forbearancewith reference to their children\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1990, 68; or Ensign, May 1990, 52). Elder James E. Faust \"Any form of physical or mental abuse to any woman is not worthy of any priesthood holder. . . . This, ofcourse, means verbal as well as physical abuse\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1988, 44; or Ensign, May 1988, 37). Policy toward Abuse President Ezra Taft Benson \"A priesthood holder who would curse his wife, abuse her with words or actions, or do the same to one ofhis own children is guilty of grievous sin.\"'Can ye be angry, and not sin?' asked the ApostlePaul (Joseph Smith Translation, Ephesians 4:26)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1983, 61-62; or Ensign,Nov. 1983, 42). \"If a man does not control his temper, it is a sad admission that he is not in control of his thoughts.He then becomes a victim of his own passions andemotions, which lead him to actions that are totallyunfit for civilized behavior, let alone behavior for apriesthood holder\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1986, 62; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 47). \"What does it mean to love someone with all ourhearts? It means with all our emotional feelings andour devotion. Surely when you love your wife withall your heart, you cannot demean her, criticize her,find fault with her, nor abuse her by words, sullenbehavior, or actions\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1983, 63; or Ensign, Nov. 1983, 43). President Howard W. Hunter \"Any man who abuses or demeans his wife physically or spiritually is guilty of grievous sin and in need of sincere and serious repentance\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 64; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 51). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Question 6: What about spouse and child abuse? . . .\"We are doing all we know how to do to stamp out this terrible evil. When there is recognition of equalitybetween the husband and the wife, when there isacknowledgment that each child born into the worldis a child of God, then there will follow a greater senseof responsibility to nurture, to help, to love with anenduring love those for whom we are responsible. \"No man who abuses his wife or children is worthy to hold the priesthood of God. No man who abuseshis wife or children is worthy to be a member ingood standing in this Church. The abuse of one'sspouse and children is a most serious offense beforeGod, and any who indulge in it may expect to bedisciplined by the Church\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1998, 92-93; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 72). Causes of Abuse President Ezra Taft Benson \"Another face of pride is contention. Arguments, fights, unrighteous dominion, generation gaps,divorces, spouse abuse, riots, and disturbances all Abuse is the physical, emotional, sexual, or spiritual mistreatment of others. \u2014Responding to Abuse ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL3fall into this category of pride\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 5; or Ensign, May 1989, 6). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I am glad that there is a growing public awareness of this insidious evil. The exploitation of children, or theabuse of one's spouse, for the satisfaction of sadisticdesires is sin of the darkest hue\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1985, 67; or Ensign, Nov. 1985, 51). Avoiding Abuse President Ezra Taft Benson \"To our temperance we are to add patience. A priesthood holder is to be patient. Patience is another form of self-control. It is the ability to postpone gratification and to bridle one's passions. In hisrelationships with loved ones, a patient man doesnot engage in impetuous behavior that he will laterregret. Patience is composure under stress. A patientman is understanding of others' faults\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1986, 62; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 47). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"There must be self-discipline that constrains against abuse of wife and children and self. There must bethe Spirit of God, invited and worked for, nurturedand strengthened. There must be recognition of thefact that each is a child of God\u2014father, mother, son,and daughter, each with a divine birthright\u2014and alsorecognition of the fact that when we offend one ofthese, we offend our Father in Heaven\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1991, 97; or Ensign, May 1991, 74). \"Question: 'What are you doing to reduce [childabuse]?' \"Response: 'We are doing everything we know how to reduce it. We are teaching our people. We are talkingabout it. We have set up a course of instruction forour bishops all across the nation. All last year wecarried on an educational program. We have set upa help-line for them where they can get professionalcounseling and help with these problems. We haveissued a journal dealing with child abuse, spouseabuse, abuse of the elderly, the whole problem ofabuse. We are concerned about it. I am deeplyconcerned about the victims. My heart reaches outto them. I want to do everything we can to ease thepain, to preclude the happening of this evil andwicked thing. . . . I know of no other organization inthis world that has taken more exhaustive measures,tried harder, done more to tackle this problem, towork with it, to do something to make a change.We recognize the terrible nature of it, and we wantto help our people, reach out to them, assist them'\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 72; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 51). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Familial patterns of abuse and unrighteous parental dominion obviously affect us profoundly. But theseneed not enslave future generations. Deprivationdoes not mean automatic and perpetual ruination.Emancipation is possible. God can heal us, if we willsubmit to him. This is not to diminish the degree of difficulty encountered in bringing about desiredchange, but in that very difficulty lies the need forfaith and patience\" ( Not My Will, But Thine, 62-63). Elder H. Burke Peterson \"The Man of Power is one who presides\u2014 \"By persuasion. He uses no demeaning words or behavior, does not manipulate others, appeals to the best in everyone, and respects the dignity andagency of all humankind\u2014men, women, boys, and girls. \"By long-suffering. He waits when necessary and listens to the humblest or youngest person. He is tolerant of the ideas of others and avoids quickjudgments and anger. \"By gentleness. He uses a smile more often than a frown. He is not gruff or loud or frightening; he does not discipline in anger. \"By meekness. He is not puffed up, does not dominate conversations, and is willing to conform his will to the will of God. \"By love unfeigned. He does not pretend. He is sincere, giving honest love without reservation even when others are unlovable. \"By kindness. He practices courtesy and thoughtfulness in little things as well as in the more obvious things.\"By pure knowledge. He avoids half-truths and seeks to be empathetic.\"Without hypocrisy. He practices the principles he teaches. He knows he is not always right and is willing to admit his mistakes and say 'I'm sorry.' \"Without guile. He is not sly or crafty in his dealings with others, but is honest and authentic when describing his feelings. . . . ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABUSE 45 \"Each husband, each father, should ask some questions of himself to see if he may be on theborderline of unrighteous dominion: \"1. Do I criticize family members more than I compliment them? \"2. Do I insist that family members obey me because I am the father or husband and hold the priesthood?\"3. Do I seek happiness more at work or somewhere other than in my home? \"4. Do my children seem reluctant to talk to me about some of their feelings and concerns? \"5. Do I attempt to guarantee my place of authority by physical discipline or punishment? \"6. Do I find myself setting and enforcing numerous rules to control family members?\"7. Do family members appear to be fearful of me?\"8. Do I feel threatened by the notion of sharing with other family members the power and responsibility for decision making in the family? \"9. Is my wife highly dependent on me and unable to make decisions for herself? \"10. Does my wife complain that she has insufficient funds to manage the household because I control all the money? \"11. Do I insist on being the main source of inspiration for each individual family member ratherthan teaching each child to listen to the Spirit? \"12. Do I often feel angry and critical toward family members? \"If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then we may need to evaluate our relationship with ourfamily members. For one who holds the priesthood,the best test as to whether he is trying to control thelives of family members can be found by examininghis relationship with the Lord. If a man feels areduction or withdrawal of the Holy Ghost (mani-fested by contention, disunity, or rebellion), he mayknow that he is exercising unrighteous dominion\"(\"Unrighteous Dominion,\" Ensign, July 1989, 10-11). Sister Aileen H. Clyde \"If charity is not always quick to our understanding, it may occasionally be quick to our misunderstanding.It is not charity or kindness to endure any type ofabuse or unrighteousness that may be inflicted onus by others. God's commandment that as we lovehim we must respect ourselves suggests we must notaccept disrespect from others. It is not charity to letanother repeatedly deny our divine nature andagency. It is not charity to bow down in despairand helplessness. That kind of suffering should beended, and that is very difficult to do alone. Thereare priesthood leaders and other loving servantswho will give aid and strength when they know of the need. We must be willing to let others help us\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 107; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 77). HEALING THE TRAGIC SCARS OF ABUSE Elder Richard G. Scott Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1992, 43-46; or Ensign, May 1992, 31-33 The Tragic Scars of Abuse I speak from the depths of my heart to each one ofyou who have been scarred by the ugly sin of abuse,whether you are a member or nonmember of theChurch. I would prefer a private setting to discussthis sensitive subject and ask that the Holy Spirithelp us both that you may receive the relief of theLord from the cruelty that has scarred your life. Unless healed by the Lord, mental, physical, or sexual abuse can cause you serious, enduringconsequences. As a victim you have experiencedsome of them. They include fear, depression, guilt,self-hatred, destruction of self-esteem, and alienationfrom normal human relationships. When aggravatedby continued abuse, powerful emotions of rebellion,anger, and hatred are generated. These feelingsoften are focused against oneself, others, life itself,and even Heavenly Father. Frustrated efforts to fightback can degenerate into drug abuse, immorality,abandonment of home, and, tragically in extremecases, suicide. Unless corrected, these feelings leadto despondent lives, discordant marriages, and eventhe transition from victim to abuser. One awfulresult is a deepening lack of trust in others, whichbecomes a barrier to healing. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABUSEScars Need Not Be Permanent To be helped, you must understand some things about eternal law. Your abuse results from another'sunrighteous attack on your freedom. Since all ofFather in Heaven's children enjoy agency, there canbe some who choose willfully to violate thecommandments and harm you. Such acts temporarilyrestrict your freedom. In justice, and to compensate,the Lord has provided a way for you to overcomethe destructive results of others' acts against yourwill. That relief comes by applying eternal truthswith priesthood assistance. Know that the wicked choice of others cannot completely destroy your agency unless you permit it.Their acts may cause pain, anguish, even physicalharm, but they cannot destroy your eternalpossibilities in this brief but crucial life on earth.You must understand that you are free to determine toovercome the harmful results of abuse. Your attitude can control the change for good in your life. It allows youto have the help the Lord intends you to receive.No one can take away your ultimate opportunitieswhen you understand and live eternal law. The lawsof your Heavenly Father and the atonement of theLord have made it possible that you will not berobbed of the opportunities which come to thechildren of God. You may feel threatened by one who is in a position of power or control over you. You may feel trappedand see no escape. Please believe that your Heavenly Father does not want you to be held captive byunrighteous influence, by threats ofreprisal, or by fear of repercussion to thefamily member who abuses you. Trust that the Lord will lead you to asolution. Ask in faith, nothing doubting (see James 1:6; Enos 1:15;Moroni 7:26; D&C 8:10; 18:18). I solemnly testify that when another's acts of violence, perversion, or incest hurtyou terribly, against your will, you are not responsibleand you must not feel guilty. You may be left scarred by abuse, but those scars need not be permanent. Inthe eternal plan, in the Lord's timetable, thoseinjuries can be made right as you do your part. Hereis what you can do now. Seek Help If you are now or have in the past been abused,seek help now. Perhaps you distrust others and feelthat there is no reliable help anywhere. Begin withyour Eternal Father and his beloved Son, your Savior.Strive to comprehend their commandments andfollow them. They will lead you to others who willstrengthen and encourage you. There is available toyou a priesthood leader, normally a bishop, at timesa member of the stake presidency. He can build abridge to greater understanding and healing. JosephSmith taught, \"A man can do nothing for himselfunless God direct him in the right way; and thePriesthood is for that purpose\" (Teachings of theProphet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938], p. 364). Talk to your bishop in confidence. His calling allows him to act as an instrument of the Lord in yourbehalf. He can provide a doctrinal foundation to guideyou to recovery. An understanding and applicationof eternal law will provide the healing you require.He has the right to be inspired of the Lord in yourbehalf. He can use the priesthood to bless you. Your bishop can help you identify trustworthy friends to support you. He will help you regain self-confi-dence and self-esteem to begin the process of renewal.When abuse is extreme, he can help you identifyappropriate protection and professional treatmentconsistent with the teachings of the Savior. Principles of Healing These are some of the principles of healing you willcome to understand more fully: Recognize that you are a beloved child of your Heavenly Father. He loves you per fectly and can help you as no earthly par ent, spouse, or devoted friend can. His Son gave his life so that by faith in himand obedience to his teachings youcan be made whole. He is theconsummate healer. Gain trust in the love and compassion of your elder brother, Jesus Christ, by pondering the scriptures. As with the Nephites, he tells you:\"I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy. . . . I see that your faith issufficient that I should heal you\" (3 Nephi 17:7-8). Healing best begins with your sincere prayer asking your Father in Heaven for help. That use of youragency allows divine intervention. When you permitit, the love of the Savior will soften your heart andbreak the cycle of abuse that can transform a victiminto an aggressor. Adversity, even when caused ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABUSE 6 You may be left scarred by abuse, but those scars need not be permanent.willfully by others' unrestrained appetite, can be a source of growth when viewed from the perspectiveof eternal principle (see D&C 122:7). The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often the victim is innocent becauseof being disabled by fear or the power or authorityof the offender. At some point in time, however, theLord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree ofresponsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader willhelp assess your responsibility so that, if needed, itcan be addressed. Otherwise the seeds of guilt willremain and sprout into bitter fruit. Yet no matterwhat degree of responsibility, from absolutely noneto increasing consent, the healing power of theatonement of Jesus Christ can provide a completecure (see D&C 138:1-4). Forgiveness can be obtainedfor all involved in abuse (see Articles of Faith 1:3).Then comes a restoration of self-respect, self-worth,and a renewal of life. As a victim, do not waste effort in revenge or retribution against your aggressor. Focus on yourresponsibility to do what is in your power to correct.Leave the handling of the offender to civil andChurch authorities. Whatever they do, eventuallythe guilty will face the Perfect Judge. Ultimately theunrepentant abuser will be punished by a just God.The purveyors of filth and harmful substances whoknowingly incite others to acts of violence anddepravation and those who promote a climate ofpermissiveness and corruption will be sentenced.Predators who victimize the innocent and justifytheir own corrupted life by enticing others to adopttheir depraved ways will be held accountable. Ofsuch the Master warned, \"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstonewere hanged about his neck, and that he weredrowned in the depth of the sea\" (Matthew 18:6). Understand that healing can take considerable time. Recovery generally comes in steps. It is acceleratedwhen gratitude is expressed to the Lord for everydegree of improvement noted. Forgiveness Helps Heal During prolonged recovery from massive surgery, a patient anticipates complete healing in patience,trusting in others' care. He does not alwaysunderstand the importance of the treatmentprescribed, but his obedience speeds recovery. So it is with you struggling to heal the scars of abuse.Forgiveness, for example, can be hard to understand,even more difficult to give. Begin by withholding judgment. You don't know what abusers may have suffered as victims when innocent. The way torepentance must be kept open for them. Leave thehandling of aggressors to others. As you experiencean easing of your own pain, full forgiveness willcome more easily. You cannot erase what has been done, but you can forgive (see D&C 64:10). Forgiveness heals terrible,tragic wounds, for it allows the love of God to purgeyour heart and mind of the poison of hate. It cleansesyour consciousness of the desire for revenge. It makesplace for the purifying, healing, restoring love ofthe Lord. The Master counseled, \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hateyou, and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you \" (3 Nephi 12:44; italics added). Bitterness and hatred are harmful. They producemuch that is destructive. They postpone the reliefand healing you yearn for. Through rationalizationand self-pity, they can transform a victim into anabuser. Let God be the judge\u2014you cannot do it aswell as he can. To be counseled to just forget abuse is not helpful. You need to understand the principles which will bringhealing. I repeat, most often that comes through anunderstanding priesthood leader who has inspirationand the power of the priesthood to bless you. Cautions in Repairing Damage I caution you not to participate in two impropertherapeutic practices that may cause you more harmthan good. They are (1) excessive probing into everyminute detail of your past experiences, particularlywhen this involves penetrating dialogue in groupdiscussion; and (2) blaming the abuser for everydifficulty in your life. While some discovery is vital to the healing process, the almost morbid probing into details of past acts,long buried and mercifully forgotten, can beshattering. There is no need to pick at healingwounds to open them and cause them to fester. The Lord and his teachings can help you withoutdestroying self-respect. There is another danger. Detailed leading questions that probe your past may unwittingly trigger thoughtsthat are more imagination or fantasy than reality. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABUSE 7They could lead to condemnation of another for acts that were not committed. I know of cases, likely fewin number, where such therapy has caused greatinjustice to the innocent from unwittingly stimulatedaccusations that were later proven false. Memory,particularly adult memory of childhood experiences,is fallible. Remember, false accusation is also a sin. Stated more simply, if someone intentionally poured a bucket of filth on your carpet, would you invitethe neighbors to determine each ingredient thatcontributed to the ugly stain? Of course not. Withthe help of an expert, you would privately restoreits cleanliness. Likewise the repair of damage inflicted by abuse should be done privately, confidentially, with atrusted priesthood leader and, where needed, thequalified professional he recommends. There mustbe sufficient discussion of the general nature of abuseto allow you to be given appropriate counsel and to prevent the aggressor from committing moreviolence. Then, with the help of the Lord, you canbury the past. I humbly testify that what I have told you is true. It is based upon eternal principles I have seen theLord use to give a fulness of life to those scarred bywicked abuse. The Savior's Healing Power If you feel there is only a thin thread of hope, believeme, it is not a thread. It can be the unbreakableconnecting link to the Lord which puts a life preserveraround you. He will heal you as you cease to fearand place your trust in him by striving to live histeachings. Please, don't suffer more. Ask now for the Lord to help you (see Mormon 9:27; Moroni 7:26, 33). Decidenow to talk to your bishop. Don't view all that youexperience in life through lenses darkened by thescars of abuse. There is so much in life that isbeautiful. Open the windows of your heart and letthe love of the Savior in. And should ugly thoughtsof past abuse come back, remember his love and hishealing power. Your depression will be converted topeace and assurance. You will close an ugly chapterand open volumes of happiness. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALABUSE 8ADJUSTMENTS IN MARRIAGE SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"Two people coming from different backgrounds learn soon after the ceremony is performed that starkreality must be faced. There is no longer a life offantasy or of make-believe; we must come out ofthe clouds and put our feet firmly on the earth.Responsibility must be assumed and new dutiesmust be accepted. Some personal freedoms must be relinquished, and many adjustments, unselfishadjustments, must be made. \"One comes to realize very soon after marriage that the spouse has weaknesses not previously revealedor discovered. The virtues which were constantlymagnified during courtship now grow relativelysmaller, and the weaknesses which seemed so smalland insignificant during courtship now grow to sizableproportions. The hour has come for understandinghearts, for self-appraisal, and for good common sense,reasoning, and planning. The habits of years nowshow themselves; the spouse may be stingy orprodigal, lazy or industrious, devout or irreligious;he may be kind and cooperative or petulant andcross, demanding or giving, egotistical or self-effacing. The in-law problem comes closer intofocus, and the relationships of the spouse to them is again magnified\" (\"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign,Mar. 1977, 3). Elder Harold B. Lee If young people \"would resolve from the moment of their marriage, that from that time forth theywould resolve and do everything in their power toplease each other in things that are right, even to thesacrifice of their own pleasures, their own appetites,their own desires, the problem of adjustment inmarried life would take care of itself, and their homewould indeed be a happy home. Great love is built ongreat sacrifice, and that home where the principleof sacrifice for the welfare of each other is dailyexpressed is that home where there abides a greatlove\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1947, 49). Adjusting to In-Laws President Spencer W. Kimball \"Couples do well to immediately find their own home, separate and apart from that of the in-lawson either side. The home may be very modest andunpretentious, but still it is an independent domicile.Your married life should become independent of herfolks and his folks. You love them more than ever;you cherish their counsel; you appreciate theirassociation; but you live your own lives, beinggoverned by your decisions, by your own prayerfulconsiderations after you have received the counselfrom those who should give it. To cleave does notmean merely to occupy the same home; it means toadhere closely, to stick together: \"'Wherefore, it is lawful that . . . they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answerthe end of its creation; \"'And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world wasmade.' (D&C 49:16-17.)\" (\"Oneness in Marriage,\"Ensign, Mar. 1977, 5). Financial Adjustments President Joseph F. Smith \"We are engaged in a temporal as well as in a spiritual labor. You must continue to bear in mind that thetemporal and the spiritual are blended. They are notseparate. One cannot be carried on without the other,so long as we are here in mortality\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1900, 46). Adjusting to an Intimate Relationship President Joseph F.

Holland Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 112-16; or Ensign,Nov. 1996, 82-84 Jesus Gives Peace, Strength, and Hope Peace and good tidings; good tidings and peace.These are among the ultimate blessings that thegospel of Jesus Christ brings a troubled world andthe troubled people who live in it\u2014solutions topersonal struggles and human sinfulness, a sourceof strength for days of weariness and hours of genuinedespair. This entire general conference and TheChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints whichconvenes it declare that it is the Only Begotten Sonof God Himself who gives us this help and this hope.Such assurance is as \"firm as the mountains aroundus.\" 3As the Book of Mormon prophet Abinadi made clear in a slight variation of Isaiah's exclamation: \"O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation untohis people.\" 4 Ultimately it is Christ who is beautiful upon themountain. And it is His merciful promise of \"peacein this world,\" His good tidings of \"eternal life inthe world to come\" 5that make us fall at His feetand call His name blessed and give thanks for therestoration of His true and living Church. Seeking Peace That Only God Can Bring The search for peace is one of the ultimate quests of the human soul. We all have highs and lows, but such times come and they usually always go.Kind neighbors assist. Beautiful sunshine bringsencouragement. A good night's sleep usually workswonders. But there are times in all of our lives whendeep sorrow or suffering or fear or loneliness makesus cry out for the peace which only God Himself canbring. These are times of piercing spiritual hungerwhen even the dearest friends cannot fully come to our aid. Perhaps you know people in the broad congregation of this conference, or in your local ward or stake, or in your own home\u2014courageous people who arecarrying heavy burdens and feeling private pain, whoare walking through the dark valleys of this world'stribulation. Some may be desperately worried abouta husband or a wife or a child, worried about theirhealth or their happiness or their faithfulness inkeeping the commandments. Some are living withphysical pain, or emotional pain, or disabilities thatcome with age. Some are troubled as to how to makeends meet financially, and some ache with the privateloneliness of an empty house or an empty room orsimply empty arms. These beloved people seek the Lord and His word with particular urgency, often revealing their trueemotions only when the scriptures are opened orwhen the hymns are sung or when the prayers areoffered. Sometimes only then do the rest of us realizethey feel near the end of their strength\u2014they aretired in brain and body and heart, they wonder ifthey can get through another week or another dayor sometimes just another hour. They are desperatefor the Lord's help, and they know that in suchtimes of extremity nothing else will do. Christ, Angels, and Prophets Seek to Help Well, at least one of the purposes of generalconference and the teachings of the prophets downthrough the ages is to declare to these very peoplethat the Lord is equally fervent in trying to reachthem, that when there is trouble, His hopes and Hisstriving and His efforts greatly exceed our own, andit never ceases. The search for peace is one of the ultimate quests of the human soul. \u2014Elder Jeffrey R. Holland ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWe have been promised, \"He that Christ and His angels and His prophets forever laborto buoy up our spirits, steady our nerves, calm ourhearts, send us forth with renewed strength andresolute hope. They wish all to know that \"if Godbe for us, who can be against us?\" 7In the world we shall have tribulation, but we are to be of good cheer.Christ has overcome the world. 8Through His suffering and His obedience He has earned and rightly bearsthe crown of \"Prince of Peace.\" Obedience and Repentance Bring Peace In that spirit we declare to all the world that for realand abiding peace to come, we must strive to be morelike that exemplary Son of God. Many among us aretrying to do that. We salute you for your obedience,your forbearance, your waiting faithfully upon theLord for the strength you seek, which will surelycome. Some of us, on the other hand, need to makesome changes, need to make greater effort in gospelliving. And change we can. The very beauty of theword repentance is the promise of escaping old problems and old habits and old sorrows and old sins.It is among the most hopeful and encouraging\u2014andyes, most peaceful\u2014words in the gospel vocabulary.In seeking true peace, some of us need to improvewhat has to be improved, confess what needs to beconfessed, forgive what has to be forgiven, and forgetwhat should be forgotten in order that serenity cancome to us. If there is a commandment we arebreaking, and as a result it is breaking us and hurtingthose who love us, let us call down the power ofthe Lord Jesus Christ to help us, to free us, to leadus through repentance to that peace \"which passethall understanding.\" 9 And when God has forgiven us, which He is soeternally anxious to do, may we have the good senseto walk away from those problems, to leave themalone, to let the past bury the past. If one of you hasmade a mistake, even a serious mistake, but you havedone all you can according to the teachings of theLord and the governance of the Church to confessit and feel sorrow for it and set it as right as can be,then trust in God, walk into His light, and leave thoseashes behind you. Someone once said that repentanceis the first pressure we feel when drawn to the bosomof God. For real peace may I recommend animmediate rush to the bosom of God, leaving behindyou all that would bring sorrow to your soul orheartache to those who love you. \"Depart from evil,\"the scripture says, \"and do good.\" 10 Forgive Others to Find Peace Closely related to our own obligation to repent isthe generosity of letting others do the same\u2014we are to forgive even as we are forgiven. In this weparticipate in the very essence of the Atonement ofJesus Christ. Surely the most majestic moment ofthat fateful Friday, when nature convulsed and theveil of the temple was rent, was that unspeakablymerciful moment when Christ said, \"Father, forgivethem; for they know not what they do.\" 11As our advocate with the Father, He is still making thatsame plea today\u2014in your behalf and in mine. Here, as in all things, Jesus set the standard for us to follow. Life is too short to be spent nursinganimosities or keeping a box score of offensesagainst us\u2014you know, no runs, no hits, all errors.We don't want God to remember our sins, so thereis something fundamentally wrong in our relentlesslytrying to remember those of others. When we have been hurt, undoubtedly God takes into account what wrongs were done to us andwhat provocations there are for our resentments,but clearly the more provocation there is and themore excuse we can find for our hurt, all the morereason for us to forgive and be delivered from thedestructive hell of such poisonous venom andanger. 12It is one of those ironies of godhood that in order to find peace, the offended as well as theoffender must engage the principle of forgiveness. Our Trials Have a Purpose Yes, peace is a very precious commodity, a trulyheartfelt need, and there are many things we cando to achieve it. But\u2014for whatever reason\u2014life hasits moments when uninterrupted peace may seemto elude us for a season. We may wonder why thereare such times in life, particularly when we may betrying harder than we have ever tried to live worthyof God's blessings and obtain His help. Whenproblems or sorrows or sadness come and they don't seem to be our fault, what are we to make of theirunwelcome appearance? With time and perspective we recognize that such problems in life do come for a purpose, if only toallow the one who faces such despair to be convincedthat he really does need divine strength beyond ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALATONEMENT AND ETERNAL MARRIAGE 1213 himself, that she really does need the offer of heaven's hand. Those who feel no need for mercyusually never seek it and almost never bestow it.Those who have never had a heartache or a weaknessor felt lonely or forsaken never have had to cry untoheaven for relief of such personal pain. Surely it isbetter to find the goodness of God and the grace of Christ, even at the price of despair, than to riskliving our lives in a moral or material complacencythat has never felt any need for faith or forgiveness,any need for redemption or relief. A life without problems or limitations or challenges\u2014 life without \"opposition in all things,\" 13as Lehi phrased it\u2014would paradoxically but in very fact rewarding and less ennobling than one whichconfronts\u2014even frequently confronts\u2014difficultyand disappointment and sorrow. As beloved Eve said,were it not for the difficulties faced in a fallen world,neither she nor Adam nor any of the rest of us everwould have known \"the joy of our redemption, andthe eternal life which God giveth unto all theobedient.\" 14 \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" So life has its oppositions and its conflicts, and thegospel of Jesus Christ has answers and assurances.In a time of terrible civil warfare, one of the mostgifted leaders ever to strive to hold a nation togethersaid what could be said of marriages and familiesand friendships. Praying for peace, pleading forpeace, seeking peace in any way that would notcompromise union, Abraham Lincoln said in thosedark, dark days of his First Inaugural: \"Though passionmay have strained, it must not break our bonds ofaffection. The mystic chords of memory,\" he said,\"will yet swell . . . when again touched, as surelythey will be, by the better angels of our nature.\" 15 The better angels of our nature. That is much of whatthe Church and general conference and the gospelof Jesus Christ are about\u2014the appeal today andtomorrow and forever to be better, to be cleaner, tobe kinder, to be holier; to seek peace and always bebelieving. God's Gift of Sanctifying Renewal I have personally known in my own life therealization of the promise \"that the everlasting God,. . . the Creator of the ends of the earth, faintethnot, neither is [he] weary.\" I am a witness that \"hegiveth power to the faint; and to them that have nomight he increaseth strength.\" 16 I know that in times of fear or fatigue, \"they thatwait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; theyshall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run,and not be weary; and they shall walk, and notfaint.\" 17 We receive the gift of such majestic might andsanctifying renewal through the redeeming grace ofthe Lord Jesus Christ. He has overcome the world,and if we will take upon us His name and \"walk inHis paths\" and keep our covenants with Him, weshall, ere long, have peace. Such a reward is not onlypossible; it is certain. \"For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee,neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed,saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.\" 18 Of Him and His good tidings, of the publication of His peace in this conference and in this His trueChurch, and of His living prophet who is about tospeak to us, I bear grateful and joyful witness in themerciful name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

We declare that God'scommandment for His children to multiply andreplenish the earth remains in force. We furtherdeclare that God has commanded that the sacredpowers of procreation are to be employed onlybetween man and woman, lawfully wedded ashusband and wife. \"We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm thesanctity of life and of its importance in God'seternal plan\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). First Presidency\u2014Heber J. Grant, J. ReubenClark Jr., David O.

Thus, every husbandand wife should become a father and a mother inIsrael to children born under the holy, eternalcovenant\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1942, 11-12). President Joseph F. Smith \"Motherhood lies at the foundation of happiness in the home, and of prosperity in the nation. God haslaid upon men and women very sacred obligationswith respect to motherhood, and they are obligationsthat cannot be disregarded without invoking divinedispleasure. In 1 Timothy 2:13-15, we are told that'Adam was first formed, then Eve. . . .' Can she besaved without child-bearing? She indeed takes an awful risk if she wilfully disregards what is apronounced requirement of God\" ( Gospel Doctrine, 288-89). President David O. McKay \"Love realizes his sweetest happiness and his most divine consummation in the home where thecoming of children is not restricted, where they are made most welcome, and where the duties ofparenthood are accepted as a co-partnership withthe eternal Creator. \"In all this, however, the mother's health should be guarded. In the realm of wifehood, the woman shouldreign supreme\" (Gospel Ideals, 469). President Joseph Fielding Smith \"The family is the most important organization in time or in eternity. Our purpose in life is to createfor ourselves eternal family units. There is nothingthat will ever come into your family life that is asimportant as the sealing blessings of the temple andthen keeping the covenants made in connectionwith this order of celestial marriage\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1972, 13; or Ensign, July 1972, 27). President Spencer W. Kimball \"Tomorrow when I repeat the phrases that will bind you for eternity, I shall say the same impressive wordsthat the Lord said to that handsome youth and hislovely bride in the Garden of Eden: . . You came to get for yourself a mortal body that could become perfected, immortalized, and youunderstood that you were to act in partnership withGod in providing bodies for other spirits. . . . AndThe ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity. \u2014Elder Dallin H. Oaks ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL1415 so you will not postpone parenthood. There will be rationalists who will name to you numerous reasonsfor postponement. Of course, it will be harder to getyour college degrees or your financial start with afamily, but strength like yours will be undaunted inthe face of difficult obstacles. Have your family asthe Lord intended. Of course it is expensive, but youwill find a way, and besides, it is often those childrenwho grow up with responsibility and hardships whocarry on the world's work\" (\"John and Mary,Beginning Life Together,\" New Era, June 1975, 8). \"Supreme happiness in marriage is governedconsiderably by a primary factor\u2014that of the bearingand rearing of children. Too many young people settheir minds, determining they will not marry or havechildren until they are more secure, until the militaryservice period is over; until the college degree issecured; until the occupation is more well-defined;until the debts are paid; or until it is more convenient.They have forgotten that the first commandment isto 'be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,and subdue it.' (Genesis 1:28.) And so brides continuetheir employment and husbands encourage it, andcontraceptives are used to prevent conception.Relatives and friends and even mothers sometimesencourage birth control for their young newlyweds.But the excuses are many, mostly weak. The wife isnot robust; the family budget will not feed extramouths; or the expense of the doctor, hospital, andother incidentals is too great; it will disturb sociallife; it would prevent two salaries; and so abnormalliving prevents the birth of children. The Churchcannot approve nor condone the measures whichso greatly limit the family\" ( Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 328-29). President Howard W. Hunter \"Honor your wife's unique and divinely appointed role as a mother in Israel and her special capacity to bear and nurture children. We are under divinecommandment to multiply and replenish the earthand to bring up our children and grandchildren inlight and truth (see Moses 2:28; D&C 93:40). Youshare, as a loving partner, the care of the children.Help her to manage and keep up your home. Helpteach, train, and discipline your children\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1994, 67; or Ensign,Nov. 1994, 50).President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I am offended by the sophistry that the only lot of the Latter-day Saint woman is to be barefoot andpregnant. It's a clever phrase, but it's false. Of coursewe believe in children. The Lord has told us tomultiply and replenish the earth that we might havejoy in our posterity, and there is no greater joy thanthe joy that comes of happy children in good families.But he did not designate the number, nor has theChurch. That is a sacred matter left to the coupleand the Lord. The official statement of the Churchincludes this language: 'Husbands must be considerateof their wives, who have the greater responsibilitynot only of bearing children but of caring for themthrough childhood, and should help them conservetheir health and strength. Married couples shouldexercise self-control in all of their relationships. Theyshould seek inspiration from the Lord in meetingtheir marital challenges and rearing their childrenaccording to the teachings of the gospel' ( General Handbook of Instructions [1983], p. 77)\" (Cornerstones of a Happy Home, 6). Elder Melvin J. Ballard \"There is a passage in our Scriptures which the Latter-day Saints accept as divine: 'This is the gloryof God\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternallife of man' [see Moses 1:39]. Likewise we could saythat this is the glory of men and women\u2014to bringto pass the mortality of the sons and daughters ofGod, to give earth-life to the waiting children of ourFather. . . . The greatest mission of woman is to givelife, earth-life, through honorable marriage, to thewaiting spirits, our Father's spirit children whoanxiously desire to come to dwell here in this mortalstate. All the honor and glory that can come to menor women by the development of their talents, thehomage and the praise they may receive from anapplauding world, worshipping at their shrine ofgenius, is but a dim thing whose luster shall fade incomparison to the high honor, the eternal glory,the ever-enduring happiness that shall come to thewoman who fulfils the first great duty and missionthat devolves upon her to become the mother of thesons and daughters of God\" (Hinckley, Sermons and Missionary Services of Melvin Joseph Ballard, 203-4). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALBIRTH CONTROLElder Ezra Taft Benson \"The first commandment given to man was to multiply and replenish the earth with children.That commandment has never been altered,modified, or cancelled. The Lord did not say tomultiply and replenish the earth if it is convenient,or if you are wealthy, or after you have gotten yourschooling, or when there is peace on earth, or untilyou have four children. The Bible says, 'Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: . . . Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them. . . .' (Ps. 127:3, 5.)We believe God is glorified by having numerouschildren and a program of perfection for them. Soalso will God glorify that husband and wife whohave a large posterity and who have tried to raisethem up in righteousness\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1969, 12). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"To the first man and woman on earth, the Lord said, 'Be fruitful, and multiply' (Moses 2:28; Genesis1:28; see also Abraham 4:28). This commandmentwas first in sequence and first in importance. It wasessential that God's spirit children have mortal birthand an opportunity to progress toward eternal life.Consequently, all things related to procreation areprime targets for the adversary's efforts to thwartthe plan of God. . . . \"Knowledge of the great plan of happiness also gives Latter-day Saints a distinctive attitude toward thebearing and nurturing of children. \"In some times and places, children have been regarded as no more than laborers in a familyeconomic enterprise or as insurers of support fortheir parents. Though repelled by these repressions,some persons in our day have no compunctionsagainst similar attitudes that subordinate thewelfare of a spirit child of God to the comfort or convenience of parents. \"The Savior taught that we should not lay up treasures on earth but should lay up treasures inheaven (see Matthew 6:19-21). In light of theultimate purpose of the great plan of happiness, I believe that the ultimate treasures on earth and in heaven are our children and our posterity\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1993, 97, 100-101; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 72, 75). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALBIRTH CONTROL 1617 I HAVE A QUESTION Dr. Homer Ellsworth Ensign, Aug. 1979, 23-24 Is it our understanding that we are to propagate children as long and as frequently as the human body will permit?Is there not any kind of \"gospel family-planning,\" for lack of a better way to say it? I hear this type of question frequently from active and committed Latter-day Saint women who often ask questions that are outside my professionalresponsibilities. Here are some of the principles andattitudes I believe apply to this fundamental question,a question most couples ask themselves many timesduring their child-bearing years. I rejoice in our basic understanding of the plan of salvation, which teaches us that we come to earth forgrowth and maturity, and for testing. In that processwe may marry and provide temporal bodies for ourHeavenly Father's spirit children. That's basic, it seemsto me. In contemplating this truth, I also take greatdelight in the Church's affirmative position that itis our blessing and joy, and our spiritual obligation,to bear children and to have a family. It impressesme that the positive is stressed as our goal. I rejoice in our understanding that one of the most fundamental principles in the plan of salvation is freeagency. The opportunity to make free agency choicesis so important that our Heavenly Father was willingto withhold additional opportunities from a third ofhis children rather than deprive them of their rightof choice. This principle of free agency is vital to thesuccess of our probation. Many of the decisions wemake involve the application of principles whereprecise yes-and-no answers are just not available inChurch handbooks, meetings, or even the scriptures. Our growth process, then, results from weighing the alternatives, studying the matter carefully, andseeking inspiration from the Lord. This, it seems tome, is at the heart of the gospel plan. It has alwaysgiven me great joy and confidence to observe that intheir administration of God's teachings, our inspiredprophets do not seek to violate this general plan ofindividual agency, but operate within broad guidelinesthat provide considerable individual flexibility. I recall a President of the Church, now deceased, who visited his daughter in the hospital following a miscarriage.She was the mother of eight children and was in herearly forties. She asked, \"Father, may I quit now?\"His response was, \"Don't ask me. That decision isbetween you, your husband, and your Father inHeaven. If you two can face him with a goodconscience and can say you have done the best youcould, that you have really tried, then you may quit.But, that is between you and him. I have enoughproblems of my own to talk over with him whenwe meet!\" So it is clear to me that the decisionsregarding our children, when to have them, theirnumber, and all related matters and questions canonly be made after real discussion between themarriage partners and after prayer. In this process of learning what is right for you at any particular time, I have always found ithelpful to use a basic measuring stick: Is it selfish? I have concluded that most of our sins are reallysins of selfishness. If you don't pay your tithing,selfishness is at the heart of it. If you commit adultery, selfishness is at the heart of it. If you are dishonest, selfishness is at the heart of it. I havenoted that many times in the scriptures we observethe Lord chastising people because of theirselfishness. Thus, on the family questions, if we limit our families because we are self-centered or materialistic, we willsurely develop a character based on selfishness. Asthe scriptures make clear, that is not a descriptionof a celestial character. I have found that we reallyhave to analyze ourselves to discover our motives.Sometimes superficial motivations and excusesshow up when we do that. But, on the other hand, we need not be afraid of studying the question from important angles\u2014thephysical or mental health of the mother and father,the parents' capacity to provide basic necessities,and so on. If for certain personal reasons a coupleprayerfully decides that having another childimmediately is unwise, the method of spacingchildren\u2014discounting possible medical or physicaleffects\u2014makes little difference. Abstinence, of course,is also a form of contraception, and like any othermethod it has side effects, some of which are harmfulto the marriage relationship. As a physician I am often required to treat social- emotional symptoms related to various aspects ofliving. In doing so I have always been impressed thatour prophets past and present have never stipulated ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALBIRTH CONTROLthat bearing children was the sole function of the marriage relationship. Prophets have taught thatphysical intimacy is a strong force in strengtheningthe love bond in marriage, enhancing and reinforcingmarital unity. Indeed, it is the rightful gift of Godto the married. As the Apostle Paul says, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath notpower of his own body, but the wife.\" Paul continues,\"Depart ye not one from the other, except it be withconsent for a time, that ye may give yourselves tofasting and prayer; and come together again, thatSatan tempt you not for your incontinency.\" (1 Cor. 7:4-5, Joseph Smith Translation). Abstinencein marriage, Paul says, can cause unnecessarytemptations and tensions, which are certainlyharmful side effects. So, as to the number and spacing of children, and other related questions on this subject, such decisionsare to be made by husband and wife righteously andempathetically communicating together and seekingthe inspiration of the Lord. I believe that theprophets have given wise counsel when they advisecouples to be considerate and plan carefully so thatthe mother's health will not be impaired. When thisrecommendation of the First Presidency is ignoredor unknown or misinterpreted, heartache can result. I know a couple who had seven children. The wife, who was afflicted with high blood pressure, had beenadvised by her physician that additional pregnancywas fraught with grave danger and should not beattempted. But the couple interpreted the teachingsof their local priesthood leaders to mean that theyshould consider no contraceptive measures underany circumstances. She died from a stroke duringthe delivery of her eighth child.As I meet other people and learn of theircircumstances, I am continually inspired by thecounsel of the First Presidency in the GeneralHandbook of Instructions that the health of the mother and the well-being of the family should be considered. Thirty-four years as a practicinggynecologist and as an observer of Latter-day Saintfamilies have taught me that not only the physicalwell-being but the emotional well-being must alsobe considered. Some parents are less subject to moodswings and depression and can more easily copewith the pressures of many children. Some parentshave more help from their families and friends.Some are more effective parents than others, evenwhen their desire and motivation are the same. Inaddition, parents do owe their children the necessitiesof life. The desire for luxuries, of course, would notbe an appropriate determinant of family size; luxuriesare just not a legitimate consideration. I think everyinspired human heart can quickly determine whatis luxury and what is not. In summary, it is clear to me that couples should not let the things that matter most be at the mercyof those that matter least. In searching for what ismost important, I believe that we are accountablenot only for what we do but for why we do it.Thus, regarding family size, spacing of children, andattendant questions, we should desire to multiplyand replenish the earth as the Lord commands us.In that process, Heavenly Father intends that weuse the free agency he has given in charting a wisecourse for ourselves and our families. We gain thewisdom to chart that wise course through study,prayer, and listening to the still small voice within us.

Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"Real charity is not something you give away; it is something that you acquire and make a part ofyourself. And when the virtue of charity becomesimplanted in your heart, you are never the sameagain. It makes the thought of being [critical orverbally abusive] repulsive. \"Perhaps the greatest charity comes when we are kind to each other, when we don't judge or categorizesomeone else, when we simply give each other thebenefit of the doubt or remain quiet. Charity isaccepting someone's differences, weaknesses, andshortcomings; having patience with someone whohas let us down; or resisting the impulse to becomeoffended when someone doesn't handle somethingthe way we might have hoped. Charity is refusingto take advantage of another's weakness and beingwilling to forgive someone who has hurt us. Charityis expecting the best of each other\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1992, 24; or Ensign, May 1992, 18-19).Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"Above all the attributes of godliness and perfection, charity is the one most devoutly to be desired. Charity is more than love, far more; it is everlasting love,perfect love, the pure love of Christ which endurethforever. It is love so centered in righteousness that thepossessor has no aim or desire except for the eternalwelfare of his own soul and for the souls of thosearound him. (2 Ne. 26:30; Moro. 7:47; 8:25-26.)\"(Mormon Doctrine, 121). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"Stated simply, charity means subordinating our interests and needs to those of others, as the Saviorhas done for all of us. The Apostle Paul wrote thatof faith, hope, and charity, 'the greatest of these ischarity' (1 Corinthians 13:13), and Moroni 'except ye have charity ye nowise besaved in the kingdom of God' (Moroni 10:21). I believe that selfless service is a distinctive part ofthe gospel\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 20; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 16).

Elder James E. Faust \"I wonder if it is possible for one marriage partner to jettison the other and become completely whole.Either partner who diminishes the divine role of theother in the presence of the children demeans thebudding femininity within the daughters and theemerging manhood of the sons. I suppose there arealways some honest differences between husbandand wife, but let them be settled in private.\"The importance of this subject emboldens me to say a word about covenant breaking. It must berecognized that some marriages just fail. To those inthat circumstance, I extend understanding becauseevery divorce carries heartache with it. I hope whatI say will not be disturbing. In my opinion, anypromise between a man and a woman incident to amarriage ceremony rises to the dignity of a covenant.The family relationship of father, mother, and childis the oldest and most enduring institution in theworld. It has survived vast differences of geographyand culture. This is because marriage between manand woman is a natural state and is ordained of God.It is a moral imperative. Those marriages performedin our temples, meant to be eternal relationships,then, become the most sacred covenants we canmake. The sealing power given by God throughElijah is thus invoked, and God becomes a party to the promises. \"What, then, might be 'just cause' for breaking the covenants of marriage? Over a lifetime of dealing withhuman problems, I have struggled to understandwhat might be considered 'just cause' for breakingof covenants. I confess I do not claim the wisdomor authority to definitively state what is 'just cause.'Only the parties to the marriage can determine this.They must bear the responsibility for the train ofconsequences which inevitably follows if thesecovenants are not honored. In my opinion, 'justcause' should be nothing less serious than a prolongedand apparently irredeemable relationship which isdestructive of a person's dignity as a human being. \"At the same time, I have strong feelings about what is not provocation for breaking the sacred covenantsof marriage. Surely it is not simply 'mental distress'or 'personality or having 'grown of love.' This is especially sowhere there are children. Enduring divine counselcomes from Paul: \"'Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it' (Ephesians 5:25). \"'That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, [and] to love theirchildren' (Titus 2:4). \"In my opinion, members of the Church have the most effective cure for our decaying family life. It isfor men, women, and children to honor and respectthe divine roles of both fathers and mothers in thehome.

Kimball ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL21by the righteousness found there. In this way the great sealing keys restored by Elijah, spoken of byMalachi, might operate 'to turn the hearts of thefathers to the children, and the children to thefathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse'(D&C 110:15; see also Malachi 4:6)\" Apr. 1993, 46-47; or Ensign, May 1993, 36-37). Elder Russell M. Nelson \"Keeping the garden of marriage well cultivated and free from weeds of neglect requires the time andcommitment of love. It is not only a pleasantprivilege, it is a scriptural requirement with promiseof eternal glory\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1991, 28; or Ensign, May 1991, 23). Elder Joe J. Christensen \"Keep your courtship alive. Make time to do things together\u2014just the two of you. As important as it is to be with the children as a family, you need regularweekly time alone together. Scheduling it will letyour children know that you feel that your marriageis so important that you need to nurture it. Thattakes commitment, planning, and scheduling\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1995, 86; or Ensign, May 1995, 65). Sister Ardeth G. Kapp \"It is our faith in the importance of making covenants with God and coming to understand our immensepossibilities that the temple, the house of the Lord,becomes the focus for all that really matters. In thetemple we participate in ordinances and covenantsthat span the distance between heaven and earth.They prepare us to one day return to God's presenceand enjoy the blessings of eternal families andeternal life. \"I have heard young women around the world repeat in many languages their commitment: 'We will beprepared to make and keep sacred covenants, receivethe ordinances of the temple, and enjoy the blessingsof exaltation' (Young Women Handbook, p. 3). Those blessings can be available to all of us\u2014to all ourFather's children.

Hinckley First Counselor in the First Presidency In Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 68-73; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 49-52 (priesthood session) Brethren, we have had an excellent meeting. Muchhas been spoken worthy of remembrance andapplication in our lives. I endorse and commend toyou what the Brethren have said. I hope that everyman and boy, wherever you may be, may leave thismeeting tonight with a greater desire and a strongerresolution to live more worthy of the divinepriesthood which each of us holds. . . . Experience with Sorrow . . . during these ten years that I have served in thePresidency, I have also experienced much of sorrow.It is out of this experience that I wish to speak a littlefurther. For a full decade now I have participated inthe task of sitting in judgment on the worthiness ofthose who plead to come back into the Church afterhaving been excommunicated. In every case therehad been a serious violation of Church standards ofconduct. In most cases there had been adultery, andin the majority of cases, husbands were the offenders.Disciplinary action had been taken against them. Asmonths passed they longed for what they previouslyhad. A spirit of repentance came into their hearts. As one of these men said to me, \"I really never understood nor appreciated the gift of the HolyGhost until it was taken from me.\" Unhappiness of Women I have spoken on three or four occasions to thewomen of the Church during the past ten years. I have received in response to these various talks a substantial number of letters. I have kept some ofthem in a file marked \"Unhappy Women.\" These letters have come from many areas. But they are all written in the same tone. I wish to read youa portion of one of them which was received only ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENT 2223 last week. The writer has granted me permission to do so. I will not disclose any names. Said she: \"I met my husband when he was a freshman. He was from a very active family withmany years of service in the Church. He was soenthused about serving a mission. I thought weshared the gospel as our most important value inthis life. We both enjoyed music and nature andhad a high priority on gaining knowledge. Wedated a few months, easily fell in love, and wrote toone another while he served an honorable mission.When he came back home, he got back into schooland we were married in the Salt Lake Temple. Wefollowed the counsel of Church leaders and beganour family. I had been attending [the university] onan Honors at Entrance scholarship, but I becamepregnant and sick and left school to devote mytime and energy to my husband and infant son. \"For the next eighteen years I supported my husband while he finished school, got some work experience,and started his own business. We both served inleadership positions in the Church and community.We had five wonderful children. I taught the childrenthe gospel, how to work, how to serve, how tocommunicate, and how to play the piano. I bakedbread; canned peaches, apples, tomatoes; seweddresses and quilts; cleaned house; and tended myflowers and vegetables. In many ways it seemed thatwe were an ideal family. Our relationship wassometimes sweet and sometimes difficult. Thingswere never perfect because I am not a perfect womanand he is not a perfect man, but many things weregood. I did not expect perfection; I just kept trying. \"Then came the crash. About a year ago he decided that he never loved me and that our marriage was amistake from the beginning. He was convinced thatthere was nothing in our relationship for him. Hefiled for divorce and moved out. 'Wait,' I kept saying.'Oh, no. Stop! Don't do this. Why are you leaving?What is wrong? Please, talk to me. Look at ourchildren. What of all our dreams? Remember ourcovenants. No, no! Divorce is not the answer.' Hewould not hear me. I thought I would die. \"Now I am a single parent. What an enormous load of heartache, pain, and loneliness is behind thatstatement. It explains so much trauma and so muchanger from my teenage sons. It explains so many tearsfrom my little girls. It explains so many sleeplessnights, so many family demands and needs. Whyam I in this mess? What did I choose wrong? Howwill I ever get through school? How will I get throughthis week? Where is my husband? Where is thefather of my children? I join the ranks of tiredwomen whose husbands leave them. I have nomoney, no job. I have children to care for, bills to pay, and not much hope.\" I do not know if her former husband may be in this audience somewhere. If he is listening, I may receivefrom him a letter justifying what he has done. I knowthere are two sides to every issue. But somehow, Icannot understand how a man who holds the holypriesthood and who has entered into sacred andbinding covenants before the Lord could justifyabandoning his responsibilities for his wife ofeighteen years and the five children who existbecause of him and of whose flesh and blood andheritage they have partaken. The problem is not new. I suppose it is as old as the human race. Certainly it existed among the Nephites.Jacob, brother of Nephi, speaking as a prophet tohis people, declared: \"For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my peoplein the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness andabominations of their husbands. \". . . Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because ofyour bad examples before them; and the sobbingsof their hearts ascend up to God against you\" (Jacob2:31, 35). Discipline a Violent Temper Permit me to read from another letter. Said the writer:\"My husband is a good man with many outstandingqualities and character traits, but underneath it allthere is a strong streak of authoritarianism. . . . Hisvolatile temper flares up often enough to remind meof all the potential ugliness of which he is capable. \"President Hinckley, . . . please remind the brethren that the physical and verbal abuse of women isinexcusable, never acceptable, and a cowardly wayof dealing with differences, especially and particularlydespicable if the abuser is a priesthood holder.\" Now, I believe that most marriages in the Church are happy, that both husbands and wives in thosemarriages experience a sense of security and love, ofmutual dependence, and an equal sharing of burdens.I am confident that the children in those homes, at ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENTleast in the vast majority of them, are growing up with a sense of peace and security, knowing that theyare appreciated and loved by both of their parents,who, they feel, love one another. But I am confident,my brethren, that there is enough of the oppositeto justify what I am saying. Who can calculate the wounds inflicted, their depth and pain, by harsh and mean words spoken in anger?How pitiful a sight is a man who is strong in manyways but who loses all control of himself when somelittle thing, usually of no significant consequence,disturbs his equanimity. In every marriage there are, of course, occasional differences. But I find nojustification for tempers that explode on theslightest provocation. Said the writer of Proverbs, \"Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous\" (Proverbs 27:4). A violent temper is such a terrible, corrosive thing. And the tragedy is that it accomplishes no good; itonly feeds evil with resentment and rebellion andpain. To any man or boy within the sound of myvoice who has trouble controlling his tongue, may Isuggest that you plead with the Lord for the strengthto overcome your weakness, that you apologize tothose you have offended, and that you marshal withinyourselves the power to discipline your tongue. To the boys who are here, may I suggest that you watch your temper now, in these formative years ofyour life. As Brother [David B.] Haight has remindedyou, this is the season to develop the power andcapacity to discipline yourselves. You may think itis the macho thing to flare up in anger and swearand profane the name of the Lord. It is not themacho thing. It is an indication of weakness. Angeris not an expression of strength. It is an indicationof one's inability to control his thoughts, words, hisemotions. Of course it is easy to get angry. Whenthe weakness of anger takes over, the strength ofreason leaves. Cultivate within yourselves the mightypower of self-discipline. Sacredness of Marriage Covenants Now I move to another corrosive element that afflictsall too many marriages. It is interesting to me thattwo of the Ten Commandments deal with this:\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" and ABC's \"Nightline\" program, is reported as sayingthe following to a group of students at DukeUniversity concerning slogans that were proposedto reduce drugs and immorality: \"We have actually convinced ourselves that slogans will save us. . . . But the answer is NO!Not because it isn't cool or smart or because you might end upin jail or dying in an AIDS ward, but NObecause it is wrong, because we have spent 5,000 years as a raceof rational human beings, trying to drag ourselvesout of the primeval slime by searching for truth andmoral absolutes. In its purest form, truth is not apolite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach.What Moses brought down from Mount Sinai werenot The Ten Suggestions\" (address given at Duke University, 10 May 1987). Think about that for a moment. What Moses brought down were Ten Commandments, writtenby the finger of Jehovah on tablets of stone for thesalvation and safety, for the security and happinessof the children of Israel and for all of the generationswhich were to come after them. Altogether too many men, leaving their wives at home in the morning and going to work, wherethey find attractively dressed and attractively made-up young women, regard themselves as young andhandsome and as an irresistible catch. Theycomplain that their wives do not look the same asthey did twenty years ago when they married them.To which I say, \"Who would, after living with youfor twenty years?\" The tragedy is that some men are ensnared by their own foolishness and their own weakness. They throwto the wind the most sacred and solemn of covenants,entered into in the house of the Lord and sealedunder the authority of the holy priesthood. They setaside their wives who have been faithful, who haveloved and cared for them, who have struggled withthem in times of poverty only to be discarded intimes of affluence. They have left their childrenfatherless. They have avoided with every kind ofartifice the payment of court-mandated alimonyand child support. Do I sound harsh and negative? Yes, I feel that way as I deal with case after case and have done so overa period of time. Wrote Paul, \"But if any provide notfor his own, and specially for those of his own house,he hath denied the faith, and is worse than aninfidel\" (1 Timothy 5:8). In that same epistle, he saidto Timothy, \"Keep thyself pure\" (1 Timothy 5:22). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENT 2425 Now I recognize that there may be some few cases where conditions of the marriage are totallyintolerable. But these cases are in the minority. Andeven in these cases, where a marriage has beenundertaken and children are brought into theworld, there is a responsibility, binding and withaccountability before God, to provide care for thosefor whose lives the father is responsible. The complaint of a husband, after eighteen years of marriage and fivechildren, that he no longer loves hiswife is, in my judgment, a feeble excusefor the violation of covenants madebefore God and also the evasion of theresponsibilities that are the very strengthof the society of which we are a part.The finding of fault with consequentdivorce is usually preceded by a longperiod in which little mistakes arespoken of in harsh and angry language,where tiny molehills of difference grow into great mountains of conflict. I am satisfied that the more unkindly a wife is treated, the less attractiveshe becomes. She loses pride in herself. She developsa feeling of worthlessness. Of course it shows. A husband who domineers his wife, who demeans and humiliates her, and who makes officiousdemands upon her not only injures her, but he also belittles himself. And in many cases, he plantsa pattern of future similar behavior in his sons. No Enduring Happiness without Women My brethren, you who have had conferred uponyou the priesthood of God, you know, as I know,that there is no enduring happiness, that there isno lasting peace in the heart, no tranquillity in thehome without the companionship of a goodwoman. Our wives are not our inferiors. Some men who are evidently unable to gain respect by the goodness of their lives use as justification fortheir actions the statement that Eve was told thatAdam should rule over her. How much sadness,how much tragedy, how much heartbreak has beencaused through centuries of time by weak men whohave used that as a scriptural warrant for atrociousbehavior! They do not recognize that the sameaccount indicates that Eve was given as a helpmeetto Adam. The facts are that they stood side by sidein the garden. They were expelled from the gardentogether, and they worked together side by side ingaining their bread by the sweat of their brows. Now, brethren, I know I have spoken of a minority. But the depth of the tragedy which afflicts thatminority, and particularly the victims of thatminority, has impelled me to say what I have said.There is an old adage that says, \"If the shoe fits,wear it.\" What I have spoken I have said with adesire to be helpful and, in some cases,in the spirit of a rebuke followed by anincrease of love toward those whom I may have rebuked. Beauty of Happy Marriage How beautiful is the marriage of a young man and a young woman whobegin their lives together kneeling atthe altar in the house of the Lord,pledging their love and loyalty one to another for time and all eternity. When childrencome into that home, they are nurtured and caredfor, loved and blessed with the feeling that theirfather loves their mother. In that environment theyfind peace and strength and security. Watching theirfather, they develop respect for women. They aretaught self-control and self-discipline, which bringthe strength to avoid later tragedy. The years pass. The children eventually leave the home, one by one. And the father and the motherare again alone. But they have each other to talkwith, to depend on, to nurture, to encourage, and tobless. There comes the autumn of life and a lookingback with satisfaction and gladness. Through all ofthe years there has been loyalty, one to the other.There has been deference and courtesy. Now thereis a certain mellowness, a softening, an effect thatpartakes of a hallowed relationship. They realizethat death may come anytime, usually to one firstwith a separation of a season brief or lengthy. Butthey know also that because their companionship wassealed under the authority of the eternal priesthoodand they have lived worthy of the blessings, therewill be a reunion sweet and certain. Brethren, this is the way our Father in Heaven would have it. This is the Lord's way. He has so indicated.His prophets have spoken of it. It takes effort. It takes self-control. It takes unselfishness. It requires the true essence of love, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENT Where a marriage has been undertaken and children are brought into the world, there is a responsibility, binding and with accountability before God.which is an anxious concern for the well-being and happiness of one's companion. I could wish nothingbetter for all of you than this, and I pray that thismay be your individual blessing, in the name ofJesus Christ, amen. ENDURE AND BE LIFTED UP Elder Russell M. Nelson Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1997, 96-101; or Ensign, May 1997, 70-73 Stay \"on the Boat\" Early in our married life when Sister Nelson and Ilived in Minneapolis, we decided to enjoy a freeafternoon with our two-year-old daughter. We wentto one of Minnesota's many beautiful lakes andrented a small boat. After rowing far from shore, westopped to relax and enjoy the tranquilscene. Suddenly, our little toddler liftedone leg out of the boat and started togo overboard, exclaiming, \"Time to getout, Daddy!\" Quickly we caught her and explained, \"No, dear, it's not time to get out; wemust stay in the boat until it brings us safely backto land.\" Only with considerable persuasion did wesucceed in convincing her that leaving the boatearly would have led to disaster. Children are prone to do such dangerous things simply because they have not acquired the wisdomtheir parents have. Similarly, we as children of ourHeavenly Father may foolishly want to get \"out of theboat\" before we arrive at destinations He would like us to reach. The Lord teaches over and over that weare to endure 1to the end.2This is a dominant theme of the scriptures. One example may serve to repre-sent many passages that convey a similar message: \"Blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion . . . , for they shall have the gift and the powerof the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the endthey shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall besaved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb.\" 3 Blessings bestowed by God are always predicatedupon obedience to law. 4Applied to my analogy, weare first to get \"on the boat\" with Him. Then we areto staywith Him. And if we don't get \"out of the boat\" before we should, we shall reach His kingdom,where we will be lifted up to eternal life. If We Endure, We Will Be Lifted Up The term lifted up relates to a physical law that can be illustrated by a simple demonstration.5I will use a spool of thread and blow into the axial hole ofthe spool. The force of my breath will move a pieceof tissue paper away from me. Next I will take anordinary card and a straight pin. I will place the pinthrough the card. With the pin in the hole of thespool, I will hold the card close to the spool. I willagain blow into the hole of the spool. As I blow, Iwill let go of the card so that it can respond tophysical forces. Before I proceed, would you like topredict what will happen? Will I blow the cardaway from me, or will the card be lifted up towardme? Are you ready? [Elder Nelson demonstrates thatblowing down the axial hole of the spool lifts thecard up toward the spool.] Did you notice? As long as I had sufficient breath, the card was liftedup. But when I could endure nolonger, the card fell. When my breathgave out, the opposing force ofgravity prevailed. If my energy couldhave endured, the card would havebeen lifted up indefinitely. 6 Energy is always required to provide lift overopposing forces. These same laws apply in ourpersonal lives. Whenever an undertaking is begun,both the energy and the will to endure are essential.The winner of a five-kilometer race is declared atthe end of five kilometers, not at one or two. If you board a bus to Boston, you don't get off atBurlington. If you want to gain an education, youdon't drop out along the way\u2014just as you don'tpay to dine at an elegant restaurant only to walkaway after sampling the salad. Whatever your work may be, endure at the beginning, endure through opposing forces along the way, andendure to the end. Any job must be completedbefore you can enjoy the result for which you areworking. So wrote the poet: Stick to your task till it sticks to you; Beginners are many, but enders are praiseWill [always] come . . . to the one who stays. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENT 26 The Lord teaches over and over that we are to endure to the end.27 Stick to your task till it sticks to you; Bend at it, sweat at it, smile at it too;For out of the bend and the sweat and the smileWill come life's victories, after awhile. 7 Sometimes the need to endure comes when facing a physical challenge. Anyone afflicted with a seriousillness or with the infirmities of age hopes to be ableto endure to the end of such trials. 8Most often, intense physical challenges are accompanied byspiritual challenges as well. To Endure, We Must Be Surely Converted Think of the early pioneers. What if they had notendured the hardships of their westward migration?There would be no sesquicentennial celebration thisyear. Steadfastly they endured\u2014through persecution, 9 expulsion,10a governmental order of extermination,11 expropriation of property,12and much more. Their enduring faith in the Lord provided lift for them asit will for you and for me. The Lord's ultimate concern is for the salvation and exaltation of each individual soul. What if theApostle Paul's conversion had not been enduring?He never would have testified as he did at the endof his ministry: \"I have fought a good fight, I havefinished my course, I have kept the faith.\" 13 What if Jesus had wavered in His commitment todo His Father's will? 14His Atonement would not have been accomplished. The dead would not beresurrected. The blessings of immortality and eternallife would not be. 15But Jesus did endure. During His final hour, Jesus prayed to His Father, saying,\"I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.\" 16 Early in His mortal ministry, Jesus became concernedabout the commitment of His followers. He had justfed the 5,000, 17then had taught them the doctrines of the kingdom. But some had murmured, \"This isan hard saying; who can hear it?\" 18Even after He had fed them, many lacked the faith to endure withHim. He turned to the Twelve and said, \"Will yealso go away? \"Then . thou hast the words of eternal life. \"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.\" 19 Peter's answer defines the real core of commitment.When we know without a doubt that Jesus is theChrist, we will want to stay with Him. When we aresurely converted, the power to endure is ours. Enduring in the Covenant of Marriage This power to endure is critical in those two mostimportant relationships we enter into in life. Oneis marriage; the other is membership in the Lord'sChurch. These are also unique in that they are bothcovenant\u2014not contractual\u2014relationships. Marriage, especially temple marriage, and family ties involve covenant relationships. They cannot be regarded casually. With divorce rates escalatingthroughout the world today, it is apparent thatmany spouses are failing to endure to the end oftheir commitments to each other. And some templemarriages fail because a husband forgets that hishighest and most important priesthood duty is tohonor and sustain his wife. 20The best thing that a father can do for his children is to \"love theirmother.\" 21 President Gordon B. Hinckley made a statementrecently that each Latter-day Saint husband shouldheed: \"Magnify your [wife],\" he said, \"and in sodoing you will magnify your priesthood.\" 22To his profound advice we might couple the timelesscounsel of Paul, who said, \"Let every one of you . . .love his wife even as himself; and the wife see thatshe reverence her husband.\" 23Enduring love provides enduring lift through life's trials. Anenduring marriage results when both husband andwife regard their union as one of the two mostimportant commitments they will ever make. Enduring in Our Covenants with God The other commitment of everlasting consequenceis to the Lord. 24Unfortunately, some souls make a covenant with God\u2014signified by the sacredordinance of baptism\u2014without a heartfeltcommitment to endure with Him. Baptism is anextremely important ordinance. But it is onlyinitiatory. The supreme benefits of membership inthe Church can be realized only through theexalting ordinances of the temple. These blessingsqualify us for \"thrones, kingdoms, principalities,and powers\" 25in the celestial kingdom. The Lord can readily discern between those withsuperficial signs of activity and those who are deeplyrooted in His Church. This Jesus taught in the parableof the sower. He observed that some \"have no root ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMITMENTin themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth forthe word's sake, immediately they are offended.\" 26 Loyalty to the Lord carries an obligation of loyaltyto those called by the Lord to lead His Church. Hehas empowered that men be ordained to speak inHis holy name. 27As they guide His unsinkable boat safely toward the shore of salvation, we would dowell to stay on board with them. 28\"No waters can swallow the ship where lies / The Master of oceanand earth and skies.\" 29 Nevertheless, some individuals want to jump \"outof the boat\" before reaching land. And others, sadly,are persuaded out by companions who insist thatthey know more about life's perilous journey than do prophets of the Lord. Problems often arise thatare not of your own making. Some of you mayinnocently find yourselves abandoned by one youtrusted. But you will never be forsaken by yourRedeemer, who said, \"I, the Lord, am bound whenye do what I say.\" 30 Without a strong commitment to the Lord, anindividual is more prone to have a low level ofcommitment to a spouse. Weak commitments to eternal covenants lead to losses of eternalconsequence. Laments later in life are laced withremorse, as expressed in these lines: For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: \"It might have been!\" 31 We are speaking of the most important of all blessings.The Lord said, \"If you keep my commandments andendure to the end you shall have eternal life, whichgift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.\" 32 Proper Priorities Help Us Endure Each of you who really wants to endure to theglorious end that our Heavenly Father has foreseenshould firmly establish some personal priorities. Withmany interests competing for your loyalty, you needto be careful first to stay safely \"on the boat.\" No onecan serve two masters. 33If Satan can get you to love anything\u2014fun, flirtation, fame, or fortune\u2014morethan a spouse or the Lord with whom you have madesacred covenants to endure, the adversary begins totriumph. When faced with such temptations, youwill find that strength comes from commitmentsmade well in advance. The Lord said, \"Settle this inyour hearts, that ye will do the things which I shallteach, and command you.\" 34He declared throughHis prophet Jeremiah, \"I will put my law in theirinward parts, and write it in their hearts; and willbe their God, and they shall be my people.\" 35 When priorities are proper, the power to endure isincreased. And when internalized, those prioritieswill help keep you from \"going overboard.\" Theywill protect you from cheating\u2014in marriage, in theChurch, and in life. If you really want to belike the Lord\u2014more than anything or anyone else\u2014you will remember that your adoration of Jesus is best shown by your emulation of Him. Then you will not allow any other love to become more important than love for yourcompanion, your family, and your Creator. You willgovern yourself not by someone else's set of rulesbut by revealed principles of truth. The Lord Will Help Us Endure Your responsibility to endure is uniquely yours. Butyou are never alone. I testify that the lifting powerof the Lord can be yours if you will \"come untoChrist\" and \"be perfected in him.\" You will \"denyyourselves of all ungodliness.\" And you will \"loveGod with all your might, mind and strength.\" 36 The living prophet of the Lord has issued a clarioncall: \"I invite every one of you,\" said PresidentHinckley, \"to stand on your feet and with a song inyour heart move forward, living the gospel, lovingthe Lord, and building the kingdom. Together weshall staythe course and keep the faith.\" 37 I pray that each of us may so endure and be liftedup at the last day, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1. The word endure comes from two Latin roots. The prefix en means \"within.\" The remainder comes from the verb durare, which means \"to be firm or solid.\" Thus, to endure means \"to become firm within yourself.\" That meaning carries into the original languages of the Bible. In the Hebrew language of the Old Testament, the root word 'aman means \"to render firm\" or \"to be faithful, to trust.\" It was often translatedas \"faithful,\" but never as \"faith\" alone. 'Aman meant more than faith. It was not a passiveterm; it meant \"a firm resolve to be faithful.\"'Aman was also the Hebrew root for words that were translated into related terms, such as\"verified,\" \"believe,\" fast,\" and others. Greek language of the New Testament, the verb hupom\u00e9no was used. It means (\"low temperature\"). To endure connotes a commitment within one's 2. See Matthew 24:13; promise has been confirmed byboth our Father in Heaven and by the LordJesus Christ. From the great Elohim, we havethis pronouncement: \"The words of my Belovedare true and faithful. He that endureth to theend, the same shall be saved\" (2 Nephi 31:15).And from the Savior, we have this promise:\"Whoso repenteth and is baptized in my nameshall be filled; and if he endureth to the end,. . . him will I hold guiltless before my Father atthat day when I shall stand to judge the world\"(3 Nephi 27:16). 3. disobedience to thiscommandment. For example, \"If they will notrepent and believe in his name, and be baptizedin his name, and endure to the end, they mustbe damned; for the Lord God, the Holy One ofIsrael, spoken it\" (2 Nephi 9:24; see also2 Mormon 9:29). 4.

So, when in doubt, we withhold.Yet Paul said to speak the truth in love; we can thentake the chance. We worry (and understandably so)that some communications will only produce moredistance. But silence is very risky, too. . . . \"Usually, when we do not know somebody, it is difficult for us to trust them, and this becomes arestraint upon communication and growth. Openingthe windows of the soul helps us to build healthyrelationships. But if those windows are alwaysclosed or the blinds are drawn, it is difficult to help;one simply does not know what is needed\" ( All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience, 81-82).The time to listen is when someone needs to be heard. \u2014Elder Marvin J. Ashton ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFAMILY COMMUNICATIONS Elder Marvin J. Ashton Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1976, 79-82; or Ensign, May 1976, 52-54 Some weeks ago a bewildered father asked, \"Why is it I seem to be able to communicate with everyone except my own son?\" I responded with, \"What do you mean you can't communicate with your son?\" \"It's just that whenever I try to tell him anything, he tunes me out,\" he replied. Family Communication During our private discussion which followed, andvery often since, I have concluded that perhaps oneof the principal reasons we fail to relate appropriatelywith family members is because we fail to apply somebasics of personal communications. In Hebrews 13:16we read, \"But to do good and to communicate forgetnot; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\"Communications in the family will often be a sacrificebecause we are expected to use our time, our means,our talent, and our patience to impart, share, and understand. Too often we use communication periods as occasions to tell, dictate, plead, or threaten. Nowhere in the broadest sense shouldcommunication in the family be used to impose,command, or embarrass. To be effective, family communication must be an exchange of feelings andinformation. Doors of communicationwill swing open in the home ifmembers will realize time andparticipation on the part of all arenecessary ingredients. In familydiscussions, differences should not beignored, but should be weighed and evaluated calmly. One's point or opinion usually is not asimportant as a healthy, continuing relationship.Courtesy and respect in listening and respondingduring discussions are basic in proper dialogue. Aswe learn to participate together in meaningfulassociations, we are able to convey our thoughts oflove, dependence, and interest. When we areinclined to give up in despair in our efforts tocommunicate because other family members havefailed to respond, perhaps we would do well not togive up, but rather to give and take in ourconversations. How important it is to know how todisagree with another's point of view without beingdisagreeable. How important it is to have discussionperiods ahead of decisions. Jones Stephens wrote, \"Ihave learned that the head does not hear anythinguntil the heart has listened, and that what the heartknows today the head will understand tomorrow.\" Let me share with you seven basic suggestions for more effective family communication. Sacrifice 1. A willingness to sacrifice. Be the kind of a family member who is willing to take time to be available.Develop the ability and self-discipline to think ofother family members and their communicationneeds ahead of your own\u2014a willingness to preparefor the moment\u2014the sharing moment, the teachingmoment. Shed the very appearance of preoccupationin self, and learn the skill of penetrating a familymember's shield of pr eoccupation. Sad is the day when a daughter is heard to say, \"My mother gives me everything except herself.\" Too early and too often we sow the seeds of \"Can'tyou see I'm busy? Don't bother me now.\" When weconvey the attitude of \"Go away, don't bother menow,\" family members are apt to go elsewhere orisolate themselves in silence. All family members onsome occasion or other must be taken on their ownterms so they will be willing to come, share, and ask. It takes personal sacrifice tocommunicate when conditions areright for the other person\u2014duringthe meal preparation, after a date, ahurt, a victory, a disappointment, orwhen someone wants to share aconfidence. One must be willing toforego personal convenience toinvest time in establishing a firm foundation for family communication. Whencommunication in the family seems to be boggingdown, each individual should look to himself forthe remedy. If we would know true love and understanding one for another, we must realize that communication ismore than a sharing of words. It is the wise sharing of emotions, feelings, and concerns. It is the sharing ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMUNICATION 32 To be effective, family communication must be an exchange of feelings and information.33 of oneself totally. \"Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness ofwisdom.\" (James 3:13.) Setting Stage 2. A willingness to set the stage. The location, setting, or circumstances should be comfortable, private, andconversation-conducive. Effective communicationshave been shared in a grove of trees, on the mount,by the sea, in family home evening, during a walk,in a car, during a vacation, a hospital visit, on theway to school, during the game. When the stage isset, we must be willing to let the other family memberbe front and center as we appropriately respond. Months and years after the score of a baseball game is long forgotten, the memory of having been thereall alone with Dad will never dim. I'll not soon forgeta ten-year-old girl excitedly telling me she had justridden in the car with her daddy all the way fromSalt Lake to Provo and back. \"Was the radio \"Oh, no,\" responded, \"all Daddy did waslisten and talk to me.\" She had her daddy all toherself in a setting she'll not soon forget. Let thestage be set whenever the need is there. Let thestage be set whenever the other person is ready. Listening 3. A willingness to listen. Listening is more than being quiet. Listening is much more than silence. Listening requires undivided attention. The time to listen is when someone needs to be heard. The timeto deal with a person with a problem is when hehas the problem. The time to listen is the timewhen our interest and love are vital to the one whoseeks our ear, our heart, our help, and our empathy. We should all increase our ability to ask comfortable questions, and then listen\u2014intently, naturally.Listening is a tied-in part of loving. How powerful arethe words, \"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let everyman be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: \"For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.\" (James 1:19-20.) Voice Feelings 4. A willingness to vocalize feelings. How important it is to be willing to voice one's thoughts and feelings.Yes, how important it is to be able to converse onthe level of each family member. Too often we areinclined to let family members assume how we feel toward them. Often wrong conclusions are reached. Very often we could have performed better had weknown how family members felt about us and whatthey expected. John Powell shares this touching experience: \"It was the day my father died. . . . In the small hospitalroom, I was supporting him in my arms, when . . .my father slumped back, and I lowered his headgently onto the pillow. I . . . told my mother . . . : \"'It's all over, Mom. Dad is dead.'\"She startled me. I will never know why these were her first words to me after his death. My mother said:'Oh, he was so proud of you. He loved you so much.' \"Somehow I knew . . . that these words were saying something very important to me. They were like asudden shaft of light, like a startling thought I hadnever before absorbed. Yet there was a definite edgeof pain, as though I were going to know my fatherbetter in death than I had ever known him in life. \"Later, while a doctor was verifying death, I was leaning against the wall in the far corner of theroom, crying softly. A nurse came over to me andput a comforting arm around me. I couldn't talkthrough my tears. I wanted to tell her: \"'I'm not crying because my father is dead. I'm crying because my father never told me that hewas proud of me. He never told me that he lovedme. Of course, I was expected to know these things.I was expected to know the great part I played inhis life and the great part I occupied of his heart,but he never told me.'\" ( The Secret of Staying in Love, Niles, Ill.: Argus, 1974, p. 68.) How significant are God's words when he took the time to vocalize his feelings with, \"This is my belovedSon,\" yes, even the powerful communication, \"Thisis my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\"(Matt. 3:17.) Often parents communicate most effectively with their children by the way they listen to and addresseach other. Their conversations showing gentlenessand love are heard by our ever-alert, impressionablechildren. We must learn to communicate effectivelynot only by voice, but by tone, feeling, glances,mannerisms, and total personality. Too often when weare not able to converse with a daughter or wife wewonder, \"What is wrong with her?\" when we shouldbe wondering, \"What is wrong with our methods?\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMUNICATIONA meaningful smile, an appropriate pat on the shoulder, and a warm handshake are all-important.Silence isolates. Strained silent periods cause wonder-ment, hurt, and, most often, wrong conclusions. God knows the full impact of continuingcommunication as he admonishes us to prayconstantly. He, too, has promised to respond as we relate to him effectively. Do Not Judge 5. A willingness to avoid judgment. Try to be understanding and not critical. Don't display shock, alarm, or disgust with others' comments orobservations. Don't react violently. Work within the framework of a person's free agency. Convey the bright and optimistic approach. There is hope.There is a way back. There is a possibility for betterunderstanding. Let a common ground for personal decision be developed. \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sinno more\" (John 8:11) are words that are just as gentleand effective today as when they were first uttered. Avoid imposing your values on others. When we can learn to deal with issues without involvingpersonalities and at the same time avoid bias andemotions, we are on our way to effective familycommunications. When a family member makes a decision which may be inadequate or improper,do we have the ability and patience to convey theattitude that we don't agree with his decision buthe has the right of choice and is still a loved memberof the family? It is easy to point out mistakes and pass judgment. Sincere compliments and praise come much harderfrom most of us. It takes real maturity for a parentto apologize to a child for an error. An honest apologyoften makes the son or daughter feel surprisinglywarm toward the mother or father or brother orsister. \"For in many things we offend all. If any manoffend not in word, the same is a perfect man, andable also to bridle the whole body.\" (James 3:2.) Be Worthy of Trust 6. A willingness to maintain confidences. Be worthy of trust even in trivial questions and observations.Weighty questions and observations will only followif we have been trustworthy with the trivial. Treatinnermost trusts and concerns with respect. Buildon deserved trust. Individuals who are blessed tohave a relationship with someone to whom theycan confidently talk and trust are fortunate indeed.Who is to say a family trust is not greater than a community trust? Communicate Patiently 7. A willingness to practice patience. Patience in communication is that certain ingredient of conductwe hope others will exhibit toward us when we failto measure up. Our own patience is developed whenwe are patient with others. \"Be patient; be sober; be have patience, faith, hope and charity.\" (D&C 6:19.) \"I get sick and tired of listening to your complaints\" and \"I have told you a thousand times\" are but two ofmany often-repeated family quotations that indicatepatience is gone and channels of communicationare plugged. It takes courage to communicate patiently. We constantly need to express pride, hope, and love on a most sincere basis. Each of us needs to avoidcoming through as one who has given up and hasbecome totally weary in trying. The correction of family members in front of others is to be avoided. Much more notice is taken in quiet,private conversation. Calm endurance is a pricelessvirtue in one's relationship with all family members. When family members tune each other out, communication is not taking place. Words spokenare unheard, unwanted, and resisted when we failto understand the basics for proper interchange.Each must be willing to do his part to improve,since the family unit is the basic foundation of theChurch. Proper communication will always be amain ingredient for building family solidarity andpermanence. Effective Communication I pray our Heavenly Father will help us to communi-cate more effectively in the home through a willing-ness to sacrifice, a willingness to listen, a willingnessto vocalize feelings, a willingness to avoid judgment,a willingness to maintain confidences, and a will-ingness to practice patience. \"How forcible are rightwords!\" (Job 6:25.) Yes, how forcible are right wordsshared at the right moment with the right person. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMUNICATION 34May our gracious and kind Heavenly Father help us in our needs and desires for more effective familycommunication. Communication can help buildfamily unity if we will work at it and sacrifice for it.For this goal, I pray in the name of the Lord JesusChrist. Amen. LISTEN TO LEARN Elder Russell M. Nelson Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1991, 27-28, 31; or Ensign, May 1991, 22-23, 25 Listen to Learn In his invocation for this session of conference, Elder Hugh W. Pinnock prayed that we might listencarefully. Many articles in Church literature havedealt with the important art of listening. 1They support a proverb that teaches this vital lesson:\"Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thoumayest be wise\" (Proverbs 19:20). 2Surely wisdom will come as we listen to learn from children, parents, partners, neighbors, Church leaders, and the Lord. Children Parents and teachers, learn to listen, then listen tolearn from children. A wise father once said, \"I do agreater amount of good when I listen to my childrenthan when I talk to them.\" 3 When our youngest daughter was about four yearsof age, I came home from hospital duties quite lateone evening. I found my dear wife to be very weary.I don't know why. She only had nine childrenunderfoot all day. So I offered to get our four-year-old ready for bed. I began to give the orders: \"Take offyour clothes; hang them up; put on your pajamas;brush your teeth; say your prayers\" and so on, commanding in a manner befitting a tough sergeantin the army. Suddenly she cocked her head to oneside, looked at me with a wistful eye, and said,\"Daddy, do you own me?\" She taught me an important lesson. I was using coercive methods on this sweet soul. To rule childrenby force is the technique of Satan, not of the Savior.No, we don't own our children. Our parental privilegeis to love them, to lead them, and to let them go.The time to listen is when someone needs to beheard. Children are naturally eager to share theirexperiences, which range from triumphs of delightto trials of distress. Are we as eager to listen? If theytry to express their anguish, is it possible for us tolisten openly to a shocking experience without goinginto a state of shock ourselves? Can we listen withoutinterrupting and without making snap judgmentsthat slam shut the door of dialogue? It can remainopen with the soothing reassurance that we believein them and understand their feelings. Adults shouldnot pretend an experience did not happen justbecause they might wish otherwise. Even silence can be misinterpreted. A story was written of \"a little boy [who] looked up at his motherand said, 'Why are you mad at me?' She answered,'I'm not angry at you. What makes you say that?''Well, your hands are on your hips, and you arenot saying anything.'\" 4 Parents with teenage youth may find that time forlistening is often less convenient but more importantwhen young people feel lonely or troubled. Andwhen they seem to deserve favor least, they mayneed it most. Wise parents and teachers, listen to learn from children. Parents Children of all ages, learn to listen, and listen tolearn from parents, as Elder [Dallin H.] Oaks taughtus this morning. Spiritually or physically, it can bea matter of life and death. Several years ago I was invited to give an important lecture at a medical school in New York City. Thenight before the lecture, Sister Nelson and I wereinvited to dinner at the home of our host professor.There he proudly introduced us to an honor medicalstudent\u2014his beautiful daughter. Some weeks later that professor telephoned me in an obvious state of grief. I asked, \"What is the matter?\" \"Remember our daughter whom you met at our home?\" \"Of course,\" I replied. \"I'll never forget such a stunning young lady.\" Then her father sobbed and said, \"Last night she was killed in an automobile accident!\" Trying to gaincomposure, he continued: \"She asked permission togo to a dance with a certain young man. I didn'thave a good feeling about it. I told her so and asked ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOMMUNICATION 35her not to go. She asked, 'Why?' I simply told her that I was uneasy. She had always been an obedientdaughter, but she said that if I could not give her agood reason to decline, she wanted to go. And so shedid. At the dance, alcoholic beverages were served.Her escort drank a bit\u2014we don't know how much.While returning home, he was driving too fast,missed a turn, and careened through a guardrailinto a reservoir below. They were both submergedand taken to their death.\" As I shared my feeling of sadness, he concluded: \"My grief is made worse because I had the distinctfeeling that trouble lay ahead. Why couldn't I havebeen more persuasive?\" This experience will not have been in vain if others can listen and learn from it. Children, honor yourparents, 5even when they cannot give a satisfactory explanation for their feelings. Please have faith inthis scripture, which applies to all age-groups: \"Hearthe instruction of thy father, and forsake not thelaw of thy mother\" (Proverbs 1:8). Parents have a divine duty to teach their children to love the Lord. 6Children have an equal obligation to \"obey [their] parents in the Lord\" (Ephesians 6:1).7 Wise children, listen to learn from parents. Partners Husbands and wives, learn to listen, and listen tolearn from one another. I was amused to read of anexperience recorded by Elder F. Burton Howard in hisbiography of President Marion G. Romney: \"His good-humored love for Ida was manifested in many ways.He delighted in telling of her hearing loss. 'I oncewent to see a doctor about her hearing,' he would say.'He asked me how bad it was, and I said I didn't know.He told me to go home and find out. The doctorinstructed me to go into a far room and speak to her.Then I should move nearer and nearer until she doeshear. Following the doctor's instructions, I spoke to herfrom the bedroom while she was in the kitchen\u2014noanswer. I moved nearer and spoke again\u2014no answer.So I went right up to the door of the kitchen andsaid, \"Ida, can you hear me?\" She responded, \"Whatis it, Marion\u2014I've answered you three times.\"'\" 8 Even with normal hearing, some couples seem notto listen to one another. Taking time to talk isessential to keep lines of communication intact. Ifmarriage is a prime relationship in life, it deservesprime time! Yet less important appointments areoften given priority, leaving only leftover momentsfor listening to precious partners. Keeping the garden of marriage well cultivated and free from weeds of neglect requires the time andcommitment of love. It is not only a pleasantprivilege, it is a scriptural requirement with promiseof eternal glory. 9 Wise partners, listen to learn from one another .... The wise listen to learn from the Lord. I testify ofHim and certify that as we \"hearken and . . . hearthe voice of the Lord,\" we will thehour of his coming is nigh\" (D&C 133:16-17), inthe name of Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1.

[Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28.]This earth was created for the very purpose that thespirit children of our Father might have the privilege of the temporal existence, receiving bodies of flesh and bones as tabernacles for the spirits which occupythem, and then, through the atonement of JesusChrist, receive the resurrection in which the spiritand the body become inseparably connected so thatman may live again. . . . \"The covenant given to Adam to multiply was renewed after the flood with Noah and his childrenafter him. The Lord said to Noah: 'And you, be yefruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in theearth, and multiply therein. And God spake untoNoah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I,behold, I establish my covenant with you, and withyour seed after you.'

Do those who are guilty think the enormity of the offense of maliciously or wickedlytampering with the laws of life will be overlookedby a just God? Do they think that only a few stripes,if any punishment at all, will amend this brokenlaw?\" (Doctrines of Salvation, 2:80, 83-84, 86-87, 92). Elder Marion G.

Weassume that because we are members of the Church,we shall receive as a matter of course all the blessingsof the gospel. I have heard people contend that theyhave a claim upon them because they have beenthrough the temple, even though they are notcareful to keep the covenants they there made. I do not think this will be the case. \"We might take a lesson from an account given by the Prophet of a vision of the resurrection, in whichhe records that one of the saddest things he had ever witnessed was the sorrow of members of the Church whocame forth to a resurrection below that which they hadtaken for granted they would receive \" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1949, 43; italics added). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"My message is to you who are tempted either to promote, to enter, or to remain in a life-style whichviolates your covenants and will one day bringsorrow to you and to those who love you. \"Growing numbers of people now campaign to make spiritually dangerous life-styles legal and sociallyacceptable. Among them are abortion, the gay-lesbianmovement, and drug addiction. They are debated inforums and seminars, in classes, in conversations,in conventions, and in courts all over the world.The social and political aspects of them are in thepress every day. \"The point I make is simply this: there is a MORAL and SPIRITUAL side to these issues which is universally ignored. For Latter-day Saints, moralityis one component which must not be missing whenthese issues are considered\u2014otherwise sacredcovenants are at risk! Keep your covenants and youwill be safe. Break them and you will not. . . . \"The laws of God are ordained to make us happy. Happiness cannot coexist with immorality: theprophet Alma told us in profound simplicity that'wickedness never was happiness' (Alma 41:10)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 107-8; or Ensign,Nov. 1990, 84). Elder Robert D. Hales \"As taught in this scripture [D&C 132:19], an eternal bond doesn't just happen as a result of sealingcovenants we make in the temple. How we conductourselves in this life will determine what we will bein all the eternities to come. To receive the blessingsof the sealing that our Heavenly Father has givento us, we have to keep the commandments andconduct ourselves in such a way that our families will want to live with us in the eternities. Thefamily relationships we have here on this earth areimportant, but they are much more important fortheir effect on our families for generations inmortality and throughout all eternity. \"By divine commandment, spouses are required to love each other above all others. The Lord clearlydeclares, 'Thou shalt love thy wife with all thyheart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else'(D&C 42:22)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 87;or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 65). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland and Patricia T. Holland \"JRH: That is why we can make covenants with such confidence, knowing with certainty God's power over darkness and danger and troubles of every kind.We should give gratitude from the depths of oursoul for a plan of happiness that provides for escapefrom every personal mistake we have ever made andevery dumb thing we have ever done. We shouldexpress eternal thanks for the pure, single-minded,divine goodness that can cover every concern, heal every wound, make up for every defect, andeventually dry every tear. That's the God and Christand plan King Lamoni saw, and that is what stunnedhim so. It will stun us, too\u2014by its strength and byits splendor\u2014when our need is great enough, ourfaith strong enough, and our view clear enough tosee it. In our hour of extremity, we will, if we keepour covenants, see the clouds of darkness lift, theveil of unbelief cast away by the hand of a Fatherwho is eternally committed to our happiness. \"PTH: . . . Covenants not only commit us to being unshakable in our devotion to God, they remind us God will always be unshakable in his devotion towardus. And though we may falter and make mistakes,he never falters. He never makes a mistake. He isever faithful to us. That is the beauty and majestyinherent in the covenants we make with God. \"JRH: Covenants are binding, supernal, consummate contracts between God and his children. They are the solemn promises of Deity\u2014a God who always keepshis word\u2014that heaven will pour out unmeasuredblessings upon all who are faithful and honor theconditions of their pledge. An individual can swearan oath, but only when God reciprocates in kind isa covenant established. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOVENANTS AND ORDINANCES 39\"We know that oaths are never to be spoken lightly, and covenantal language is of a higher order yet. By definition, covenants invoke the most sacredlanguage we can utter in this world. This languageestablishes a bond and a relationship unique in thehuman experience. It is the means by whichindividuals in a fallen family make their way backto eternal splendor. It is the means by which eachone of us can be, in the Lord's own words, 'apeculiar treasure unto me above all people' (Exodus19:5). That is why keeping our covenants will, asthe scripture says, add 'glory . . . upon ever and ever' 3:26)\" (in Green andAnderson, To Rejoice as Women, 99-100). Elder J. Ballard Washburn \"Thus we see that in marriage, a husband and wife enter into an order of the priesthood called the newand everlasting covenant of marriage. This covenantincludes a willingness to have children and to teachthem the gospel. Many problems of the world todayare brought about when parents do not accept theresponsibilities of this covenant. It is contradictoryto this covenant to prevent the birth of children ifthe parents are in good health. \"Thirty-five years ago when I first started practicing medicine, it was a rare thing for a married womanto seek advice about how she could keep fromhaving babies. When I finished practicing medicine,it was a rare thing, except for some faithful Latter-day Saint women, for a married woman to want tohave more than one or two children, and some didnot want any children. We in the Church must not be caught up in the false doctrines of the world thatwould cause us to break sacred temple covenants.\"We go to the temple to make covenants, but we gohome to keep the covenants that we have made. Thehome is the testing ground. The home is the placewhere we learn to be more Christlike. The home isthe place where we learn to overcome selfishness andgive ourselves in service to others\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1995, 13; or Ensign, May 1995, 12). Our Covenant-Based Relationship with the Lord Concerning the importance of reviewing our gospel covenants, Elder M. Russell Ballard stated: \"A periodic review of the covenants we have made with the Lord will help us with ourpriorities and with balance in our lives. Thisreview will help us see where we need to repentand change our lives to ensure that we areworthy of the promises that accompany ourcovenants and sacred ordinances. Working outour own salvation requires good planning anda deliberate, valiant effort\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1987, 15; or Ensign, May 1987, 14).

Itconsists of a course ofinstruction, receiving savingordinances, (see D&C95:8; 97:14; 109:13-15). The temple endowment is seen as the continuation andculmination of the covenantsmade at baptism. Templecovenants include \"tests willingness andfitness for righteousnessmay be known\" (John A.Widtsoe, Program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 178).We covenant to: \"Observe the law of strict and chastity, to becharitable, benevolent,tolerant and pure; to devoteboth talent and materialmeans to the spread of truthand the uplifting of the race;to maintain devotion to thecause of truth; and to seek inevery way to contribute to thegreat preparation that theearth may be made readyto receive her King,\u2014the LordJesus Christ\" (James E.Talmage, House of the Lord, 84).1. \"With the taking of each covenant and the assumingof each obligation a promisedblessing is pronounced,contingent upon the faithfulobservance of the conditions\"(Talmage, House of the Lord, 84). 2. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the endowmentwas designed to give us\"a comprehensive view of ourcondition and true relation toGod\" (Teachings of the ProphetJoseph Smith, 324), \"to prepare the disciples for their missionsunto the world\" (p. 274), toprevent us from being\"overcome by these evils\"(p. 259), and to enable us \"tosecure the fullness of thoseblessings which have beenprepared for the Church of theFirstborn\" (p. 237). 3.

Covenant to confine their intimate affections andsexual relations to eachother. Commit to live in ways that contribute to happy andsuccessful family life. Covenant \"to 'be fruitful, and multiply, and replenishthe earth' (Gen. 1:28). Aprimary purpose of templemarriage in this life is togrow and mature in sharingGod's creative work inraising a family inrighteousness.

President Brigham Young \"Let the father and mother, who are members of this Church and Kingdom, take a righteous course,and strive with all their might never to do a wrong,but to do good all their lives; if they have one childor one hundred children, if they conduct themselvestowards them as they should, binding them to theLord by their faith and prayers, I care not where thosechildren go, they are bound up to their parents byan everlasting tie, and no power of earth or hell canseparate them from their parents in eternity; theywill return again to the fountain from whence theysprang\" (in Discourses of Brigham Young, 208). First Presidency\u2014Spencer W. Kimball, N. EldonTanner, Marion G. Romney \"In a day when the sanctity of the home is being invaded and where the care of children has beenregarded lightly, we, by means of the family homeevening manual, have endeavored to impress uponthe parents the importance of developing a love inthe home so that in the future, should those childrenthus taught stray away, they would eventually returnagain, lest they lose their place in the eternal familycircle\" (Family Home Evening: Love Makes Our Housea Home, 2). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"It is not uncommon for responsible parents to lose one of their children, for a time, to influences overwhich they have no control. They agonize overrebellious sons or daughters. They are puzzled overwhy they are so helpless when they have tried sohard to do what they should. \"It is my conviction that those wicked influences one day will be overruled. \"'The Prophet Joseph Smith declared\u2014and he never taught a more comforting doctrine\u2014that the eternalsealings of faithful parents and the divine promisesmade to them for valiant service in the Cause ofTruth, would save not only themselves, but likewisetheir posterity. . . . Pray for your careless anddisobedient children; hold on to them with yourfaith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God' (Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report,Apr. 1929, p. 110). \"We cannot overemphasize the value of temple marriage, the binding ties of the sealing ordinance,and the standards of worthiness required of them.When parents keep the covenants they have made atthe altar of the temple, their children will be foreverbound to them\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1992,94-95; or Ensign, May 1992, 68). Elder James E. Faust \"There are some great spiritual promises which may help faithful parents in this church. Children ofeternal sealings may have visited upon them thedivine promises made to their valiant forebears whonobly kept their covenants. Covenants rememberedby parents will be remembered by God. The childrenmay thus become the beneficiaries and inheritors ofthese great covenants and promises. This is becausethey are the children of the covenant\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1990, 43; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 35). COVENANT MARRIAGE Elder Bruce C. Hafen Of the SeventyIn Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 33-36; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 26-28 Marriage Is a Covenant, Not a Contract Three summers ago I watched a new bride andgroom, Tracy and Tom, emerge from a sacred temple.They laughed and held hands as family and friendsgathered to take pictures. I saw happiness andpromise in their faces as they greeted their receptionguests, who celebrated publicly the creation of a newfamily. I wondered that night how long it would beuntil these two faced the opposition that tests everymarriage. Only then would they discover whethertheir marriage was based on a contract or a covenant. Another bride sighed blissfully on her wedding day,\"Mom, I'm at the end of all my troubles!\" \"Yes,\" replied her mother, \"but at which end?\" When troubles come, the parties to a contractual marriage seek happiness by walking away. They marry toobtain benefits and will stay only as long as they'rereceiving what they bargained for. But when troublescome to a covenant marriage, the husband and wife work them through. They marry to give and to grow,bound by covenants to each other, to the community, and to God. Contract companions each give 50 percent; covenant companions each give 100 percent. Marriage is by nature a covenant, not just a private contract one may cancelat will. Jesus taught about contractualattitudes when he described the\"hireling,\" who performs hisconditional promise of care only whenhe receives something in return. Whenthe hireling \"seeth the he amthe good shepherd, . . . and I lay down my life for the sheep.\" 1Many people today marry as hirelings. And when the wolf comes, they flee. This idea iswrong. It curses the earth, turning parents' hearts away from their children and from each other. 2 An Eternal Perspective of Marriage Before their marriage, Tom and Tracy received aneternal perspective on covenants and wolves. Theylearned through the story of Adam and Eve aboutlife's purpose and how to return to God's presencethrough obedience and the Atonement. Christ's lifeis the story of giving the Atonement. The life of Adamand Eve is the story of receiving the Atonement,which empowered them to overcome their separationfrom God and all opposition until they were eternally\"at one\" with the Lord and with each other. Without the Fall, Lehi taught, Adam and Eve would never have known opposition. And \"they wouldhave had no children; wherefore they would haveremained in a state of innocence, having no joy, forthey knew no misery.\" 3Astute parents will see a little connection here\u2014no children, no misery! Butleft in the garden, Adam and Eve could never knowjoy. So the Lord taught them they would live andbear children in sorrow, sweat, and thorns. Still, the ground was cursed for their sake: 4their path of affliction also led to the joyof both redemptionand comprehension.5That is why the husband and wife in a covenant marriage sustain and lift each other when the wolf comes. If Tom and Tracy hadunderstood all this, perhaps they would havewalked more slowly from the gardenlike templegrounds, like Adam and Eve, arm in arm, into aharsh and lonely world. And yet\u2014marrying and raising children canyield the most valuable religious experiences of a couple's lives. Covenantmarriage requires a total leap of faith:they must keep their covenantswithout knowing what risks that mayrequire of them. They must surrenderunconditionally, obeying God andsacrificing for each other. Then theywill discover what Alma called \"incomprehensible joy.\" 6 Of course, some have no opportunity to marry. Andsome divorces are unavoidable. But the Lord willultimately compensate those faithful ones who aredenied mortal fulfillment. The \"Wolf\" of Natural Adversity Every marriage is tested repeatedly by three kinds of wolves. The first wolf is natural adversity. Afterasking God for years to give them a first child, Davidand Fran had a baby with a serious heart defect.Following a three-week struggle, they buried theirnewborn son. Like Adam and Eve before them, theymourned together, brokenhearted, in faith beforethe Lord. 7 The \"Wolf\" of Personal Imperfections Second, the wolf of their own imperfections will testthem. One woman told me through her tears howher husband's constant criticism finally destroyednot only their marriage but her entire sense of self-worth. He first complained about her cooking andhousecleaning, and then about how she used hertime, how she talked, looked, and reasoned.Eventually she felt utterly inept and dysfunctional.My heart ached for her, and for him. Contrast her with a young woman who had little self-confidence when she first married. Then herhusband found so much to praise in her that shegradually began to believe she was a good personand that her opinions mattered. His belief in herrekindled her innate self-worth. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOVENANTS AND ORDINANCES 48 Marriage is by nature a covenant, not just a private contract one may cancel at will.ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOVENANTS AND ORDINANCES 49 The \"Wolf\" of Excessive Individualism The third wolf is the excessive individualism that has spawned today's contractual attitudes. A seven-year-old girl came home from school crying, \"Mom,don't I belong to you? Our teacher said today thatnobody belongs to anybody\u2014children don't belong to parents, husbands don't belong to wives. I amyours, aren't I, Mom?\" Her mother held her close and whispered, \"Of course you're mine\u2014and I'myours too.\" Surely marriage partners must respect oneanother's individual identity, and family membersare neither slaves nor inanimate objects. But thisteacher's fear, shared today by many, is that thebonds of kinship and marriage are not valuable tiesthat bind, but are, instead, sheer bondage. Ours isthe age of the waning of belonging. The adversary has long cultivated this overemphasis on personal autonomy, and now he feverishlyexploits it. Our deepest God-given instinct is to runto the arms of those who need us and sustain us.But he drives us away from each other today withwedges of distrust and suspicion. He exaggerates the need for having space, getting out, and beingleft alone. Some people believe him\u2014and then theywonder why they feel left alone. And despiteadmirable exceptions, children in America's growingnumber of single-parent families are far more at riskthan children in two-parent families. 8The primary cause of today's general decline in child well-beingis a remarkable \"collapse of marriage.\" 9 Modern Questions about Marriage Many people even wonder these days what marriageis. Should we prohibit same-sex marriage? Shouldwe make divorce more difficult to obtain? Some saythese questions are not society's business becausemarriage is a private contract. 10But as the modern prophets proclaimed, \"marriage . . . isordained of God.\" 11Even secular historically a three-party covenant among a man, awoman, and the state. Society has a huge interest inthe outcome and the offspring of every marriage. Sothe public nature of marriage distinguishes it fromall other relationships. Guests come to weddings,wrote Wendell Berry, because sweethearts \"say theirvows to the community as much as to one another,\"giving themselves not only to each other, but alsoto the common good \"as no contract could ever join them.\" 12Observing Covenants Brings Strength When we observe the covenants we make at the altarof sacrifice, we discover hidden reservoirs of strength.I once said in exasperation to my wife, Marie, \"TheLord placed Adam and Eve on the earth as full-grownpeople. Why couldn't he have done that with thisboy of ours, the one with the freckles and theunruly hair?\" She replied, \"The Lord gave us thatchild to make Christians out of us.\" One night Marie exhausted herself for hours encouraging that child to finish a school assignmentto build his own diorama of a Native Americanvillage on a cookie sheet. It was a test no hirelingwould have endured. At first he fought her efforts,but by bedtime, I saw him lay \"his\" dioramaproudly on a counter. He started for his bed, thenturned around, raced back across the room, andhugged his mother, grinning with his fourth-gradeteeth. Later I asked Marie in complete awe, \"Howdid you do it?\" She said, \"I just made up my mindthat I couldn't leave him, no matter what.\" Then sheadded, \"I didn't know I had it in me.\" She discovered deep, internal wellsprings of compassion becausethe bonds of her covenants gave her strength to laydown her life for her sheep, even an hour at a time. Be As Shepherds, Not Hirelings Now I return to Tom and Tracy, who this yeardiscovered wellsprings of their own. Their secondbaby threatened to come too early to live. Theymight have made a hireling's convenient choice andgone on with their lives, letting a miscarriage occur.But because they tried to observe their covenants bysacrifice, 13active, energetic Tracy lay almost motionless at home for five weeks, then in a hospitalbed for another five. Tom was with her virtuallyevery hour when he was not working or sleeping.They prayed their child to earth. Then the babyrequired 11 more weeks in the hospital. But she ishere, and she is theirs. One night as Tracy waited patiently upon the Lord in the hospital, she sensed that perhaps herwillingness to sacrifice herself for her baby was insome small way like the Good Shepherd's sacrificefor her. She said, \"I had expected that trying to giveso much would be really difficult, but somehow thisfelt more like a privilege.\" As many other parents inZion have done, she and Tom gave their hearts toGod by giving them to their child. In the processthey learned that theirs is a covenant marriage, one that binds them to each other and to the Lord. May we restore the concept of marriage as a covenant, even the new and everlasting covenantof marriage. 14And when the wolf comes, may we be as shepherds, not hirelings, willing to lay downour lives, a day at a time, for the sheep of ourcovenant. Then, like Adam and Eve, we will havejoy. 15In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1. John 10:12-15. 2. See Doctrine and Covenants 2.3. 2 Nephi 2:23.4. See Moses 4:23.5. See Moses 5:11.6.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALCOVENANTS AND ORDINANCES 50ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL51 DATING STANDARDS SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"'Soul mates' are fiction and an illusion; and while every young man and young woman will seek withall diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate withwhom life can be most compatible and beautiful,yet it is certain that almost any good man and anygood woman can have happiness and a successfulmarriage if both are willing to pay the price\"(\"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign, Mar. 1977, 4). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Not only should a mission be regarded as a priesthood duty, but every young man should lookforward to this experience with great joy andanticipation. . . . \"You can do nothing more important. School can wait. Scholarships can be deferred. Occupationalgoals can be postponed. Yes, even temple marriageshould wait until after a young man has served anhonorable full-time mission for the Lord. And Iwould admonish you to date only faithful youngwomen who also believe this and give you thatencouragement\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1986,57; or Ensign, May 1986, 44). \"Now, brethren, do not expect perfection in yourchoice of a mate. Do not be so particular that youoverlook her most important qualities of having astrong testimony, living the principles of the gospel,loving home, wanting to be a mother in Zion, andsupporting you in your priesthood responsibilities. \"Of course, she should be attractive to you, but do not just date one girl after another for the sole pleasureof dating without seeking the Lord's confirmationin your choice of your eternal companion. \"And one good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this: in her presence,do you think your noblest thoughts, do you aspireto your finest deeds, do you wish you were betterthan you are?\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1988, 59;or Ensign, May 1988, 53). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"How truly beautiful is a well-groomed young woman who is clean in body and mind. She is adaughter of God in whom her Eternal Father cantake pride. How handsome is a young man who iswell groomed. He is a son of God, deemed worthyof holding the holy priesthood of God. He does notneed tattoos or earrings on or in his body. The FirstPresidency and the Quorum of the Twelve are allunited in counseling against these things. . . . \"And now just a word on the most common and most difficult of all problems for you young menand young women to handle. It is the relationshipthat you have one with another. You are dealingwith the most powerful of human instincts. Onlythe will to live possibly exceeds it. \"The Lord has made us attractive one to another for a great purpose. But this very attraction becomes asa powder keg unless it is kept under control. It isbeautiful when handled in the right way. It is deadlyif it gets out of hand. \"It is for this reason that the Church counsels against early dating. This rule is not designed to hurt youin any way. It is designed to help you, and it will do so if you will observe it. \"Steady dating at an early age leads so often to tragedy. Studies have shown that the longer a boyand girl date one another, the more likely they areto get into trouble. \"It is better, my friends, to date a variety of companions until you are ready to marry. Have a wonderful time, but stay away from familiarity.Keep your hands to yourself. It may not be easy, but it is possible. . . . \". . . You mean so much to this Church. It could not be the same without you. Stand tall, proud ofyour inheritance as sons and daughters of God.Look to Him for understanding and guidance. Walkaccording to His precepts and commandments. \"You can have a good time. Of course you can! We want you to have fun. We want you to enjoy life.We do not want you to be prudes. We want you tobe robust and cheerful, to sing and dance, to laughand be happy. Right marriage begins with right dating. \u2014Elder Spencer W. Kimball\"But in so doing, be humble and be prayerful, and the smiles of heaven will fall upon you\" (\"AProphet''s Counsel and Prayer for Youth,\" Ensign, Jan. 2001, 8, 11). \"I do not worry about you young men who have recently returned from the mission field. You know as well as I what you ought to do. It is yourresponsibility and opportunity, under the naturalprocess of dating and courting, to find a wonderfulcompanion and marry in the house of the Lord.Don't rush it unduly and don't delay it unduly.'Marry in haste and repent at leisure' is an old proverbthat still has meaning in our time. But do not dally along in a fruitless, frustrating, and frivolousdating game that only raises hopes and bringsdisappointment and in some cases heartache\" (\"ToSingle Adults,\" Ensign, June 72; see also 73-75). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"Boys seldom criticize a girl for using too little makeup. Sometimes they say, 'She's a nice girl, but Iwish she'd dress up, and she uses too much makeup.'To be overdressed, to be gaudily dressed, to be dressedto look sexy, to be overdecorated is bad taste, to saythe least. The young woman is smart who can donjust enough powder and lipstick to convince thefellows it isn't makeup at all, but the 'real you.' . . . \"Young men should keep their faces shaved, their hair combed, their haircuts reasonably conservative,their nails cleaned. Overtight, suggestive pants brandyoung men as vulgar. Young people can be smartand personable, dignified and attractive by findingan area somewhere less than the extremes and stillin good style\" (\"Save the Youth of Zion,\" Improvement Era,Sept. 1965, 761). \"Clearly, right marriage begins with right dating. A person generally marries someone from amongthose with whom he associates. . . . Therefore, thiswarning comes with great emphasis. Do not take thechance of dating nonmembers, or members who areuntrained and faithless. A girl may say, 'Oh I do notintend to marry this person. It is just a \"fun\" date.'But one cannot afford to take a chance on falling inlove with someone who may never accept the gospel\"(Miracle of Forgiveness, 241-42). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"You young men must cultivate a considerate attitude toward women of all ages. The young women askedme to tell you that they want you to respect themand show them common, sincere courtesy. Do nothesitate to show your good manners by opening a door for them, taking the initiative in invitingthem on a date, and standing as they enter a room.Believe it or not, in this age of equal rights, theyoung women want you to extend these simplecourtesies\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 48; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 37). FOR THE STRENGTH OF YOUTH: FULFILLING OUR DUTY TO GOD Booklet Agency and Accountability \"Wherefore, men . . . are free to choose liberty and eternal life,through the great Mediator ofall men, or to choose captivityand death\" (2 Nephi 2:27). Your Heavenly Father has given you agency, the abilityto choose right from wrong and to act for yourself. You have been given theHoly Ghost to help you know good from evil. Whileyou are here on earth, you are being proven to see ifyou will use your agency to show your love for Godby keeping His commandments. While you are free to choose for yourself, you are not free to choose the consequences of your actions.When you make a choice, you will receive theconsequences of that choice. The consequences maynot be immediate, but they will always follow, forgood or bad. Wrong choices delay your progressionand lead to heartache and misery. Right choices leadto happiness and eternal life. That is why it is soimportant for you to choose what is right throughoutyour life. You are responsible for the choices you make. You should not blame your circumstances, yourfamily, or your friends if you choose to disobeyGod's commandments. You are a child of Godwith great strength. You have the ability to chooserighteousness and happiness, no matter whatyour circumstances. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 52You are also responsible for developing the abilities and talents Heavenly Father has given you. You areaccountable to Him for what you do with yourabilities and how you spend your time. Do not idleaway your time. Be willing to work hard. Choose todo many good things of your own free will. Matthew 25:14-29 Gratitude \"He who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious\" (D&C 78:19). The Lord wants you to have a spirit of gratitude in all you do and say. Live with a spirit of thanksgivingand you will have greater happiness and satisfactionin life. Even in your most difficult times, you canfind much to be grateful for. Doing so will strengthenand bless you. In your prayers, before you ask for blessings, pour out your heart to God in thanks for the blessings youhave already received. Thank Him for your family,for friends and loved ones, for leaders and teachers,for the gospel, and for His Son, Jesus Christ. You can also express gratitude to the Lord by the way you live. When you keep His commandmentsand serve others, you show that you love Him andare grateful to Him. Express appreciation to everyonewho helps you in any way. Luke 17:12-19 Education \"Learn wisdom in thy youth\" (Alma 37:35).The Lord wants you to educate your mind and improve your skills and abilities. Education will helpyou to be an influence for good in the world. It willhelp you better provide for yourself, your lovedones, and those in need. Be willing to work diligently and make sacrifices to obtain learning. Education is an investment thatbrings great rewards. You live in a competitiveworld where a good education opens the doors ofopportunity that may otherwise be closed to you. Maintain an enthusiasm for learning throughout your life. Find joy in continuing to learn aboutyourself, other people, and the world around you.Study the words of the Lord, and continue learningabout your Heavenly Father's plan. Make seminaryan important part of your total education. Doctrine and Covenants 88:77-80Family \"Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.Successful marriages and families are established andmaintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance,forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, andwholesome recreational activities\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\"). Being part of a family is a great blessing. Your family can provide you with companionship and happiness,help you learn correct principles in a lovingatmosphere, and help you prepare for eternal life.Not all families are the same, but each is importantin Heavenly Father's plan. Do your part to build a happy home. Be cheerful, helpful, and considerate of others. Many problemsin the home are created because family membersspeak and act selfishly or unkindly. Concern yourselfwith the needs of other family members. Seek to bea peacemaker rather than to tease, fight, and quarrel.Remember that the family is the most sacred unit ofthe Church. Honor your parents by showing love and respect for them and by being obedient. Be willing to help in thehome with chores that need to be done. Participatein family activities and traditions, including familyprayer, family home evenings, and family scripturereading. These traditions strengthen and unifyfamilies. Set a good example for other familymembers. Strengthen your relationships with your brothers and sisters. They can become your closest friends.Support them in their interests and help them withproblems they may be facing. Ephesians 6:1-3 Friends \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"(Matthew 25:40). Choose your friends carefully. They will greatly influence how you think and act, and even helpdetermine the person you will become. Choosefriends who share your values so you can strengthenand encourage each other in living high standards.A true friend will encourage you to be your best self. To have good friends, be a good friend yourself. Show interest in others and let them know you careabout them. Treat everyone with kindness and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 53respect. Go out of your way to be a friend to those who are shy or do not feel included. Invite your friends of other faiths to your Church meetings and activities, where they can learn aboutthe gospel. Help them feel welcome and wanted.Many people have joined the Church through theexample and fellowship of their friends. Don't beoffended if your friends decline your invitation tolearn more about the gospel. Just continue to betheir friend. Make a special effort to reach out to new converts and to those who are less active. Help them feelwelcome among your group of friends. You canstrengthen them by sharing your testimony and by setting a good example. Alma 17:1-2 Dress and Appearance \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? . . . The temple which ye are\" (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). Your body is God's sacred creation. Respect it as a gift from God, and do not defile it in any way.Through your dress and appearance, you can showthe Lord that you know how precious your body is.You can show that you are a disciple of Jesus Christ. Prophets of God have always counseled His children to dress modestly. The way you dress is a reflectionof what you are on the inside. Your dress andgrooming send messages about you to others andinfluence the way you and others act. When youare well groomed and modestly dressed, you invitethe companionship of the Spirit and can exercise agood influence on those around you. Never lower your dress standards for any occasion. Doing so sends the message that you are using yourbody to get attention and approval and thatmodesty is important only when it is convenient. Immodest clothing includes short shorts and skirts, tight clothing, shirts that do not cover the stomach,and other revealing attire. Young women shouldwear clothing that covers the shoulder and avoidclothing that is low-cut in the front or the back orrevealing in any other manner. Young men shouldalso maintain modesty in their appearance. Allshould avoid extremes in clothing, appearance, andhairstyle. Always be neat and clean and avoid beingsloppy or inappropriately casual in dress, grooming,and manners. Ask yourself, \"Would I feel comfortablewith my appearance if I were in the Lord's presence?\" Someday you will receive your endowment in the temple. Your dress and behavior should help youprepare for that sacred time. Do not disfigure yourself with tattoos or body piercings. If girls or women desire to have their earspierced, they are encouraged to wear only one pairof modest earrings. Show respect for the Lord and for yourself by dressing appropriately for Church meetings andactivities, whether on Sunday or during the week. If you are not sure what is appropriate, ask yourparents or leaders for help. Alma 1:27 Entertainment and the Media \"If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things\" (Articles ofFaith 1:13). Whatever you read, listen to, or look at has an effect on you. Therefore, choose only entertainment andmedia that uplift you. Good entertainment will helpyou to have good thoughts and make righteouschoices. It will allow you to enjoy yourself withoutlosing the Spirit of the Lord. While much entertainment is good, some of it can lead you away from righteous living. Offensivematerial is often found in web sites, concerts,movies, music, videocassettes, DVDs, books,magazines, pictures, and other media. Satan usessuch entertainment to deceive you by making whatis wrong and evil look normal and exciting. It canmislead you into thinking that everyone is doingthings that are wrong. Do not attend, view, or participate in entertainment that is vulgar, immoral, violent, or pornographic inany way. Do not participate in entertainment thatin any way presents immorality or violent behavioras acceptable. Pornography in all its forms is especially dangerous and addictive. What may begin as a curiousindulgence can become a destructive habit thattakes control of your life. It can lead you to sexualtransgression and even criminal behavior.Pornography is a poison that weakens your self-control, changes the way you see others, causes you ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 54ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 55 to lose the guidance of the Spirit, and can even affect your ability to have a normal relationship withyour future spouse. If you encounter pornography,turn away from it immediately. Depictions of violence often glamorize vicious behavior. They offend the Spirit and make you lessable to respond to others in a sensitive, caring way.They contradict the Savior's message of love for oneanother. Have the courage to walk out of a movie or video party, turn off a computer or television, change a radio station, or put down a magazine if what isbeing presented does not meet Heavenly Father'sstandards. Do these things even if others do not.Let your friends and family know that you arecommitted to keeping God's standards. You have thegift of the Holy Ghost, which will give you strengthand help you make good choices. Moroni 7:12-19 Music and Dancing \"Praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing\" (D&C 136:28). Music is an important and powerful part of life. It can be an influence for good that helps you draw closerto Heavenly Father. However, it can also be used forwicked purposes. Unworthy music may seemharmless, but it can have evil effects on your mindand spirit. Choose carefully the music you listen to. Pay attention to how you feel when you are listening.Don't listen to music that drives away the Spirit,encourages immorality, glorifies violence, uses foulor offensive language, or promotes Satanism orother evil practices. Dancing can be fun and can provide an opportunity to meet new people. However, it too can be misused.When dancing, avoid full body contact with yourpartner. Do not use positions or moves that aresuggestive of sexual behavior. Plan and attenddances where dress, grooming, lighting, lyrics, andmusic contribute to a wholesome atmosphere wherethe Spirit of the Lord may be present. Doctrine and Covenants 25:12 Language \"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good\" (Ephesians 4:29).How you speak says much about who you are. Cleanand intelligent language is evidence of a bright andwholesome mind. Use language that uplifts,encourages, and compliments others. Do not insultothers or put them down, even in joking. Speakkindly and positively about others so you can fulfillthe Lord's commandment to love one another.When you use good language, you invite the Spiritto be with you. Always use the names of God and Jesus Christ with reverence and respect. Misusing their names is a sin.Profane, vulgar, or crude language or gestures, as wellas jokes about immoral actions, are offensive to theLord and to others. Foul language harms your spiritand degrades you. Do not let others influence youto use it. Choose friends who use good language. Help others around you use clean language by your example andby good-naturedly encouraging them to choose otherwords. Politely walk away or change the subjectwhen others around you use bad language. If you have developed the habit of swearing, you can break it. Begin by making a decision to change.Pray for help. If you start to use words you knoware wrong, keep quiet or say what you have to sayin a different way. James 3:2-13 Dating \"The Lord has made us attractive one to another for a great purpose. But this very attraction becomes as apowder keg unless it is kept under control. . . . It is forthis reason that the Church counsels against earlydating\" (President Gordon B. Hinckley). In cultures where dating or courtship is acceptable, dating can help you develop lasting friendships andeventually find an eternal companion. Date onlythose who have high standards and in whosecompany you can maintain your standards. A young man and a young woman on a date are responsible to help each other maintain their standards and to protect each other's honor and virtue. You musthonor the sanctity of the priesthood and ofwomanhood. Do not date until you are at least 16 years old. Dating before then can lead to immorality, limit thenumber of other young people you meet, and depriveyou of experiences that will help you choose aneternal partner.Not all teenagers need to date or even want to. Many young people do not date during their teenyears because they are not yet interested, do nothave opportunities, or simply want to delay formingserious relationships. However, good friendshipscan and should be developed at every age. When you begin dating, go in groups or on double dates. Avoid going on frequent dates with the sameperson. Make sure your parents meet those you date.You may want to invite your dates to activities withyour family. Plan dating activities that are positiveand inexpensive and that will help you get to knoweach other. Do things that will help you and yourcompanions maintain your self-respect and remainclose to the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 6:14 Sexual Purity \"The sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husbandand wife\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\"). Physical intimacy between husband and wife is beautiful and sacred. It is ordained of God for thecreation of children and for the expression of lovebetween husband and wife. God has commandedthat sexual intimacy be reserved for marriage. When you obey God's commandment to be sexually pure, you prepare yourself to make and keep sacredcovenants in the temple. You prepare yourself tobuild a strong marriage and to bring children intothe world as part of a loving family. You protectyourself from the emotional damage that alwayscomes from sharing physical intimacies withsomeone outside of marriage. Do not have any sexual relations before marriage, and be completely faithful to your spouse aftermarriage. Satan may tempt you to rationalize thatsexual intimacy before marriage is acceptable whentwo people are in love. That is not true. In God'ssight, sexual sins are extremely serious because theydefile the power God has given us to create life. Theprophet Alma taught that sexual sins are more seriousthan any other sins except murder or denying theHoly Ghost (see Alma 39:5). Before marriage, do not do anything to arouse the powerful emotions that must be expressed only inmarriage. Do not participate in passionate kissing,lie on top of another person, or touch the private,sacred parts of another person's body, with or withoutclothing. Do not allow anyone to do that with you.Do not arouse those emotions in your own body. In cultures where dating or courting is acceptable, always treat your date with respect, never as anobject to be used for your lustful desires. Stay inareas of safety where you can easily control yourphysical feelings. Do not participate in talk oractivities that arouse sexual feelings. Homosexual activity is a serious sin. If you find yourself struggling with same-gender attraction,seek counsel from your parents and bishop. Theywill help you. Victims of rape, incest, or other sexual abuse are not guilty of sin. If you have been a victim of anyof these crimes, know that you are innocent andthat God loves you. Seek your bishop's counselimmediately so he can help guide you through theprocess of emotional healing. If you are tempted to commit sexual transgressions, seek help from your parents, your bishop, and friendsyou can trust. Pray to the Lord, who will help youresist temptation and overcome inappropriatethoughts and feelings. If you have committed sexual transgressions, begin the process of repentance now so you can find innerpeace and have the full companionship of the Spirit.Seek the Lord's forgiveness. Talk with your bishop.He will help you obtain the forgiveness available tothose who truly repent. Genesis 39:1-12; Doctrine and Covenants 38:42 Repentance \"He who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more\" (D&C 58:42). The Savior gave His life for us and suffered for our sins. This great sacrifice is called the Atonement.Through the Atonement, you can receive forgivenessand be cleansed from your sins when you repent.When you do what is necessary to receive forgiveness,you will know for yourself the power of theAtonement and the love God has for you. You willfeel the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ, which willbring you great strength. Satan wants you to think that you cannot repent, but that is absolutely not true. The Savior haspromised you forgiveness if you will do what isrequired. The sooner you repent, the sooner youwill find the blessings that come from forgiveness. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 56ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL57 Some people knowingly break God's commandments, expecting to repent before they go to the temple orserve a mission. Such deliberate sin mocks theSavior's Atonement and invites Satan to influenceyour life. Repentance for such behavior is difficultand can take a long time. If you sin in this way, youmay lose years of blessings and spiritual guidance.You may become trapped in the sinful behavior,making it difficult to find your way back. You always need to confess your sins to the Lord. You should also confess your sins to those you havewronged. If you have committed serious sins, such asimmorality, you need to confess them to your bishop. Alma 36:6-24 Honesty \"Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness\" (Exodus 20:15-16). Be honest with yourself, others, and the Lord. When you are honest in every way, you build strength ofcharacter that will allow you to be of great serviceto God and others. You will be blessed with peaceof mind and self-respect. When you are honest, youwill be trusted by the Lord and by those around you. Dishonesty hurts you and usually hurts others as well. When you lie, steal, shoplift, or cheat, you damageyour spirit and become less able to do good things.Be honest in your job, giving a full amount of workfor your pay. Don't rationalize that wrong is right, even though many people around you may think there is no harmin being dishonest. Being honest requires courageand commitment to do what you know is right. Alma 27:27 Sabbath Day Observance \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy\" (Exodus 20:8).The Lord has given the Sabbath day for your benefit and has commanded you to keep it holy. Observingthe Sabbath will bring you closer to the Lord and toyour family. It will give you needed rest andrejuvenation. Many uplifting activities are appropriate for the Sabbath. Worship the Lord, attend church, spendquiet time with your family, study the gospel, writeletters, write in your journal, do family history work,and visit the sick or homebound. Your dress before,during, and after church meetings should showrespect for the Sabbath.When seeking a job, share with your potentialemployer your desire to attend your Sunday meetingsand keep the Sabbath day holy. Many employersvalue employees with these personal convictions.Whenever possible, choose a job that does notrequire you to work on Sundays. Sunday is not a holiday or a day for recreation or athletic events. Do not seek entertainment or spendmoney on this day. Let your friends know whatyour standards are so they will not try to persuadeyou to participate in activities that are notappropriate for the Sabbath. Doctrine and Covenants 59:9-13 Tithes and Offerings \"Bring ye all the tithes into . . . and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will notopen you the windows of heaven, and pour you out ablessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\"(Malachi 3:10; 3 Nephi 24:10). The law of tithing is an important commandment that you should obey throughout your life. A titheis one-tenth of your income. Paying tithing shows your gratitude for all that God has given you. It is a way to help build God'skingdom on earth. Tithing is used to build templesand meetinghouses, translate and publish thescriptures, provide Church materials to members,do missionary work, perform temple and familyhistory work, and support seminaries and institutes. Your attitude is important in paying tithing. Pay it because you love the Lord and have faith in Him.Pay it willingly with a thankful heart. Pay it first,even when you think you don't have enough moneyto meet your other needs. Doing so will help youovercome selfishness and be more receptive to theSpirit. At the end of each year, schedule a time for tithing settlement with your bishop. This is a meeting inwhich you review your contribution records anddeclare whether you have paid a full tithe. Obey the law of the fast by fasting once each month (if health permits), usually on the first Sunday of themonth. A proper fast day observance includes noteating or drinking for two consecutive meals andgiving a generous fast offering to help care for thosein need. Begin and end your fast with prayer, askingfor special help with a specific need. Doctrine and Covenants 119:3-4DATING STANDARDSPhysical Health \"All saints who remember to keep and do these sayings . . . shall receive health in their navel and marrow to theirbones; and shall find wisdom and great treasures ofknowledge, even hidden treasures; and shall run and notbe weary, and shall walk and not faint\" (D&C 89:18-20). The Lord has commanded you to take good care of your body. To do this, observe the Word of Wisdom,found in Doctrine and Covenants 89. Eat nutritiousfood, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.When you do all these things, you remain free fromharmful addictions and have control over your life.You gain the blessings of a healthy body, an alertmind, and the guidance of the Holy Ghost. Never use tobacco products, such as cigarettes, snuff, chewing tobacco, cigars, and pipe tobacco.They are very addictive and will damage your bodyand shorten your life. Also, do not drink coffee ortea, for these are addictive and harmful. Any form of alcohol is harmful to your body and spirit. Being under the influence of alcohol weakensyour judgment and self-control and could lead youto break the law of chastity or other commandments.Drinking can lead to alcoholism, which destroysindividuals and families. Any drug, chemical, or dangerous practice that is used to produce a sensation or \"high\" can destroyyour physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.These include hard drugs, prescription or over-the-counter medications that are abused, and householdchemicals. Never let Satan or others lead you to think that breaking the Word of Wisdom will make you happieror more attractive. Daniel 1:3-20 Service to Others \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another\" (John 13:35). Service to others is one of the most important characteristics of a disciple of Jesus Christ. A discipleis willing to bear other people's burdens and tocomfort those who need comfort (see Mosiah 18:8-9).Often Heavenly Father will meet the needs of othersthrough you. When serving, look to the Savior as your example. Although He came to earth as the Son of God, Hehumbly served those around Him.There are many ways to serve others. You can serve in your Church assignments and in your home,school, and community. Seek daily the guidance ofthe Holy Ghost to know whom to serve and how tohelp meet their needs. Often the most importantservice is expressed through simple, everyday actsof kindness. As you devote yourself to serving others, you will draw closer to Heavenly Father. Your heart will befilled with love. Your capacities will increase, andyour life and the lives of those around you willbe blessed. Luke 10:25-37 Go Forward with Faith The standards presented in this book will help you make correct choices. Review them often and askyourself, \"Am I living the way the Lord wants me to live?\" To help you become all that the Lord wants you to become, get on your knees each day and express toHim the desires of your heart. He is the source of allwisdom, and you need His help. He will hear andanswer you. Read the scriptures daily. They are a powerful source of personal revelation and a constant strength toyour testimony. Remember and keep the covenants you made when you were baptized and that you renew each weekwhen you partake of the sacrament. You young menshould keep the covenants you made when youreceived the priesthood. Keeping these covenantsnow will help you prepare for the temple covenantsyou will make in the future. Be true to the Lord and to His Church in all circumstances. The authorities of the Church willlead you in paths of happiness. Be grateful for yourmembership in God's great kingdom. Be humble and willing to listen to the whisperings of the Spirit. Place the wisdom of the Lord aboveyour own wisdom. When you do these things, the Lord will make much more out of your life than you can by yourself. Hewill increase your opportunities, expand your vision,and strengthen you. He will give you the help youneed to meet your trials and challenges. You will findtrue joy as you come to know your Father in Heavenand His Son, Jesus Christ, and feel their love for you. 2 Nephi 31:16-21 ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDATING STANDARDS 58ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL59 DEBT Related Scriptures Proverbs 22:7 \"The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.\" Romans 13:8 \"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.\" Mosiah 4:28 \"And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighborshould return the thing that he borroweth, accordingas he also.\" Doctrine and Covenants 64:27 \"Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to get in debt to thine enemies.\" Doctrine and Covenants 104:78 \"And again, verily I say unto you, concerning your debts\u2014behold it is my will that you shall pay allyour debts.\" Doctrine and Covenants 136:25 \"If thou borrowed; and if canstnot repay then go straightway and tell thy neighbor,lest he condemn thee.\" SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W.

Hinckley President of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Oct. 1998, 69-72; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 52-54 To the Older Men Now, brethren, I should like to talk to the oldermen, hoping that there will be some lesson for theyounger men as well. I wish to speak to you about temporal matters.As a backdrop for what I wish to say, I read to you a few verses from the 41st chapter of Genesis. Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, dreamed dreams which greatly troubled him. The wise men of his courtcould not give an interpretation. Joseph was thenbrought before him: \"Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: \"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: \"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, very ill favoured and leanfleshed. . . . \"And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: . . . \"And I saw in my dream . . seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: \"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: \"And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. . .\"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, . . . God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. \"The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. . . . \". . . What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. \"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDEBT 60ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL61 \"And there shall arise after them seven years of famine. . . . \". . . And God it to pass\" (Genesis 41:17-20, 22-26, 28-30, 32). Get Our Houses in Order Now, brethren, I want to make it very clear that I amnot prophesying, that I am not predicting years offamine in the future. But I am suggesting that thetime has come to get our houses in order. So many of our people are living on the very edge of their incomes. In fact, some are living on borrowings. We have witnessed in recent weeks wide and fearsome swings in the markets of the world. The economy isa fragile thing. A stumble in the economy in Jakartaor Moscow can immediately affect the entire world.It can eventually reach down to each of us asindividuals. There is a portent of stormy weatherahead to which we had better give heed. I hope with all my heart that we shall never slip into a depression. I am a child of the Great Depression ofthe thirties. I finished the university in 1932, whenunemployment in this area exceeded 33 percent. My father was then president of the largest stake in the Church in this valley. It was before our presentwelfare program was established. He walked the floorworrying about his people. He and his associatesestablished a great wood-chopping project designedto keep the home furnaces and stoves going andthe people warm in the winter. They had no moneywith which to buy coal. Men who had been affluentwere among those who chopped wood. Warning against Consumer Debt I repeat, I hope we will never again see such adepression. But I am troubled by the huge consumerinstallment debt which hangs over the people of thenation, including our own people. In March 1997that debt totaled $1.2 trillion, which represented a 7 percent increase over the previous year. In December of 1997, 55 to 60 million households in the United States carried credit card balances.These balances averaged more than $7,000 and cost$1,000 per year in interest and fees. Consumer debtas a percentage of disposable income rose from16.3 percent in 1993 to 19.3 percent in 1996. Everyone knows that every dollar borrowed carries with it the penalty of paying interest. When moneycannot be repaid, then bankruptcy follows. Therewere 1,350,118 bankruptcies in the United Stateslast year. This represented a 50 percent increasefrom 1992. In the second quarter of this year, nearly362,000 persons filed for bankruptcy, a recordnumber for a three-month period. We are beguiled by seductive advertising. Television carries the enticing invitation to borrow up to125 percent of the value of one's home. But nomention is made of interest. President J. Reuben Clark Jr., in the April 1938 general conference, said from this pulpit, \"Once indebt, interest is your companion every minute ofthe day and night; you cannot shun it or slip awayfrom it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither toentreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever youget in its way or cross its course or fail to meet itsdemands, it crushes you\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1938, 103). Live within Your Means I recognize that it may be necessary to borrow toget a home, of course. But let us buy a home thatwe can afford and thus ease the payments whichwill constantly hang over our heads without mercyor respite for as long as 30 years. No one knows when emergencies will strike. I am somewhat familiar with the case of a man who washighly successful in his profession. He lived incomfort. He built a large home. Then one day he wassuddenly involved in a serious accident. Instantly,without warning, he almost lost his life. He was lefta cripple. Destroyed was his earning power. He facedhuge medical bills. He had other payments to make.He was helpless before his creditors. One momenthe was rich; the next he was broke. Since the beginnings of the Church, the Lord has spoken on this matter of debt. To Martin Harristhrough revelation He said: \"Pay the debt thou hastcontracted with the printer. Release thyself frombondage\" (D&C 19:35). President Heber J. Grant spoke repeatedly on this matter from this pulpit. He said: \"If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into thefamily, it is to live within our means. And if there isany one thing that is grinding and discouragingand disheartening, it is to have debts andDEBTobligations that one cannot meet\" (Gospel Standards, comp. G. Homer Durham [1941], 111). Become Self-Reliant We are carrying a message of self-reliance throughoutthe Church. Self-reliance cannot obtain when thereis serious debt hanging over a household. One hasneither independence nor freedom from bondagewhen he is obligated to others. In managing the affairs of the Church, we have tried to set an example. We have, as a matter ofpolicy, stringently followed the practice of settingaside each year a percentage of the income of theChurch against a possible day of need. I am grateful to be able to say that the Church in all its operations, in all its undertakings, in all of itsdepartments, is able to function without borrowedmoney. If we cannot get along, we will curtail ourprograms. We will shrink expenditures to fit theincome. We will not borrow. One of the happiest days in the life of President Joseph F. Smith was the day the Church paid off itslong-standing indebtedness. What a wonderful feeling it is to be free of debt, to have a little money against a day of emergency putaway where it can be retrieved when necessary. President Faust would not tell you this himself. Perhaps I can tell it, and he can take it out on meafterward. He had a mortgage on his home drawing4 percent interest. Many people would have toldhim he was foolish to pay off that mortgage whenit carried so low a rate of interest. But the firstopportunity he had to acquire some means, he and his wife determined they would pay off theirmortgage. He has been free of debt since that day.That's why he wears a smile on his face, and that'swhy he whistles while he works. Free Yourselves from Bondage of Debt I urge you, brethren, to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in yourexpenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchasesto avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt asquickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage. This is a part of the temporal gospel in which we believe. May the Lord bless you, my belovedbrethren, to set your houses in order. If you havepaid your debts, if you have a reserve, even thoughit be small, then should storms howl about yourhead, you will have shelter for your wives andchildren and peace in your hearts. That's all I haveto say about it, but I wish to say it with all theemphasis of which I am capable. I leave with you my testimony of the divinity of this work and my love for each of you, in the nameof the Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDEBT 62ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL63 DIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEENMEN AND WOMEN SELECTED TEACHINGS President Harold B. Lee \"From my experience, it would seem that faithful mothers have a special gift that we often refer to asmother's intuition. Perhaps with the great blessing ofmotherhood, our Heavenly Father has endowed themwith this quality, since fathers, busy in priesthoodcallings and with the work of earning a livelihood,never draw quite as close to heavenly beings inmatters that relate to the more intimate details ofbringing up children in the home\" (Teachings ofHarold B. Lee, 291). President Spencer W. Kimball \"In his wisdom and mercy, our Father made men and women dependent on each other for the fullflowering of their potential. Because their naturesare somewhat different, they can complement eachother; because they are in many ways alike, theycan understand each other. Let neither envy theother for their differences; let both discern what issuperficial and what is beautifully basic in thosedifferences, and act accordingly\" (\"Relief Society\u2014Its Promise and Potential,\" Ensign, Mar. 1976, 5). \"We had full equality as his spirit children. We haveequality as recipients of God's perfected love foreach of us. . . . \"Within those great assurances, however, our roles and assignments differ. These are eternal differences\u2014with women being given many tremendousresponsibilities of motherhood and sisterhood andmen being given the tremendous and the priesthood\" (\"The Role ofRighteous Women,\" Ensign, Nov. 1979, 102). President Ezra Taft Benson \"You [women] were not created to be the same as men. Your natural attributes, affections, andpersonalities are entirely different from a man's.They consist of faithfulness, benevolence, kindness,and charity. They give you the personality of awoman. They also balance the more aggressive andcompetitive nature of a man. \"The business world is competitive and sometimes ruthless. We do not doubt that women have boththe brainpower and skills\u2014and in some instancessuperior abilities\u2014to compete with men. But bycompeting they must, of necessity, become aggressiveand competitive. Thus their godly attributes arediminished and they acquire a quality of samenesswith man\" (Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, 547-48). President Howard W. Hunter \"I suppose you would say it is a man's viewpoint to throw a burden upon a woman to maintain thestability and the sweetness of marriage, but thisseems to be her divine nature. She has a superiorspirituality in the marriage relationship, and theopportunity to encourage, uplift, teach, and be theone who sets the example in the family for righteousliving. When women come to the point of realizingthat it is more important to be superior than to beequal, they will find the real joy in living thoseprinciples that the Lord set out in his divine plan\"(Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 139). \"It seems strange that women want to enter intoprofessions and into work and into places in societyon an equality with men, wanting to dress like menand carry on men's work. I don't deny the fact thatwomen are capable of doing so, but as I read thescriptures, I find it hard to reconcile this with whatthe Lord has said about women\u2014what he has saidabout the family, what he has said about children.It seems to me that in regard to men and women,even though they might be equal in many things,there is a differentiation between them that we fullyunderstand. I hope the time never comes whenwomen will be brought down to the level with men,although they seem to be making these demands inmeetings held . . . all over the world\" (Teachings of Howard W. Hunter, 150). Some roles are best suited to the masculine nature and others to the feminine nature. \u2014Elder Boyd K. PackerPresident James E.

Rather, the answer lies in being who you are and living upto your divine potential by fulfilling eternalcommitments. . . . \"All of you will have to sometime answer to your natural womanly instincts, which the Prophet Josephsaid are according to your natures. He said, 'If youlive up to your privileges, the angels cannot berestrained from being your associates.'

Follow the noble,intuitive feelings planted deep within your souls byDeity in the previous world. In this way you will beresponding to the Holy Spirit of God and will besanctified by truth. By so doing, you will be eternallyhonored and loved. Much of your work is to enrichmankind with your great capacity for care and mercy\"(\"How Near to the Angels,\" Ensign, May 1998, 95-97).

Inturn, a wife and a mother can domuch\u2014and in time of need, mostthings\u2014usually considered theresponsibility of the man, withoutjeopardizing their distinct roles. Evenso, leaders, and especially parents,should recognize that there is a distinctmasculine nature and a distinct feminine nature essential to the foundation of the home and the family.

Elder Thomas S. Monson \"What the modernists, even the liberationists, fail to remember is that women, in addition to beingpersons, also belong to a sex, and that with thedifferences in sex are associated important differencesin function and behavior.

Scott \"Our Heavenly Father endowed His sons and daughters with unique traits especially fitted fortheir individual responsibilities as they fulfill Hisplan. To follow His plan requires that you do thosethings He expects of you as a son or daughter,husband or wife. Those roles are different, butentirely compatible. In the Lord's plan, it takestwo\u2014a man and a woman\u2014to form a whole.Indeed, a husband and wife are not two identicalhalves, but a wondrous, divinely determinedcombination of complementary capacities andcharacteristics. \"Marriage allows these different characteristics to come together in oneness\u2014in unity\u2014to bless ahusband and wife, their children and grandchildren.For the greatest happiness and productivity in life,both husband and wife are needed. Their effortsinterlock and are complementary. Each has individualtraits that best fit the role the Lord has defined forhappiness as a man or woman. When used as theLord intends, those capacities allow a married coupleto think, act, and rejoice as one\u2014to face challengestogether and overcome them as one, to grow in loveand understanding, and through temple ordinancesto be bound together as one whole, eternally. Thatis the plan. \"You can learn how to be more effective parents by studying the lives of Adam and Eve. Adam wasMichael who helped create the earth\u2014a glorious,superb individual. Eve was his equal\u2014a full,powerfully contributing partner. After they hadpartaken of the fruit, the Lord spoke with them.Their comments reveal some different characteristicsof a man and woman. To Adam He said, 'Hast thoueaten of the tree whereof I not eat?' [Moses 4:17.] Now, Adam'sresponse was characteristic of a man who wants to beperceived as being as close to right as possible. Adamresponded, 'The woman thou gavest me, andcommandest that she should remain with me, she gave me of the fruit of the tree and I did eat.'[Moses 4:18.] And the Lord said unto thou hast done?' characteristic of a Her answerwas very simple and straightforward. 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.' [Moses 4:19.]\" Report, Oct. 1996, 101; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 73-74). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"We know so little, brothers and sisters, about the reasons for the division of duties betweenwomanhood and manhood as well as betweenmotherhood and priesthood. These were divinelydetermined in another time and another place. . . . \"We men know the women of God as wives, mothers, sisters, daughters, associates, and friends. You seemto tame us and to gentle us, and, yes, to teach us andto inspire us. For you, we have admiration as well asaffection, because righteousness is not a matter ofrole, nor goodness a matter of gender. In the work ofthe Kingdom, men and women are not without eachother, but do not envy each other, lest by reversalsand renunciations of role we make a wasteland ofboth womanhood and manhood\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1978, 13; or Ensign, May 1978, 10). Elder Merrill J. Bateman \"When a man understands how glorious a woman is, he treats her differently. When a woman understandsthat a man has the seeds of divinity within him, shehonors him not only for who he is but for what hemay become. An understanding of the divine natureallows each person to have respect for the other.The eternal view engenders a desire in men andwomen to learn from and share with each other. \"Men and women are created as complements. They complete one another. Paul told the Corinthians:'Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman,neither the woman without the man, in the Lord'(1 Corinthians 11:11). Men and women complementeach other not only physically, but also emotionallyand spiritually. The apostle Paul taught that 'theunbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, andthe unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband'and through them both the children are made holy(1 Corinthians 7:14). Men and women have differentstrengths and weaknesses, and marriage is asynergistic relationship in which spiritual growth isenhanced because of the differences\" (\"The EternalFamily,\" 113).FOR TIME AND ALL ETERNITY Elder Boyd K. Packer Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 27-32; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 21-24 The Great Plan of Happiness Dear brethren and sisters, the scriptures and theteachings of the Apostles and prophets speak of usin premortal life as sons and daughters, spiritchildren of God. 1Gender existed before, and did not begin at mortal birth.2 In the great council in heaven,3God's plan was presented:4the plan of salvation,5the plan of redemption,6the great plan of happiness.7The plan provides for a proving; all must choose betweengood and evil. 8His plan provides for a Redeemer, an atonement, the Resurrection, and, if we obey,our return to the presence of God. The adversary rebelled and adopted a plan of his own. 9Those who followed him were denied the right to a mortal body.10Our presence here confirms that we sanctioned our Father's plan.11 The single purpose of Lucifer is to oppose the greatplan of happiness, to corrupt the purest, mostbeautiful and appealing experiences of life: romance,love, marriage, and parenthood. 12The specters of heartbreak and guilt13follow him about. Only repentance can heal what he hurts. God's Plan Requires Marriage and Family The plan of happiness requires the righteous unionof male and female, man and woman, husband andwife. 14Doctrines teach us how to respond to the compelling natural impulses which too oftendominate how we behave. A body patterned after the image of God was created for Adam, 15and he was introduced into the Garden.16At first, Adam was alone. He held the priesthood,17but, alone, he could not fulfill the purposes of his creation.18 No other man would do. Neither alone nor withother men could Adam progress. Nor could Evewith another woman. It was so then. It is so today.Eve, an helpmeet, was created. Marriage wasinstituted, 19for Adam was commanded to cleave unto his wife(not just to a woman) and \"to none else.\"20 A choice, it might be said, was imposed upon Eve.21 She should be praised for her decision. Then \"Adamfell that men might be.\" 22 Elder Orson F. Whitney described the Fall as having\"a twofold direction\u2014downward, yet forward. Itbrought man into the world and set his feet uponprogression's highway.\" 23 God blessed Adam and Eve \"and said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply.\" 24And so the family was established. God Values Men and Women Equally There is nothing in the revelations which suggeststhat to be a man rather than to be a woman ispreferred in the sight of God, or that He places a higher value on sons than on daughters. All virtues listed in the scriptures\u2014love, joy, peace, faith, godliness, charity\u2014are shared by both menand women, 25and the highest priesthood ordinance in mortality is given only to man and womantogether. 26 After the Fall, natural law had far-reachingsovereignty over mortal birth. There are whatPresident J. Reuben Clark, Jr., called \"pranks\" ofnature, 27which cause a variety of abnormalities, deficiencies, and deformities. However unfair theyseem to man's way of reasoning, they somehow suitthe purposes of the Lord in the proving of mankind. The following of every worthy instinct, the responding to every righteous urge, the consum-mating of every exalting human relationship areprovided for and approved in the doctrines of thegospel of Jesus Christ and are protected bycommandments revealed to His church. The Roles of Men and Women Except Adam and Eve by nature be different fromone another, they could not multiply and fill theearth. 28The complementing differences are the very key to the plan of happiness. Some roles are best suited to the masculine nature and others to the feminine nature. Both thescriptures and the patterns of nature place man as the protector, the provider. 29 ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 66ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 67 Those responsibilities of the priesthood which have to do with the administration of the Church ofnecessity function outside the home. By divinedecree, they have been entrusted to men. It hasbeen that way since the beginning, for the Lordrevealed that \"the order of this priesthood wasconfirmed to be handed down from father to son.. . . This order was instituted in the days of Adam.\" 30 A man who holds the priesthood does not have anadvantage over a woman in qualifying for exaltation.The woman, by her very nature, is also co-creatorwith God and the primary nurturer of the children.Virtues and attributes upon which perfection andexaltation depend come naturally to a woman andare refined through marriage and motherhood. The priesthood is conferred only upon worthy men in order to conform to our Father's plan of happiness.With the laws of nature and the revealed word ofGod working in harmony, it simply works best thatway. The priesthood carries with it awesome responsibility. \"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, bylong-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and bylove unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge.\" 31 Should a man \"exercise control or dominion orcompulsion . . . in any degree of unrighteousness,\" 32 he violates \"the oath and covenant which belongethto the priesthood.\" 33Then \"the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved.\"34 Unless he repents, he will lose his blessings. While the different roles of man and woman are set forth in exalted celestial declarations, they are bestdemonstrated in the most practical, ordinary,down-to-earth experiences of family life. Recently I heard a speaker in sacrament meeting complain that he could not understand why hisgrandchildren always spoke of going to Grandma's house, never to Grandpa's house. I solved that greatmystery for him: Grandpas don't bake pies! Natural and Spiritual Laws Are Eternal Natural and spiritual laws which govern life wereinstituted from before the foundation of the world. 35 They are eternal, as are the consequences for eitherobeying or disobeying them. They are not based onsocial or political considerations. They cannot bechanged. No pressure, no protest, no legislation canalter them.Years ago I supervised the Indian seminaries. WhenI visited a school at Albuquerque, the principal toldme of an incident that happened in a first-grade class. During a lesson, a kitten wandered into the room and distracted the youngsters. It was brought to thefront of the room so all could see it. One youngster asked, \"Is it a boy kitty or a girl kitty?\"The teacher, unprepared for that discussion, said, \"It doesn't matter; it's just a kitten.\" But the children persisted, and one little boy said, \"I know how we can tell if it is a boy kitty or a girl kitty.\" The teacher, cornered, said, \"All right, you tell us how we can tell if it is a boy kitty or a girl kitty.\" The boy answered, \"We can vote on it!\"Some things cannot be changed. Doctrine cannot be changed. \"Principles which have been revealed,\" President Wilford Woodruff said, \"for the salvation andexaltation of the children of men . . . are principlesyou cannot annihilate. They are principles that nocombination of men [or women] can destroy. They are principles that can never die. . . . They are beyondthe reach of man to handle or to destroy. . . . It isnot in the power of the whole world put togetherto destroy those principles. . . . Not one jot or tittleof these principles will ever be destroyed.\" 36 During World War II, men were called away to fight.In the emergency, wives and mothers worldwidewere drawn into the workforce as never before. Themost devastating effect of the war was on the family.It lingers to this generation. Multiply and Replenish the Earth In the October 1942 general conference, the FirstPresidency delivered a message to \"the Saints inevery land and clime,\" in which they said, \"By virtueof the authority in us vested as the First Presidencyof the Church, we warn our people.\" And they said: \"Amongst His earliest commands to Adam and Eve, the Lord said: 'Multiply and replenishthe earth.' He has repeated that command in our day.He has again revealed in this, the last dispensation,the principle of the eternity of the marriagecovenant. . . . \"The Lord has told us that it is the duty of every husband and wife to obey the command given toAdam to multiply and replenish the earth, so that thelegions of choice spirits waiting for their tabernacles of flesh may come here and move forward underGod's great design to become perfect souls, forwithout these fleshly tabernacles they cannot progressto their God-planned destiny. Thus, every husbandand wife should become a father and mother in Israel to children born under the holy, eternal covenant. \"By bringing these choice spirits to earth, each father and each mother assume towards the tabernacledspirit and towards the Lord Himself by having takenadvantage of the opportunity He offered, anobligation of the most sacred kind, because the fateof that spirit in the eternities to come, the blessingsor punishments which shall await it in the hereafter,depend, in great part, upon the care, the teachings,the training which the parents shall give to that spirit. \"No parent can escape that obligation and that responsibility, and for the proper meeting thereof,the Lord will hold us to a strict accountability. Noloftier duty than this can be assumed by mortals.\" Motherhood Is a Holy Calling Speaking of mothers, the First Presidency said:\"Motherhood thus becomes a holy calling, a sacred dedication for carrying out the Lord's plans,a consecration of devotion to the uprearing andfostering, the nurturing in body, mind, and spirit,of those who kept their first estate and who cometo this earth for their second estate 'to see if theywill do all things whatsoever the Lord their Godshall command them.' (Abraham 3:25) To leadthem to keep their second estate is the work ofmotherhood, and 'they who keep their secondestate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever.' (op. cit.) [Abraham 3:26] \"This divine service of motherhood can be rendered only by mothers. It may not be passed to others.Nurses cannot do it; public nurseries cannot do it;hired help cannot do it\u2014only mother, aided as muchas may be by the loving hands of father, brothers,and sisters, can give the full needed measure ofwatchful care.\" The First Presidency counseled that \"the mother who entrusts her child to the care of others, thatshe may do non-motherly work, whether for gold,for fame, or for civic service, should remember that'a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.'(Prov. 29:15) In our day the Lord has said that unlessparents teach their children the doctrines of theChurch 'the sin be upon the heads of the parents.'(D&C 68:25) \"Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind. It placesher who honors its holy calling and service next tothe angels.\" 37 That message and warning from the First Presidencyis needed more, not less, today than when it wasgiven. And no voice from any organization of theChurch on any level of administration equals thatof the First Presidency. 38 Any souls who by nature or circumstance are notafforded the blessing of marriage and parenthood,or who innocently must act alone in rearing childrenand working to support them, will not be denied inthe eternities any blessing\u2014provided they keep thecommandments. 39As President Lorenzo Snow promised, \"That is sure and positive.\"40 Parable of the Treasure and Keys I close with a parable. Once a man received as his inheritance two keys. The first key, he was told, would open a vaultwhich he must protect at all cost. The second keywas to a safe within the vault which contained a priceless treasure. He was to open this safe andfreely use the precious things which were storedtherein. He was warned that many would seek torob him of his inheritance. He was promised that ifhe used the treasure worthily, it would be replenishedand never be diminished, not in all eternity. Hewould be tested. If he used it to benefit others, hisown blessings and joy would increase. The man went alone to the vault. His first key opened the door. He tried to unlock the treasurewith the other key, but he could not, for there weretwo locks on the safe. His key alone would notopen it. No matter how he tried, he could not openit. He was puzzled. He had been given the keys. Heknew the treasure was rightfully his. He had obeyedinstructions, but he could not open the safe. In due time there came a woman into the vault. She too held a key. It was noticeably different from thekey he held. Her key fit the other lock. It humbledhim to learn that he could not obtain his rightfulinheritance without her. They made a covenant that together they would open the treasure and, as instructed, he would watch ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 68ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 69 over the vault and protect it; she would watch over the treasure. She was not concerned that, as guardianof the vault, he held two keys, for his full purposewas to see that she was safe as she watched over thatwhich was most precious to them both. Togetherthey opened the safe and partook of their inheritance.They rejoiced, for, as promised, it replenished itself. With great joy they found that they could pass the treasure on to their children; each could receive afull measure, undiminished to the last generation. Perhaps some few of their posterity would not find a companion who possessed the complementary key,or one worthy and willing to keep the covenantsrelating to the treasure. Nevertheless, if they keptthe commandments, they would not be deniedeven the smallest blessing. Because some tempted them to misuse their treasure, they were careful to teach their children about keysand covenants. There came, in due time, among their posterity some few who were deceived or jealous or selfishbecause one was given two keys and another onlyone. \"Why,\" the selfish ones reasoned, \"cannot thetreasure be mine alone to use as I desire?\" Some tried to reshape the key they had been given to resemble the other key. Perhaps, they thought, itwould then fit both locks. And so it was that the safewas closed to them. Their reshaped keys were useless,and their inheritance was lost. Those who received the treasure with gratitude and obeyed the laws concerning it knew joy withoutbounds through time and all eternity. I bear witness of our Father's plan for happiness, and bear testimony in the name of Him who wroughtthe Atonement, that it might be, in the name ofJesus Christ, amen. Notes 1.

NadauldYoung Women General President In Conference Report, Oct. 2000, 14-17; or Ensign, Nov. 2000, 14-16 Faithful Women Have a Glorious Mission It is a remarkable blessing to be a daughter of Godtoday. We have the fulness of the gospel of JesusChrist. We are blessed to have the priesthood restoredto the earth. We are led by a prophet of God whoholds all of the priesthood keys. I love and honorPresident Gordon B. Hinckley and all of our brethrenwho bear the priesthood worthily. I am inspired by the lives of good and faithful women. From the beginning of time the Lord hasplaced significant trust in them. He has sent us toearth for such a time as this to perform a grand andglorious mission. The Doctrine and Covenants teachesthat even before we were born, we were among thosewho \"received their first lessons in the world of spiritsand were prepared to come forth in the due time ofthe Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation ofthe souls of men\" (D&C 138:56). What a wonderfulvision that gives us of our purpose on earth.Where much is given, much is required. OurHeavenly Father asks His daughters to walk in virtue,to live in righteousness so that we can fulfill ourlife's mission and His purposes. He wants us to besuccessful, and He will help us as we seek His help. Women Were Given Special Qualities That women were born into this earth female wasdetermined long before mortal birth, as were thedivine differences of male and female. I love theclarity of the teachings of the First Presidency andthe Quorum of the Twelve in the proclamation onthe family, where they state, \"Gender is an essentialcharacteristic of individual premortal, mortal, andeternal identity and purpose.\" 1From that statement we are taught that every girl was feminine and femalein spirit long before her mortal birth. God sent women to earth with some qualities in extra capacity. In speaking to young women, PresidentFaust observed that femininity \"is the divineadornment of humanity. It finds expression in your. . . capacity to love, your spirituality, delicacy,radiance, sensitivity, creativity, charm, graciousness,gentleness, dignity, and quiet strength. It is manifestdifferently in each girl or woman, but each . . .possesses it. Femininity is part of your inner beauty.\" 2 Care for Outward Appearance Our outward appearance is a reflection of what weare on the inside. Our lives reflect that for which weseek. And if with all our hearts we truly seek to knowthe Savior and to be more like Him, we shall be, forHe is our divine, eternal Brother. But He is more thanthat. He is our precious Savior, our dear Redeemer.We ask with Alma of old, \"Have ye received hisimage in your countenances?\" (Alma 5:14). You can recognize women who are grateful to be a daughter of God by their outward appearance.These women understand their stewardship overtheir bodies and treat them with dignity. They carefor their bodies as they would a holy temple, forthey understand the Lord's teaching, \"Know ye notthat ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\" (1 Cor. 3:16). Women who love God would never abuse or deface a temple with graffiti. Nor would they throw openthe doors of that holy, dedicated edifice and invitethe world to look on. How even more sacred is thebody, for it was not made by man. It was formed ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN 70ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL71 by God. We are the stewards, the keepers of the cleanliness and purity with which it came fromheaven. \"If any man defile the temple of God, himshall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,which temple ye are\" (1 Cor. 3:17). Grateful daughters of God guard their bodies carefully, for they know they are the wellspring of life and they reverence life. They don't uncovertheir bodies to find favor with the world. They walkin modesty to be in favor with their Father inHeaven, for they know He loves them dearly. Minister to Others You can recognize women who are grateful to be adaughter of God by their attitude. They know thatthe errand of angels is given to women, and theydesire to be on God's errand to love His childrenand minister to them, to teach them the doctrinesof salvation, to call them to repentance, to savethem in perilous circumstances, to guide them inthe performance of His work, to deliver His messages. 3 They understand that they can bless their Father'schildren in their homes and neighborhoods andbeyond. Women who are grateful to be daughters of God bring glory to His name. Magnify Gifts You can recognize women who are grateful to be adaughter of God by their abilities. They fulfill theirdivine potential and magnify their God-given gifts.They are capable, strong women who bless families,serve others, and understand that \"the glory of Godis intelligence\" (D&C 93:36). They are women whoembrace enduring virtues in order to be all that ourFather needs them to be. The prophet Jacob spokeof some of those virtues when he said their \"feelingsare exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate beforeGod, which thing is pleasing unto God\" (Jacob 2:7). Reverence Motherhood You can recognize women who are grateful to be daughters of God by their r everence for motherhood, even when that blessing has been withheld fromthem for a time. In those circumstances, their righteous influence can be a blessingin the lives of children they love. Theirexemplary teachings can echo thevoice of a faithful home and resonatetruth in the hearts of children whoneed another witness.Grateful daughters of God love Him and teach theirchildren to love Him without reservation and withoutresentment. They are like the mothers of Helaman'syouthful army, who had such great faith and \"hadbeen taught by their mothers, that if they did notdoubt, God would deliver them\" (Alma 56:47). When you observe kind and gentle mothers in action, you see women of great strength. Their families canfeel a spirit of love and respect and safety when theyare near her as she seeks the companionship of theHoly Ghost and the guidance of His Spirit. They areblessed by her wisdom and good judgment. Thehusbands and children whose lives they bless willcontribute to the stability of societies all over thisworld. Grateful daughters of God learn truths fromtheir mothers and grandmothers and aunts. Theyteach their daughters the joyful art of creating ahome. They seek fine educations for their childrenand have a thirst for knowledge themselves. Theyhelp their children develop skills that they can use inserving others. They know that the way they havechosen is not the easy way, but they know it isabsolutely worth their finest efforts. They understand what Elder Neal A. Maxwell meant when he said: \"When the real history of mankind isfully disclosed, will it feature the echoes of gunfire orthe shaping sound of lullabies? The great armisticesmade by military men or the peacemaking of womenin homes and in neighborhoods? Will whathappened in cradles and kitchens prove to be morecontrolling than what happened in congresses?\" 4 Daughters of God know that it is the nurturingnature of women that can bring everlasting blessings,and they live to cultivate this divine attribute. Surelywhen a woman reverences motherhood, her childrenwill arise up and call her blessed (see Prov. 31:28). Not like Women of the World Women of God can never be like women of theworld. The world has enough women who are tough;we need women who are tender. There are enoughwomen who are coarse; we need women who arekind. There are enough women who are rude; weneed women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we needmore women of faith. We have enoughgreed; we need more goodness. We have enough vanity; we need more virtue.We have enough popularity; we needmore purity. Women of God can never be like women of the world.DIFFERENCES INHERENT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMENOh, how we pray that every young woman will grow up to be all the wonderful things she is meant tobe. We pray that her mother and father will showher the right way. May daughters of God honor thepriesthood and sustain worthy priesthood holders.May they understand their own great capacity forstrength in the timeless virtues that some wouldscoff at in a modern, liberated world for women. Understand and Nourish Potential May mothers and fathers understand the greatpotential for good their daughters inherited fromtheir heavenly home. We must nourish theirgentleness, their nurturing nature, their innatespirituality and sensitivity, and their bright minds.Celebrate the fact that girls are different from boys.Be thankful for the position they have in God'sgrand plan. And always remember what PresidentHinckley said, \"Only after the earth had beenformed, after the day had been separated from thenight, after the waters had been divided from theland, after vegetation and animal life had beencreated, and after man had been placed on the earth,was woman created; and only then was the workpronounced complete and good.\" 5Fathers, husbands, young men, may you catch a vision of all that women are and can be. Please beworthy of God's holy priesthood, which you bear,and honor that priesthood, for it blesses all of us. Sisters, regardless of your age, please understand all that you are and must be, all that you were preparedto be in royal courts on high by God Himself. Maywe use with gratitude the priceless gifts we havebeen given for the lifting of mankind to higherthinking and nobler aspirations, I pray in the nameof Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1.

Hinckley \"Nurture and cultivate your marriage. Guard it and work to keep it solid and beautiful. Divorce isbecoming so common, even rampant, that studiesshow in a few years half of those now married willbe divorced. It is happening, I regret to say, evenamong some who are sealed in the house of the Lord.Marriage is a contract, it is a compact, it is a unionbetween a man and a woman under the plan of theAlmighty. It can be fragile. It requires nurture andvery much effort. I regret to acknowledge that somehusbands are abusive, some are unkind, some are thoughtless, some are evil. They indulge inpornography and bring about situations whichdestroy them, destroy their families, and destroythe most sacred of all relationships. \"I pity the man who at one time looked into the eyes of a beautiful young woman and held herhand across the altar in the house of the Lord asthey made sacred and everlasting promises one toanother, but who, lacking in self-discipline, fails tocultivate his better nature, sinks to coarseness andevil, and destroys the relationship which the Lordhas provided for him\" (\"Walking in the Light of theLord,\" Ensign, Nov. 1998, 99). \"I am concerned about family life in the Church.We have wonderful people, but we have too manywhose families are falling apart. It is a matter ofserious concern. I think it is my most seriousconcern\" (\"Pres. Hinckley Notes His 85th Birthday,Reminisces about Life,\" Church News, 24 June 1995, 6). Growing Plague of Divorce Is Not of God President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Too many who come to marriage have been coddled and spoiled and somehow led to feel that everythingmust be precisely right at all times, that life is a seriesof entertainments, that appetites are to be satisfiedwithout regard to principle. How tragic theconsequences of such hollow and unreasonablethinking! . . . \"There may be now and again a legitimate cause for divorce. I am not one to say that it is never justified.But I say without hesitation that this plague amongus, which seems to be growing everywhere, is not ofGod, but rather is the work of the adversary ofrighteousness and peace and truth\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1991, 96-98; or Ensign, May 1991, 73-74). President James E. Faust \"What, then, might be 'just cause' for breaking the covenants of marriage? Over a lifetime of dealingwith human problems, I have struggled to understandwhat might be considered 'just cause' for breakingof covenants. I confess I do not claim the wisdomNurture and cultivate your marriage. Guard it and work to keep it solid and beautiful. \u2014President Gordon B. Hinckleyor authority to definitively state what is 'just cause.' Only the parties to the marriage can determine this.They must bear the responsibility for the train ofconsequences which inevitably follows if thesecovenants are not honored. In my opinion, 'justcause' should be nothing less serious than a prolongedand apparently irredeemable relationship which isdestructive of a person's dignity as a human being. \"At the same time, I have strong feelings about what is not provocation for breaking the sacred covenantsof marriage. Surely it is not simply 'mental distress'or 'personality or having 'grown love.' This is especially sowhere there are children\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1993, 46; or Ensign, May 1993, 36-37). MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE Elder David B. Haight Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1984, 14-17; or Ensign, May 1984, 12-14 I pray for the companionship of the Holy Spirit,that my remarks will be in harmony with revealedtruth and will be received and understood by thatsame heavenly influence. Assault on Traditional Family For more than twenty-five years we have witnessed an unending assault on the traditional family. Sacredvalues of human goodness, discipline, and love andhonor for God our Eternal Father have beenchallenged. A new self-centered generation has made the family a prime target of continuing belittlement. Marriageis downgraded or shunned, parenthood degraded andavoided. These, with other disturbing influences,have resulted in a torrent of evil temptations for so-called instant gratification and the demeaning ofmarriage and the sacred roles of wife and mother. Divine Intent for Marriage Unfortunately, there are many good human beingswho would live differently, but they do not know ofGod's eternal plan for His children. We learn fromthe scriptures that the divine intent is that marriageis to be an eternal union with enduring familyrelationships throughout eternity. Scripture reveals that, after the earth was developed, God created man in His own image and gave himdominion over the earth. By the side of man stoodthe woman, sharing with him the divinely bestowedhonor and dignity of supremacy over all othercreations. God said, \"It is not good that the manshould be alone; I will make him an help meet forhim\" (Genesis 2:18). \"In the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\" (Genesis 1:27). The Lord also instructed, \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleaveunto his wife: and they shall be one flesh\" (Genesis2:24), thereby giving sanction to the union of male and female in authorized marriage, which isheaven-planned for the creation of mortal bodies. The Lord's Program for the Family The earliest recorded commandment to Adam andEve was to \"be fruitful, and multiply, and replenishthe earth\" (Genesis 1:28). We regard children as gifts from God, committed to our care for loving, nurturing, and careful training. The Lord also instructed, \"And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly beforethe Lord\" (D&C 68:28). They are not to be mistreated or abused, for, with their parents, they are part of a family with thepotential of eternal relationship. President Spencer W. Kimball explained:\"The Lord organized the whole program in the beginning with a father who procreates, provides,and loves and directs, and a mother who conceivesand bears and nurtures and feeds and trains. TheLord could have organized it otherwise but chose to have a unit with responsibility and purposefulassociations where children train and disciplineeach other and come to love, honor, and appreciateeach other. The family is the great plan of life asconceived and organized by our Father in Heaven\"(Ensign, July 1973, p. 15). Marriage was meant to be and can be a loving,binding, and harmonious relationship between a husband and wife. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALDIVORCE 74ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL75 DIVORCE Divorce Always Tragic and Painful As we contemplate our Lord's declaration to Moses, \"This is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to passthe immortality and eternal life of man\" (Moses1:39), we reflect with sadness upon the presentserious trend of families and homesbeing torn apart through divorce. It would seem that a major underlying cause of divorce is in notunderstanding that marriage andfamilies are God-given and God-ordained. If we understood the fullmeaning we would have less divorce andits attendant unhappiness. Coupleswould plan for a happy marriagerelationship based on divine instruction.If couples understood from thebeginning of their romance that their marriagerelationship could be blessed with promises and conditions extending into the eternities, divorce would not even be a considered alternative whendifficulties arise. The current philosophy\u2014get adivorce if it doesn't work out\u2014handicaps a marriagefrom the beginning. The ever-increasing rise in divorce is ample evidence of how acceptable divorce has become as the popularsolution to unhappy or \"not-quite-up-to-expectation\"marriages. But no matter how acceptable divorce has become\u2014how quick and easy to obtain\u2014divorce istragic and painful, not only at the outset, but alsoin the years to come. Divorce can never really be final. How can mothers and fathers really divorce themselves from their ownflesh and blood children, or from the memories ofdays and years of shared experiences which havebecome part of their very lives. Divorce rarely occurs without immense emotional, social, and financial upheaval. Most peopleunderestimate the alienation, bitterness, disruption,and frustration between a divorcing couple, andamong their children, friends, and relatives. Somenever adjust to the resulting emotional consequences. Perhaps most tragic of all is that more than 60 percent of all divorces involve children undereighteen years of age. Children of divorce all toooften have a higher delinquency rate and less self-confidence, and tend to be more promiscuous andthemselves more likely to have unhappy marriages.Prepare for Success Considering the enormous importance of marriage, it is rather astonishing that we don't make betterpreparation for success. Usually, young couples datefor a few months or for a year or two, enjoying romance and getting acquainted, andthen get mar ried. Once married, they soon learn that romance must blendwith spiritual beliefs, in-lawrelationships, money issues, and serious discussions involving ethics,children, and the running of a home. Too many people are inadequately prepared for this lofty responsibility. \"People go to college for years to prepare for a vocation or profession . . . \"Conference on Utah Families,\"Salt Lake Tribune, 6 Apr. 1980, p. F-9.) Seek Good Counsel Serious transgressions, as well as injured lives thatsometimes are revealed in bishops' offices, all toofrequently make it clear that husband and wiferelationships deserve a great deal more prayerfulattention than many are giving it. Fewer marriageswould get in trouble, and more would be happier, ifcouples visited a warm-hearted bishop who mightsuggest ways of avoiding pitfalls, and encouragehusbands and wives to thoughtfully use self-discipline and needed restraint and develop theloving attribute of unselfishness. A few years ago, President Harold B. Lee received this letter from a married woman: \"When wethought that the end was here and that there wasonly one thing to do and that was to get a divorce,we had been told that we should counsel with ourbishop. At first . . . we hesitated, because he wasjust a young man. . . . But he was our bishop so wewent to see him. We poured out our souls to ouryoung bishop. He sat and listened silently, andwhen we ran out of conversation he said, simply,'Well, my wife and I, we had problems, too, and welearned how to solve them.' That is all . . . he said.But you know there was something that happenedas a result of that young bishop's statement. Wewalked out of there and we said, 'Well, if they cansolve their problems, what is the matter with us?'\"(Ensign, Jan. 1974, p. 100).A major underlying cause of divorce is in not understanding that marriage and families are God-given and God-ordained.Protect and Nurture Marriage A prominent producer recently stated: \"In movies and on television there is . . reluctance to deal with marriage, . . . [except as] a comic turnor in We prefer to stress Wife of Your Youth [Palos Heights, Illinois: Np, 1977], np). Our concern is not just that media producers and writers don't portray happy, fruitful marriage, butthat many married couples don't take their marriagesseriously enough\u2014to work at them, protect them,nurture them, cultivate them day in and day out,week in and week out, yearlong, quarter-centurylong, half-a-century long, forever. Middle-age divorce is particularly distressing, as it indicates that mature people, who are the backboneof our society, are not working carefully enough topreserve their marriages. Divorces granted to peopleover forty-five have increased at an alarming rate.When middle-aged people even consider breakingup their marriage\u2014a couple who may have rearedtheir children, who possibly have grandchildren\u2014and now decide to go their separate ways, theyneed to realize that every divorce is the result ofselfishness on the part of one or both. In Malachi we read:\"The Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealttreacherously: yet is she thy companion, and thewife of thy covenant. . . . \"Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth\"(Malachi 2:14-15). The Ideal Marriage Marriage is a covenant. Two of the TenCommandments deal directly with preserving the sanctity of marriage: \"Thou not 20:14, 17). Jesus magnified the law against adultery: \"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman tolust after her hath committed adultery with heralready in his heart\" (Matthew 5:28).The ideal marriage is the faithfulness of a man anda woman to each other, a faithfulness that beganwhen each had chosen the other. In Proverbs weread, \"Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice withthe wife of thy youth\" (Proverbs 5:18). Let heraffection fill you at all times with delight, and beinfatuated always with her love. (See Proverbs 5:19.) It is a privilege indeed to live our life with the wife of our youth, to enjoy the golden years together\u2014neither objecting to the wrinkles nor the grayhair\u2014but to continue acquiring a depth of love,oneness, and wisdom which can be shared witheach other now and throughout all eternity. Marriage is sustained by faith and knowledge of its divine establishment, and is sustained daily by theenergy of love. A wise man explained, \"When thesatisfaction or the security of another person becomesas significant to one as one's own satisfaction andsecurity then the state of love exists\" (Harry StackSullivan, Concepts of Modern Psychiatry, 2nd ed. [New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1961], p. 42). Ask God for Help A strong, shared conviction that there is somethingeternally precious about a marriage relationshipbuilds faith to resist evil. Marriage should bebeautiful and fulfilling, with joy beyond ourfondest dreams, for \"neither is the man without thewoman, neither the woman without the man, inthe Lord\" (1 Corinthians 11:11). Latter-day Saints need not divorce\u2014there are solutions to marriage problems. If, as husband andwife, you are having serious misunderstandings or ifyou feel some strain or tension building up in your marriage, you should humbly get on your kneestogether and ask God our Father, with a sincere heartand real intent, to lift the darkness that is over yourrelationship, that you may receive the needed light,see your errors, repent of your wrongs, forgive eachother, and receive each unto yourselves as you didin the beginning. I solemnly assure you that Godlives and will answer your humble pleas, for he hassaid, \"Ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the nameof Jesus and it shall be done\" (D&C 50:29).

A LL HUMAN BEINGS \u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each hasa divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essentialcharacteristic of individual premortal, mortal, andeternal identity and purpose. I N THE PREMORTAL REALM , spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children couldobtain a physical body and gainearthly experience to progress towardperfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternallife. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to beperpetuated beyond the grave. Sacredordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible forindividuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally. T HE FIRST COMMANDMENT that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God'scommandment for His children to multiply andreplenish the earth remains in force. We furtherdeclare that God has commanded that the sacredpowers of procreation are to be employed onlybetween man and woman, lawfully wedded ashusband and wife. W E DECLARE the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan. HUSBAND AND WIFE have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. \"Children are an heritage of the Lord\" (Psalms 127:3).Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children inlove and righteousness, to provide for their physicaland spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serveone another, to observe the commandments of Godand to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.Husbands and wives\u2014mothers and fathers\u2014will beheld accountable before God for the discharge ofthese obligations. T HE FAMILY is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony,and to be reared by a father and a mother who honormarital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness infamily life is most likely to be achieved when foundedupon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.Successful marriages and families are establishedand maintained on principles of faith, prayer,repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion,work, and wholesome recreational activities. Bydivine design, fathers are to preside over their familiesin love and righteousness and are responsible toprovide the necessities of life and protection fortheir families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothersare obligated to help one another asequal partners. Disability, death, orother circumstances may necessitateindividual adaptation. Extendedfamilies should lend support whenneeded.Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. \u2014First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL83 The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave.WE WARN that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day standaccountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring uponindividuals, communities, and nations the calamitiesforetold by ancient and modern prophets. W E CALL upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family asthe fundamental unit of society. SELECTED TEACHINGS President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I salute fathers and mothers who are loyal to one another and who nurture their children in faith andlove. There has been a wonderful response to theproclamation on the family, which we issued lastOctober. . . . We hope you will read it and reread it\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1996, 90; or Ensign,May 1996, 66). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"The recent proclamation to the world on the family, issued by the First Presidency and the Quorum ofthe Twelve Apostles, makes very clear that the familyis ordained of God. The proclamation warns that the disintegration of the family will bring uponindividuals, communities, and nations the calamitiesforetold by ancient and modern prophets\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1996, 112; or Ensign, May 1996, 81). Elder Richard G. Scott \"Learn the doctrinal foundation of the great plan of happiness by studying the scriptures, pondering theircontent, and praying to understand them. Carefullystudy and use the proclamation of the FirstPresidency and the Twelve on the family. . . . It wasinspired of the Lord\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1996, 103; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 75). Elder Merrill J. Bateman \"The proclamation teaches that 'successful marriages and families are established and maintained onprinciples of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness,respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesomerecreational activities.' In other words, the Lordmeasures the success of a family by the quality ofits relationships. In a home where faith, love, andforgiveness are dominant, members find joy andsatisfaction in being together. Ideally the fatherpresides in love and righteousness, provides thenecessities of life, and protects the family while themother is primarily responsible for the nurturing ofthe children. In contrast, the world often measuresfamily success by the accumulation of worldly thingsand the size of the estate that is passed on to thechildren\" (\"The Eternal Family,\" 115). Principle of Faith Matthew 9:29 \"Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.\" 2 Corinthians 5:7 \"For we walk by faith, not by sight.\" Philippians 4:13 \"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.\" 1 Nephi 3:7 \"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth nocommandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they mayaccomplish the thing which he commandeth them.\" Doctrine and Covenants 76:53 \"And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forthupon all those who are just and true.\" President Joseph Fielding Smith \"When a man and a woman, in all sincerity, enter into a covenant of marriage for time and all eternity(and after they have 'overcome by faith,' and are'just and [D&C 76:53]), the Ghost\u2014whois the Spirit of promise\u2014bears record of or ratifiesthat sealing. In other words, he seals the promisesappertaining to the marriage covenant upon them\"(Doctrines of Salvation, 2:98). President Harold B. Lee \"Faith, not doubt, is the beginning of all learning, whether in science or religion. . . . It is faith thatseeks for spiritual knowledge and power by studying ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 84out in your own mind the matter in question, by applying all possible human wisdom to the solutionof your problem and then asking God if yourconclusion is right. If it is right, your bosom shallburn within you and you shall 'feel' that it is right,but if your conclusion is not right, you shall have astupor of thought that shall cause youto forget the thing that is wrong. (Doc.and Cov. 9:8-9.)\" (Decisions forSuccessful Living, 194). President Spencer W. Kimball \"The love of which the Lord speaks is not only physical attraction, but alsofaith, confidence, understanding, andpartnership. It is devotion and companionship,parenthood, common ideals and standards. It iscleanliness of life and sacrifice and unselfishness\"(Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 248). \"Mary and John, I congratulate you for your visionand faith and your willingness to forgo the fanfareand glamour of a worldly wedding for a simple, quiet,but beautiful marriage in the temple, a sweet eternalceremony that will be unostentatious and sacredlike your birth, blessing, baptism, or ordination\"(Faith Precedes the Miracle, 127). Elder LeGrand Richards \"Anderson M. Baten dedicated a poem to his beloved wife, Beulah, entitled, The Philosophy of Life, which expresses his faith that his marriage tiewould extend beyond the grave: \"I wed thee forever, not for now; Nor for the sham of earth's brief years.I wed thee for the life beyond the tears,Beyond the heart pain and the clouded brow.Love knows no grave, and it will guide us, dear,When life's spent candles flutter and burn low.\"(Marvelous Work and a Wonder, 203). Elder Bruce R. McConkie Commenting on 2 Corinthians 1:24. \"After the grace of God as manifest through the sacrifice of his Son, after baptism, after temple marriage, after the Lordoffers any blessing to men\u2014still the promisedrewards come by individual faith, by personalrighteousness, by one man standing alone beforehis Maker and doing those things which enablehim to work out his salvation\" ( Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 2:410).Elder David B. Haight \"Marriage is sustained by faith and knowledge of its divine establishment, and is sustained daily by theenergy of love. . . . \"A strong, shared conviction that there is something eternally precious about a marriage relationship builds faith to resist evil. Marriageshould be beautiful and fulfilling, withjoy beyond our fondest dreams, for 'neither is the man without thewoman, neither the woman withoutthe man, in the Lord' (1 Corinthians11:11)\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1984, 16-17; or Ensign, May 1984, 14). Principle of Prayer President Spencer W. Kimball \"When a husband and wife go together frequently to the holy temple, kneel in prayer together in theirhome with their family, . . . then happiness is at itspinnacle\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 309). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Prayer in the home and prayer with each other will strengthen your union. Gradually thoughts,aspirations, and ideas will merge into a onenessuntil you are seeking the same purposes and goals. \"Rely on the Lord, the teachings of the prophets, and the scriptures for guidance and help, particularlywhen there may be disagreements and problems\"(\"Salvation\u2014A Family Affair,\" Ensign, July 1992, 2, 4; or Conference Report, Oct. 1982, 85-86;Ensign, Nov. 1982, 60). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I know of no other practice that will have so salutary an effect upon your lives as will the practiceof kneeling together in prayer. The very words, Our Father in Heaven, have a tremendous effect.You cannot speak them with sincerity and withrecognition without having some feeling ofaccountability to God. The little storms that seem to afflict every marriage become of smallconsequence while kneeling before the Lord andaddressing him as a suppliant son and daughter. \"Your daily conversations with him will bring peace into your hearts and a joy into your lives that cancome from no other source. Your companionship will ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 85 Marriage should be beautiful and fulfilling, with joy beyond our fondest dreams.sweeten through the years. Your love will strengthen. Your appreciation one for another will grow. \"Your children will be blessed with a sense of security that comes of living in a home where dwells theSpirit of God. They will know and love parents whorespect one another, and a spirit of respect willgrow in their own hearts. They will experience thesecurity of kind words quietly spoken. They will besheltered by a father and mother who, living honestlywith God, live honestly with one another and withtheir fellowmen. They will mature with a sense ofappreciation, having heard their parents in prayerexpress gratitude for blessings great and small. Theywill grow with faith in the living God\" (Teachings ofGordon B. Hinckley, 216). \"Your companionship will be one that will sweetenand strengthen through the years and that willendure through eternity. Your love and appreciationfor one another will increase\" ( Cornerstones of a Happy Home, 11). Elder Joe J. Christensen \"Many Church leaders as well as professional counselors have indicated that they have never seena marriage in serious difficulty in which the couplewas still praying together daily. When you invite theLord to be a partner in your union, there is a softeningof feelings, a moderation of tension that occursthrough the power of the Spirit. See what happenswhen, as you kneel together, you hear yourcompanion express gratitude and love for you. Pray that you, working together, may overcomewhatever difficulties you may have so that yourlove can increase. . . . \"Sometimes, when Barbara has not been feeling well or has been discouraged for whatever reason, it hasseemed to me to be helpful and meaningful duringour joint companion prayer to shift into the firstperson and genuinely express my feelings, 'Father, Iam so grateful to have a companion such as Barbara.Help her to know how much I love and appreciateher as one of Thy chosen daughters. Assist her to behealed completely and given the health and strengthshe needs to continue on with her life's importantmission as wife and mother.' . . . \"I would invite you to candidly analyze your situation. Are you and your companion prayingtogether daily that your marriage may bestrengthened? If not, now is an excellent time tostart!\" (One Step at a Time, 15-16).Principle of Repentance President Spencer W. Kimball \"One day in the temple in Salt Lake City, as I walked down the long hall preparing to go into oneof the rooms to perform a marriage for a youngcouple, a woman followed me . . . and with greatagitation she said, 'Elder Kimball, do you rememberme?' Her eyes were searching and her ears wereseeking to hear if I remembered her. I was abashed.For the life of me I could not make the connection.I was much embarrassed. I finally said, 'I am sorry,but I cannot remember you.' Instead ofdisappointment, there was great joy that came toher face. She was relieved. She said, 'Oh, I am so grateful you can't remember me. With my husbandI spent all night with you one time, while you weretrying to change our lives. We had committed sin,and we were struggling to get rid of it. You laboredall night to help me to clear it. We have repented,and we have changed our lives totally. I am gladyou don't remember me, because if you, one of the apostles, cannot remember me, maybe the Savior cannot remember my sins'\" (Teachings of Spencer W.Kimball, 108). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"There is a remedy for all of this. It is not found in divorce. It is found in the gospel of the Son of God.He it was who said, 'What therefore God hathjoined together, let not man put asunder' (Matthew19:6). The remedy for most marriage stress is not indivorce. It is in repentance. It is not in separation. Itis in simple integrity that leads a man to square uphis shoulders and meet his obligations. It is foundin the Golden Rule\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1991, 97; or Ensign, May 1991, 73-74). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"It is well to remember that, awful, horrible and serious as adultery and other sexual sins are, theLord has kindly provided forgiveness on conditionof repentance commensurate with the sin. Butwhere these sins are concerned, even more thanwith less grievous ones, prevention is so muchbetter than cure\" (Miracle of Forgiveness, 74). \"Another young couple showed a similar unawarenessof the gravity of sin, and especially of sexual sin.They came to me in June, having become formallyengaged with a ring the previous December, and in ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 86the six months' interval their sexual sin had been repeated frequently. In June they went to theirrespective bishops seeking recommends to the temple.The girl's bishop, knowing that she had always been active, did not searchingly question her as tocleanliness, and a recommend was soon tucked awayin her purse for use in the planned June marriage.The bishop of the other ward questioned the youngman carefully and learned of the six months oftransgression. \"In my office the couple frankly admitted their sin and shocked me when they said: 'That isn't so verywrong, is it, when we were formally engaged andexpected to marry soon?' They had no comprehensionof the magnitude of the sin. They were ready to gointo the holy temple for their marriage without athought that they were defiling the Lord's house.How lacking was their training! How insincere wastheir approach! They were very disturbed whentheir marriage had to be postponed to allow timefor repentance. They had rationalized the sin nearlyout of existence. They pressed for a date, the firstpossible one they could set up and on which theycould plan their temple marriage. They did notunderstand that forgiveness is not a thing of daysor months or even years but is a matter of intensityof feeling and transformation of self. Again, thisshowed a distortion of attitude, a lack of convictionof the seriousness of their deep transgression. Theyhad not confessed their serious sin. They had butadmitted it when it had been dug out. There is a wide difference between the two situations. \"This couple seemed to have no conception of satisfying the Lord, of paying the total penalties andobtaining a release and adjustment which could beconsidered final and which might be accepted ofthe Lord. I asked them the question: 'As you weighthis transgression, do you feel that you should beexcommunicated from the Church?' They weresurprised at such a question. They had thought of their heinous sin as nothing more than anindiscretion. They had been born and reared in theChurch and had received the gift ofthe Holy Ghost at eight years of age.But in the successive nights of theirperfidy they had driven the Holy Spiritaway. They had made him unwelcome.They were not listening to hispromptings. It is inconceivable thatthey did not know how wrong theirsin was but they had convincedthemselves against the truth. They had seared theirconsciences as with a hot iron\" (Miracle ofForgiveness, 155-56). \"In my office one day sat a sober couple who had alarge family of little children. Early in their marriedlife they had both committed adultery, and for manyyears had been suffering untold agonies of remorse.They had forgiven each other but were stillsuffering tortures. \"The couple came to get some questions answered. They could stand it no longer. The husband brokethe silence. 'I told my wife that because of ouradultery years ago we could never hope for salvationin the celestial kingdom, much less exaltation and eternal life, but that we could receive greatsatisfactions as we bore children and reared them to be so righteous that we could be sure they wouldall receive all the blessings of the gospel and theChurch and eventually reach their exaltation.' \"When I quoted a long list of scriptures showing that forgiveness was possible eventually, when theheavy price had been paid, I could see hope stirwithin them and a peace settle over them. They left my office radiant with a new-found ecstasy\"(Miracle of Forgiveness, 343). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The single purpose of Lucifer is to oppose the great plan of happiness, to corrupt the purest, mostbeautiful and appealing experiences of life: romance,love, marriage, [see 2 follow about. Onlyrepentance can heal he hurts\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1993, 27-28; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 21). \"In the battle of life, the adversary takes enormousnumbers of prisoners, and many who know of noway to escape and are pressed into his service. Everysoul confined to a concentration camp of sin andguilt has a key to the gate. The adversary cannothold them if they know how to use it. The key is labeled Repentance . The twin principles of repentance and forgiveness exceed in strength the awesome power of theadversary. \"I know of no sins connected with the moral standard for which we cannot be forgiven. I do not exempt abortion.The formula is stated in forty words: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 87 The twin principles of repentance and forgiveness exceed in strength the awesome power of the adversary.\"'Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more. \"'By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins\u2014behold, he will confess them and forsakethem' (D&C 58:42-43). \"However long and painful the process of repentance, the Lord has said: \"'This is the covenant . . I will make with them. . . . I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; \"'And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more' (Hebrews 10:16-17; italics added)\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1992, 95; or Ensign, May 1992, 68). Principle of Forgiveness in Marriage President Spencer W. Kimball \"If the faults of two people are more nearly equal, if both of them have a beam-impaired vision, that stillgives no justification for a selfish, unforgivingattitude. With this in mind, I once wrote to a womanwith whom I had had previous occasion to discussat length her family problems. I had given counselin my desire to prevent further misunderstandingsand avoid a separation or divorce. After some weeks,she wrote that she would accept my decision. I responded in part as follows: \"'It is not my decision\u2014it is up to you to make the decisions. You have your free agency. If you are determined to get a divorce it is your responsibilityand your suffering if you are not willing to makeadjustments. When I talked with you, I understoodthat you had forgiven each other and would startfrom there to build a beautiful life. Apparently, Iwas mistaken. All my warnings and pleadings seemto have fallen on deaf ears. I want you to know thatI do not justify in your husband anything that waswrong, but I recognized all the way through thathis was not the whole fault. I have never been ableto feel that you had wholly purged the selfishnessfrom your own soul. I do know that two people asseemingly intelligent and apparently mature as youtwo, could have a gloriously happy life, if both ofyou would begin to let your concerns run in favorof the other, instead of in favor of your selfish selves. \"'The escapist never escapes. If two people, selfish and self-centered, and without the spirit offorgiveness, escape from each other, they cannotescape from themselves. The disease is not cured by the separation or the divorce, and it will mostassuredly follow along in the wake of futuremarriages'\" ( Miracle of Forgiveness, 270-71). President Howard W. Hunter \"First, I invite all members of the Church to live with ever more attention to the life and example ofthe Lord Jesus Christ, especially the love and hopeand compassion he displayed. I pray that we willtreat each other with more kindness, more patience,more courtesy and forgiveness\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 7; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 8). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"There must be recognition on the part of both husband and wife of the solemnity and sanctity ofmarriage and of the God-given design behind it. \"There must be a willingness to overlook small faults, to forgive, and then to forget\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1991, 97; or Ensign, May 1991, 74). \"Eternal vigilance is the price of eternal development.Occasionally we may stumble. I thank the Lord forthe great principle of repentance and forgiveness.When we drop the ball, when we make a mistake,there is held out to us the word of the Lord that hewill forgive our sins and remember them no moreagainst us. But somehow we are prone to rememberthem against ourselves\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1994, 64-65; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 48). President Thomas S. Monson \"Recently I read where an elderly man disclosed at the funeral of his brother, with whom he had shared,from early manhood, a small one-room cabin nearCanisteo, New York, that following a quarrel theyhad divided the room in half with a chalk line andneither had crossed the line nor spoken a word tothe other since that day\u2014sixty-two years before!What a human tragedy\u2014all for the want of mercyand forgiveness\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1995, 77; or Ensign, May 1995, 59). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"If we will sue for peace, taking the initiative in settling differences\u2014if we can forgive and forgetwith all our hearts\u2014if we can cleanse our own soulsof sin, accusations, bitterness, and guilt before we casta stone at others\u2014if we forgive all real or fanciedoffenses before we ask forgiveness for our own sins\u2014if ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 88we pay our own debts, large or small, before we press our debtors\u2014if we manage to clear our own eyes ofthe blinding beams before we magnify the motes inthe eyes of others\u2014what a glorious world this wouldbe! Divorce would be reduced to a minimum; courtswould be freed from disgusting routines; family lifewould be heavenly\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1949, 133). Elder James E. Faust \"What is the central characteristic of those having only five loaves and two fishes? What makes itpossible, under the Master's touch, for them toserve, lift, and bless so that they touch for good thelives of hundreds, even thousands? After a lifetime ofdealing in the affairs of men and women, I believeit is the ability to overcome personal ego andpride\u2014both are enemies to the full enjoyment of theSpirit of God and to walking humbly before him.The ego interferes with husbands and wives askingeach other for forgiveness. It prevents the enjoymentof the full sweetness of a higher love. The ego often prevents parents and children from fullyunderstanding each other. The ego enlarges ourfeelings of self-importance and worth. It blinds usto reality. Pride keeps us from confessing our sinsand shortcomings to the Lord and working out ourrepentance\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1994, 4-5;or Ensign, May 1994, 6). Elder Robert D. Hales \"I must ask for forgiveness from Heavenly Father for those things which I have done which are lessthan perfect and ask forgiveness of anyone I mighthave offended knowingly or unknowingly becauseof my personality or style\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1994, 105; or Ensign, May 1994, 78). Elder Robert L. Simpson \"Every couple, whether in the first or the twenty- first year of marriage, should discover the value ofpillow-talk time at the end of the day\u2014the perfecttime to take inventory, to talk about tomorrow. Andbest of all, it's a time when love and appreciationfor one another can be reconfirmed. The end ofanother day is also the perfect setting to say,'Sweetheart, I am sorry about what happened today.Please forgive me'\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1982, 30; or Ensign, May 1982, 21).FORGIVENESS: THE ULTIMATE FORM OF LOVE Elder Marion D. Hanks Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1973, 14-15, 17; or Ensign, Jan. 1974, 20, 22 Lesson of Forgiveness Today I would like to speak of one lesson amongmany that he [the Lord] taught us and that you andI must learn if we are to merit his friendship. Christ's love was so pure that he gave his life for us: \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man laydown his life for his friends.\" (John 15:13.) But there was another gift he bestowed while he was onthe cross, a gift that further measured the magnitudeof his great love: he forgave, and asked his Father toforgive, those who persecuted and crucified him. Was this act of forgiveness less difficult than sacrificing his mortal life? Was it less a test of hislove? I do not know the answer. But I have felt thatthe ultimate form of love for God and men isforgiveness. He met the test. What of us? Perhaps we shall not be called upon to give our lives for our friends orour faith (though perhaps some shall), but it iscertain that every one of us has and will haveoccasion to confront the other challenge. What will we do with it? What arewe doing with it? Someone has written: \". . . the withholding of loveis the negation of the spirit of Christ, the proof thatwe never knew him, that for us he lived in vain. Itmeans that he suggested nothing in all our thoughts,that he inspired nothing in all our lives, that wewere not once near enough to him to be seizedwith the spell of his compassion for the world.\" Christ's example and instructions to his friends are clear. He forgave, and he said: \". . . Love your enemies,bless them that curse you, do good to them thathate you, and pray for them which despitefully useyou, and persecute you.\" (Matt. 5:44.) ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 89Response to Offenses What is our response when we are offended, misunderstood, unfairly or unkindly treated, orsinned against, made an offender for a word, falselyaccused, passed over, hurt by those we love, ourofferings rejected? Do we resent, become bitter,hold a grudge? Or do we resolve the problem if wecan, forgive, and rid ourselves of the burden? The nature of our response to such situations may well determine the nature and quality of our lives,here and eternally. A courageous friend, her faithrefined by many afflictions, said to me only hoursago, \"Humiliation must come before exaltation.\" Forgiveness Required It is required of us to forgive. Oursalvation depends upon it. In arevelation given in 1831 the Lordsaid: \"My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another andforgave not one another in theirhearts; and for this evil they wereafflicted and sorely chastened. \"Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother histrespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; forthere remaineth in him the greater sin. \"I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.\" (D&C 64:8-10.) Therefore, Jesus taught us to pray, \"And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass againstus.\" (See Matt. 6:14-15.) Does it not seem a supreme impudence to ask and expect God to forgive when we do not forgive?\u2014openly? and \"in our hearts\"? The Lord affirms in the Book of Mormon that we bring ourselves under condemnation if we do notforgive. (See Mosiah 26:30-31.) But not only our eternal salvation depends upon our willingness and capacity to forgive wrongscommitted against us. Our joy and satisfaction inthis life, and our true freedom, depend upon ourdoing so. When Christ bade us turn the othercheek, walk the second mile, give our cloak to himwho takes our coat, was it to be chiefly out ofconsideration for the bully, the brute, the thief? Orwas it to relieve the one aggrieved of the destructiveburden that resentment and anger lay upon us? . . . God help us to rid ourselves of resentment and pettiness and foolish pride; to love, and to forgive,in order that we may be friends with ourselves, withothers, and with the Lord. \". . . even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.\" (Col. 3:13.) In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Principle of Mutual Respect President Spencer W. Kimball \"It is not enough to refrain from adultery. We need to make the marriage relationship sacred, to sacrifice andwork to maintain the warmth andrespect which we enjoyed duringcourtship. God intended marriage to beeternal, sealed by the power of thepriesthood, to last beyond the grave.Daily acts of courtesy and kindness,conscientiously and lovingly carriedout, are part of what the Lord expects\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1978, 7; orEnsign, Nov. 1978, 6). President Howard W. Hunter \"Any man who abuses or demeans his wife physically or spiritually is guilty of grievous sin and in need ofsincere and serious repentance. Differences shouldbe worked out in love and kindness and with a spiritof mutual reconciliation. A man should alwaysspeak to his wife lovingly and kindly, treating herwith the utmost respect. Marriage is like a tenderflower, brethren, and must be nourished constantlywith expressions of love and affection\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 68; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 51). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"How beautiful is the marriage of a young man and a young woman who begin their lives togetherkneeling at the altar in the house of the Lord,pledging their love and loyalty one to another fortime and all eternity. When children come into thathome, they are nurtured and cared for, loved andblessed with the feeling that their father loves theirmother. In that environment they find peace and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 90 We need to make the marriage relationship sacred, to sacrifice and work to maintain the warmth and respect which we enjoyed during courtship.strength and security. Watching their father, they develop respect for women. They are taught self-control and self-discipline, which bring the strengthto avoid later tragedy\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1991, 73; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 52). \"Every marriage is subject to occasional stormyweather. But with patience, mutual respect, and a spirit of forbearance, we can weather these storms.Where mistakes have been made, there can beapology, repentance, and forgiveness. But there mustbe willingness to do so on the part of both parties\"(\"This I Believe,\" 80). President James E. Faust \"There is no great or majestic music which constantly produces the harmony of a great love. The mostperfect music is a welding of two voices into onespiritual solo. Marriage is the way provided by Godfor the fulfillment of the greatest of human needs,based upon mutual respect, maturity, selflessness,decency, commitment, and honesty. Happiness inmarriage and parenthood can exceed a thousandtimes any other happiness\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1977, 14; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, 11). Elder Gordon B. Hinckley \"Companionship in marriage is prone to become commonplace and even dull. I know of no morecertain way to keep it on a lofty and inspiring planethan for a man occasionally to reflect upon the factthat the helpmeet who stands at his side is a daughterof God, engaged with Him in the great creativeprocess of bringing to pass His eternal purposes. I know of no more effective way for a woman tokeep ever radiant the love for her husband than forher to look for and emphasize the godly qualitiesthat are a part of every son of our Father and thatcan be evoked when there is respect and admirationand encouragement. The very processes of suchactions will cultivate a constantly rewardingappreciation for one another\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1971, 82; or Ensign, June 1971, 71-72). Elder L. Tom Perry \"Adam learned that the bonds of marriage are stronger than any other family bond. The sacredbonds of marriage invite unity, fidelity, respect, andmutual support\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995,97; or Ensign, May 1995, 72).Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"'Relationships and their outcome seem to be governed by principles which are unvarying andcannot be repealed. . . .

When a woman understandsthat a man has the seeds of divinity within him,she honors him not only for who he is but for whathe may become.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 91President Gordon B. Hinckley \"How godlike a quality is mercy. It cannot be legislated. It must come from the heart. It must bestirred up from within. It is part of the endowmenteach of us receives as a son or daughter of God andpartaker of a divine birthright. I plead for an effortamong all of us to give greater expression and widerlatitude to this instinct which lies within us. . . . \"I plead for a stronger spirit of compassion in all of our relationships, a stronger element of mercy, forthe promise is sure that if we are merciful we shallobtain mercy .... \"Mercy is of the very essence of the gospel of JesusChrist. The degree to which each of us is able toextend it becomes an expression of the reality of ourdiscipleship under Him who is our Lord and Master. \"I remind you that it was He who said, 'Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him theother also' (Matthew 5:39). \"It was He who said, 'And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thycloke also' (5:40).\"It was He who said, 'And whosoever shall compelthee to go a mile, go with him twain' (5:41). \"It was He who said, 'Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn notthou away' (5:42). \"It was He who said to the woman taken in sin:\"'Where are those thine accusers? hath no man . . do I sin no more' (John 8:10-11). \"It was He who, while hanging on the cross in dreadful agony, cried out, 'Father, forgive them; forthey know not what they do' (Luke 23:34). \"He, the Son of the everlasting Father, was the epitome of mercy. His ministry was one of compas-sion toward the poor, the sick, the oppressed, the victims of injustice and man's inhumanity to man.His sacrifice on the cross was an unparalleled act ofmercy in behalf of all humanity. \"How great a thing is mercy. Most often it is quiet and unassuming. It receives few headlines. It is theantithesis of vengeance and hatred, of greed andoffensive egotism. . . . \"And this brings me to another area where there is so great a need for that mercy which speaks offorbearance, kindness, clemency, compassion. I speak of the homes of the people. \"Every child, with few possible exceptions, is the product of a home, be it good, bad, or indifferent.As children grow through the years, their lives, inlarge measure, become an extension and a reflectionof family teaching. If there is harshness, abuse,uncontrolled anger, disloyalty, the fruits will becertain and discernible, and in all likelihood they willbe repeated in the generation that follows. If, on theother hand, there is forbearance, forgiveness, respect,consideration, kindness, mercy, and compassion,the fruits again will be discernible, and they will beeternally rewarding. They will be positive and sweetand wonderful. And as mercy is given and taughtby parents, it will be repeated in the lives andactions of the next generation. \"I speak to fathers and mothers everywhere with a plea to put harshness behind us, to bridle our anger,to lower our voices, and to deal with mercy andlove and respect one toward another in our homes\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1990, 86-89; or Ensign,May Greek: verb.

Principle of Work Genesis 3:17-19 \"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thoutaken: for dust thou and unto dust shalt thoureturn.\" 2 Nephi 5:17 \"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with theirhands.\" Mosiah 10:4-5 \"And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner offruit of every kind. \"And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen,yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clotheour nakedness; and thus we did prosper in theland\u2014thus we did have continual peace in the landfor the space of twenty and two years.\" Doctrine and Covenants 42:42 \"Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.\" Doctrine and Covenants 68:30-31 \"The idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord. Now, I, the Lord am not well pleased with theinhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them.\"President Gordon B. Hinckley \"There is no substitute under the heavens for productive labor. It is the process by which dreamsbecome realities. It is the process by which idlevisions become dynamic achievements. \"Most of us are inherently lazy. We would rather play than work. A little play and a little loafing aregood. But it is work that spells the difference in thelife of a man or woman. It is work that provides thefood we eat, the clothing we wear, the homes inwhich we live. We cannot deny the need for workwith skilled hands and educated minds if we are togrow and prosper individually and collectively\" (\"I Believe,\" New Era, Sept. 1996, 4). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread' is not outdated counsel. It is basic to personal welfare.One of the greatest favors parents can do for theirchildren is to teach them to work. Much has beensaid over the years about children and monthlyallowances, and opinions and recommendationsvary greatly. I'm from the 'old school.' I believechildren should earn their money needs throughservice and appropriate chores. Some financialrewards to children may also be tied to educationaleffort and the accomplishment of other worthwhilegoals. I think it is unfortunate for a child to growup in a home where the seed is planted in thechild's mind that there is a family money tree thatautomatically drops 'green stuff' once a week oronce a month\" (One for the Money, 8). Elder L. Tom Perry \"Teaching children the joy of honest labor is one of the greatest of all gifts you can bestow upon them. I am convinced that one of the reasons for thebreakup of so many couples today is the failure ofparents to teach and train sons in their responsibilityto provide and care for their families and to enjoythe challenge this responsibility brings. Many of us also have fallen short in instilling within ourdaughters the desire of bringing beauty and orderinto their homes through homemaking\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1986, 78; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 62). \"Marriage is a divine institution, ordained of God. Achieving success in the home is a supernalchallenge\u2014no other success can compensate for it. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 93Unless, however, a husband and wife learn to work together as one, marriage can also be an infernalordeal. There are too many unhappy marriages inthe world today. There are too many marriages thatdo not stay the course, ending prematurely indivorce\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 96; orEnsign, May 1995, 72). Elder David B. Haight \"Our concern is not just that media producers and writers don't portray happy, fruitful marriage, butthat many married couples don't take their marriagesseriously enough\u2014to work at them, protect them,nurture them, cultivate them day in and day out,week in and week out, yearlong, quarter-centurylong, half-a-century long, forever\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1984, 16; or Ensign, May 1984, 13). Elder James E. Faust \"An essential part of teaching children to be disciplined and responsible is to have them learn towork. As we grow up, many of us are like the manwho said, 'I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit andlook at it for hours' (Jerome Klapka Jerome, in The International Dictionary of Thoughts, comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, and Thomas C. Jones[Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969],p. 782). Again, the best teachers of the principle of work are the parents themselves. For me, workbecame a joy when I first worked alongside myfather, grandfather, uncles, and brothers. I am surethat I was often more of an aggravation than a help,but the memories are sweet and the lessons learnedare valuable. Children need to learn responsibilityand independence. Are the parents personally takingthe time to show and demonstrate and explain sothat children can, as Lehi taught, 'act for the world's greatest horticulturists, said, 'If we hadpaid no more attention to our plantsthan we have to our children, wewould now be living in a jungle ofweeds' (in Elbert Hubbard's Scrap Book[New York: (in Conference Report,Oct. 1990, 42; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 34). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"Some people who lived through the Great Depression and the period following, when thegovernment bestowed gratuities upon the people,developed a feeling that the world owed them aliving. In that climate, the First Presidency said in1936: 'The aim of the Church is to help the peopleto help themselves. Work is to be re-enthroned asthe ruling principle of the lives of our Churchmembership.' (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936,p. 3.) . . . \"The love for work needs to be reenthroned in our lives. Every family should have a plan for work thattouches the lives of each family member so thatthis eternal principle will be ingrained in theirlives\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 116; orEnsign, May 1981, 85). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"Husbands, be patient with your wives; and wives, be patient with your husbands. Don't expectperfection. Find agreeable ways to work out thedifferences that arise\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1987, 37; or Ensign, May 1987, 32). \"Parents should plant deeply the seed of the workethic into the hearts and habits of their children. As society has shifted from an agrarian to an urbanstructure, the joy and necessity of diligent, hardwork have been neglected. If our young people donot learn to work while in their homes, they likelywill be compelled to learn later in a setting wherethe lesson may be painful\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1989, 9; or Ensign, May 1989, 8). Elder Dean L. Larsen \"Marriage is not an easy venture. It is largely a one- time-through, do-it yourself project for the husbandand wife. I repeatedly encounter the illusion today,especially among younger people, that perfect marriages happen simply if the right two people come together. This isuntrue. Marriages don't succeedautomatically. Those who buildhappy, secure, successful marriagespay the price to do so. They work at itconstantly\" (\"Enriching Marriage,\"Ensign, Mar. 1985, 20). Sister Barbara B. Smith \"Accountability is a necessary condition of work. Responsibility brings system to the workings of a family and order to a marriage.

Maxwell Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1998, 48-51; or Ensign, May 1998, 37-39 (priesthood session) Learning to Work by Raising Pigs Brethren, during my Aaronic Priesthood years I wasa swineherd! Way back then, by means of a 4-H Clubproject involving purebred Duroc pigs, I becamefamiliar with work! As proof that what follows isnot merely swollen memory, may I, with ElderNelson's help, display very briefly this blanket ofnearly 100 ribbons won by my prize pigs at variousfairs over several years. Up near Elder Nelson's hand is a pink ribbon, won 60 years ago. It was the very first ribbon I ever won.I think the judge had a tender eye, and the pigwasn't really so choice, but he knew I neededencouragement and hence the fourth prize. Thepurple ribbons were for champions that wereexhibited later on! Thank you, Elder Nelson.Brethren, I learned the hard way about the need to watch shifting pork prices at the local meat-packingplant. Careful records of profits and losses were keptwith the help of my bookkeeper father. As in allthings, my parents, so supportive, even ended updoing some of the perspiring themselves, includinga special mother born 95 years ago today. Sheshowed me how to work, and she loved me enoughto correct me. In order to obtain low-cost pig feed, I regularly bought dozens and dozens of three-day-old loaves of breadat a bakery for a mere penny a loaf. Additionally, ifpresent at the right time at a local dairy, I could getabout 70 gallons of skim milk free! Now I pay $2.50 a gallon\u2014an amusing irony. By saving in theseways, I could buy the needed grain for the pigs withthe little hard cash that I had. There were many times when a pregnant sow would give birth to her litter after midnight. The resultantweariness of attending to all that, and more, wasreal. Yet through it all, there was a sense of someaccomplishment, including contributing to our familymenus. Most young men my age did similar work.Back then, brethren, we were all poor together, andwe didn't know it. Work was a given. Today, forsome, receiving is a given. However, there were real social downsides to raising pigs. Already shy, I remember vividly the principalof the junior high school coming into my classonce and saying aloud in front of everybody: \"Neal,your mother just called. Your pigs are out!\" I feltlike crawling under my desk but instead ran hometo help round up the pigs. Gratitude for Parents Who Taught Work My father was loving but exacting. He noted thatwhile I worked hard, my work was often not carefullydone. I was a stranger to excellence. One summer dayI determined to please Dad by putting in a numberof needed fence posts, firmly implanted and fullyaligned. I worked hard all that day and thenexpectantly scanned the lane down which my fatherwould walk home. When he arrived, I watchedanxiously as he carefully inspected the fence posts,even checking them with a level bar beforepronouncing them to be fully satisfactory. Then camehis praise. My sweat of the brow had earned Dad'scommendation which, in turn, melted my heart. Please forgive this brief autobiographical note, which I have used to express my deep appreciation forlearning to work at an early age. Even so, brethren,I certainly did not always put my shoulder to thewheel with a \"heart full of song\" ( Hymns, no. 252), but I did learn about shoulders and wheels, whichhelped later in life, when the wheels grew larger.Some of today's otherwise good young menmistakenly think that putting their shoulders to the wheel is the same thing as putting their handson a steering wheel! The Gospel of Work Our Heavenly Father has described His vast plan forHis children by saying, \"Behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 95eternal life of man\" (Moses 1:39; italics added). Consider the significance of the Lord's use of theword work. What He is doing so lovingly and redemptively is, nevertheless, work\u2014even for Him!We, likewise, speak of \"working out our salvation,\"of the \"law of the harvest,\" and of the \"sweat of thebrow\" (see Moses 5:1; see also Joseph SmithTranslation, Genesis 4:1). These are not idle phrases.Instead, they underscore the importance of work. Infact, brethren, work is always a spiritual necessityeven if, for some, work is not an economic necessity. Thus I speak to you as good young men, including seven fine grandsons listening tonight, among themtwo missionaries and three recently ordained deacons.I remind you that the gospel of work is part of \"thefulness of the gospel.\" Though joyful, missionarywork is work. Though joyful, temple work is work.Alas, a few of our underwhelmed youth work allright, but mostly at trying to please themselves. Balance of Work Should Be Orchestrated Unfortunately, a few of our otherwise good youthare unstretched, having almost a free pass. Perks areprovided, including cars complete with fuel andinsurance\u2014all paid for by parents who sometimeslisten in vain for a few courteous and appreciativewords. Young men, your individual mix of work will vary, understandably, by season and circumstance asbetween the hours spent on homework and family work and Church work, part-time work, and work on service projects. Each form of work can stretch your talents. Nevertheless, watch for the warning lights.For instance, if you are engaged in part-time work, are all your wages spent on yourself? Is tithing paid?Is some saved for a mission? President Spencer W.Kimball gave us this crisp counsel: \"If the [youngman] is permitted to spend his all on himself, thatspirit of selfishness may continue with him to hisgrave\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 560). Homework from school is surely a necessity, but does mental work squeeze out spiritual work entirely?Your grade-point average is very important, but whatis your GPA for Christian service? Doing Church work can develop vital reflexes, and the need for this form of work will never cease. But are you merely going through the motions? Family work is vital too, but does it really go beyond merely keeping your own rooms clean and picking up your own clothes?Whatever the mix of work, the hardest work you and I will ever do is to put off our selfishness. It isheavy lifting! A balance of work needs to be orchestrated, because some forms of work tend to dominate other forms,like fathers working late at the office too often. Ourpreferred chores need little encouragement just asin Elder Spencer Condie's paraphrase of Strauss'swarning to orchestra conductors: \"Never give anencouraging nod to the brass section, or you'llnever hear the strings again!\" Fathers, Work with Your Sons Be careful, fathers, when you inordinately desirethings to be better for your children than they werefor you. Do not, however unintentionally, makethings worse by removing the requirement forreasonable work as part of their experience, therebyinsulating your children from the very things thathelped make you what you are! Granted, some tactical situations have changed! For most young men, there are no cows to be milked,pigs to be fed, et cetera. Yes, some of today's workmay seem artificial and contrived. Nevertheless,young men, be patient with your parents as theytry to help provide reasonable and meaningfulwork. In that connection, how blessed we would beif more sons could work alongside their fathers, ifonly occasionally. Fathers and sons, if such teamingup is not already happening at all, please, in thenext three months, select just one stretching choreto do together. Known for the Work Ethic Young men, I do not know what your individual giftsare, but you have them! Please employ these gifts andstretch your talents\u2014along with taking out garbagecans, mowing lawns, raking leaves, or shovelingsnow for widows, widowers, or a sick neighbor. Knowing how to work will give you an edge in life, and experience with excellence\u2014a special edge! Let us all be quick and generous to praise our youth for the work they accomplish, especially when theydo it well! The rising generation will determine if Latter-day Saints will continue to be known for the work ethic.Long ago, President Brigham Young advised: \"I wantto see our Elders so full of integrity that [their work]will be preferred. . . . If we live our religion and are ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 96worthy [of] the name . . . Latter-day Saints, we are just the men that all such business can be entrustedto with perfect safety; if it can not [be] it will provethat we do not live our religion\" ( Discourses of Brigham Young, 232-33). No Perspiration-Free Shortcuts When the time comes, young men, make yourcareer choices. Know that whether one is aneurosurgeon, forest ranger, mechanic, farmer, orteacher is a matter of preference not of principle.While those career choices are clearly veryimportant, these do not mark your real career path.Instead, brethren, you are sojourning sons of Godwho have been invited to take the path that leadshome. There, morticians will find theirs is not theonly occupation to become obsolete. But thecapacity to work and work wisely will never becomeobsolete. And neither will the ability to learn.Meanwhile, my young brethren, I have not seen anyperspiration-free shortcuts to the celestial kingdom;there is no easy escalator to take us there. Special Spirits Sent to Do Special Chores Now, whether holders of the Aaronic or theMelchizedek Priesthood, at no time has it beenmore important for you to know whoyou are than in today's world. For a long, long time, each of youhas been part of a great and ongoing drama. Youwere actually with God in the beginning (see D&C93:29). You were at the grand, premortal councilwhen, as His spirit sons, you shouted for joy overthe prospect of this mortal experience in furtheranceof Heavenly Father's plan of salvation. Further drama lies ahead for the faithful, including one day when every knee shall bow and everytongue confess that Jesus is the Christ,and when all will acknowledge thatGod is God, and that He is perfect inHis justice and mercy (see Mosiah27:31; 16:1; Alma 12:15). Those wholove the Lord will inherit His celestialkingdom, where eye hath not seennor ear heard such things as the Lordhath prepared for them (see 1 Corinthians 2:9).Jesus has already worked to prepare such aglorious place for us. My brethren, old and young, sweeping is the only way to describe your spiritual history and your possible future! There will always be plenty of workto do, especially for those who know how to do theLord's work! I gladly endorse what President Hinckleyhas declared, namely that \"we have the finestgeneration of young people ever in the history ofthis Church\" (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley, 714; see also Conference Report, Apr. 1992, 96; or Ensign,May 1992, 69). I believe in your future possibilities. You are special spirits sent to do special chores. It is toward thosechores that I have tried to give you a friendly nudgetonight! I love you! May God bless you and keep you on that path that will take you home is my prayer inthe holy name of Jesus Christ, amen. Principle of Wholesome Recreational Activities President Spencer W. Kimball \"Too much leisure for children leaves them in a state of boredom, and it is natural for them to want moreand more of the expensive things for their recreation.We must bring dignity to labor in sharing theresponsibilities of the home and the yard\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1976, 5-6; or Ensign, May 1976, 5). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Wholesome recreation is part of our religion, and a change of pace is necessary, and even itsanticipation can lift the spirit\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1974, 92; or Ensign, Nov. 1974, 66). \"Families must spend more time together in work and recreation. Family home evenings should bescheduled once a week as a time for discussionsof gospel principles, recreation, work projects,skits, songs around the piano, games, special refreshments, and family prayers. Likeiron links in a chain, this practice willbind a family together, in love, pride,tradition, strength, and loyalty\"(\"Salvation\u2014A Family Affair,\" Ensign, July 1992, 4; see also ConferenceReport, Oct. 1982, 86; or Ensign,Nov. 1982, 60). \"Successful families do things together: familyprojects, work, vacations, recreation, and reunions\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1984, 6; or Ensign, May 1984, 6). \"Mothers in Zion, your God-given roles are so vital to your own exaltation and to the salvation andexaltation of your family ....

Take time to be a real friend to your children. . . . \". . . Take time your children. . . .\". . . Take time to do things together as a family\" (To the Mothers in Zion, 8-10). \"With love in my heart for the fathers in Israel, mayI suggest ten specific ways that fathers can givespiritual leadership to their children: . . . \"4. Go on daddy-daughter dates and father-and-sons' outings with your children. As a family, go on campouts and picnics, to ball games and recitals, to school programs, and so forth. Having Dad theremakes all the difference. \"5. Build traditions of family vacations and trips and outings. These memories will never be forgotten byyour children\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987,62-63; or Ensign, Nov. 1987, 51; To the Fathers in Israel, 8-9). President Hugh B. Brown \"This is entitled 'When Is Success a Failure?'\"When you are doing the lower while the higher is possible, When you are not a cleaner, finer, larger man on account of your work, When you live only to eat and drink, have a good time, and accumulate money, then success is a failure.When you do not carry a higher wealth in your character than in your pocketbook, When the attainment of your ambition has blighted the aspirations and crushed the hopes of others, When hunger for more money, more land, more houses and bonds has grown to be your dominant passion, When your profession has made you a physical wreck\u2014 a victim of 'nerves' and moods, When your absorption in your work has made you practically a stranger to your family, When your greed for money has darkened and cramped your wife's life, and deprived her of self-expression, ofneeded rest and recreation, of amusement of any kind, When all sympathy and fellowship have been crushed out of your life by selfish devotion to your vocation, When you do not overtop your vocation, when you are not greater as a man than as a lawyer, a merchant, aphysician or a scientist,When you plead that you have never had time tocultivate your friendships, your politeness, or your goodmanners, When you have lost on your way your self-respect, your courage, your self-control, or any other quality ofmanhood, then success has been a failure.\" (In Conference Report, Apr. 1969, 113.) President Thomas S. Monson \"So frequently we mistakenly believe that our children need more things, when in reality theirsilent pleadings are simply for more of our time.The accumulation of wealth or the multiplication of assets belies the Master's teaching: \"'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and wherethieves break through and steal: \"'But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, andwhere thieves do not break through nor steal: \"'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'

Elder Thomas S. Monson \"Our house is to be a house of order. 'To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven' (Ecclesiastes 3:1), advised Ecclesiastes,the Preacher.

Elder L. Tom Perry \"If I were cast again in the role of having a young family around me, I would be determined to givethem more time. . . . \". . . Saturday would be a special activity day divided into two parts: first, a time for teaching childrenthe blessings of work, how to care for and improve ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 98the home, the yard, the garden, the field; second, a time for family activity, to build a family heritage ofthings you enjoy doing together\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1980, 8-9; or Ensign, Nov. 1980, 9). \"Dr. Nick Stinnett of the University of Nebraska gavea most interesting talk at an annual meeting of theNational Council on Family Relations.

The result of all this instantgratification is overloaded bankruptcy courts andfamilies that are far too preoccupied with theirfinancial burdens\" (in Conference Report,Sept.-Oct. 1995, 45; or Ensign, Nov. 1995, 35). Elder James E. Faust \"Develop family traditions. Some of the great strengths of families can be found in their own traditions, which may consist of many things: making specialoccasions of the blessing of children, baptisms,ordinations to the priesthood, birthdays, fishingtrips, skits on Christmas Eve, family home evening,and so forth.

Their capacity tobecome worthwhile persons is strongly affected bythe absence or presence of such a family and by theirown acceptance of the challenge to be a contributing,responsible member of it. The influence of a goodfamily is well-captured by this account from anunknown source: \"'It was a gorgeous October day. My husband Art and I were down at the boat landing helping our friendDon drag his skiff up on the beach. Art remarkedwistfully that it would be a long time before nextsummer, when we could all start sailing again. \"Youfolks ought to take up skiing like our family andhave fun the year round,\" Don said. \"'\"Doesn't that get pretty expensive?\" I asked.\"'Don straightened up and smiled. \"It's funny,\" he said. \"We live in an old-fashioned house\u2014legs onthe tub, that sort of thing.

THE ETERNAL FAMILY Elder Robert D. Hales Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 86-90; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 64-68 The Doctrine of Eternal Families I wish to speak to all those who would like to knowabout eternal families and about families beingforever. One year ago the First Presidency andQuorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a proclamationto the world concerning the family. It summarizeseternal gospel principles that have been taughtsince the beginning of recorded history and evenbefore the earth was created. The doctrine of the family begins with heavenly parents. Our highest aspiration is to be like them.The Apostle Paul taught that God is the father of ourspirits (see Hebrews 12:9). From the proclamationwe read, \"In the premortal realm, spirit sons anddaughters knew and worshiped God as their EternalFather and accepted His plan by which His childrencould obtain a physical body and gain earthlyexperience to progress toward perfection andultimately realize his or her divine destiny as anheir of eternal life.\" The proclamation also reiteratesto the world that \"marriage between a man and awoman is ordained of God and that the family iscentral to the Creator's plan for the eternal destinyof His children\" (\"The Family: A Proclamation tothe World,\" Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). From the earliest beginnings, God established thefamily and made it eternal. Adam and Eve weresealed in marriage for time and all eternity: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 100\"And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, anda decree sent forth, that it should be in the world,until the end thereof; and thus it was\" (Moses 5:59). \"And Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sons and daughters, and they began to multiply andto replenish the earth\" (Moses 5:2). The Savior Himself spoke of this sacred marriage covenant and promise when He gave the authorityto His disciples to bind in heaven sacred covenantsmade on earth: \"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earthshall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thoushalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\"(Matthew 16:19). In this latter day the promise of eternal families was restored in 1829 when the powers of the MelchizedekPriesthood were restored to the earth. Seven yearslater, in the Kirtland Temple, the keys to performthe sealing ordinances were restored, as recorded inthe Doctrine and Covenants: \"Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said: \"Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi. . . . \". . . The are committed into your hands\" (D&C 110:13-14, 16). With the restoration of these keys and priesthood authority comes the opportunity for all who areworthy to receive the blessings of eternal families.\"Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of thousandsshall greatly rejoice in consequence of the blessingswhich shall be poured out, and the endowmentwith which my servants have been endowed in thishouse\" (D&C 110:9). Promises and Requirements of Sealings What is the promise of these sealings which areperformed in the temples? The Lord outlines thepromise and requirements in this sacred verse: \"And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the newand everlasting covenant, and it is sealed untothem by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who isanointed, unto whom I have appointed this powerand the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be saidunto them\u2014Ye shall come forth in the firstresurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection,in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones,kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions,all heights and depths\u2014then shall it written inthe Lamb's Book of Life . . . and shall be of fullforce when they are out of the world; and they shallpass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there,to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hathbeen sealed upon their heads, which glory shall bea fulness and a continuation of the seeds foreverand ever\" (D&C 132:19). As taught in this scripture, an eternal bond doesn't just happen as a result of sealing covenants we makein the temple. How we conduct ourselves in this lifewill determine what we will be in all the eternitiesto come. To receive the blessings of the sealing thatour Heavenly Father has given to us, we have to keepthe commandments and conduct ourselves in sucha way that our families will want to live with us inthe eternities. The family relationships we havehere on this earth are important, but they are muchmore important for their effect on our families forgenerations in mortality and throughout all eternity. Love Spouse above All Others By divine commandment, spouses are required tolove each other above all others. The Lord clearlydeclares, \"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thyheart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else\"(D&C 42:22). The proclamation states: \"By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsibleto provide the necessities of life and protection fortheir families [see D&C 83:2-4; 1 Timothy 5:8]. [Bydivine are responsiblefor the nurture of their children.\" By divine design,husband and wife are equal partners in their marriageand parental responsibilities. By direct commandmentof God, \"parents have a sacred duty . . . to teach[their children] to love and serve one another, to observethe commandments of God and to be law-abidingcitizens [in the countries where they Satan's Efforts to Destroy the Family Because of the importance of the family to the eternalplan of happiness, Satan makes a major effort todestroy the sanctity of the family, demean theimportance of the roles of men and women, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 101encourage moral uncleanliness and violations of the sacred law of chastity, and discourage parents fromplacing the bearing and rearing of children as oneof their highest priorities. So fundamental is the family unit to the plan of salvation that God has declared a warning that those\"individuals who violate covenants of chastity, whoabuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill familyresponsibilities will one day stand accountablebefore God [their maker]. The disintegration of thefamily will bring upon individuals, communities,and nations the calamities foretold by ancient andmodern prophets\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Save Families, Not Just Ourselves While our individual salvation is based on ourindividual obedience, it is equally important thatwe understand that we are each animportant and integral part of a family and that the highest blessings can be received only within an eternal family.When families are functioning asdesigned by God, the relationshipsfound therein are the most valued ofmortality. The plan of the Father is thatfamily love and companionship will continue into the eternities. Being one in a family carries a great responsibility of caring, loving, lifting, andstrengthening each member of the family so that allcan righteously endure to the end in mortality anddwell together throughout eternity. It is not enoughjust to save ourselves. It is equally important thatparents, brothers, and sisters are saved in ourfamilies. If we return home alone to our HeavenlyFather, we will be asked, \"Where is the rest of thefamily?\" This is why we teach that families areforever. The eternal nature of an individualbecomes the eternal nature of the family. Families Prepare Us for Eternal Life The eternal nature of our body and our spirit is a question often pondered by those who live inmortality. All people who will ever live on earth aremembers of a human family and are eternal childrenof God, our loving Heavenly Father. After birth andtasting of death in mortality, all will be resurrectedbecause of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the OnlyBegotten Son of God the Father. Depending on ourindividual obedience to the laws, ordinances, andcommandments of God, each mortal can have theblessing of attaining eternal life; that is, returningto live in the presence of Heavenly Father and HisSon, Jesus Christ, having eternal increase for all theeternities to come. Through making and keepingthe sacred covenants found in the temple ordinances,individuals can return to the presence of God andwill be reunited with their families eternally. The home is where we are nurtured and where we prepare ourselves for living in mortality. It is alsowhere we prepare ourselves for death and forimmortality because of our belief and understandingthat there is life after death, not only for theindividual but also for the family. Faith of a Friend with a Terminal Illness Some of the greatest lessons of gospel principles aboutthe eternal nature of the family are learned as we observe how members of the Church,when faced with adversity, applygospel principles in their lives and intheir homes. In the past year I havewitnessed the blessings of joy which come to those who honor and reverethe gospel teaching of the eternal family during times of adversity intheir lives. A few months ago I had the opportunity of visitinga man who had been diagnosed with a terminalillness. As a devoted priesthood holder, he wasconfronted with the realities of mortality. He foundstrength, however, in the example of the Savior,who said, in the Lord's Prayer, \"After this mannertherefore pray ye: . . . Thy will done in earth, asit is in heaven\" (Matthew 6:9-10). My friend tookcourage in knowing that as Jesus was required toendure great pain and agony in the Garden ofGethsemane while completing the atoning sacrifice,He uttered the words, \"O my Father, if this cup maynot pass away from me, except I drink it, thy willbe done\" (Matthew 26:42). My friend came to accept the phrase \"Thy will be done\" as he faced his own poignant trials andtribulations. As a faithful member of the Church, hewas now confronted with some sobering concerns.Particularly touching were his questions, \"Have Idone all that I need to do to faithfully endure to theend?\" \"What will death be like?\" \"Will my familybe prepared to stand in faith and be self-reliantwhen I am gone?\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 102 We are each an important and integral part of a family.We had the opportunity to discuss all three questions. They are clearly answered in the doctrine taught tous by our Savior. We discussed how he had spent hislife striving to be faithful, to do what God asked ofhim, to be honest in his dealings with his fellowmenand all others, to care for and love his family. Isn'tthat what is meant by enduring to the end? Wetalked about what happens immediately after death,about what God has taught us about the world ofspirits. It is a place of paradise and happiness forthose who have lived righteous lives. It is notsomething to fear. After our conversation, he called together his wife and the extended family\u2014children and grandchildren\u2014to teach them again the doctrine of the Atonementthat all will be resurrected. Everyone came tounderstand that just as the Lord has said, while therewill be mourning at the temporary separation, thereis no sorrow for those who die in the Lord (seeRevelation 14:13; D&C 42:46). His blessing promisedhim comfort and reassurance that all would be well,that he would not have pain, that he would haveadditional time to prepare his family for his departure,and even that he would know the time of hisdeparture. The family related to me that on the nightbefore he passed away, he said he would go on themorrow. He passed away the next afternoon at peace,with all his family at his side. This is the solace andcomfort that comes to us when we understand thegospel plan and know that families are forever. Gospel Doctrines Comfort a Young Widow Contrast these events with an incident whichhappened to me when I was a young man in myearly twenties. While serving in the Air Force, oneof the pilots in my squadron crashed on a trainingmission and was killed. I was assigned to accompanymy fallen comrade on his final journey home to beburied in Brooklyn. I had the honor of standing byhis family during the viewing and funeral servicesand of representing our government in presentingthe flag to his grieving widow at the graveside. Thefuneral service was dark and dismal. No mentionwas made of his goodness or his accomplishments.His name was never mentioned. At the conclusionof the services, his widow turned to me and asked,\"Bob, what is really going to happen to Don?\" I wasthen able to give her the sweet doctrine of theResurrection and the reality that, if baptized andsealed in the temple for time and all eternity, theycould be together eternally. The clergyman standingnext to her said, \"That is the most beautiful doctrineI have ever heard.\" The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings great comfort in stressful times of mortality. It brings lightwhere there is darkness and a calming influencewhere there is turmoil. It gives eternal hope wherethere is mortal despair. It is more than just beautifuldoctrine. It is a reality in our lives that if we can beobedient and obtain the eternal rewards that Godgrants us, if we will draw nigh unto Him and embracethe eternal doctrine, we will be blessed. A Dying Man Has Faith in Eternal Families Another incident that has touched my life recently happened when a young man with a terminalillness passed away. He knew that his illness wouldfirst take away his manual dexterity and his abilityto walk, then its progression would take his abilityto speak, and finally his respiratory system wouldcease to function. But he also had faith that familiesare forever. With this knowledge, he spoke to eachof his children through video recordings for usewhen he was gone. He produced recordings to begiven to his sons and daughters at important, sacredoccasions in their lives, such as baptisms, priesthoodordinations, and weddings. He spoke to them withthe tender love of a father who knew that while hisfamily was forever, for a time he would not physicallybe able to be with them, but spiritually he wouldnever leave their side. The examples of faith shown by steadfast widows and widowers, along with that of their children, afterthe passing of a spouse or parent are an inspirationto all of us. Great lessons can be learned as weobserve their faith and obedience as they strive toremain faithful so that they can once again betogether as families through eternity. The Gospel Brings Light and Hope The knowledge and understanding of the doctrinethat God lives and Jesus is the Christ and that wehave an opportunity to be resurrected and live inthe presence of God the Father and His Son, JesusChrist, make it possible to endure otherwise tragicevents. This doctrine brings a brightness of hopeinto an otherwise dark and dreary world. It answersthe simple questions of where we came from, why weare here, and where we are going. These are truthsthat must be taught and practiced in our homes. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 103God lives. Jesus is the Christ. Through His Atonement we will all have the opportunity of being resurrected.This is not just an individual blessing; it is muchmore than that. It is a blessing to each one of us andto our families. That we may be eternally grateful,that we can live in the presence of God the EternalFather and His Son Jesus Christ, that we may betogether in the eternities to come, that we mightunderstand the joy, and that we not only teach thisdoctrine but live true to it in our lives and in ourfamilies, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,amen. THE FAMILY Elder Henry B. Eyring Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles CES fireside for college-age young adults, 5 Nov. 1995; or To Draw Closer to God, 157-73 Since the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christthrough the Prophet Joseph Smith until 23 September1995, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintshas issued a proclamation only four times. It hasbeen more than fifteen years since the last one,which described the progress the Church had madein 150 years of its history. Thus, you can imaginethe importance our Heavenly Father places uponthe subject of this most recent proclamation. Because our Father loves his children, he will not leave us to guess about what matters most in this lifeconcerning where our attention could bring happinessor our indifference bring sadness. Sometimes he willtell a person directly, by inspiration. But he will, inaddition, tell us through his servants. In the wordsof the prophet Amos, recorded long ago, \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth hissecret unto his servants the prophets\" (Amos 3:7).He does that so that even those who cannot feelinspiration can know, if they will only listen, thatthey have been told the truth and been warned. The title of the proclamation reads: \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\u2014The First Presidency andCouncil of the Twelve Apostles of The Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" (see Ensign, Nov. 1995, p. 102).Three things about the title are worth our carefulreflection. First, the subject: the family. Second, theaudience, which is the whole world. And third, thosewho proclaimed are those we sustain as prophets,seers, and revelators. That means that the familymust be as important to us as anything we canconsider, that what the proclamation says couldhelp anyone in the world, and that the proclamationfits the Lord's promise when he said, \"Whether bymine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it isthe same\" (D&C 1:38). Before we start to listen to the words of the proclamation together, the title tells us somethingabout how to prepare. We can expect that Godwon't just tell us a few interesting things about thefamily; he will tell us what a family ought to be andwhy. And we know at the outset that we could beeasily overwhelmed with such thoughts as: \"This isso high a standard and I am so weak that I can neverhope for such a family.\" That feeling can comebecause what our Heavenly Father and his son JesusChrist want for us is to become like them so that wecan dwell with them forever, in families. We knowthat from this simple statement of their intent: \"This is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\" (Moses 1:39). Eternal life means to become like the Father and to live in families in happiness and joy forever, so ofcourse what he wants for us will require help beyondour powers. That feeling of our inadequacy canmake it easier to repent and to be ready to rely onthe Lord's help. The fact that the proclamation goes to all the world\u2014to every person and government in it\u2014givesus assurance that we need not be overwhelmed.Whoever we are, however difficult our circumstances,we can know that what our Father commands wedo to qualify for the blessings of eternal life will notbe beyond us. What a young boy said long ago whenhe faced a seemingly impossible assignment is true: \"I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare away for them that they may accomplish the thingwhich he commandeth them\" (1 Nephi 3:7). We may have to pray with faith to know what we are to do and we must pray with a determination toobey, but we can know what to do and be sure thatthe way has been prepared for us by the Lord. As weread of what the proclamation tells us about the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 104family, we can expect, in fact we must expect, impressions to come to our minds as to what we areto do, and we can be confident it is possible. The proclamation begins this way:\"We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriagebetween a man and a woman is ordained of Godand that the family is central to the Creator's planfor the eternal destiny of His children.\" Try to imagine yourself as a little child, hearing those words for the first time, and believing that they aretrue. This can be a useful attitude whenever we reador hear the word of God because he has told us,\"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receivethe kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wiseenter therein\" (Luke 18:17). A little child would feel safe hearing the words that marriage between a man and woman is ordained ofGod. The child would know that the longing to havethe love of both a father and a mother, distinct butsomehow perfectly complementary, exists becausethat is the eternal pattern, the pattern of happiness.The child would also feel safer knowing that Godwould help mother and father resolve differences andlove each other, if only they will ask for his helpand try. Prayers of children across the earth wouldgo up to God, pleading for his help for parents andfor families. Read in that same way, as if you were a little child, the next words of the proclamation: \"All human beings\u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son ordaughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, eachhas a divine nature and destiny. Gender is anessential characteristic of individual premortal,mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. \"In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Fatherand accepted His plan by which His children couldobtain a physical body and gain earthly experienceto progress toward perfection and ultimately realizehis or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. Thedivine plan of happiness enables family relationshipsto be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinancesand covenants available in holy temples make itpossible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.\"Understanding these truths ought to make it easierfor us to feel like a little child, not just as we readthe proclamation, but throughout our lives, becausewe are children\u2014but in what a family and of whatparents! We can picture ourselves as we were, forlonger than we can imagine, sons and daughtersassociating in our heavenly home with parents whoknew and loved us. But now we can see ourselveshome again with our heavenly parents, in thatwonderful place, not only as sons and daughtersbut husbands and wives, fathers and mothers,grandfathers and grandmothers, grandsons andgranddaughters, bound together forever in lovingfamilies. And we know that in the premortal worldwe were men or women, with unique gifts becauseof our gender, and that the opportunity to be marriedand to become one was necessary for us to haveeternal happiness. With that picture before us we can never be tempted even to think, \"Maybe I wouldn't like eternal life.Maybe I would be just as happy in some other placein the life after death. I've heard that even thelowest kingdoms are more beautiful than anythingwe have ever seen.\" We must have the goal not just in our minds but in our hearts. What we want is eternal life in families.We don't just want it if that is what works out, nordo we want something approaching eternal life. Wewant eternal life, whatever its cost in effort, pain,and sacrifice. Whenever we are tempted to makeeternal life our hope instead of our determination,we might think of a building I took a look at a fewweeks ago. I was in Boston. For a little nostalgia, I walked up to the front of the boarding house I was living in whenI met Kathleen, who is now my wife. That was a longtime ago, so I expected to find the house a little moredilapidated than it was, since I seem to be a littlemore dilapidated. But to our surprise, it was freshlypainted and much renovated. A university haspurchased it from the Sopers, the people who ownedit and ran it as a boarding house. The building was locked, so we couldn't get in to see the back room on the top floor, which once wasmine. Costs have changed, so this will be hard foryou to believe, but this was the deal the Sopers gaveme: My own large room and bath, furniture andsheets provided, maid service, six big breakfasts andfive wonderful dinners a week, at the price of $21 a week. More than that, the meals were ample and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 105prepared with such skill that we called our landlady with some affection, \"Ma Soper.\" Just talking aboutit with you makes me realize that I didn't thankMrs. Soper often enough, nor Mr. Soper and theirdaughter, since it must have been some burden tohave twelve single men to dinner every week night. Now, you aren't tempted by that description of a boarding house, and neither am I. It could havethe most spacious rooms, the best service, and thefinest eleven men you could ever know as fellowboarders and we wouldn't want to live there formore than a short while. If it were beautiful beyondour power to imagine, we wouldn't want to livethere forever, single, if we have even the dimmestmemory or the faintest vision of a family withbeloved parents and children, like the one fromwhich we came to this earth and the one which isour destiny to form and to live in forever. There isonly one place where there will be families\u2014thehighest degree of the celestial kingdom. That iswhere we will want to be. A child hearing and believing those words would begin a lifetime of looking for a holy temple whereordinances and covenants perpetuate familyrelationships beyond the grave and would begin a striving to become worthy, and to find a potentialmate who has become worthy, of such ordinances.The words of the proclamation make it clear that to receive those blessings requires some sort ofperfecting experiences. A child might not sense atfirst, but soon would learn, that all the making ofresolutions and trying harder can produce onlyfaltering progress toward perfection. With age willcome temptations to acts that create feelings ofguilt. Every child will someday feel those pangs ofconscience, as we all have. And those who feel thatpriceless sense of guilt and cannot shake it maydespair, sensing that eternal life requires a progresstoward perfection that seems increasingly to bebeyond them. So you and I will resolve to speak tosomeone who doesn't yet know what we know abouthow that perfection is produced. We will do thatbecause we know that someday they will want whatwe want, and will then realize that we were theirbrother or sister, and that we knew the way to eternallife. Tonight and tomorrow it won't be hard to be a member missionary if you think of that futuremoment when they and we will see things as theyreally are.Some other words in the proclamation will havespecial meaning for us, knowing what we know abouteternal life. They are in the next two paragraphs: \"The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthoodas husband and wife. We declare that God'scommandment for His children to multiply andreplenish the earth remains in force. We furtherdeclare that God has commanded that the sacredpowers of procreation are to be employed onlybetween man and woman, lawfully wedded ashusband and wife. \"We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity oflife and of its importance to God's eternal plan.\" Believing those words, a child could spot easily the mistakes in reasoning made by adults. For instance,apparently wise and powerful people blame povertyand famine on there being too many people in someparts of the earth or in all the earth. With greatpassion they argue for limiting births, as if that willproduce human happiness. A child believing theproclamation will know that cannot be so, evenbefore hearing these words from the Lord throughhis prophet, Joseph Smith: \"For the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given untothe children of men to be agents unto themselves\"(D&C 104:17). A child could see that Heavenly Father would not command men and women to marry and to multiplyand replenish the earth if the children they invitedinto mortality would deplete the earth. Since thereis enough and to spare, the enemy of humanhappiness as well as the cause of poverty andstarvation is not the birth of children. It is thefailure of people to do with the earth what Godcould teach them to do, if only they would ask andthen obey, for they are agents unto themselves. We would also see that the commandment to be chaste, to employ the powers of procreation only ashusband and wife, is not limiting but ratherexpanding and exalting. Children are the inheritanceof the Lord to us in this life, but also in eternity.Eternal life is not only to have forever our descendantsfrom this life. It is also to have eternal increase.This is the description of what awaits those of usmarried as husband and wife by a servant of God ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 106with authority to offer us the sacred sealing ordinances. Here are the words of the Lord: \"It shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, andthrough all eternity; and shall be of full force whenthey are out of the world; and they shall pass by theangels, and the gods, which are set there, to theirexaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealedupon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness anda continuation of the seeds forever and ever. \"Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting\"(D&C 132:19-20). Now you can see why our Father in Heaven puts such a high standard before us in using procreativepowers whose continuation is at the heart of eternallife. He told us what that was worth this way: \"And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift isthe greatest of all the gifts of God\" (D&C 14:7). We can understand why our Heavenly Father commands us to reverence life and to cherish thepowers that produce it as sacred. If we do not havethose feelings in this life, how could our Father givethem to us in the eternities? Family life here is theschoolroom in which we prepare for family lifethere. And to give us the opportunity for family lifethere was and is the purpose of creation. That iswhy the coming of Elijah was described this way: \"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts ofthe children shall turn to their fathers. If it werenot so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted athis coming\" (Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:39). For some of us, the test in that schoolroom of mortality will be to want marriage and children inthis life, with all our hearts, but to have it delayedor denied. Even such a sorrow can be turned toblessing by a just and loving Father and his Son,Jesus Christ. No one who strives with full faith andheart for the blessings of eternal life will be denied.And how great will be the joy and how muchdeeper the appreciation then after enduring inpatience and faith now. The proclamation describes our schooling here for family life in the presence of our Eternal Father: \"Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children.'Children are an heritage of the Lord' (Psalms127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear theirchildren in love and righteousness, to provide fortheir physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe thecommandments of God and to be law-abidingcitizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives\u2014mothers and fathers\u2014will be held accountablebefore God for the discharge of these obligations. \"The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan.Children are entitled to birth within the bonds ofmatrimony, and to be reared by a father and amother who honor marital vows with completefidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to beachieved when founded upon the teachings of theLord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and familiesare established and maintained on principles offaith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love,compassion, work, and wholesome recreationalactivities. By divine design, fathers are to presideover their families in love and righteousness andare responsible to provide the necessities of life andprotection for their families. Mothers are primarilyresponsible for the nurture of their children. Inthese sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothersare obligated to help one another as equal partners.Disability, death, or other circumstances maynecessitate individual adaptation. Extended familiesshould lend support when needed.\" Those two paragraphs are filled with practical implications. There are things we can start to donow. They have to do with providing for thespiritual and the physical needs of a family. Thereare things we can do now to prepare, long beforethe need, so that we can be at peace knowing wehave done all we can. To begin with, we can decide to plan for success, not failure. Statistics are thrown at us every day topersuade us that a family composed of a lovingfather and mother with children loved, taught, andcared for in the way the proclamation enjoins isgoing the way of the dinosaurs, toward extinction.You have enough evidence in your own familiesthat righteous people sometimes have their familiesripped apart by circumstances beyond their control.It takes courage and faith to plan for what Godholds before you as the ideal rather than whatmight be forced upon you by circumstances. There are important ways in which planning for failure can make failure more likely and the ideal ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 107less so. Consider these twin commandments as an example: \"Fathers are to and \"mothers areprimarily responsible for the nurture of theirchildren.\" Knowing how hard thatmight be, a young man might choosea career on the basis of how muchmoney he could make, even if it meanthe couldn't be home enough to be anequal partner. By doing that, he hasalready decided he cannot hope to dowhat would be best. A young woman might preparefor a career incompatible with being primarilyresponsible for the nurture of her children because of the possibilities of not marrying, of not havingchildren, or of being left alone to provide for them herself. Or, she might fail to focus her education onthe gospel and the knowledge of the world thatnurturing a family would require, not realizing thatthe highest and best use she could make of hertalents and her education would be in her home.Because a young man and woman had planned totake care of the worst, they might make the bestless likely. They are both wise to worry about the physical needs of that future family. The costs of buying a home,compared to average salaries, seem to be rising andjobs harder to hold. But there are other ways theyoung man and the young woman could thinktonight about preparing to provide for that futurefamily. Income is only one part of it. Have younoticed husbands and wives who feel pinched forlack of money, then choose ways to make theirfamily income keep rising, and then find that thepinch is there whatever the income? There is an oldformula you've heard, which goes something likethis: Income five dollars and expenses six dollars:misery. Income four dollars and expenses threedollars: happiness. Whether the young man can provide and still be in the home and whether the young woman can bethere to nurture children can depend as much onhow they learn to spend as how they learn to earn.Brigham Young said it this way, speaking to us asmuch as he did to the people in his day: \"If you wish to get rich, save what you get. A fool can earn money; but it takes a wise man to saveand dispose of it to his own advantage. Then go to work, and save everything, and make your ownbonnets and clothing.\" (Journal of Discourses, 11:201.)In today's world, instead of telling you to makebonnets, he might suggest you think carefully aboutwhat you really need in cars, and clothes, andrecreation, and houses, and vacations, and whatever else you will someday try to provide for your children. And he might point out that the difference in cost betweenwhat the world tells you is necessaryand what your children really needcould allow you the margin in timethat a father and a mother might need with their children to bring them home to theirHeavenly Father. Even the most frugal spending habits and the most careful planning for employment may not be enoughto ensure success, but it could be enough to allowyou the peace that comes from knowing you didthe best you could to provide and to nurture. There is another way we could plan to succeed tonight, despite the difficulties that might lie beforeus. The proclamation sets a high hurdle for us toclear when it describes our obligation to teach ourchildren. We are somehow to teach them so thatthey love one another and serve one another andkeep the commandments and are law-abiding citizens.If we think of good families who have not met thattest, and few meet it without some degree of failureover a generation or two, we could lose heart. We cannot control what others choose to do, and so we cannot force our children to heaven, but wecan determine what we will do. And we can decidetonight that we will do all we can to bring downthe powers of heaven into that family we want somuch to have forever. A key for us is in the proclamation in this sentence: \"Happiness in family life is most likely to be achievedwhen founded upon the teachings of the Lord JesusChrist.\" What could make it more likely that people in a family would love and serve one another, observethe commandments of God, and obey the law? It isnot simply teaching them the gospel. It is in theirhearing the word of God and then trying it in faith.If they do, their natures will be changed in a waythat produces the happiness we seek. From Moronithese words describe exactly how that change is thenatural fruit of living the gospel of Jesus Christ: \"And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 108 Think carefully about what you really need.commandments; and the fulfilling the command- ments bringeth remission of \"And and lowliness heart; and because of meekness andlowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the HolyGhost, which Comforter filleth with hope andperfect love, which love endureth by diligence untoprayer, until the end shall come, when all the saintsshall dwell with God\" (Moroni 8:25-26). When we prepare children for baptism, if we do it well, we prepare them for the process that will bringthe effects of the Atonement into their lives and thepowers of heaven into our home. Think of thechange we need. We need the Holy Ghost to fill uswith hope and perfect love, so that we can endureby diligence unto prayer. And then we can dwellforever with God in families. How can it come? Bythe simple promise Mormon described to his sonMoroni. Faith in Jesus Christ unto repentance andthen baptism by those with authority leads toremission of sins. And that produces meekness andlowliness of heart. And that in turn allows us tohave the companionship of the Holy Ghost, whichfills us with hope and perfect love. You know that is true; I know that is true from our own experience and from the experience of those inour families. We know that someday we could findon our bedspread, after a twenty-hour flight acrossthe world, a sign written in colors in a childish hand:\"You must be so tired! Lie down and relax! You'reback home where we'll take care of everything!\"And you could know that is more than talk if herolder sister had said in a phone call made at astopping place on that flight home, \"Oh, I'm justvacuuming the house.\" How does an eleven-year-old who has never flown across the sea know the effects of jet lag on hermother and father? How does a fifteen-year-olddecide to run a vacuum without being asked? Or howdoes a husband know the feelings of his wife, or awife the feelings of her husband, and so understandwithout being told, and then help without beingasked? Why does a niece give up her bed to an auntand a nephew share his house and dinner table?How does a son and a daughter-in-law find itpossible to take children into their already busyhome and act as if it were a blessing? It takes thepowers of heaven brought down by believing thesewords, and acting upon them:\"And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, andlowliness of heart; and because of meekness andlowliness cometh the visitation of the HolyGhost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfectlove, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer,until the end shall come, when all the saints shalldwell with God\" (v. 26). And may I add the words\"in families.\" The proclamation is careful in what it promises: \"happiness in family life is most likely to be achievedwhen founded upon the teachings of the Lord JesusChrist.\" My heart aches a little to know that manywho read those words will be surrounded by thosewho do not know or who deny the teachings ofJesus Christ. They can only do their best. But, theycan know this: their placement in a family, howeverchallenging, is known by a loving Heavenly Father.They can know that a way is prepared for them todo all that will be required for them to qualify foreternal life. They may not see how God could givethem that gift, nor with whom they will share it.Yet the promise of the gospel of Jesus Christ is sure: \"But learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace inthis world, and eternal life in the world to come. \"I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit beareth record. Amen\" (D&C 59:23-24). That peace will come from the assurance that the Atonement has worked in our lives and the hope ofeternal life that springs from it. The proclamation warns that for those who fail to respond the result will be more disastrous thansimply lack of peace in this life or absence ofhappiness. Here is the prophetic warning and thecall to action, with which the proclamation ends: \"We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who failto fulfill family responsibilities will one day standaccountable before God. Further, we warn that thedisintegration of the family will bring uponindividuals, communities, and nations the calamitiesforetold by ancient and modern prophets. \"We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measuresdesigned to maintain and strengthen the family asthe fundamental unit of society.\" The family unit is not only fundamental to society and to the Church but to our hope for eternal life. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTHEFAMILY : A P ROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD 109We begin to practice in the family, the smaller unit, what will spread to the Church and to the societyin which we live in this world, and then will bewhat we practice in families bound together foreverby covenants and by faithfulness. We can start nowto \"promote those measures designed to maintainand strengthen the family.\" I pray that we will. Ipray that you will ask, \"Father, how can I prepare?\"Tell him how much you want what it is that he wantsso much to give you. You will receive impressions,and if you act on them, I promise you the help ofthe powers of heaven. I testify that our Heavenly Father lives, that we lived with him as spirits, and that we would be lonelyliving anywhere but with him in the world to come.I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior, that he madepossible the changes in you and me that can give useternal life by suffering for the sins of all of us, hisspirit brothers and sisters, the children of hisHeavenly Father and our Heavenly Father. I testify that the Holy Ghost can fill us with hope and with perfect love. And I testify that the sealing power restored to Joseph Smith and now held by President Gordon B.Hinckley can bind us in families and give us eternallife, if we do all that we can do in faith. And I sotestify and express my love to you. In the name ofthe Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.

It is interesting to methat two of the Ten Commandments deal with this:'Thou shalt not commit adultery' and ABC's 'Nightline' program, is reported as sayingthe following to a group of students at DukeUniversity concerning slogans that were proposedto reduce drugs and immorality: \"'We have actually convinced ourselves that slogans will save us. . . .

In its purest form, truth is not apolite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach.What Moses brought down from Mount Sinai werenot The Ten Suggestions' (address given at Duke University, 10 May 1987).\"Think about that for a moment. What Mosesbrought down were Ten Commandments, writtenby the finger of Jehovah on tablets of stone for thesalvation and safety, for the security and happinessof the children of Israel and for all of the generationswhich were to come after them. \"Altogether too many men, leaving their wives at home in the morning and going to work, where theyfind attractively dressed and attractively made-upyoung women, regard themselves as young and hand-some and as an irr esistible catch. They complain that their wives do not look the same as they did twentyyears ago when they married them. To which I say,'Who would, after living with you for twenty years?' \"The tragedy is that some men are ensnared by their own foolishness and their own weakness.

It destroys self- discipline. It obliterates loyalty. Ittears up sacred covenants. It afflictsboth men and women. \"Too many who come to marriage have been coddledand spoiled and somehow led to feel that everythingmust be precisely right at all times, that life is a seriesof entertainments, that appetites are to be satisfiedwithout regard to principle.

McKay \"The sexual impurity of the world today is the result of the loss of true manhood through indulgence.Unchaste thoughts have bred unchaste words, andunchaste words, unchaste acts. In the teachings of theChurch, next to the crime of murder comes that ofadultery, and sexual unchastity. If the members of theChurch will remain true to their belief in chastity, andwill develop true manhood through practicing self-control in other ways, they will stand as beacon lightswhose rays will penetrate a sin-stained world\" (\"Christ,the Light of Humanity,\" Improvement Era, June 1968, 5). President Spencer W. Kimball \"It is not enough to refrain from adultery. We need to make the marriage relationship sacred, to sacrificeand work to maintain the warmth and respect whichwe enjoyed during courtship. God intended marriageto be eternal, sealed by the power of the priesthood,to last beyond the grave.

President Ezra Taft Benson \"Control your thoughts. No one steps into immorality in an instant. The first seeds of immorality are always sown in the mind.

If you are married, avoid being alone with members of the opposite sex whenever possible. Many of the tragedies of immorality begin when a man and woman are alone in the office or at church or drivingin a car. At first there may be no intent or eventhought of sin.

It is so much easier toavoid such circumstances from the start so thattemptation gets no chance for nourishment\" (\"Lawof Chastity,\" 51-52). President Gordon B.

Oaks \"The deceitfulness of riches can choke out the fruits of the gospel in many ways. A person who covetsthe wealth of another will suffer spiritually. A personwho has wealth and then loses it and becomesembittered and hateful is also a victim of thedeceitfulness of riches. \"Another victim is the person who becomes resentful of the wealth of the wicked. The prophet Jeremiahgave voice to the old question, 'Wherefore doth theway of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all theyhappy that deal very treacherously?' (Jeremiah 12:1.)Those who brood over the prosperity or seeminghappiness of the wicked put too much emphasis onmaterial things. They can be deceived because theirpriorities are too concentrated on worldly wealth. \"Another victim of the deceitfulness of riches is the person who consciously or unconsciously feels guilt athaving failed to acquire the property or prominencethe world credits as the indicia of success. \"Those who preach the gospel of success and the theology of prosperity are suffering from 'thedeceitfulness of riches' and from supposing that'gain is godliness' (1 Timothy 6:5).

Riches can be amongthe blessings that follow right behavior\u2014such asthe payment of tithing (Malachi 3:9-12)\u2014but richescan also be acquired through the luck of a prospectoror as the fruits of dishonesty\" ( Pure in Heart, 75-76).ONE FOR THE MONEY: GUIDE TO FAMILY FINANCE Elder Marvin J. Ashton Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Booklet In the welfare session of the April 1975 general conference, Elder Marvin J. Ashton, a member of theQuorum of the Twelve Apostles, delivered the addressfrom which this booklet is adapted. PresidentSpencer W. Kimball endorsed Elder Ashton's messagewhen in the same meeting he stood and said: \"I have been thinking of many things since we came to this meeting. I endorse what Brother Ashton has said. Ithink if I were starting with a young family, I would wantto get the twelve points explained by Brother Ashton andfollow them explicitly myself and teach my children andmy family and everybody with whom I came in contact.It is basic. All my life from childhood I have heard theBrethren saying, 'Get out of debt and stay out of debt.' Iwas employed for some years in the banks and I saw theterrible situation that many people were in because theyhad ignored that important counsel. \"I agree with all that Brother Ashton has said . . . with regard to family financing in the home. Every familyshould have a budget. Why, we would not think of goingone day without a budget in this Church or our businesses.We have to know approximately what we may receive,and we certainly must know what we are going to spend.And one of the successes of the Church would have to bethat the Brethren watch these things very carefully, andwe do not spend that which we do not have.\" Recently I had the opportunity to visit with a choice young couple. They were to be married within theweek. Their eyes sparkled in anticipation of theimportant event and with evidence of their contin-uing love for one another. Both had the advantagesof college education, good homes, and culturalexperiences. It was delightful to share their person-alities, plans, and potentials. Their courtship alreadyseemed appropriately launched on an eternal basis. During our interview, their responses to only one question gave me concern. I hope my anxieties and The possession of wealth or the acquisition of significant income is not a mark of heavenly favor, and their absence is not evidence of heavenly disfavor. \u2014Elder Dallin H. Oaks ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL115suggestions caused them to reassess their pending partnership. To the question, \"Who is going to manage the money in your marriage?\" she replied, \"He is, Iguess.\" He responded, \"We haven't talked about thatyet.\" These comments surprised and shocked me. How important are money management and finances in marriage and family affairs? May I respond,\"Tremendously.\" The American Bar Association hasindicated that 89 percent of all divorces can be tracedto quarrels and accusations over money. Othershave estimated that 75 percent of all divorces resultfrom clashes over finances. Some professionalcounselors indicate that four out of five families are strapped with serious money problems. May I at this time hasten to emphasize the fact that these marriage tragedies are not caused simply bylack of money, but rather by the mismanagement ofpersonal finances. A prospective wife could wellconcern herself not with the amount her husband-to-be can earn in a month, but rather with how he(and she) will manage the money that comes intotheir hands. Money management should takeprecedence over money productivity. A prospectivehusband who is engaged to a sweetheart who haseverything would do well to take yet another lookand see if she has money-management sense. In the home, money management between husband and wife should be on a partnership basis, with bothparties having a voice in decision- and policy-making.When children come along and reach the age ofaccountability, they too should be involved in moneyconcerns on a limited partnership basis. Peace,contentment, love, and security in the home are notpossible when financial anxieties and bickeringsprevail. Whether we are anticipating marriage or arewell into it, today is the time for all of us to reviewand repent as necessary to improve our moneymanagement skills and live within our means. As proper money management and living within one's means are essential in today's world if we areto live abundantly and happily, may I make somerecommendations for improved personal and familyfinancial management. The following twelve pointswill help each of us achieve this goal, I believe. Pay an Honest Tithing Successful financial management in every LDS homebegins with the payment of an honest tithe. If ourtithing and fast offerings are the first obligationsmet following the receipt of each paycheck, ourcommitment to this important gospel principle willbe strengthened and the likelihood of financialmismanagement will be reduced. Paying tithingpromptly to Him who does not come to check upeach month will teach us and our children to bemore honest with those physically closer at hand. Learn to Manage Money Before It Manages You A bride-to-be would do well to ask herself, \"Can my sweetheart manage money? Does he know how tolive within his means?\" These are more importantquestions than, \"Can he earn a lot of money?\"Financial peace of mind is not determined by howmuch we make, but is dependent upon how muchwe spend. New attitudes and relationships toward money should be developed constantly by all couples. After all, the partnership should be full and eternal.Management of family finances should be mutualbetween husband and wife in an attitude of opennessand trust. Control of the money by one spouse as asource of power and authority causes inequality inthe marriage and is inappropriate. Conversely, if amarriage partner voluntarily removes himself orherself entirely from family financial management,that is an abdication of necessary responsibility. Learn Self-Discipline and Self-Restraint in Money Matters Learning how to discipline oneself and exercise constraint where money is concerned can be moreimportant than courses in accounting. Young couplesshould recognize that they cannot immediatelymaintain the same spending patterns and life-styleas that to which they were accustomed as part oftheir parents' family. Married couples show genuinematurity when they think of their partner's and theirfamily's needs ahead of their own spending impulses.Money management skills should be learned togetherin a spirit of cooperation and love on a continuingbasis. A disgusted husband once said, \"I think thatin life money talks, but when my wife gets hold ofit, all it ever says is 'good-bye.'\" To the husbandwho says his wife is the poorest money manager inthe world, I would say, \"Look in the mirror andmeet the world's poorest teacher-trainer.\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFINANCES 116We live in a self-indulgent, me-oriented, materialistic society. Advertisements entice young buyers bydemonstrating how easy it is to get credit and buyon time. Interestingly, no ads focus on the glamourof paying the money back, nor do they mentionhow long or hard it is to do just that\u2014especiallywith the unavoidable interest added on. A debt-elimination calendar can help you reduce or eliminate unnecessary debt. Mark off several columnson a piece of paper. In the first column on the left,write the names of the months, beginning with theupcoming month. At the top of the next column,write the name of the creditor you want to pay offfirst. It may be the debt with the highest interestrate, or the earliest pay-off date. List the monthlypayment for that creditor until the loan is repaid asshown in the illustration above. At the top of thenext column, record the name of the secondcreditor you want to repay, and list payments dueeach month. After you have repaid the first creditor,add the amount of that monthly payment to yourpayment to the second creditor. (In the exampleabove, notice that the family finished makingmonthly payments on their credit card. They thenadded $110 to the department store's $70 payment,creating a new monthly payment of $180.)Continue the process until all loans are repaid. Use a Budget Every family must have a predetermined under-standing of how much money will be available eachmonth and the amount to be spent in each categoryof the family budget. Checkbooks facilitate familycash management and record keeping. Carefullyrecord each check when written and balance thecheckbook with the monthly bank statement. With the exception of buying a home, paying for education, or making other vital investments, avoiddebt and the resulting finance charges. Buy consumerdurables and vacations with cash.

Buy useditems until you have saved sufficiently to purchasequality new items. Purchasing poor-qualitymerchandise almost always ends up being veryexpensive. Save and invest a specific percentage of your income. Liquid savings available for emergencies should besufficient to cover at least three months of allessential family obligations. Every LDS family shouldfile honest and timely tax returns. Please listen carefully to this\u2014and if it makes some of you feel uncomfortable, it is on purpose: Latter-daySaints who ignore or avoid their creditors are entitledto feel the inner frustrations that such conductmerits, and they are not living as Latter-day Saintsshould! Bankruptcy should be avoided, except onlyunder the most unique and irreversible circumstances,and then utilized only after prayerful thought andthorough legal and financial consultation. A budget helps you plan and evaluate your expenditures. Budget for a specified period (such as weekly, biweekly, monthly), according to your pay schedule. Balance income with expenditures, and spend less than you earn. Teach Family Members Early the Importance of Working and Earning \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\" is not outdated counsel. It is basic to personal welfare.One of the greatest favors parents can do for theirchildren is to teach them to work. Much has beensaid over the years about children and monthlyallowances, and opinions and recommendationsvary greatly. I'm from the \"old school.\" I believechildren should earn their money needs throughservice and appropriate chores. Some financialrewards to children may also be tied to educationaleffort and the accomplishment of other worthwhilegoals. I think it is unfortunate for a child to growup in a home where the seed is planted in thechild's mind that there is a family money tree thatautomatically drops \"green stuff\" once a week oronce a month. Teach Children to Make Money Decisions in Keeping with Their Capacities toComprehend Based upon appropriate teaching and individual experience, children should be responsible for thefinancial decisions affecting their own money andsuffer the consequences of unwise spending. \"Saveyour money\" is a hollow pronouncement from aparent to a child. \"Save your money for a mission,bicycle, doll house, trousseau, or car\" makesunderstandable sense. Family unity comes fromsaving together for a common, jointly approvedpurpose. In our home we found it unifying to havea child save for a major project; then, when the amount was achieved, we matched it with apredetermined percentage. Incentives are a powerfulforce in motivating and achieving desired behavior.BUDGET FOR ______________ 19____ INCOME PLANNED ACTUAL Wages/Salaries (after taxes) Other income Total income EXPENDITURES PLANNED ACTUAL Church donations Savings Food Mortgage or rent Utilities Transportation Debt payments Insurance Medical Clothing Other Total Expenditures Income less expenditures ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFINANCES 118Teach Each Family Member to Contribute to the Total Family Welfare As children mature, they should understand the family financial position, budget and investmentgoals, and their individual responsibility within thefamily. Encourage inexpensive fun projects, under-standable to the children, that contribute to a familygoal or joy. Some families miss a tremendous financialand spiritual experience when they fail to sit together,preferably during family home evening, and eachput in his share of the monthly amount going tothe son or daughter, brother or sister, who is servingin the mission field. When this monthly activity isengaged in all at once, he or she becomes \"our\"missionary, with pride becoming a two-way street. Make Education a Continuing Process Complete as much formal, full-time education aspossible, including trade schools and apprenticeprograms. This is money well invested. Based onpotential lifetime earnings, the hours spent infurthering your education will be very valuableindeed. Use night school and correspondenceclasses to further prepare. Acquire some special skillor ability that could be used to avoid prolongedunemployment. The ability to do basic home andauto repairs can frequently be helpful, as well as a source of family savings. Periods of unexpectedunemployment can happen to anyone. We shouldnot allow ourselves, when we are out of work, to sitback and wait for \"our type of job\" if other honorableinterim employment becomes available. Work Toward Home Ownership Home ownership qualifies as an investment, notconsumption. Buy the type of home your incomewill support. Improve the home and beautify thelandscape throughout the period you occupy thepremises so that if you do sell it, you can use theaccumulated equity and potential capital gain toacquire a home more suitable to family needs. Appropriately Involve Yourself in an Insurance Program It is most important to have sufficient medical, automobile, and homeowner's insurance and anadequate life insurance program. Costs associatedwith illness, accident, and death may be so largethat uninsured families can be financially burdenedfor many years. Understand the Influence of External Forces on Family Finances and Investments Inflation continues to offset a major portion of average wage increases. A larger paycheck may notmean more purchasing power and should not be anexcuse for extravagant purchases or additional debt.Beyond the emergency liquid savings, families shouldplan for and utilize a wise investment programpreparing for financial security, possible disability,and retirement. Avoid all proposals for high-riskinvestments and get-rich-quick schemes. Appropriately Involve Yourself in a Food Storage and Emergency PreparednessProgram Accumulate your basic food storage and emergency supplies in a systematic and orderly way. Avoid goinginto debt for these purposes. Beware of unwise foodstorage promotional schemes. Planting and harvestinga garden annually is helpful to the family in manyways, including the food budget. Eat nutritiousfoods and exercise appropriately to improve health,thus avoiding many medical costs. These few points and suggestions are not intended to be all-inclusive or exhaustive. Rather, it is hopedthat a need has been brought to the surface for ourserious consideration. We need to recognize and beaware of these basic guidelines for wise moneymanagement. God help us to realize that money management is an important ingredient in proper personal welfare.Learning to live within our means should be acontinuing process. We need to work constantlytoward keeping ourselves free of financial difficulties.It is a happy day financially when time and interestare working for you and not against you. Money in the lives of Latter-day Saints should be used as a means of achieving eternal happiness.Careless and selfish uses cause us to live in financialbondage. We can't afford to neglect personal andfamily involvement in our money management.God will open the windows of heaven to us inthese matters if we will but live close to him andkeep his commandments. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFINANCES 119GREED, SELFISHNESS, AND OVERINDULGENCE Elder Joe J. Christensen Of the Presidency of the Seventy In Conference Report, Apr. 1999, 8-11; or Ensign, May 1999, 9-11 They say the gospel is to comfort the afflicted andto afflict the comforted. My purpose today is tospeak to the comforted: the rich, the poor, and allof us in between. The Lord has said, \"Wo unto you rich men, . . . for your riches will canker your souls.\" He has alsosaid, \"Wo unto you whose hearts are notbroken, . . . [and] whose eyes are full ofgreediness.\" 1 Many of you probably have heard this little prayersomebody wrote: \"Dear God,\"So far today I have done all right. I haven't gossiped, haven't lost my temper, haven't been greedy, grumpy,nasty, selfish, or overly indulgent. But in a fewminutes, Lord, I am going to get out of bed, andfrom then on, I am probably going to need a lotmore help.\" When it comes to overcoming being greedy, selfish, and overly indulgent, we all need a lot more help.In his candid manner, President Brigham Youngsaid: \"The worst fear . . . I have about this people isthat they will get rich in this country, forget Godand His people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church. . . . My greater fear . . . is that theycannot stand wealth.\" 2 Our prosperity brings some real challenges becausemany are getting rich, more of us are waxing fat, andas a result of greed, selfishness, and overindulgence,we could lose the Spirit and literally kick ourselvesout of the Church. Materialism Consuming Our Thoughts Money and material things are on the minds ofalmost everyone. As Morris Chalfant wrote: \"Thegreat [question] of the twentieth century is[,] 'Howcan I acquire wealth?' No question occupies a largerplace in the minds . . This is true of men in everystation and in every walk of life.\" 3 Money in and of itself is not an evil, but as Paultaught Timothy, it is the love of money that is theroot of all evil. 4There are some of the wealthy who deal with their prosperity very well, using theirresources to bless others and build the kingdom. For many, however, wealth presents major difficulties. As we deal with the materialism that threatens us, here are four suggestions for each of us to consider. Wants Are Not Needs First, we should not confuse wants with needs. My mother taught me an important lesson along these lines. For many years my father had a practiceof trading for a new car every year. Then shortlyafter World War II when grain prices increased, wewere surprised one day when Dad drove home in a more expensive car. One morning my mother asked, \"How much more did the new car cost than the other one?\" When Dad told her, my mother said, \"Well, the other car has always been able to get me where Ineed to go. I think we ought to give the differenceto someone who needs it more than we do.\" And so it was. The next year Dad returned to the less-expensive cars, and they continued theirgenerous ways. If we are not careful, it is easy for our wants to become needs. Remember the line \"There, there,little luxury, don't you cry. You'll be a necessity byand by.\" Avoid Spoiling Children Second, we should avoid spoiling children by givingthem too much. In our day many children grow up with distorted values because we as parents overindulge them.Whether you are well-to-do or, like most of us, ofmore modest means, we as parents often attempt to provide children with almost everything theywant, thus taking away from them the blessing ofanticipating, of longing for something they do nothave. One of the most important things we canteach our children is to deny themselves. Instant ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFINANCES 120gratification generally makes for weak people. How many truly great individuals do you know whonever had to struggle? Elder Maxwell has voiced this concern when he said: \"A few of our wonderful youth and youngadults in the Church are unstretched. They havealmost a free pass. Perks are provided, includingcars complete with fuel and insurance\u2014all paid forby parents who sometimes listen in vain for a fewcourteous and appreciative words. What is thus takenfor granted . . . tends to underwrite selfishness anda sense of entitlement.\" 5 A wise young mother said: \"I choose not to give ourchildren what I can afford to give them. I hold backfor their sake.\" In the words of Fred Gosman, \"Children who always get what they want will want as long as they live.\" 6 And somewhere along the line it is important forthe character development of our children to learnthat \"the earth still revolves around the sun\" and notaround them. 7Rather, we should train our children to ask themselves the question, How is the world a better place because they are in it? We live in a world of entertainment in full color with a lot of fast action, a world in which manychildren grow up thinking that if it isn't fun, it isboring and not worthwhile. Even in familyactivities, we need to strike a balance between playand work. Some of my most memorable experienceswhile growing up centered around family activities:learning how to shingle a roof, build a fence, orworking in the garden. Rather than being all workand no play, for many of our children it is almostall play and very little work. As a consequence of overindulgence, many children leave homes ill-prepared to meet the real world.President Hinckley said: \"Of course, weneed to earn a living. The Lord toldAdam that in the sweat of his faceshould he eat bread all the days of hislife. It is important that we qualifyourselves to be self-reliant, particularlythat every young man at the time ofmarriage be ready and able to assumethe responsibilities of providing for hiscompanion and for the children whomay come to that home.\" 8 All too many enter marriage who have never learnedto cook, sew, or develop other important life skills.Ignorance of these needed skills, along with the lackof understanding of the management of money, sowthe seeds for many failures in our children's marriages. I fear that in many cases we are rearing children who are slaves to expensive fads and fashions. Rememberthe scripture \"For where your treasure is, there willyour heart be also.\" 9How do we determine where our treasure is? To do so, we need to evaluate theamount of time, money, and thought we devote tosomething. Might it not be well to evaluate howmuch focus we place on shopping and spending? This does not mean that our children should not dress in some of the appropriate clothing that is infashion because that can be very important to them.But they don't need a closet full. As members of theChurch, we have a responsibility to present ourselvesin a well-groomed, attractive, and modest manner.With good planning, this can be done without beingdriven to spend extravagantly on our clothing. More than 10 times the prophets in the Book of Mormon warn us about the problems of priderelated to the nature of our clothing. Here is oneexample of them: \"And it came to pass . . . that thepeople of the church began to wax proud, becauseof their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, andtheir fine-twined linen. . . . In all these things werethey lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for theybegan to wear very costly apparel.\" 10 We would do well if in all these areas of materialthings we and our children would follow the oft-quoted motto of our pioneer forebears to \"fix it up,wear it out, make it do, or do without.\" Live Modestly and Avoid Debt Third, as we have heard so often, live modestly andavoid debt as if it were a plague. President Hinckley recently remindedus of President Heber J. Grant'sstatement: \"'If there is any one thingthat will bring peace and contentmentinto the human heart, and into thefamily, it is to live within our means. And if there is any one thing that isgrinding and discouraging anddisheartening, it is to have debts and obligations that one cannot meet.' ( Gospel Standards, comp. G. Homer Durham [1941], 111).\" 11 ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFINANCES 121 As a consequence of overindulgence, many children leave homes ill-prepared to meet the real world.Samuel Johnson said, \"Do not accustom yourself to consider debt as an inconvenience, you will find it[to be] a calamity.\" How much house do we really need to accommodate our family comfortably? We should not endangerourselves either spiritually or economically byacquiring homes which are ostentatious, feed ourvanity, and go far beyond our needs. If we are to be self-reliant and in a position to share, obviously we must acquire some resources. If welive within our means and avoid debt, resources canbe accumulated. There are those with averageincomes who, over a lifetime, do amass some means,and there are those who receive large salaries whodo not. What is the difference? It is simply spendingless than they receive, saving along the way, andtaking advantage of the power of compound interest. Financial consultants indicate that \"most people have it all wrong about wealth. . . . Wealth is notthe same as income. If you make a good incomeeach year and spend it all, you are not gettingwealthier. You are just living high. Wealth is whatyou accumulate, not what you spend.\" 12 Give Generously to Others Finally, be generous in giving and sharing with others. The more our hearts and minds are turned to assisting others less fortunate than we, the more wewill avoid the spiritually cankering effects that resultfrom greed, selfishness, and overindulgence. Ourresources are a stewardship, not our possessions. Iam confident that we will literally be called upon tomake an accounting before God concerning how wehave used them to bless lives and build the kingdom. The prophet Jacob provides us with some excellent counsel about how riches can be acquired and forwhat they should be used: \"But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God. \"And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them . . . for theintent to do good\u2014to clothe the naked, and to feedthe hungry, and to liberate the captive, andadminister relief to the sick and the afflicted.\" 13 In addition to paying an honest tithing, we shouldbe generous in assisting the poor. How much shouldwe give? I appreciate the thought of C. S. Lewis onthis subject. He said: \"I am afraid the only safe ruleis to give more than we can spare. . . . If our charitiesdo not at all pinch or hamper us, . . . they are toosmall. There ought to be things we should like to doand cannot do because our charitable expendituresexcludes them.\" 14 There are many worthy individuals and causes to which we might contribute. We should givegenerously to the fast offering and humanitarianfunds of the Church. And if we desire our familiesto live lives of depth and meaning, we must havethe courage to examine honestly where ourtreasures lie and avoid the pitfalls that result fromgreed, selfishness, and overindulgence. Let us each remember: First: Not to confuse wants with needs. Second: Avoid spoiling our children. Third: Live modestly and avoid debt. Fourth: Be generous in giving to others. Giving really is at the heart of our faith. At this Easter time, we again commemorate that \"God [ourHeavenly Father] so loved the world, that he gavehis only begotten Son,\" 15who came to the earth and could have possessed any material thing but ratherchose to give to all of us an example of a simple lifefree from any shade of greed, selfishness, oroverindulgence. May we strive daily to live morelike He lived, the ultimate example of a life ofdepth and meaning. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, this is His Church led by living prophets, and His tomb was literallyempty on that third day. In the name of JesusChrist, amen. Notes 1.

Elder Richard G. Scott \"The most important principle I can share: Anchor your life in Jesus Christ, your Redeemer. Make yourEternal Father and His Beloved Son the most important priority in your life\u2014more importantthan life itself, more important than a belovedcompanion or children or anyone on earth.

THE CONSTITUTION FOR A PERFECT LIFE President Harold B. Lee President of the ChurchStand Ye in Holy Places: Selected Sermons and Writings of PresidentHarold B. Lee, 341-48 You want to know the \"steps\" by which one canhave his life patterned to that fulness which makes him a worthy citizen or \"saint\" in God's kingdom.The best answer may be found by a study of the lifeof Jesus in the scriptures, for it has been said that\"our gospels are not merely the record of oralteachings; they are the portraits of a living man.\"(Dean Inge.) Christ came not only into the world tomake an atonement for the sins of mankind, but toset an example before the world of the standard ofperfection of God's law and of obedience to theFather. In His Sermon on the Mount the Master hasgiven us somewhat of a revelation of His owncharacter, which was perfect, or what might be saidto be \"an autobiography, every syllable of which Hehad written down in deeds,\" and in so doing hasgiven us a blueprint for our own lives. Anyoneclearly understanding the true import of His wordscomes to the realization that an unworthy memberof the Church, although he might be in thekingdom of God, yet would not be of the kingdombecause of his unworthiness. You may know you are living a full, rich life when you have the real joy of living, for \"men are, thatthey might have joy.\" (2 Nephi 2:25.) What is it,then, that gives you that high emotional ecstasycalled joy? Does it come from the unusual or does itcome from common things? He who is moved thusonly by the unusual is as one who must flag a failingappetite with strong spices and flavorings that destroythe true sense of taste. You are making a seriouserror if you mistake an emotional thrill that passeswith the moment for the upsurge of deep feelingsthat is the joy of living. If one feels strong surgesof happiness and desire from the quiet of a happyhome, from the unfolding of a beautiful life, fromthe revelation of divine wisdom, or from a love forthe beautiful, the true and good, he is having a tasteof the fulness of the joy that the living of a rich,full life only can bring. In that matchless Sermon on the Mount, Jesus has given us eight distinct ways by which we mightreceive this kind of joy. Each of His declarations isbegun by the word \"blessed.\" Blessedness is definedas being higher than happiness. \"Happiness comesfrom without and is dependent on circumstances;blessedness is an inward fountain of joy in the soulitself, which no outward circumstances can seriouslyaffect.\" (Dummelow's Commentary.) These declarationsof the Master are known in the literature of theChristian world as the Beatitudes and have beenreferred to by Bible commentators as the preparationnecessary for entrance into the kingdom of heaven.For the purposes of this discussion may I speak ofthem as something more than that as they areapplied to you and me. They embody, in fact, theconstitution for a perfect life. Make your Eternal Father and His Beloved Son the most important priority in your life. \u2014Elder Richard G. Scott ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL124Let us consider them for a few moments. Four of them have to do with our individual selves, theliving of our own inner, personal lives, if we would beperfect and find the blessedness of that inward joy. Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are they that mourn.Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.Blessed are the pure in heart. To be poor in spirit is to feel yourselves as the spiritually needy, even dependent upon the Lordfor your clothes, your food, the air you breathe,your health, your life; realizing that no day shouldpass without fer vent prayer of thanksgiving, for guidance and forgiveness and strength sufficient for each day's need. If a youth realizes his spiritual need, when in dangerous places where his very lifeis at stake, he may be drawn close to the fountainof truth and be prompted by the Spirit of the Lordin his hour of gr eatest trial. It is indeed a sad thing for one, because of his wealth or learning or worldly position, to think himself independent of thisspiritual need. It is the opposite of pride or self- conceit. To the worldly rich it is that \"he must possess his wealth as if he possessed it not\" and bewilling to say without regret, if he were suddenly to meet financial disaster, as did Job, \"the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the nameof the Lord.\" (Job 1:21.) Thus, if in your humilityyou sense your spiritual need, you are made readyfor adoption into the \"church of the Firstborn,\"and to become \"the elect of God.\" To mourn, as the Master's lesson here would teach, one must show that \"godly sorrow that workethrepentance\" (2 Corinthians 7:10) and wins for thepenitent a forgiveness of sins and forbids a returnto the deeds of which he mourns. It is to see, as didthe Apostle Paul, \"glory in must be willing \"to one another's they may be light.\" (Mosiah 18:8.) You must bewilling to mourn with those that mourn, and comfortthose that stand in need of comfort. (Mosiah 18:9.)When a mother mourns in her loneliness for thereturn of a wayward daughter, you with compassionmust forbid the casting of the first stone. It is thekind of mourning portrayed in the deep feelings ofthe marine on Saipan who wrote to us during WorldWar II when his buddy was killed, \"As I lay in myfoxhole that night I wept bitterly.\" Your mourningwith the aged, the widow, and the orphan shouldlead you to bring the succor they require. In aword, you must be as the publican and not as thePharisee. \"God be merciful to me a sinner.\" (Luke18:13.) Your reward for so doing is the blessednessof comfort for your own soul through a forgivenessof your own sins. Did you ever hunger for food or thirst for water when just a crust of stale bread or a sip of tepid water toease the pangs that distressed you would seem to bethe most prized of all possessions? If you have sohungered, then you may begin to understand howthe Master meant we should hunger and thirst afterrighteousness. It's that hungering and thirsting thatleads Latter-day Saints away from home to seek thefellowship with Saints in sacrament services andthat induces worship on the Lord's day. It is thatwhich prompts fervent prayers and leads our feet toholy temples and bids us be reverent therein. Onewho keeps the Sabbath Day will be filled with alasting joy far more to be desired than the fleetingpleasures derived from activities indulged incontrary to God's commandments. If you ask with\"a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith inChrist, he will manifest . . . truth . unto you, bythe of the Holy Ghost,\" and by its power you\"may know the truth of all things.\" (Moroni 10:4-5.)Build \"each temple nobler than tillthou at length are free,\" then \"your whole bodiesshall be filled with light, and there shall be nodarkness in you. . . .\" (D&C 88:67.) If you would see God, you must be pure. There is in Jewish writings the story of a man who saw an objectin the distance, an object that he thought was a beast.As it drew nearer he could perceive it was a man; asit came still closer he saw it was his friend. You cansee only that which you have eyes to see. Some of theassociates of Jesus saw Him only as a son of Joseph thecarpenter. Others thought Him to be a winebibber ora drunkard because of His words. Still others thoughtHe was possessed of devils. Only the righteous sawHim as the Son of God. Only if you are the pure inheart will you see God, and also in a lesser degree willyou be able to see the \"God\" or good in man andlove him because of the goodness you see in him.Mark well that person who criticizes and malignsthe man of God or the Lord's anointed leaders inHis Church. Such a one speaks from an impure heart. But in order to gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven we must not only be good, but we are also ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 125required to do good and be good for something. So if you would walk daily toward that goal of perfectionand fulness of life, you must be schooled by theremaining four articles in the Master's constitutionfor a perfect life. These beatitudes have to do withman's social relations with others: Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the merciful.Blessed are the peacemakers.Blessed are they which are persecuted. A meek man is defined as one who is not easily provoked or irritated and is forbearing under injuryor annoyance. The meek man is the strong, themighty, the man of complete self-mastery. He is theone who has the courage of his moral convictions,despite the pressure of the gang or the club. Incontroversy his judgment is the court of last resortand his sobered counsel quells the rashness of themob. He is humble-minded; he does not bluster.\"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty.. . .\" (Proverbs 16:32.) He is a natural leader and isthe chosen of army and navy, business and church,to lead where other men follow. He is the \"salt\" ofthe earth and shall inherit it. Our salvation rests upon the mercy we show to others. Unkind and cruel words, or wanton acts of crueltytoward man or beast, even though in seemingretaliation, disqualify the perpetrator in his claimsfor mercy when he has need of mercy in the day ofjudgment before earthly or heavenly tribunals. Isthere one who has never been wounded by theslander of another whom he thought to be his friend?Do you remember the struggle you had to refrainfrom retribution? Blessed are all you who aremerciful, for you shall obtain mercy! Peacemakers shall be called the children of God. The trouble-maker, the striker against law and order, theleader of the mob, the law-breaker are prompted bymotives of evil; and unless they desist, they will beknown as the children of Satan rather than God.Withhold yourselves from him who would causedisquieting doubts by making light of sacred things,for he seeks not for peace but to spread confusion.That one who is quarrelsome or contentious, andwhose arguments are for other purposes than toresolve the truth, is violating a fundamental principlelaid down by the Master as an essential in thebuilding of a full rich life. \"Peace and goodwill tomen on earth\" was the angel song that heralded thebirth of the Prince of Peace. To be persecuted for righteousness' sake in a great cause where truth and virtue and honor are at stakeis God-like. Always there have been martyrs to everygreat cause. The great harm that may come frompersecution is not from the persecution itself butfrom the possible effect it may have upon thepersecuted who may thereby be deterred in their zealfor the righteousness of their cause. Much of thatpersecution comes from lack of understanding, formen are prone to oppose that which they do notcomprehend. Some of it comes from men intentupon evil. But from whatever cause, persecutionseems to be so universal against those engaged in arighteous cause that the Master warns us, \"Woe untoyou, when all men shall speak well of you! for sodid their fathers to the false prophets.\" (Luke 6:26.) May youth everywhere remember that warning when you are hissed and scoffed at because you refuse tocompromise your standards of abstinence, honesty,and morality in order to win the applause of thecrowd. If you stand firmly for the right, despite thejeers of the crowd or even physical violence, youshall be crowned with the blessedness of eternal joy.Who knows but that again in our day some of thesaints or even apostles, as in former days, may berequired to give their lives in defense of the truth. Ifthat time should come, God grant they will not fail. Gradually as we ponder prayerfully all these teachings, we will make what may be to some thestartling discovery that after all, God's measure ofour worth in His kingdom will not be the highpositions we have held here among man, nor in Hischurch, nor the honors we have won, but rather thelives we have led and the good we have done,according to the \"constitution for a perfect life\"revealed in the life of the Son of God. May you make the Beatitudes the constitution of your own lives and thus receive the blessednesspromised therein. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 126CORNERSTONES OF A HAPPY HOME President Gordon B. Hinckley Second Counselor in the First Presidency Satellite broadcast fireside for husbands and wives, 29 Jan. 1984 More than half a century has passed, but I have neverforgotten my father's tenderness toward my mother.She died when she was fifty, a relatively youngwoman. During the months of her illness he wasconstantly solicitous for her comfort. But this attitudewas not expressed only after she became ill. It hadbeen evident to us, their children, throughout ourlives. In the happy home of our childhood, weknew\u2014and that came of a feeling and not of anydeclaration\u2014that they loved, respected, and honoredone another. What a blessing that image has been.When we were children we felt a certain securitybecause of it. As we grew older our thoughts and ouractions were colored by that remembered example. My own beloved companion and I have now been married for nearly half a century\u2014forty-seven yearsto be exact. She too was blessed to come from a home where there was an environment ofcompanionship, love, and trust. I know that mostof you have come out of such homes; further, I knowthat most of you live in happiness and love in yourown homes. But there are many, very many, whodo otherwise. Troubled Marriages It is difficult for me to understand the tragic accountsof troubled marriages that come to me. They speakof abuse. They speak of dictatorial attitudes and ofsome husbands who are bullies in their own homes.They speak of violations of trust and of brokencovenants. They speak of divorce and tears andheartache. Only the other day a letter came to mydesk from a woman who wrote at length of hertroubles. In a spirit of desperation she asked, \"Doesa woman have any promise of some day being a firstclass member of the human race? Will she alwaysbe a piece of chattel wrapped in a chuddar actingonly by the permission of the man who stands ather head?\" (A chuddar, incidentally, is a very simpleshawl worn by women in India.) She then continued,\"To me the answers to these questions are no longerimportant, but I have daughters. If it is possible fora woman to look forward to an eternity of anythingother than being barefoot and pregnant, I wouldlike to be able to teach them this.\" There is bitter tragedy in the lines of that letter. I fear there are many others who may feel that way.The situation is tragic because it is so extremelydifferent from what our Father in Heaven wouldhave for his daughters. Behind this woman's wordsI see the picture of a wife who is discouraged,starved for appreciation, ready to give up, and notknowing which way to turn. I see a husband who hasdefaulted on his sacred obligations, who is callousedin his feelings and warped in his perceptions, andwho denies through his manner of living the veryessence of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I do not doubtthat there has been fault on her part as well as his,but I am inclined to think that his is the more serious. Equality in Marriage To men within the sound of my voice, whereveryou may be, I say, if you are guilty of demeaningbehavior toward your wife, if you are prone todictate and exercise authority over her, if you areselfish and brutal in your actions in the home, thenstop it! Repent! Repent now while you have theopportunity to do so. To you wives who are constantly complaining and see only the dark side of life, and feel that you areunloved and unwanted, look into your own heartsand minds. If there is something wrong, turn about.Put a smile on your faces. Make yourselves attractive.Brighten your outlook. You deny yourselves happinessand court misery if you constantly complain and donothing to rectify your own faults. Rise above theshrill clamor over rights and prerogatives, and walkin the quiet dignity of a daughter of God. The time has come for all of us to put the past behind us in a spirit of repentance and live thegospel with new dedication. The time is now forhusbands and wives who may have offended oneanother to ask forgiveness and resolve to cultivaterespect and affection one for another, standingbefore the Creator as sons and daughters worthy ofhis smile upon us. I should like to read words of the Lord, with a slight modification that does not alter the meaning. Saidhe: \"He which made them at the beginning made ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 127them male and female, . . . For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave tohis wife: and they twain shall be one. are no more twain, but one\" (Matthew 19:4-6). God our Eternal Father ordained that we should becompanions. That implies equality. Marriage is a jointventure. Of course, there are hazards and problems,but these are secondary to the greater opportunitiesand greater satisfactions that come of sublimatingselfish interests to the good of the partnership. Some years ago I clipped from the Deseret News a column by Jenkin Lloyd Jones, who said, in part: \"There seems to be a superstition among manythousands of our young who hold hands . . . in thedrive-ins that marriage is a cottage surrounded byperpetual hollyhocks, to which a perpetually youngand handsome husband comes home to a perpetuallyyoung and beautiful wife. When the hollyhockswither and boredom and bills appear, the divorcecourts are jammed. . . . Life is like an old-time railjourney\u2014delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders,and jolts interspersed only occasionally by beautifulvistas and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is tothank the Lord for letting you have the ride.\" The trick, my brethren and sisters is to enjoy the journey, traveling hand in hand, in sunshine andstorm, as companions who love one another. Anyonecan do it with a disciplined effort to live the gospel.Remember, \"Except the Lord build the house, theylabour in vain that build it\" (Psalm 127:1). Four Cornerstones At the risk of repeating some things I have saidbefore, I should like to suggest four cornerstones on which to establish and nurtureyour homes. I do not hesitate topromise that if you will do so, yourlives will be enriched and be fruitfulof great good, and your joy will beeverlasting. 1. Mutual Respect The first of these I choose to call mutual respect. Each of us is an individual. Each of us is different. There must be respect for those differences, andwhile it is important and necessary that both thehusband and the wife strive to ameliorate thosedifferences, there must be some recognition that theyexist and that they are not necessarily undesirable.There must be respect one for another, notwith-standing such differences. In fact, the differencesmay make the companionship more interesting. I have long felt that happiness in marriage is not so much a matter of romance as it is an anxiousconcern for the comfort and well-being of one'scompanion. That involves a willingness to overlookweaknesses and mistakes. One man has said, \"Love is not blind\u2014it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to seeless\" (Julius Gordon, Treasure Chest, ed. Charles L. Wallis [New York: Harper and Row, 1965], p. 168). Many of us need to stop looking for faults and begin to look for virtues. Booth Tarkington once remarkedthat \"an ideal wife is any woman who has an idealhusband\" (Looking Forward and Others [Garden City, N.Y.: Page and Co., 1926], p. 97). Unfortunately, somewomen want to remake their husbands after their owndesign. Some husbands regard it as their prerogativeto compel their wives to fit their standards of whatthey think to be the ideal. It never works. It onlyleads to contention, misunderstanding, and sorrow. There must be respect for the interests of one another. There must be opportunities and encouragementfor the development and expression of individualtalent. Any man who denies his wife the time andthe encouragement to develop her talents, denieshimself and his children a blessing which couldgrace their home and bless their posterity. It is commonplace with us to say that we are sons and daughters of God. There is no basis in thegospel for inferiority or superiority as between the husband and wife. Do you think that God our Eternal Father loves hisdaughters less than he loves his sons?No man can demean or belittle his wifeas a daughter of God without givingoffense to her Father in Heaven. I am offended by the sophistry that the only lot of the Latter-day Saint womanis to be barefoot and pr egnant. It's a clever phrase, but it's false. Of course we believe in children. The Lord has told us to multiplyand replenish the earth that we might have joy in our posterity, and there is no greater joy than thejoy that comes of happy children in good families.But he did not designate the number, nor has theChurch. That is a sacred matter left to the couple ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 128 There is no basis in the gospel for inferiority or superiority as between the husband and wife.and the Lord. The official statement of the Church includes this language: \"Husbands must beconsiderate of their wives, who have the greaterresponsibility not only of bearing children but ofcaring for them through childhood, and should helpthem conserve their health and strength. Marriedcouples should exercise self-control in all of theirrelationships. They should seek inspiration from theLord in meeting their marital challenges and rearingtheir children according to the teachings of thegospel\" (General Handbook of Instructions [1983], p. 77). Husbands, wives, respect one another. Live worthyof the respect of one another. Cultivate that kind ofrespect which expresses itself in kindness, forbearance,patience, forgiveness, true affection, withoutofficiousness and without show of authority. 2. The Soft Answer I pass now to the second cornerstone. For want of a better name I call it the soft answer. The writer of Proverbs long ago declared, \"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stirup anger\" (Proverbs 15:1). I hear so many complaints from men and women that they cannot communicate with one another.Perhaps I am naive, but I do not understand this. Communication is essentially a matter ofconversation. They must have communicated whenthey were courting. Can they not continue to speaktogether after marriage? Can they not discuss withone another in an open and frank and candid andhappy way their interests, their problems, theirchallenges, their desires? It seems to me that communication is essentially a matter of talking with one another. Let that talkbe quiet for quiet talk is the language of love. It isthe language of peace. It is the language of God. Itis when we raise our voices that tiny mole hills ofdifference become mountains of conflict. It seems to me that there is something significant in the description of Elijah's contest with the priests ofBaal: \"A great and strong wind rent the mountains,and brake in pieces the rocks.\" That is a rather vividdescription of some of the arguments that take placebetween husbands and wives but, notes the writerof the scripture, \"The Lord was not in the wind:and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord wasnot in the earthquake: And after the earthquake afire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after thefire a still small voice\" (1 Kings 19:11-12). Thevoice of heaven is a still small voice. The voice ofpeace in the home is a quiet voice. There is need for much discipline in marriage, not of one's companion but of one's self. Husbands, wives,remember, \"He [or she] that is slow to anger is betterthan the mighty\" (Proverbs 16:32). Cultivate the artof the soft answer. It will bless your homes, it willbless your lives, it will bless your companionships,it will bless your children. 3. Financial Honesty Cornerstone number three is financial honesty. I am satisfied that money is the root of more troublein marriage than all other causes combined. I am confident that there is no better discipline nor one more fruitful with blessings in the handling ofour resources than obedience to the commandmentgiven to ancient Israel through the Prophet Malachi,\"Bring ye all the tithes into andprove saith the Lord of hosts, if Iwill not open you the windows of heaven, and pouryou out a blessing, that there shall not be roomenough to receive it\" (Malachi 3:10). Those who livehonestly with God are more likely to live honestlywith one another and their associates. Further, asthey budget for their tithes and offerings they willcultivate a discipline in the handling of theirresources. We live in an age of persuasive advertising and of skillful salesmanship, all designed to entice us to spend. An extravagant husband or wife canjeopardize any marriage. I think it is a good principlethat each have some freedom and independencewith everyday, necessary expenditures, while at thesame time always discussing and consulting andagreeing on large expenditures. There would befewer rash decisions, fewer unwise investments,fewer consequent losses, fewer bankruptcies ifhusbands and wives would counsel together onsuch matters and unitedly seek counsel from others. Live honestly with the Lord. Live honestly with one another as companions. Live honestly with others.Make timely payment of obligations a cardinalprinciple of your lives. Consult with one anotherand be united in your decisions. The Lord will blessyou as you do so. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 1294. Family Prayer The final cornerstone on which to build your home is family prayer. I know of no other practice that will have so salutary an effect upon your lives as will the practice ofkneeling together in prayer. The very words, OurFather in Heaven, have a tremendous effect. Youcannot speak them with sincerity and withrecognition without having some feeling ofaccountability to God. The little storms that seem to afflict every marriage become of smallconsequence while kneeling before the Lord andaddressing him as a suppliant son and daughter. Your daily conversations with him will bring peace into your hearts and a joy into your lives that cancome from no other source. Your companionship willsweeten through the years. Your love will strengthen.Your appreciation one for another will grow. Your children will be blessed with a sense of security that comes of living in a home where dwells theSpirit of God. They will know and love parents whorespect one another, and a spirit of respect willgrow in their own hearts. They will experience thesecurity of kind words quietly spoken. They will besheltered by a father and mother who, livinghonestly with God, live honestly with one anotherand with their fellowmen. They will mature with asense of appreciation, having heard their parents inprayer express gratitude for blessings great andsmall. They will grow with faith in the living God. Your companionship will be one that will sweeten and strengthen through the years and that willendure through eternity. Your love and appreciationfor one another will increase. . . . God bless you, my brethren and sisters, husbands and wives, joined together as appreciative companionsin sacred covenants of marriage, for time andeternity, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.CULTIVATING DIVINE ATTRIBUTES Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1998, 31-34; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 25-28 As Latter-day Saints, all things, we hopeall things. . . . If there is anything virtuous, lovely,or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek afterthese things.\" 6What do we believe that will motivate us to move forward? What do we hopefor? What are the virtuous, lovely, or praiseworthythings we should seek after? I believe we shouldstrive to develop within ourselves the traits of thecharacter of the Savior. Faith, Hope, and Charity The words of the Apostle Paul come to mind: \"Andnow abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; butthe greatest of these is charity.\" 7These divine attributes should become fixed in our hearts andminds to guide us in all of our actions. We read inMoroni: \"Cleave unto charity, which is the greatestof all. . . . Whoso is found possessed of it at the lastday, it shall be well with him.\" 8Charity can be the outward expression of faith and hope. If sought andobtained, these three foundation elements ofcelestial character will abide with us in this life andbeyond the veil into the next life. Remember thatthe \"same spirit which doth possess your bodies atthe time that [you] go out of this life . . . will havepower to possess your body in [the] eternal world.\" 9 We should not wait a single day to intensify ourpersonal efforts to strengthen these virtuous, lovely,and praiseworthy attributes. When we keep the Lord's commandments, faith, hope, and charity abide with us. These virtues\"distil upon [our] soul as the dews from heaven,\" 10 and we prepare ourselves to stand with confidencebefore our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, \"withoutblemish and without spot.\" 11 As I read and ponder the scriptures, I see thatdeveloping faith, hope, and charity within ourselvesis a step-by-step process. Faith begets hope, andtogether they foster charity. We read in Moroni, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 130\"Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there mustbe hope there must also be charity.\" 12These three virtues may be sequential initially, but once obtained,they become interdependent. Each one is incompletewithout the others. They support and reinforce eachother. Moroni explained, \"And except ye have charityye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God;neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if yehave not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.\" 13 These are the virtuous, lovely, praiseworthycharacteristics we seek. We all are familiar withPaul's teaching that \"charity never faileth.\" 14 Certainly we need unfailing spiritual strength inour lives. Moroni recorded the revelation \"thatfaith, hope and charity bringeth [us] unto [theLord]\u2014the fountain of all righteousness.\" 15 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, therestored Church of the Lord on the earth today, guidesus to the Savior and helps us develop, nurture, andstrengthen these divine attributes. In fact, Herevealed the qualifications required to labor in Hisservice in these words: \"No one can assist in thiswork except he shall be humble and full of love,having faith, hope, and charity.\" 16 Mormon taught that \"charity is the pure love ofChrist\" and exhorted us to \"pray unto the Fatherwith all the energy of heart, that [we] may be filledwith this love, which he hath bestowed upon allwho are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.\" 17 Note that charity is given only to those who seek it,only to those who earnestly pray for it, only tothose who are disciples of Christ. Before we can befilled with this pure love, we must start at thebeginning with the first principle of the gospel. Wemust have \"first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\" 18 Faith \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"19\"Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if [we] havefaith [we] hope for things which are not seen,which are true.\" 20Latter-day Saints can rejoice in the strength of our faith because we have the fulnessof the gospel. If we study, ponder, and pray, our faithin the unseen but true things of God will grow.Even if we start with only \"a particle of faith, . . .even if [we] can no more than desire to believe,\" 21 with nurturing attention a tiny seed of faith cangrow into a vibrant, strong, fruitful tree of testimony.Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ motivates us to repent.Through repentance, made possible by the Lord'sAtonement, we can feel the calming peace offorgiveness for our sins, weaknesses, and mistakes.With faith in a spiritual rebirth, we are baptized andreceive the gift of the Holy Ghost. We strive to keep the commandments of God with faith that obedience will help us become like Him.By virtue of the Resurrection of our Savior, we havefaith that death is not the end of life. We have faiththat we once again will know the pleasant companyand warm embrace of loved ones who have departedfrom mortality. Hope Mormon asked the Saints of his day, \"And what is itthat ye shall hope for?\" He gave them this answer:\"Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hopethrough the atonement of Christ and the power ofhis resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, andthis because of your faith in him according to thepromise.\" 22In Ether we learn that \"whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world,yea, even a place at the right hand of God, whichhope cometh of faith, [and] maketh an anchor tothe souls of men.\" 23 Even when the winds of adversity blow, our Fatherkeeps us anchored to our hope. The Lord haspromised, \"I will not leave you [our] afflictions for [our]gain.\" 25Even when our trials seem overwhelming, we can draw strength and hope from the surepromise of the Lord: \"Be not afraid nor dismayed...; for the battle is not yours, but God's.\" 26 Charity Once faith grows into a firm, abiding testimony,giving us hope in our Heavenly Father's plan ofhappiness; once we see through the eye of faith thatwe are children of a loving Father, who has given usthe gift of His Son to redeem us, we experience amighty change in our hearts. 27We feel \"to sing the song of redeeming love,\"28and our hearts overflow with charity. Knowing that the love of God \"is themost desirable [of] all things mostjoyous to the soul,\" 29we want to share our joy with others. We want to serve them and bless them. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 131Family \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\" states clearly the sacredness of the family and that a\"husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for theirchildren.\" 30Children should be taught at an early age of the sacredness of temples, and that theirultimate goal should be to go to the temple toenjoy the blessings that our Heavenly Father has instore for them. Even the tapestry of this sacred goalis given to children that will, in due time, realizethis is the greatest blessing that could come to themin this life. . . . I testify to you as a special witness that Jesus is the Christ and that through His prophet, PresidentGordon B. Hinckley, the Savior presides over HisChurch. May we cultivate, in preparation of Hisreturning to this earth, His divine attributes is myprayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Notes . . . 6. Articles of Moroni 7:46-47.9. Alma 5:14.28.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALFOUNDATIONS FOR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 132HAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE SELECTED TEACHINGS Marriage Brings Happiness and Joy President David O. McKay \"In the teachings of the Church of Christ, the family assumes supreme importance in the development ofthe individual and of society. 'Happy and thricehappy are they who enjoy an uninterrupted unionand whose love, unbroken by any complaints, shallnot dissolve until the last day.' It will not dissolvewhen a worthy couple is sealed by the authority ofthe Holy Priesthood throughout all eternity. Themarriage ceremony when thus sealed produceshappiness and joy unsurpassed by any otherexperience in the world\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1966, 108). \"'How, then,' you ask, 'may you tell whether or not there is any consanguinity [feelings of affection], thatsomething which will each other's company?' 'Is there,' you ask, 'someguide?' Though love is not always a true guide, . . .yet certainly there is no happiness without love\"(Gospel Ideals, 459). President Spencer W. Kimball \"Honorable, happy, and successful marriage is surely the principal goal of every normal person. Marriageis perhaps the most vital of all the decisions andhas the most far-reaching effects, for it has to donot only with immediate happiness, but also witheternal joys. . . . \". . . Marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive. This is within thereach of every couple, every person\" (\"Oneness inMarriage,\" Ensign, Mar. 1977, 3-4). President Ezra Taft Benson \"As our family is our greatest source of joy in this life, so it may well be in the eternity\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1979, 48; or Ensign, May 1979, 33-34). President Boyd K. Packer \"The ultimate purpose of all we teach is to unite parents and children in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,that they are happy at home, sealed in an eternalmarriage, linked to their generations, and assured ofexaltation in the presence of our Heavenly Father\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 8; or Ensign, May 1995, 8). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"Some marriages do bend, and some will break, but we must not, because of this, lose faith in marriagenor become afraid of it. \"Broken marriages are not typical.\"Remember that trouble attracts attention! We travel the highway with thousands of cars movingin either direction without paying much attentionto any of them. But should an accident occur, wenotice immediately. \"If it happens again, we get the false impression that no one can go safely down the road. \"One accident may make the front page, while a hundred million cars that safely pass are not regardedas worth mentioning. \"Writers think that a happy, stable marriage does not have the dramatic appeal, the conflict worthfeaturing in a book or a play or a film. Therefore,we constantly hear about the ruined ones and welose our perspective. \"I believe in marriage. I believe it to be the ideal pattern for human living. I know it to be ordainedof God. The restraints relating to it were designed toprotect our happiness. \"I do not know of any better time in all of the history of the world for a young couple who are of age andprepared and who are in love to think of marriage.There is no better time because it is your time. \"I know that these are very troubled times. Troubleslike we have now are very hard on marriages.Marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive. This is within the reach of every couple, every person. \u2014President Spencer W. Kimball ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL133\"Do not lose faith in marriage. Not even if you have been through the unhappiness of a divorce and aresurrounded with pieces of a marriage that has fallenapart\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 15-16; orEnsign, May 1981, 14-15). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"There is nothing in this world as important as the creation and perfection of family units\" (\"SalvationIs a Family Affair,\" Improvement Era, June 1970, 43-44). \"The whole aim and purpose of the gospel is toenable men and women\u2014united as one in theLord\u2014to create for themselves eternal family unitsin eternity. Celestial marriage prepares us for thegreatest joy and happiness known to mortals andfor eternal life in the realms ahead\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1979, 82; or Ensign, Nov. 1979, 55). Elder James E. Faust \"Happiness in marriage and parenthood can exceed a thousand times any other happiness\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1977, 14; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, 11). Scripture Study Identify the principles in the following scriptures that give us insights into happiness in marriage: Job 6:25 42:22-23; 50:28 Satan Tries to Destroy Happiness President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Perhaps our greatest concern is with families. The family is falling apart all over the world. The old tiesthat bound together father and mother and childrenare breaking everywhere. We must face this in ourown midst. There are too many broken homes amongour own. The love that led to marriage somehowevaporates, and hatred fills its place. Hearts arebroken; children weep. Can we not do better? Ofcourse we can. It is selfishness that brings aboutmost of these tragedies. If there is forbearance, ifthere is forgiveness, if there is an anxious lookingafter the happiness of one's companion, then lovewill flourish and blossom.\"As I look to the future, I see little to feel enthusiasticabout concerning the family in America and acrossthe world. Drugs and alcohol are taking a terribletoll, which is not likely to decrease. Harsh languageone to another, indifference to the needs of oneanother\u2014all seem to be increasing. There is somuch of child abuse. There is so much of spouseabuse. There is growing abuse of the elderly. All ofthis will happen and get worse unless there is anunderlying acknowledgment, yes, a strong andfervent conviction, concerning the fact that thefamily is an instrument of the Almighty. It is Hiscreation. It is also the basic unit of society. \"I lift a warning voice to our people. We have moved too far toward the mainstream of society inthis matter. Now of course there are good families.There are good families everywhere. But there aretoo many who are in trouble. This is a malady witha cure. The prescription is simple and wonderfullyeffective. It is love. It is plain, simple, everyday loveand respect. It is a tender plant that needs nurturing.But it is worth all of the effort we can put into it\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1997, 94; or Ensign,Nov. 1997, 69). \"There may be now and again a legitimate cause for divorce. I am not one to say that it is never justified.But I say without hesitation that this plague amongus, which seems to be growing everywhere, is not ofGod, but rather is the work of the adversary ofrighteousness and peace and truth\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1991, 97-98; or Ensign, May 1991, 74). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The single purpose of Lucifer is to oppose the great plan of happiness, to corrupt the purest, mostbeautiful and appealing experiences of life: romance,love, Nephi Report, Oct.1993, 27-28; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 21). \"The ultimate purpose of the adversary, who has'great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath buta short time,' [Revelation 12:12] is to disrupt, disturb,and destroy the home and the family. Like a shipwithout a rudder, without a compass, we drift fromthe family values which have anchored us in thepast. Now we are caught in a current so strong thatunless we correct our course, civilization as we know ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALHAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE 134it will surely be wrecked to pieces\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1994, 24; or Ensign, May 1994, 19). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"We live in a day when Lucifer's influence is greater than we ever have known in our lifetimes. In termsof the sin, evil, and wickedness upon the earth, wecould liken our time to the days of Noah before theflood.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALHAPPINESS IN MARRIAGE 135HOLY SPIRIT OF PROMISE SELECTED TEACHINGS Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"The Holy Spirit of Promise is the Holy Spirit promised the saints, or in other words the Holy Ghost. This name-title is used in connection with the sealing andratifying power of the Holy Ghost, that is, the powergiven him to ratify and approve the righteous actsof men so that those acts will be binding on earthand in heaven. 'All covenants, contracts, bonds,obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections,associations, or expectations,' must be sealed by theHoly Spirit of Promise, if they are to have 'efficacy,virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from thedead; for all contracts that are not made unto this endhave an end when men are dead.' (D. & C. 132:7.) \"To seal is to ratify, to justify, or to approve. Thus an act which is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise is one which is ratified by the Holy Ghost; it isone which is approved by the Lord;and the person who has taken theobligation upon himself is justified bythe Spirit in the thing he has done. \"The ratifying seal of approval is put upon an act only if those entering thecontract are worthy as a result of personalrighteousness to receive the divine approbation.They 'are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, whichthe Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.' (D. & C. 76:53.) If they are not just and true and worthy the ratifying seal is withheld.\"When any ordinance or contract is sealed by theSpirit, it is approved with a promise of reward,provided unrighteousness does not thereafter breakthe seal, remove the ratifying approval, and causeloss of the promised blessing. (Doctrines of Salvation,vol. 1, p. 55; vol. 2, pp. 94-99.) Seals are placed oncontracts through righteousness. \"The operation and power of the Holy Spirit of Promise is best illustrated by the ordinance andcontract of baptism. An unworthy candidate forbaptism might deceive the elders and get theordinance performed, but no one can lie to theHoly Ghost and get by undetected. Accordingly, the baptism of an unworthy and unrepentantperson would not be sealed by the Spirit; it wouldnot be ratified by the Holy Ghost; the unworthyperson would not be justified by the Spirit in hisactions. If thereafter he became worthy throughrepentance and obedience, the seal would then beput in force. Similarly, if a worthy person is baptized,with the ratifying approval of the Holy Ghostattending the performance, yet the seal may bebroken by subsequent sin. \"These principles also apply to every other ordinance and performance in the Church. Thus if both partiesare 'just and true,' if they are worthy, a ratifyingseal is placed on their temple marriage; if they areunworthy, they are not justified by the Spirit and the ratification of the Holy Ghost is withheld. Subsequent worthinesswill put the seal in force, andunrighteousness will break any seal. \"Even if a person progresses to that state of near-perfection in which hiscalling and election is made sure, inwhich he is 'sealed up unto eternallife' (D. & eternal life' (D. & C. 88:3-4), in which he is 'sealedup unto the day of redemption' (D. & C. 124:124;Eph. 1:13)\u2014yet with it all, these great promises aresecured only if the 'perfor mances' are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise\" (Mormon Doctrine, 361-62). To seal is to ratify, to justify, or to approve. \u2014Elder Bruce R.

Kimball \"Couples do well to immediately find their own home, separate and apart from that of the in-lawson either side. The home may be very modest andunpretentious, but still it is an independent domicile.Your married life should become independent of herfolks and his folks.

Elder Ezra Taft Benson \"Another sterling virtue which builds manliness and independence is frugality or thrift. 'Waste not,want not' has long been the clarion call. In morerecent years, however, this maxim has given way toso-called 'deficit spending.' Many have been teachingthat we must spend our way into prosperity. Howdo you regard this philosophy?

Sexual experienceswere never intended by the Lord to be a mereplaything or merely to satisfy passions and lusts.We know of no directive from the Lord that propersexual experience between husbands and wives needbe limited totally to the procreation of children, but we find much evidence from Adam until nowthat no provision was ever made by the Lord forindiscriminate sex\" (\"The Lord's Plan for Men andWomen,\" Ensign, Oct. 1975, 4).

Purposes of Intimacy President Lorenzo Snow \"Think of the promises that are made to you in the beautiful and glorious ceremony that is used in themarriage covenant in the temple. When two Latter-day Saints are united together in marriage, promisesare made to them concerning their offspring, thatreach from eternity to eternity. They are promisedthat they shall have the power and the right togovern and control and administer salvation andexaltation and glory to their offspring worldswithout end. And what offspring they do not havehere, undoubtedly there will be opportunities tohave them hereafter. What else could man wish? Aman and a woman in the other life, having celestialbodies, free from sickness and disease, glorified andbeautified beyond description, standing in the midstof their posterity, governing and controlling them,administering life, exaltation, and glory, worldswithout end\" (Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, 138). President Spencer W. Kimball \"Your love, like a flower, must be nourished. There will come a great love and interdependence betweenyou, for your love is a divine one. It is deep, inclusive,comprehensive. It is not like that association of theworld which is misnamed love, but which is mostlyphysical attraction. When marriage is based on thisonly, the parties soon tire of each other. There is a break and a divorce, and a new, fresher physicalattraction comes with another marriage which inturn may last only until it, too, becomes stale. Thelove of which the Lord speaks is not only physicalattraction, but spiritual attraction as well. It is faithand confidence in, and understanding of, oneanother. It is a total partnership. It is companionshipwith common ideals and standards. It is unselfishnesstoward and sacrifice for one another. It is cleanlinessof thought and action and faith in God and hisprogram. It is parenthood in mortality ever lookingtoward godhood and creationship, and parenthoodof spirits. It is vast, all-inclusive, and limitless. Thiskind of love never tires or wanes. It lives on throughsickness and sorrow, through prosperity andprivation, through accomplishment anddisappointment, through time and eternity\" ( Faith Precedes the Miracle, 130-31). Misused Physical Intimacy President David O. McKay \"Let us instruct young people who come to us, first, young men throughout the Church, to know that a woman should be queen of her own body. Themarriage covenant does not give the man the rightto enslave her, or to abuse her, or to use her merelyfor the gratification of his passion. Your marriageceremony does not give you that right\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1952, 86). President Spencer W. Kimball \"If it is unnatural, you just don't do it. That is all, and all the family life should be kept clean andworthy and on a very high plane. There are somepeople who have said that behind the bedroomdoors anything goes. That is not true and the Lordwould not condone it\" (Teachings of Spencer W.Kimball, 312). \"We with Peter, '. . . Abstain fleshly war against the soul.' 2:11.) No indecentexposure or pornography or other aberrations todefile the mind and spirit. No fondling of bodies,one's own or that of others, and no sex betweenpersons except in proper marriage relationships. Thisis positively prohibited by our Creator in all places, atall times, and we reaffirm it. Even in marriage therecan be some excesses and distortions. No amount ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 140of rationalization to the contrary can satisfy a disappointed Father in heaven\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1974, 8-9; or Ensign, May 1974, 7). President Howard W. Hunter \"Keep yourselves above any domineering or unworthy behavior in the tender, intimate relationship betweenhusband and wife. Because marriage is ordained ofGod, the intimate relationship between husbands andwives is good and honorable in the eyes of God. Hehas commanded that they be one flesh and that theymultiply and replenish the earth (see Moses 2:28; 3:24).You are to love your wife as Christ loved the Churchand gave himself for it (see Ephesians 5:25-31). \"Tenderness and respect\u2014never selfishness\u2014must be the guiding principles in the intimate relationshipbetween husband and wife. Each partner must beconsiderate and sensitive to the other's needs anddesires. Any domineering, indecent, or uncontrolledbehavior in the intimate relationship betweenhusband and wife is condemned by the Lord\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 68; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 51). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"Even though sex can be an important and satisfactory part of married life, we must rememberthat life is not designed just for sex. Even marriagedoes not make proper certain extremes in sexualindulgence. To the Ephesian saints Paul begged forpropriety in marriage: 'So ought men to love theirwives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wifeloveth himself.' (Eph. 5:28.) And perhaps the Lord'scondemnation included secret sexual sins in marriage,when he said: '. . . And those who are not pure, andhave said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith theLord God.' (D&C 132:52.)\" ( Miracle of Forgiveness, 73). THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE Elder Boyd K. Packer Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Things of the Soul, 105-17 We shall start at the very beginning. \"The Godswent down to organize man in their own image, inthe image of the Gods to form they him, male andfemale to form they them. And the Gods said: Wewill bless them. And the Gods said: We will causethem to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish theearth, and subdue it.\" (Abraham 4:27-28.) And so the cycle of human life began on this earth as \"Adam knew his wife, and she bare unto him sonsand daughters, and they began to multiply and toreplenish the earth. And . . . the sons and daughtersof Adam began to divide two and two in the land,and to till the land, and to tend flocks, and theyalso begat sons and daughters.\" (Moses 5:2-3.) Commandment Never Rescinded The commandment to multiply and replenish theearth has never been rescinded. It is essential to theplan of redemption and is the source of humanhappiness. Through the righteous exercise of thispower, as through nothing else, we may come closeto our Father in Heaven and experience a fulness ofjoy, even godhood! The power of procreation is notan incidental part of the plan of happiness; it is thekey\u2014the very key. The power to generate life emerges in the body of the male and the female as each grows to maturity,empowering a man to become a father and a womanto become a mother. Constant in Mankind The desire to mate in humankind is constant andvery strong. Our happiness in mortal life, our joyand exaltation, are dependent upon how we respondto these persistent, compelling physical desires. As the procreative power matures in early manhood and womanhood there occurs, in a natural way, verypersonal feelings unlike any other physical experience.It is not without meaning that the process throughwhich life is conceived should be accompanied byfeelings of such depth and attraction that they drawthe individual to seek a repetition of them. Ideally, mating begins with romance. Though customs may vary, romance flourishes with all thestorybook feelings of excitement and anticipation,and sometimes rejection. There are moonlight androses, love letters, love songs, poetry, the holding of hands, and other worthy expressions of affectionbetween a young man and a young woman. The world disappears around a couple, and theyexperience feelings of joy. Every couple in love is ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 141positive that no couple since Adam and Eve has felt quite the same as they do. There are other patterns of romance which appear to be too sensible, too quiet, even dull. Nevertheless,they embody a depth of affection and romantic lovethat the deadly serious, silly senseless, or head-in-the-clouds ones will experience only as they mature. Mature Love And if you suppose that the full-blown rapture ofyoung romantic love is the sum of the possibilitieswhich spring from the fountains of life, you havenot yet lived to see the devotion and the comfort oflongtime married love. Married couples are tried bytemptation, misunderstandings, separation, financialproblems, family crises, illness; and all the whilelove grows stronger, the mature love enjoys a blissnot even imagined by newlyweds. True love requires a mutual respect and that the couple reserve until after the marriage the sharing ofthat affection which unlocks those sacred powers inthat fountain of life. It means avoiding pre-marriagesituations in which physical desire might take control.Courtship is a time to measure integrity, moralstrength, and worthiness. The invitation, \"If youlove me, you will let me,\" exposes a major flaw incharacter. It deserves the reply: \"If you really lovedme, you would never ask me to transgress. If youunderstood the gospel, you couldn't!\" Pure love presupposes that only after a pledge of eternal fidelity, a legal and a lawful ceremony, andideally after the sealing ordinance in the temple arethose procreative powers released for the full expres-sion of love. They are to be shared only and solely with that one who is our companion in marriage. Participation in the mating process offers an experience like nothing else in life. When enteredinto worthily, it combines the most exquisite andexalted physical, emotional, and spiritual feelingsassociated with the word love. Those feelings and the lifelong need for one another bind a husbandand wife together in a marriage wherein all of theattributes of adult masculinity are complementedby the priceless feminine virtues of womanhood. That part of life has no equal, no counterpart, in all human experience. It will, when covenants are madeand kept, last eternally, \"For therein are the keys ofthe holy priesthood ordained, that may 124:34), \"which glory shallbe the seeds foreverand ever\" (D&C 132:19). But romantic love is incomplete; it is a prelude. Love is nourished by the coming of children, whospring from that fountain of life entrusted to couplesin marriage. Conception takes place in a weddedembrace between husband and wife. A tiny bodybegins to form after a pattern of magnificentcomplexity. A child emerges in the miracle of birth,created in the image of its earthly father and mother,able to see and hear and feel and to perceive throughphysical senses. Within its mortal body is a spirit,able to feel and perceive spiritual things. Dormantin the mortal body of the child is the power tobeget offspring in its own image. \"The spirit and the body are the soul of man\" (D&C 88:15); hence there are spiritual and physical lawsto obey if we are to be happy. Moral and Natural Laws There are eternal laws, including laws relating to thispower to give life, \"irrevocably decreed in heavenbefore the foundations of this world, upon whichall blessings are predicated\" (D&C 130:20). Thereare spiritual laws which define the Romans 7:14-15; 134:6). There covenants thatbind, seal, safeguard, and give promise of eternalblessings. There are physical or natural laws whichgovern attraction to a mate, love of offspring, andthe instinct to protect them. Thou Shalt Not Kill Every time physical conditions are met, conceptionwill take place, whether in wedlock or out. Once a life is conceived, to destroy that life, even beforebirth, is a major transgression, save conceptionresults from rape, the mother's life hangs in thebalance, or the life of the unborn is certified to behopeless. We do not know all about when a spiritenters the body, but we do know that life, in anyform, is very precious. While we are given thepower to generate life and commanded to do so, wehave no license to destroy it. \"For the Lord . . . inall things hath forbidden it, from the beginning ofman\" (Ether 8:19). And the commandment given atSinai this dispensation: \"Thou unto (D&C 59:6). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 142To Be Controlled The eternal laws of the gospel of Jesus Christ do not prohibit our responding to inborn, God-given matinginstincts. Alma admonished his son Shiblon, \"Seethat ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filledwith love\" (Alma 38:12). A bridle is used to guide,to direct. Our passion is to be controlled\u2014but notcontrolled by extermination, as with a plague ofinsects; not controlled by eradication, as with adisease. It is to be controlled as electricity is controlled,to generate power and life. When lawfully used, thepower of procreation will bless and it will sanctify(see Joseph F. Smith, Gospel Doctrine [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1977], p. 309). The gospel tells us when and with whom these sacred powers may be safely experienced. As with all things,the scriptures do not contain page after page ofdetailed commandments covering every possibleapplication of the law of life. Rather they speak ingeneral terms, leaving us free to apply the principlesof the gospel to meet the infinite variety of life. We are free to ignore the counsels and command- ments of the scriptures, but when the revelationsspeak in such blunt terms, such as \"thou shalt not,\"we had better pay attention. When we obey, we canenjoy these life-giving powers in the covenant ofmarriage, and from our fountains of life will springour children, our family! Love between husbandand wife can be constant and bring fulfillment andcontentment all the days of their lives. Children of God No greater ideal has been revealed than the supernaltruth that we are the children of God, and that byvirtue of our creation we differ from all other livingthings (see Moses 6:8-10, 22, 59). \"All flesh,\" thescriptures teach, \"is not the same flesh: but there isone kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts\"(1 Corinthians 15:39). Men and women have unique responsibility in begetting life. The scriptures tell us that \"men areinstructed sufficiently that they know good from evil.And the law is given unto men.\" (2 Nephi 2:5.) Weare intelligent beings and we are accountable forour actions, even for our thoughts (see Alma 12:14). Creatures in the animal kingdom are drawn together in season by the compelling instinct to mate. Onceimpregnation takes place, they separate, ordinarilyleaving the mother alone to protect and provide forher offspring, for that is the way of the animal. But itis not the way of mankind. Family life among animalsis a rarity and even then is generally temporary.Except for rare examples, for instance among birds,the bond between animal parents is transitory;between sire and offspring, almost nonexistent. Animals cannot be accountable for the standards of morality by which mankind is judged. They areruled by the physical laws of nature. Animals by andlarge are promiscuous in responding to their matinginstincts. Nevertheless, their mating rituals followset patterns and have rigid limitations. For instance,animals do not pair up with their own gender tosatisfy their mating instincts. Nor are these matinginstincts expressed in the molestation of their ownoffspring. Children of God can willfully surrender to their carnal nature and, seemingly without remorse, defythe laws of morality and degrade themselves evenbelow the beasts. The Tempter Temptations are ever present in mortal life. Theadversary is jealous toward all who have power tobeget life. He cannot beget life; he is impotent. Heand those who followed him were cast out of heavenand forfeited the right to a mortal body. He will, ifhe can, take possession of your body, direct how you use it. His angels even begged to inhabit the bodiesof swine (see Matthew 8:31). He knows the supernalvalue of our power of procreation and jealously desiresto rule those who have it. And, the revelations tellus, \"he seeketh that all men might be miserable likeunto himself\" (2 Nephi 2:27). He will tempt you, ifhe can, to degrade, to corrupt, if possible to destroythis gift by which we may, if we are worthy, haveeternal increase (see D&C 132:28-31). The Obsession The rapid and sweeping deterioration of values insociety is characterized now by a preoccupation\u2014even an obsession\u2014with the procreative act.Abstinence before marriage and fidelity within it are openly scoffed at as being out of date; marriageand parenthood are ridiculed as burdensome andunnecessary. Modesty, a virtue present in a refinedindividual or society, is all but gone. Morality is no longer a measure of character for prominent role models for our youth\u2014the politicians, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 143the athletes, the entertainers. With ever fewer exceptions, what we see and read and hear has themating act as the central theme. Censorship of anykind is forced offstage as a violation of individualfreedom. That which should be absolutely private isdisrobed and acted out center stage. In the shadowsbackstage wait addiction, pornography, perversion,infidelity, abortion, and\u2014the ugliest of them all\u2014incest and molestation. And all of them are on theincrease. In company with them now is the pestilentdisease, which, like a biblical plague, threatens racesof mankind. In fact, all of mankind. The philosophies which now converge all have one thing in common: either by insinuation or bydeclaration they reject God as our creator, as ourFather, as our lawgiver. The Evil Idea The knowledge that we are the children of God is arefining, even an exalting truth. On the other hand,no idea has been more destructive of happiness, no philosophy has produced more sorrow, moreheartbreak, more suffering and mischief, no ideahas contributed more to the erosion ofthe family than the idea that we arenot the offspring of God, but onlyadvanced animals. There flows fromthat idea the not too subtle perceptionthat we are compelled to yield to everycarnal urge, are subject to physical butnot to moral law. The man-from-animal theory has been passed about enough to be pronounced true on thebasis of general acceptance. Because it seems tooffer logical explanations for some things, it is widely taught and generally accepted as thesolution to the mystery of life. I know there are two views on the subject. But it is one thing to measure this theory solely againstintellectual or academic standards, quite another tomeasure it against moral or spiritual or doctrinalstandards. When the theory that man is the offspring of animals is planted in young minds, it should be accompaniedby careful instruction to set it in isolation in thegarden of the mind until faith is well rooted.Otherwise, seeds of doubt may spring up and chokeout the seedling of faith, and the harvest will be bitterfruit and the giver will have served the wrong master.Freedom to Choose Lehi taught that men are free and must be free, free\"to act for themselves and not to be acted upon,save it be by the punishment of the law at the greatand last day\" (2 Nephi 2:26). Society now excuses itself from any responsibility for the high incidence of sexual immorality in youngpeople except for teaching children in school thephysical process of human reproduction in order toprevent pregnancy or disease, and providingteenagers with devices which are supposed to protectthem against both. When any effort is made toinclude in these courses basic universal values\u2014notjust values of the Church but those of civilization, ofsociety itself\u2014the protest arises, \"You are imposingreligion upon us, infringing upon our freedom.\" It is interesting how one virtue, when given exaggerated or fanatical emphasis, can be used tobatter down another. How clever the deception whenfreedom\u2014the virtue\u2014is invoked to justify vice! The advocates for lifting all restraints excuse themselves from responsibility by saying, \"I do not intend to do any of these thingsmyself, but I think everyone shouldbe free to choose what they want todo without any moral or legalinterference.\" With that same logic,one could argue that all traffic signsand barriers set to keep the carelessfrom falling to their death should bepulled down on the theory that each individual has the moral right to choose how closeto the edge he will go. There Are Higher Laws Anyone who has been taught the plan of salvationunderstands that to advocate freedom from all moralrestraints is to preach what is contrary to God's will.The phrase \"free agency\" does not appear in thescriptures. The only agency spoken of there is moral agency\u2014\"which,\" the Lord said, \"I have given untohim, that every man may be accountable for hisown sins in the day of judgment\" (D&C 101:78). Civilizations of the past\u2014Sodom and Gomorrah, for example\u2014have destroyed themselves by disobedienceto the laws of morality. \"For the Spirit of the Lordwill not always strive with man. And when theSpirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 144 The knowledge that we are the children of God is a refining, even an exalting truth.speedy destruction.\" 1:33; Moses 8:17.) If we pollute our fountains of life or lead others to transgress in that way, there will be penalties more\"exquisite\" and \"hard to bear\" (see D&C 19:15)than all the physical pleasure could ever be worth.Alma told his son Corianton, \"Know ye not, myson, that these things are an abomination in thesight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above allsins save it be the shedding of innocent blood ordenying the Holy Ghost?\" (Alma 39:5). We do notescape the consequences when we transgress. The only legitimate employment of the powers of procreation is between husband and wife who havebeen legally and lawfully married. Anything otherthan this violates the commandments of Godhimself. And as Alma said, \"I say unto you, if yespeak against it, it matters not, for the word of Godmust be fulfilled\" (Alma 5:58). You who are married will know the joy of parenthood and feel the responsibility which comes with familylife. Always keep in mind and make a central partof your lives the rearing of your children in lightand truth. Give to these precious souls the best thatyou are learning from life. And accept this caution.A married couple may be tempted to introducethings into their relationship that are unworthy. Donot, as the scriptures warn, \"change the natural useinto that which is against nature\" (Romans 1:26). If you do, the tempter will drive a wedge betweenyou. If something unworthy has become part ofyour relationship, be wise and don't ever do it again. Exceptions When we speak of marriage, family life, thereinevitably comes to mind, \"What about the excep-tions? There are always exceptions!\" Some are bornwith limitations and cannot beget children. Someinnocent ones have their marriage wrecked becauseof the infidelity of their spouses. Others do not marryand live lives of single worthiness, while at once thewayward and the wicked seem to enjoy it all. For now, I offer this comfort: God is our Father! All the love and generosity manifest in the ideal earthlyfather is magnified, beyond the capacity of mortalmind to comprehend, in Him who is our Father andour God. His judgments are just, His mercy withoutlimit, His power to compensate beyond any earthlycomparison.Remember that mortal life is a brief moment, for wewill live eternally. There will be ample\u2014I almost usedthe word time, but time does not apply here\u2014there will be ample opportunity for all injustices, allinequities to be made right, all loneliness anddeprivation compensated, and all worthinessrewarded when we keep the faith. \"If in this lifeonly we have hope in Christ, we are of all menmost miserable\" (1 Corinthians 15:19). It does notall end with mortal death; it just begins. Repentance Already I have warned that the awesome powers ofthe adversary will be employed to entice all mankindto sinfully use the sacred power of procreation. Donot yield, for every debt of transgression must bepaid \"till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing\"(Matthew justice demands it, and\". . . your sufferings [will] be sore\u2014how sore youknow not, how exquisite you know not, yea, howhard to bear you know not\" (D&C 19:15). In the universal battle for human souls, the adversary takes enormous numbers of prisoners.Many, knowing of no way to escape, are pressed intohis service. Every soul confined in a concentrationcamp of sin and guilt has a key to the gate. The keyis labeled Repentance. The adversary cannot holdthem, if they know how to use it. The twin principlesof repentance and forgiveness exceed in strengththe awesome power of the tempter. The world being what it is, if you have already made a mistake it can certainly be understood. Itcannot, under the law, be condoned, but it can beunderstood. You must stop conduct that is immoral.You must stop it now! Nowhere is the generosity and kindness and mercy of God more manifest than in repentance. Do youunderstand the consummate cleansing power of theatonement made by the Son of God, our Savior, ourRedeemer, who said, \"I, God, have suffered thesethings for all, that they might not suffer if theywould repent\"? (D&C 19:16.) I know of no sinconnected with transgression of the moral law whichcannot be forgiven, assuming, of course, full andcomplete repentance. I do not exempt abortion. The formula is stated in forty words: \"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven,and I, the Lord, remember them no more. By thisye may know if a man repenteth of his sins\u2014behold, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 145he will confess them and forsake them.\" (D&C 58:42-43.) I know of no more beautiful words in allof revelation than these. \"The same is forgiven, andI, the Lord, remember them no more.\" Confession\u2014The Bishop The formula for repentance requires that we confess.Our first confession is to the Lord in prayer. Whenour mistakes are not grievous ones, and if they arepersonal, that may be all that is required by way ofconfession. If our transgression includes tampering with the procreative capacities of another of either gender,then there is a necessary confession beyond prayer.From His priesthood the Lord has designated thebishop to be the common judge. If your transgressionis serious, and your conscience will tell you whetherit is or not, seek out the bishop. The bishop represents the Lord in extending forgiveness for the Church. At times he mustadminister bitter medicine. Alma told Corianton,\"Now, repentance could not come unto men exceptthere were a punishment\" (Alma 42:16). I wouldnot want to live in a world where there was norepentance, and if punishment is a condition of that,I will willingly accept that. There is the idea abroadthat one can send a postcard of prayer and receivein return full forgiveness and be ready at once for amission or for marriage in the temple. Not so. Thereare payments to be made. If a bishop offers comfortonly and, in misguided kindness, seeks to relieveyou of the painful but healing process in connectionwith repentance, he will not serve you well. Forgiveness from the Lord is earned through great personal effort. It takes courage to face the reality of your transgression, accept whatever penalty isrequired, and allow sufficient time for the processto work. When that is done, you will be innocentagain. The Lord said: \"I, even I, am he that blottethout thy transgressions for mine own sake, and willnot remember thy sins\" (Isaiah 43:25). He Will Remember Our Sins No More \"This is the covenant that I will make with them..., I will put my laws into their hearts, and intheir minds will I write them; and their sins andiniquities will I remember no more\" (Hebrews10:16-17).Alma, who in his youth had a rebellious spirit, spokefrom his own experience about the great reliefrepentance brings: \"Now, as my mind caught holdupon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus,thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am inthe gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by theeverlasting chains of death. And now, behold, whenI thought this, I could remember my pains no more;yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sinsno more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelouslight I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joyas exceeding as was my pain!\" (Alma 36:18-20.) Sometimes, even after confession and penalties, the most difficult part of repentance is to forgive oneself.President Joseph Fielding Smith told of a womanwho had repented of immoral conduct and wasstruggling to find her way. She asked him what sheshould do now. In turn, he asked her to read to himfrom the Old Testament the account of Sodom andGomorrah, of Lot, and of Lot's wife, who wasturned to a pillar of salt (see Genesis 19:26). Thenhe asked her what lesson those verses held for her. She answered, \"The Lord will destroy those who are wicked.\" \"Not so,\" President Smith told this repentant woman. \"The lesson for you is 'Don't look back!'\" The Temple Reverently now I use the word temple. As I do, there comes to mind the words: \"Put off thy shoes fromoff thy feet, whereon thou standest isholy ground\" (Exodus 3:5). I envision a sealing roomand an altar, with a young couple kneeling there, orperhaps a more mature couple who joined the Churcha year ago. This sacred temple ordinance is more,much more, than a wedding, for this marriage issealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise, and thescriptures promise that the participants, if theyremain worthy, \"shall inherit thrones, kingdoms,principalities, and powers, dominions\" (D&C 132:19). I think of the words of the sealing ordinance, which cannot be written here. I understand, in a smallmeasure at least, the sacred nature of the fountain oflife which is in us. And I see the joy that awaits thosewho accept this supernal gift and use it worthily. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALINTIMACY IN MARRIAGE 146JESUS CHRIST THE LIVING CHRIST: THE TESTIMONY OF THE APOSTLES The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 1 January 2000 As we commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ two millennia ago, we offer our testimony of the reality of Hismatchless life and the infinite virtue of His great atoningsacrifice. None other has had so profound an influenceupon all who have lived and will yet live upon the earth. He was the Great Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Messiah of the New. Under the direction of His Father,He was the creator of the earth. \"All things were madeby him; and without him was not any thing madethat was made\" (John 1:3). Though sinless, He wasbaptized all righteousness. He \"went aboutdoing good\" (Acts 10:38), yet was despised for it.His gospel was a message of peace and goodwill. Heentreated all to follow His example. He walked theroads of Palestine, healing the sick, causing the blindto see, and raising the dead. He taught the truths ofeternity, the reality of our premortal existence, thepurpose of our life on earth, and the potential forthe sons and daughters of God in the life to come. He instituted the sacrament as a reminder of His great atoning sacrifice. He was arrested and condemned onspurious charges, convicted to satisfy a mob, andsentenced to die on Calvary's cross. He gave His life toatone for the sins of all mankind. His was a great vicariousgift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth. We solemnly testify that His life, which is central to all human history, neither began in Bethlehem norconcluded on Calvary. He was the Firstborn of theFather, the Only Begotten Son in the flesh, theRedeemer of the world. He rose from the grave to \"become the firstfruits of them that slept\" (1 Corinthians 15:20). As RisenLord, He visited among those He had loved in life.He also ministered among His \"other sheep\" (John10:16) in ancient America. In the modern world, Heand His Father appeared to the boy Joseph Smith,ushering in the long-promised \"dispensation of thefulness of times\" the Living Christ, the Prophet Joseph wrote: \"Hiseyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head waswhite like the pure snow; his countenance shoneabove the brightness of the sun; and his voice wasas the sound of the rushing of great waters, eventhe voice of Jehovah, saying: \"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with theFather\" (D&C 110:3-4). Of Him the Prophet also declared: \"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him,this is the testimony, last of all, which we give ofhim: That he lives! \"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is theOnly Begotten of the Father\u2014 \"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitantsthereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God\"(D&C 76:22-24). We declare in words of solemnity that His priesthood and His Church have been restored upon the earth\u2014\"built upon the foundation of . . . apostles andprophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone\" (Ephesians 2:20). We testify that He will someday return to earth. \"And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all fleshshall see it together\" (Isaiah 40:5). He will rule as Kingof Kings and reign as Lord of Lords, and every kneeshall bend and every tongue shall speak in worshipbefore Him. Each of us will stand to be judged of Himaccording to our works and the desires of our hearts. We bear testimony, as His duly ordained Apostles\u2014 that Jesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son ofGod. He is the great King Immanuel, who standstoday on the right hand of His Father. He is the light,the life, and the hope of the world. His way is thepath that leads to happiness in this life and eternallife in the world to come. God be thanked for thematchless gift of His divine Son. T HEFIRSTPRESIDENCY THEQUORUM OF THE TWELVE Boyd K. Packer L. Tom PerryDavid B. HaightNeal A. MaxwellRussell M. NelsonDallin D. R.

FaustJesus is the Living Christ, the immortal Son of God. \u2014The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL147KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS ACQUIRING SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE Elder Richard G. Scott Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 117-20; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86-88 You wonderful, righteous members of this churchconstantly inspire and motivate me. Thank you foryour zest for life, your generous giving of self, yourdevotion, and your determination to live worthily. I also express gratitude to our many friends whohave joined us through these conference sessions.May the messages given bless your lives. Importance of Spiritual Knowledge Recently in South America a youth inquired, \"Canyou give us suggestions that will help us know theSavior better and be able to constantly follow Hisexample?\" That meaningful question and otherslike it have prompted this message on acquiringspiritual knowledge. President Ezra Taft Benson emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge, saying: \"We should make daily study of the scriptures a lifetime pursuit. . . . \"'. . do . . . is to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. Searchthem diligently. . . . the scripturesis not a burden laid upon [us] by the Lord, but amarvelous blessing and opportunity'\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1986, p. 61; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 47). President Spencer W. Kimball commented: \"Spiritual learning takes precedence. The secular without the foundation of the spiritual is . . . likethe foam upon the milk, the fleeting shadow. . . .One need not choose between the two . . . for thereis opportunity to get both Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, . . . p. 390). How to Acquire Spiritual Knowledge As you seek spiritual knowledge, search for principles.Carefully separate them from the detail used toexplain them. Principles are concentrated truth,packaged for application to a wide variety ofcircumstances. A true principle makes decisionsclear even under the most confusing and compellingcircumstances. It is worth great effort to organizethe truth we gather to simple statements of principle.I have tried to do that with gaining spiritualknowledge. The result is now shared in hope that it will be a beginning place for your study. Thatstatement of principle is: To acquire spiritual knowledge and to obey it with wisdom, one must\u2014 In humility, seek divine light. Exercise faith in Jesus Christ. Hearken to His counsel. Keep His commandments.As spiritual knowledge unfolds, it must be understood, valued, obeyed, remembered, and expanded. I will explain that statement using examples from the scriptures, the prophets, and the precious,though difficult, laboratory of personal experience.My desire is that the suggestions given will helpyou in your quest for spiritual truth throughoutyour life. Then, in time, you may accomplish thisobjective given by President Joseph F. Smith: \"The greatest achievement mankind can make in this world is to familiarize themselves with divinetruth, so thoroughly, so perfectly, that the exampleor conduct of no creature living in the world canever turn them away from the knowledge that theyhave obtained. . . . As spiritual knowledge unfolds, it must be understood, valued, obeyed, remembered, and expanded. \u2014Elder Richard G. Scott ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL148\"From my boyhood I have desired to learn the principles of the gospel in such a way . . . that itwould matter not to me who might fall from thetruth, . . . my foundation would be truths that City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], pp. 3-4). Like President Smith, you and I need that kind of secure anchor to keep our life centered inrighteousness and to avoid being swept away by the ruthless waves of worldliness. Humbly Seek Divine Light The following scriptures teach why we should seekdivine light: \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path\" (Psalm 119:105; italics added).\"I, the Lord, . . . will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words\" (2 Nephi I am the light which shineth in darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee. \". . . Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good\u2014yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judgerighteously; and this is my Spirit. \". . . I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soulwith joy; \"And . . . by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which are pertainingunto things of righteousness, in faith believing in methat you shall receive\" (D&C 11:11-14; italics added). Analogies with physical light help us understand the power of spiritual light. A bulb ignited in a darkroom overpowers darkness. Yet if the darkness is toointense, it can overpower light, as with a bulbplunged into a bucket of black ink. Spiritual lightovercomes the darkness of ignorance and disbelief.When transgression severely clouds a life, thefocused spiritual truths of repentance cut theblackness as a laser penetrates the darkest ink. Humility is essential to the acquiring of spiritual knowledge. To be humble is to be teachable. Humility permits you to be tutored by the Spiritand to be taught from sources inspired by the Lord,such as the scriptures. The seeds of personal growthand understanding germinate and flourish in thefertile soil of humility. Their fruit is spiritualknowledge to guide you here and hereafter.A proud individual cannot know the things of the Spirit. Paul taught this truth, saying: \"The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. . . . \"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:neither can he know them, because they arespiritually discerned\" (1 Corinthians 2:11, 14). Since it requires much personal effort to gain and use worthwhile knowledge, you cannot endlessly samplefrom every fascinating arena of life. Therefore, youshould select carefully a few vital areas where youcan focus energy to learn and share vital truths. Iknow that to gain knowledge of great worth requiresextraordinary personal effort. This is particularlytrue when our desire is to obtain spiritual knowledge.President Kimball said it this way: \"The treasures of both secular and spiritual knowledge are hidden ones\u2014but hidden from those who donot properly search and strive to find them. . . .Spiritual knowledge is not available merely for theasking; even prayers are not enough. It takespersistence and dedication of one's life. . . . Of alltreasures of knowledge, the most vital is theknowledge of God\" ( The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pp. 389-90). Brigham Young learned truth by carefully listening toJoseph Smith and striving to understand everythingthat was taught by word, example, or the Spirit. The resulting tutoring has blessed generations. Itconditioned Brigham Young to learn additionaltruths and to share far more than he had receivedpersonally from Joseph Smith. Follow his example. Exercise Faith and Hearken to Jesus' Counsel The need to exercise faith in Jesus Christ is absolutely essential. It is the foundation of the plan of salvation. When that exercise of faith is coupled with sincereeffort based upon a willingness to hearken to Hiscounsel, great personal growth and blessings follow. The Savior declared: \"I now give unto you a commandment . . . to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. \"For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. \"For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALKNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS 149\"And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to thevoice of the Spirit. \"And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the cometh unto . . . the Father\" (D&C 84:43-47;italics added). Obey the Commandments The role of obedience in gaining spiritual knowledge is crucial, as this comment of President JosephFielding Smith confirms: \"Now the Lord would give us gifts. He will quicken our minds. He will give us . . . a knowledge that willbe so deeply rooted in our souls that [it] can neverbe rooted out, if we will just seek for the light . . .and the understanding which is promised to us, andwhich we can receive if we will only be true andfaithful to every covenant and obligation pertainingto the gospel of Jesus Christ\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1958, p. 22). To keep the commandments, you must know them. The best single source for learning them is thescriptures. President Joseph Fielding Smith gave thisadmonition: \"Today we are troubled by evil-designing persons who [endeavor] to destroy the testimonies of members of the Church, and many . . . are in danger becauseof lack of understanding and because they have not sought the guidance of the Spirit. . . . It is acommandment dimand eventually disappear [without] study, obedience,and diligent seeking to know and understand thetruth\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1963, p. 22; orImprovement Era, Dec. 1963, p. 1062). Profound spiritual truth cannot simply be pouredfrom one mind and heart to another. It takes faithand diligent effort. Precious truth comes a smallpiece at a time through faith, with great exertion,and at times wrenching struggles. The Lord intendsit be that way so that we can mature and progress.Moroni said, \"Dispute not because ye see not, for yereceive no witness until after the trial of your faith\"(Ether 12:6). To explain that truth, PresidentHarold B. Lee gave this wise instruction:\"The Savior's blood, His atonement, will save us,but only after we have done all we can to saveourselves by keeping His commandments. All of theprinciples of the gospel are principles of promise bywhich the plans of the Almighty are unfolded tous\" (Stand Ye in Holy Places [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974], p. 246). Apply Spiritual Knowledge As packets of knowledge unfold, they must beunderstood, valued, obeyed, remembered, and expanded. I'll explain: Understood. As each element of truth is encountered, you must carefully examine it in the light of prior knowledge to determine whereit fits. Ponder it; inspect it inside out. Study it fromevery vantage point to discover hidden meaning.View it in perspective to confirm you have notjumped to false conclusions. Prayerful reflectionyields further understanding. Such evaluation isparticularly important when the truth comes as animpression of the Spirit. Valued. You show knowledge is valued by expressing appreciation for it, especially in heartfelt prayers of gratitude. The Lord said, \"He whoreceiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be addedunto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more\" (D&C78:19). Obeyed. Obedient application of truth is the surest way of making it eternally yours. The wise use of knowledge will permeate your life with its preciousfruit. Remembered. Powerful spiritual direction in your life can be overcome or forced into the background unless you provide a way to retain it. BrighamYoung declared, \"If you love the truth you canremember it\" (Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co.,1941], p. 10). Knowledge carefully recorded isknowledge available in time of need. Spirituallysensitive information should be kept in a sacredplace that communicates to the Lord how youtreasure it. That practice enhances the likelihood ofyour receiving further light. Expanded. This thought refers to rich benefits that come from your efforts to enlarge, extend, and increase your understanding of truth. Use thescriptures and the declarations of the prophets to ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL150 KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGSexpand your knowledge. You will find that efforts to share knowledge are often rewarded with moreunderstanding as additional light flows into yourmind and heart (see D&C 8:2-3). Study and Apply Conference Messages We have come to the end of a great conference.Through its messages, you have been given inspiredtruth without much effort on your part. Make these truths yours through study and thoughtfulapplication and by emulating a prophet of God,Spencer W. Kimball, who at the conclusion of aconference, taught: \"While sitting here, I have made up my mind that when I go home from this conference this nightthere are many, many areas in my life that I canperfect. I have made a mental list of them, and Iexpect to go to work as soon as we get throughwith conference\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1975,p. 164; or Ensign, Nov. 1975, p. 111).The privilege of learning absolute truth is sacred tome. I stand in awe that our Heavenly Father andHis Beloved Son are willing, even anxious for us tolearn from them. Please use what I have shared withsensitivity for the wondrous privilege given each ofus, willing to obey, to be taught eternal truth. Gainingspiritual knowledge is not a mechanical process. Itis a sacred privilege based upon spiritual law. I testifythat you can receive inspired help. Humbly ask yourEternal Father. Seek divine light. Exercise faith in theSavior. Strive to hearken to His counsel and obeyHis commandments. He will bless and lead you asyou move through this sometimes treacherous world. I solemnly testify that Jesus Christ guides this, His church. He knows and loves you personally. As youwalk in faithful obedience, He will bless you, inspireyou, and lead you to greater knowledge and capacity.I certify that He lives, in the name of Jesus Christ,amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALKNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL THINGS 151LIVING TOGETHER WITHOUT MARRIAGE Related Scripture Proverbs 6:27-33 \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? \"Can one go upon hot coals, and his be burned? . . doeth it destroyethhis own soul. \"A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.\" SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"Not all sins of this permissive world are with the youth. I was shocked recently when I read a magazinearticle. The man spoke of marriage as a legalistic,paper-signing institution, and said: 'It should beabolished. Without the social pressures in the state,it could be utopia.' He asked the woman. She said:'Marriage should be done away with. I already knowpeople who are living quietly together withoutmarriage, but I haven't yet seen the effect of this on children as they grow up in such a society.' \"These are not the only ones who are advocating living together without marriage. We call this to theattention of our people with all the strength wepossess. \"We say again: We members of the Church marry. All normal people should marry. (There could be afew exceptions.) All normal married couples shouldbecome parents\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1974, 9;or Ensign, Nov. 1974, 8).President Gordon B. Hinckley \"God-sanctioned marriage between a man and a woman has been the basis of civilization forthousands of years. There is no justification toredefine what marriage is. Such is not our right, andthose who try will find themselves answerable toGod\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1999, 70; orEnsign, Nov. 1999, 54). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"There is a practice, now quite prevalent, for unmarried couples to live together, a counterfeit ofmarriage. They suppose that they shall have all thatmarriage can offer without the obligations connectedwith it. They are wrong! \"However much they hope to find in a relationship of that kind, they will lose more. Living togetherwithout marriage destroys something inside all whoparticipate. Virtue, self-esteem, and refinement ofcharacter wither away. \"Claiming that it will not happen does not prevent the loss; and these virtues, once lost, are not easilyreclaimed. \"To suppose that one day they may nonchalantly change their habits and immediately claim all thatmight have been theirs had they not made a mockeryof marriage is to suppose something that will not be. \"One day, when they come to themselves, they will reap disappointment. \"One cannot degrade marriage without tarnishing other words as well, such words as boy, girl, manhood, womanhood, husband, wife, father, mother, baby,children, family, home. \"Such words as unselfishness and sacrifice will then be tossed aside. Then self-respect will fade and love itself will not want to stay. \"If you have been tempted to enter such a relationship or if you now live with another withoutmarriage, leave! Withdraw from it! Run away fromit! Do not continue with it! Or, if you can, make a marriage out of it\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1981, 14-15; or Ensign, May 1981, 13). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland Marriage \"is a union of such completeness that we use the word seal to convey its eternal promise. The Prophet Joseph Smith once said we perhaps could Living together without marriage destroys something inside all who participate. \u2014Elder Boyd K. Packer ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL152render such a sacred bond as being 'welded' [see D&C 128:18] one to another. \"But such a total union, such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman, can onlycome with the proximity and permanence affordedin a marriage covenant, with solemn promises andthe pledge of all they possess\u2014their very hearts andminds, all their days and all their dreams. \"Can you see the moral schizophrenia that comes from pretending you are one, pretending you have made solemn promises before God, sharing thephysical symbols and the physical intimacy of yourcounterfeit union but then fleeing, retreating,severing all such other aspects of what was meantto be a total obligation?\"In matters of human intimacy, you must wait! You must wait until you can give everything, and youcannot give everything until you are legally andlawfully married. To give illicitly that which is notyours to give (remember, 'you are not your own')and to give only part of that which cannot befollowed with the gift of your whole self is emotionalRussian roulette. If you persist in pursuing physicalsatisfaction without the sanction of heaven, you runthe terrible risk of such spiritual, psychic damage thatyou may undermine both your longing for physical intimacy andyour ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later, truer love\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1998, 100; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 76-77).

President David O. McKay \"'Well,' you may ask, 'how may I know when I am in love?' \". . . George Q. Morris [who later became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave thisreply]: 'My mother once said that if you meet a girlin whose presence you feel a desire to achieve, whoinspires you to do your best, and to make the mostof yourself, such a young woman is worthy of yourlove and is awakening love in your heart.' \"I submit that . . . as a true guide. In the presence of the girl you truly love you do not feel to grovel; inher presence you do not attempt to take advantageof her; in her presence you feel that you would liketo be everything that a Master Man should become,for she will inspire you to that ideal. And I ask youyoung women to cherish that same guide\" (\"AsYouth Contemplates an Eternal Partnership,\"Improvement Era, Mar. 1938, 139). President Ezra Taft Benson \"If we would truly seek to be more like our Savior and Master, learning to love as He loves should beour highest goal\" (Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, 275). Elder John A. Widtsoe \"Love is the foundation of marriage, but love itself is a product of law and lives by law. True love islaw-abiding, for the highest satisfactions come to a law-abiding life. . . . \". . . Marriage that lasts only during earth life is a sad one, for the love established between man andwoman, as they live together and rear their family,should not die, but live and grow richer with theeternal years. True love hopes and prays for anendless continuation of association with the lovedone. To those who are sealed to each other for allexistence, love is ever warm, more hopeful, believing,courageous, and fearless. Such people live the richer,more joyful life. To them happiness and the makingof it have no end. . . . \"Above physical charm, love is begotten by qualities, often subtle, of mind and spirit. The beautiful faceIf one really loves another, one would rather die for that person than to injure him. \u2014Elder Spencer W. Kimball ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL154may hide an empty mind; the sweet voice may utter coarse words; the lovely form may be ill-mannered;the woman of radiant beauty and the man of kinglyform may be intolerable bores on neareracquaintanceship; or, the person who looksattractive may really have no faults, may excel us inknowledge and courtesy, yet he is not of our kind,his ways are not ours. Under either condition, lovewilts in its first stage. 'Falling in love' is always fromwithin, rather than from without. That is, physicalattractiveness must be reinforced with mental andspiritual harmony if true love is to be born andhave long life\u2014from the Latter-day Saint point ofview, to last throughout the eternities\" ( Evidences and Reconciliations, 297, 299, 302). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"What is love? Many people think of it as mere physical attraction and they casually speak of 'fallingin love' and 'love at first sight.' This may be Holly-wood's version and the interpretation of those whowrite love songs and love fiction. True love is notwrapped in such flimsy material. One might becomeimmediately attracted to another individual, butlove is far more than physical attraction. It is deep,inclusive and comprehensive. Physical attraction isonly one of the many elements, but there must befaith and confidence and understanding and part-nership. There must be common ideals and standards.There must be a great devotion and companionship.Love is cleanliness and progress and sacrifice andselflessness. This kind of love never tires nor wanes,but lives through sickness and sorrow, poverty andprivation, accomplishment and disappointment,time and eternity\" ( Love versus Lust, 18). \"If one really loves another, one would rather diefor that person than to injure him\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 279). Elder Gordon B. Hinckley \"May I quickly suggest four cornerstones upon which to build that house? There are others, but Ichoose to emphasize these. . . . \"The first of these I call Respect for One Another, the kind of respect that regards one's companion as the most precious friend on earth and not as a possessionor a chattel to be forced or compelled to suit one'sselfish whims.\"Pearl Buck has observed, 'Love cannot be forced.. . . It comes out of heaven, unasked and unsought.'(The Treasure Chest, p. 165.) \"This respect comes of recognition that each of us isa son or daughter of God, endowed with somethingof his divine nature, that each is an individualentitled to expression and cultivation of individualtalents and deserving of forbearance, of patience, of understanding, of courtesy, of thoughtfulconsideration. True love is not so much a matter ofromance as it is a matter of anxious concern for thewell being of one's companion\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1971, 81-82; or Ensign, June 1971, 71). Elder Boyd K. Packer See quotation on page 142. Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"The world is filled with too many of us who are inclined to indicate our love with an announcementor declaration. \"True love is a process. True love requires personal action. Love must be continuing to be real. Lovetakes time. Too often expediency, infatuation,stimulation, persuasion, or lust are mistaken forlove. How hollow, how empty if our love is no deeperthan the arousal of momentary feeling or theexpression in words of what is no more lasting than the time it takes to speak them. . . . \"We must at regular and appropriate intervals speak and reassure others of our love and the long time ittakes to prove it by our actions. Real love does taketime. The Great Shepherd had the same thoughts inmind when he taught, 'If ye love me, keep my commandments' (John 14:15; italics added) and 'Ifye love me feed my sheep' (John 21:16; italics added). Love demands action if it is to be continuing. Loveis a process. Love is not a declaration. Love is not anannouncement. Love is not a passing fancy. Love isnot an expediency. Love is not a convenience. 'If yelove me, keep my commandments' and 'If ye loveme feed my sheep' are God-given proclamationsthat should remind us we can often best show ourlove through the processes of feeding and keeping. \"Love of God takes time. Love of family takes time.Love of country takes time. Love of neighbor takestime. Love of companion takes time. Love incourtship takes time. Love of self takes time\" (in ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 155Conference Report, Oct. 1975, 160, 163; or Ensign, Nov. 1975, 108, 110). \"One who loves has and feels responsibility. Paul in 1 Corinthians says love thinketh no evil, is not self-seeking, is long-suffering, and is kind. (See 1 Cor.13:4-5.) If we look at love between two who arepreparing for temple marriage, we see the elementsof sacrifice and of serving each other's best interests,not a shortsighted 'me' interest. True love andhappiness in courtship and marriage are based uponhonesty, self-respect, sacrifice, consideration, courtesy,kindness, and placing 'we' ahead of 'me.'\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1981, 30; or Ensign, May 1981, 23). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Perfect love is perfectly patient\" (All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience, 69). \"Unlike our love, Jesus' love consists of activerestraint as well as pressing encouragement. Hisperfect love of each and all spares Him the need toaccept us as we now are, for He knows perfectly whatwe have the possibility to become\" ( Even As I Am, 18). Elder Richard G. Scott \"Love, as defined by the Lord, elevates, protects, respects, and enriches another. It motivates one tomake sacrifices for another\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1991, 43; or Ensign, May 1991, 35). Elder Joe J. Christensen \"Be quick to say, 'I'm sorry.' As hard as it is to form the words, be swift to say, 'I apologize, and pleaseforgive me,' even though you are not the one whois totally at fault. True love is developed by thosewho are willing to readily admit personal mistakesand offenses\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 86;or Ensign, May 1995, 65). What Are Some of the Counterfeits of True Love? Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"At the hour of sin, pure love is pushed out of one door while lust sneaks in the other. Affection hasthen been replaced with desire of the flesh anduncontrolled passion. Accepted has been thedoctrine which the devil is so eager to establish,that illicit sex relations are justified\" ( Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 279).\"If anyone feels that petting or other deviations aredemonstrations of love, let him ask himself: 'If thisbeautiful body which I have misused suddenlybecame deformed, or paralyzed, would my reactionsbe the same? If this lovely face were scarred byflames, or this body which I have used suddenlybecame rigid, or this keen mind which I have enjoyedwere suddenly to become blank, would I be such anardent lover? If senility or any of its approachessuddenly fell upon my sweetheart, what would myattitudes be?' Answers to these questions might testone to see if he really is in love or if it is onlyphysical attraction which encouraged the improperphysical contacts. The young man who protects hissweetheart against all useor abuse, against insult and infamy from himself or others, could beexpressing true love. \"But the young man who uses his companion as a biological toy to give himself temporary satisfaction\u2014that is lust, and is at the other end of the spectrum from love. A young woman conductsherself to be attractive spiritually, mentally andphysically but will not by word nor dress nor actstir nor stimulate to physical reactions the companionbeside her. That could be true love. That youngwoman who must touch and stir and fondle andtempt and use knows not love. That is lust andexploitation\" (Love versus Lust, 18-19). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The greatest deception foisted upon the human race in our day is that overemphasis of physicalgratification as it is related to romantic love. It ismerely a repetition of the same delusion that hasbeen impressed on every generation in ages past.When we learn that physical gratification is onlyincident to, and not the compelling force of loveitself, we have made a supreme discovery. If onlyphysical gratification should interest you, you neednot be selective at all. This power is possessed byalmost everyone. Alone, without attendant love,this relationship becomes nothing\u2014indeed, less andworse than nothing\" (Eternal Love, 15). Elder Richard G. Scott \"Satan promotes counterfeit love, which is lust. It is driven by a hunger to appease personal appetite.One who practices this deception cares little for thepain and destruction caused another. While oftencamouflaged by flattering words, its motivation is ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 156self-gratification. You know how to be clean and live a righteous life. We trust you to do it. The Lordwill bless you richly and will help you keep cleanand pure\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1991, 43-44;or Ensign, May 1991, 35). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland \"May I suggest that human intimacy, that sacred, physical union ordained of God for a married couple,deals with a symbol that demands special sanctity. Such an act of love between a man and a womanis\u2014or certainly was ordained to be\u2014a symbol oftotal union: union of their hearts, their hopes, theirlives, their love, their family, their future, theireverything. It is a symbol that we try to suggest inthe temple with a word like seal. The Prophet Joseph Smith once said we perhaps ought to render such asacred bond as 'welding'\u2014that those united inmatrimony and eternal families are 'welded' together,inseparable, if you will, to withstand the temptationsof the adversary and the afflictions of mortality (see D&C 128:18). \"But such a total, virtually unbreakable union, such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman, can only come with the proximity andpermanence afforded in a marriage covenant, withthe union of all that they possess\u2014their very hearts and minds, all their days and all their dreams. . . . \"Can you see then the moral schizophrenia that comes from pretending we are one, sharing thephysical symbols and physical intimacy of our union, but then fleeing, retreating, severing all such otheraspects\u2014and symbols\u2014of what was meant to be atotal obligation, only to unite again furtively someother night or, worse yet, furtively unite (and youcan tell how cynically I use that word) with someother partner who is no more bound to us, no moreone with us than the last was or than the one thatwill come next week or next month or next year or anytime before the binding commitments ofmarriage?\" (Speaking Out on Moral Issues, 158-59; see also Conference Report, Oct. 1998, 100). How Does Our Love for God Influence Our Ability to Love Others? Elder Orson Pratt \"The more righteous a people become the more they are qualified for loving others and rendering themhappy. A wicked man can have but little love for hiswife; while a righteous man, being filled with thelove of God, is sure to manifest this heavenlyattribute in every thought and feeling of his heart,and in every word and deed. Love, joy, and innocencewill radiate from his very countenance, and beexpressed in every look. This will beget confidencein the wife of his bosom, and she will love him inreturn; for love begets love; happiness impartshappiness; and these heaven born emotions willcontinue to increase more and more, until they areperfected and glorified in all the fulness of eternallove itself\" (\"Celestial Marriage,\" The Seer, Oct. 1853, 156). Elder John A. Widtsoe \"True love of man for woman always includes love of God from whom all good things issue\" ( Evidences and Reconciliations, 297). Elder Russell M. Nelson \"Without a strong commitment to the Lord, an individual is more prone to have a low level ofcommitment to a spouse. Weak commitments to eternal covenants lead to losses of eternalconsequence\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1997, 98;or Ensign, May 1997, 72). What Types of Conduct Help Develop True Love in Relationships? President Joseph Fielding Smith \"If a man and his wife were earnestly and faithfully observing all the ordinances and principles of thegospel, there could not arise any cause for divorce.The joy and happiness pertaining to the marriagerelationship would grow sweeter, and husband andwife would become more and more attached to eachother as the days go by. Not only would the husbandlove the wife and the wife the husband, but childrenborn to them would live in an atmosphere of loveand harmony. The love of each for the others wouldnot be impaired, and moreover the love of alltowards our Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christwould be more firmly rooted in their souls\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1965, 11). President Ezra Taft Benson The Lord \"said, 'Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else'(D&C 42:22). . . . ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 157\"This kind of love can be shown for your wives in so many ways. First and foremost, nothing exceptGod Himself takes priority over your wife in yourlife\u2014not work, not recreation, not hobbies. . . . \"What does it mean to love someone with all your heart? It means to love with all your emotionalfeelings and with all your devotion. . . . You cannotdemean her, criticize her, find fault with her .... \"What does it mean to 'cleave unto her'? It meansto stay close to her, to be loyal and faithful to her,to communicate with her, and to express your lovefor her. \"Love means being sensitive to her feelings and needs. . . . \"Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and to counsel with you. . . . \"Give her the opportunity to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially as well as spiritually. \"Remember, brethren, love can be nurtured and nourished by little tokens. Flowers on specialoccasions are wonderful, but so is your willingnessto help with the dishes, change diapers, get up witha crying child in the night, and leave the televisionor the newspaper to help with the dinner. Those arethe quiet ways we say 'I love you' with our actions.They bring rich dividends for such little effort\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1987, 61-62; or Ensign,Nov. 1987, 50). Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"If two people love the Lord more than their own lives and then love each other more than their ownlives, working together in total harmony with thegospel program as their basic structure, they aresure to have this great happiness. When a husbandand wife go together frequently to the holy temple,kneel in prayer together in their home with theirfamily, go hand in hand to their religious meetings,keep their lives wholly chaste\u2014mentally andphysically\u2014so that their whole thoughts anddesires and loves are all centered in the one being,their companion, and both work together for theupbuilding of the kingdom of God, then happinessis at its pinnacle\" (\"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign,Mar. 1977, 5).\"HOW DO I LOVE THEE?\" Elder Jeffrey R. Holland Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Brigham Young University 1999-2000 Speeches,158-62 I wish to speak to you this morning about Christlikelove and what I think it can and should mean inyour friendships, in your dating, in serious courtship,and, ultimately, in your marriage. I approach the subject knowing full well that, as a newly engaged young woman said to me just lastmonth, \"There is certainly a lot of advice out there!\"I don't want to add needlessly to this rhetoric onromance, but I believe that second only to yourmembership in the Church, your \"membership in a marriage\" is the most important association youwill have in time and eternity\u2014and to the faithfulwhat doesn't come in time willcome in eternity. So perhaps all of you will forgive me for offering, yes,more advice. But I wish it to be scriptural advice,gospel advice. Advice, if you will, that is as basic tolife as it is to love\u2014counsel that is equally applicableto men and to women. It has nothing to do withtrends or tides of the time or tricks of the trade buthas everything to do with the truth. So may I put your friendships and dates and eventually your marriages in a scriptural contextthis morning and speak to you of what I will try tocommunicate as true love. After a long wonderful discourse by Mormon on thesubject of charity, the seventh chapter of Moronitells us that this highest of Christian virtues is moreaccurately labeled \"the pure love of Christ.\" And it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him [and her]. Wherefore, . . . pray unto the Father with all the energyof heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which hehath bestowed upon all who are true followers of hisSon, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons [and daughters] of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; . . . that wemay be purified even as is pure. [Moroni 7:47-48] ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 158True charity, the absolutely pure, perfect love of Christ, has really been known only once in thisworld\u2014in the form of Christ Himself, the living Sonof the living God. It is Christ's love that Mormongoes to some length to describe for us and that Paulthe Apostle did as well some years before, writing to the Corinthians in New Testament times. As ineverything, Christ is the only one who got it allright, did it all perfectly, loved the way we are all totry to love. But even though we fall short, that divinestandard is there for us. It is a goal toward whichwe are to keep reaching, keep striving\u2014and, certainly,a goal to keep appreciating. And as we speak of this, may I remind you, as Mormon explicitly taught, that this love, this ability,capacity, and reciprocation we all so want, is a gift.It is \"bestowed\"\u2014that is Mormon's word. It doesn'tcome without effort and it doesn't come withoutpatience, but, like salvation itself, in the end it is agift, given by God to the \"true followers of his Son,Jesus Christ.\" The solutions to life's problems arealways gospel solutions. Not only are answers found in Christ, but so is the power, the gift,the bestowal, the miracle of giving andreceiving those answers. In this matterof love, no doctrine could be moreencouraging to us than that. I have taken for a title to my remarks Mrs. Browning's wonderful line \"How do I love thee?\" (Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Sonnets from the Portuguese [1850], no. 43.) I am not going to \"count the ways\" this morning, but I amimpressed with her choice of adverb\u2014not when do I love thee nor where do I love thee nor whydo I love thee nor why don't you love me, but, rather, how. How do I demonstrate it, how do I reveal my true love for you? Mrs. Browning was correct. Real loveis best shown in the \"how,\" and it is with the howthat Mormon and Paul help us the most. The first element of divine love\u2014pure love\u2014taught by these two prophets is its kindness, its selflessquality, its lack of ego and vanity and consumingself-centeredness. \"Charity suffereth long, and is kind,[charity] envieth not, not puffed up, seekethnot her own\" (Moroni 7:45). I have heard PresidentHinckley teach publicly and privately what I supposeall leaders have said\u2014that most problems in love andmarriage ultimately start with selfishness. In outliningideal love in which Christ, the most unselfish manwho ever lived, is the great example, it is notsurprising that this scriptural commentary starts here. There are many qualities you will want to look for in a friend or a serious date\u2014to say nothing of aspouse and eternal companion\u2014but surely amongthe very first and most basic of those qualities willbe those of care and sensitivity toward others, aminimum of self-centeredness that allows compassionand courtesy to be evident. \"That best . kindness,\" (Lines a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey [1798], lines 33-35). There are lots of limitations in all of us that we hope our sweetheartswill overlook. I suppose no one is as handsome or asbeautiful as he or she wishes, or as brilliant in schoolor as witty in speech or as wealthy as we would like,but in a world of varied talents and fortunes thatwe can't always command, I think that makes evenmore attractive the qualities we cancommand\u2014 such qualities as thoughtfulness, patience, a kindword, and true delight in the accomplishment ofanother. These cost us nothing, and they can mean everything to the one who receives them. I like Mormon and Paul's language that says one who truly loves is not\"puffed up.\" Puffed up! Isn't that agreat image? Haven't you ever beenwith someone who was so conceited, so full of themselves that they seemed like the Pillsbury Doughboy? Fred Allen said once that he saw such a fellow walking down Lovers' Laneholding his own hand. True love blooms when wecare more about another person than we care aboutourselves. That is Christ's great atoning example forus, and it ought to be more evident in the kindnesswe show, the respect we give, and the selflessnessand courtesy we employ in our personalrelationships. Love is a fragile thing, and some elements in life can try to break it. Much damage can be done if we arenot in tender hands, caring hands. To give ourselvestotally to another person, as we do in marriage, is the most trusting step we take in any humanrelationship. It is a real act of faith\u2014faith all of usmust be willing to exercise. If we do it right, we endup sharing everything\u2014all our hopes, all our fears,all our dreams, all our weaknesses, and all ourjoys\u2014with another person. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 159 The solutions to life's problems are always gospel solutions.No serious courtship or engagement or marriage is worth the name if we do not fully invest allthat we have in it and in so doing trust ourselves totally tothe one we love. You cannot succeed in love if youkeep one foot out on the bank for safety's sake. Thevery nature of the endeavor requires that you holdon to each other as tightly as you can and jump inthe pool together. In that spirit, and in the spirit ofMormon's plea for pure love, I want to impress uponyou the vulnerability and delicacy of your partner'sfuture as it is placed in your hands for safekeeping\u2014male and female, it works both ways. Sister Holland and I have been married for nearly 37 years, just a half-dozen or so years short of twiceas long as we have lived without each other. I maynot know everything about her, but I know 37 years'worth, and she knows that much of me. I know herlikes and dislikes, and she knows mine. I know hertastes and interests, hopes and dreams, and she knowsmine. As our love has grown and our relationshiphas matured, we have been increasingly free witheach other about all of that. The result is that I know much more clearly now how to help her, and, if I let myself, I know exactlywhat will hurt her. In the honesty of our love\u2014lovethat can't truly be Christlike without such totaldevotion\u2014surely God will hold me accountable forany pain I cause her by intentionally exploiting orhurting her when she has been so trusting of me,having long since thrown away any self-protectionin order that we could be, as the scripture says, \"oneflesh\" (Genesis 2:24). To impair or impede her inany way for my gain or vanity or emotional mastery over her should disqualify me on the spot to be herhusband. Indeed, it should consign my miserable soulto eternal incarceration in that large and spaciousbuilding Lehi says is the prison of those who live by\"vain imaginations\" and the \"pride of the world\"(1 Nephi 11:36, 12:18). No wonder that building isat the opposite end of the field from the tree of liferepresenting the love of God! In all that Christ was,He was not everenvious or inflated, never consumed with His own needs. He did not once, not ever, seek His own advantage at the expense of someone else.He delighted in the happiness of others, the happinessHe could bring them. He was forever kind. In a dating and courtship relationship, I would not have you spend five minutes with someone whobelittles you, who is constantly critical of you, whois cruel at your expense and may even call it humor.Life is tough enough without having the person whois supposed to love you leading the assault on yourself-esteem, your sense of dignity, your confidence,and your joy. In this person's care you deserve tofeel physically safe and emotionally secure. Members of the First Presidency have taught that \"any form of physical or mental abuse to any womanis not worthy of any priesthood holder\" and thatno \"man who holds the priesthood of God [should]abuse his wife in any way, [or] demean or injure ortake undue advantage friends, dates, sweethearts, E. Faust, \"The HighestPlace of Honor,\" Ensign, May 1988, 37, and Gordon B. Hinckley, \"Reach Out in Love andKindness,\" Ensign, November 1982, 77). If you are just going for pizza or to play a set oftennis, go with anyone who will provide good,clean fun. But if you are serious, or planning to beserious, please find someone who brings out thebest in you and is not envious of your success. Findsomeone who suffers when you suffer and whofinds his or her happiness in your own. The second segment of this scriptural sermon on love in Moroni 7:45 says that true charity\u2014real love\u2014\"isnot easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoicethnot in iniquity.\" Think of how many arguments couldbe avoided, how many hurt feelings could be spared,how many cold shoulders and silent treatmentscould be ended, and, in a worst-case scenario, howmany breakups and divorces could be avoided if wewere not so easily provoked, if we thought no evilof one another, and if we not only did not rejoicein iniquity but didn't rejoice even in little mistakes. Temper tantrums are not cute even in children; they are despicable in adults, especially adults whoare supposed to love each other. We are too easilyprovoked; we are too inclined to think that ourpartner meant to hurt us\u2014meant to do us evil, soto speak; and in defensive or jealous response wetoo often rejoice when we see them make a mistake and find them in a fault. Let's show some discipline on this one. Act a little more maturely. Bite yourtongue if you have to. \"He that is slow to anger isbetter than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spiritthan he that taketh a city\" (Proverbs 16:32). At leastone difference between a tolerable marriage and agreat one may be that willingness in the latter toallow some things to pass without comment,without response. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 160I mentioned Shakespeare earlier. In a talk on love and romance you might well expect a reference toRomeo and Juliet. But let me refer to a much lessvirtuous story. With Romeo and Juliet the outcomewas a result of innocence gone awry, a kind of sad,heartbreaking mistake between two families thatshould have known better. But in the tale of Othelloand Desdemona the sorrow and destruction iscalculated\u2014it is maliciously driven from thebeginning. Of all the villains in Shakespeare's writing,and perhaps in all of literature, there is no one I loathe so much as I loathe Iago. Even his namesounds evil to me, or at least it has become so. Andwhat ishis evil, and Othello's tragic, near-inexcusable susceptibility to it? It is the violation of Moroni 7and 1 Corinthians 13. Among other things, theysought for evil where none existed, they embracedimaginary iniquity. The villains here rejoiced not\"in the truth.\" Of the innocent Desdemona, Iagosaid, \"I turn her virtue into pitch; / And out of herown goodness make the net / That shall enmeshthem all\" (William Shakespeare, Othello, act 2, scene 3, lines 366-68). Sowing doubt and devilishinnuendo, playing on jealousy and deceit andfinally murderous rage, Iago provokes Othello intotaking Desdemona's life\u2014virtue turned into pitch,goodness twisted into a fatal net. Now, thank heavens, here in Happy Valley this morning we are not talking of infidelity, real orimagined, or of murder; but in the spirit of auniversity education, let's learn the lessons beingtaught. Think the best of each other, especially ofthose you say you love. Assume the good and doubtthe bad. Encourage in yourself what Abraham Lincolncalled \"the better angels of our nature\" (FirstInaugural Address, 4 March 1861). Othello couldhave been saved even in the last moment when hekissed Desdemona and her purity was so evident.\"That [kiss] dost almost persuade / Justice to breakher sword!\" he said (act 5, scene 2, lines 16-17). Well,he would have been spared her death and then hisown suicide if he had broken what he consideredjustice's sword right then and there rather than,figuratively speaking, using it on her. This tragicallysad Elizabethan tale could have had a beautiful,happy ending if just one man, who then influencedanother, had thought no evil, had rejoiced not ininiquity, but had rejoiced in the truth. Thirdly and lastly, the prophets tell us that true love \"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth allthings, endureth all things\" (1 again that is ultimately a description ofChrist's love\u2014He is the great example of one whobore and believed and hoped and endured. We areinvited to do the same in our courtship and in ourmarriage to the best of our ability. Bear up and bestrong. Be hopeful and believing. Some things inlife we have little or no control over. These have tobe endured. Some disappointments have to be livedwith in love and in marriage. These are not thingsanyone wants in life, but sometimes they come.And when they come, we have to bear them; wehave to believe; we have to hope for an end to suchsorrows and difficulty; we have to endure untilthings come right in the end. One of the great purposes of true love is to help each other in these times. No one ought to have to facesuch trials alone. We can endure almost anything ifwe have someone at our side who truly loves us, whois easing the burden and lightening the load. In thisregard, a friend from our BYU faculty, Professor BrentBarlow, told me some years ago about Plimsoll marks. As a youth in England, Samuel Plimsoll was fascinated with watching ships load and unloadtheir cargoes. He soon observed that, regardless ofthe cargo space available, each ship had its maximumcapacity. If a ship exceeded its limit, it would likelysink at sea. In 1868 Plimsoll entered Parliament andpassed a merchant shipping act that, among otherthings, called for making calculations of how mucha ship could carry. As a result, lines were drawn onthe hull of each ship in England. As the cargo wasloaded, the freighter would sink lower and lowerinto the water. When the water level on the side ofthe ship reached the Plimsoll mark, the ship wasconsidered loaded to capacity, regardless of howmuch space remained. As a result, British deaths atsea were greatly reduced. Like ships, people have differing capacities at different times and even different days in their lives. In ourrelationships we need to establish our own Plimsollmarks and help identify them in the lives of thosewe love. Together we need to monitor the load levelsand be helpful in shedding or at least readjustingsome cargo if we see our sweetheart is sinking.Then, when the ship of love is stabilized, we canevaluate long-term what has to continue, what canbe put off until another time, and what can be putoff permanently. Friends, sweethearts, and spousesneed to be able to monitor each other's stress and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 161recognize the different tides and seasons of life. We owe it to each other to declare some limits andthen help jettison some things if emotional healthand the strength of loving relationships are at risk.Remember, pure love \"beareth all things, believethall things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,\"and helps loved ones do the same. Let me close. In Mormon's and Paul's final witnesses, they declare 7:46, 1 Corinthians 13:8). It there throughthick and thin. It endures through sunshine andshadow, through darkest sorrow and on into thelight. It never fails. So Christ loved us, and that is how He hoped we would love each other. In a finalinjunction to all his disciples for all time, He said,\"A new commandment I give unto you, That yelove one another; as I have loved you\" (John 13:34;emphasis added). Of course such Christlike stayingpower in romance and marriage requires more thanany of us really have. It requires something more,an endowment from heaven. Remember Mormon'spromise: that such love\u2014the love we each yearn forand cling to\u2014is \"bestowed\" upon \"true followers ofChrist.\" You want capability, safety, and security indating and romance, in married life and eternity?Be a true disciple of Jesus. Be a genuine, committed,word-and-deed Latter-day Saint. Believe that your faithhas everything to do with your romance, because it does. You separate dating from discipleship at yourperil. Or, to phrase that more positively, Jesus Christ,the Light of the World, is the only lamp by which youcan successfully see the path of love and happinessfor you and for your sweetheart. How should I love thee? As He does, for that way \"never faileth.\" I sotestify and express my love for you and for Him, inthe sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. A UNION OF LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING Elder Marlin K. Jensen Of the Quorum of the Seventy Ensign, Oct. 1994, 46-51 Of the many opportunities for service that come with my calling, in my estimation none exceeds theprivilege of performing a sealing ceremony in oneof the Lord's temples. Whenever I am in a beautifullyappointed sealing room, facing a wholesome andanxious young couple about to make the most sacredof vows with God and with each other, I have thefeeling that nothing I might say could do justice tothe significance of that occasion in their lives. At such times I frequently remember my own wedding day nearly twenty-six years ago and thestrong feelings of love I had for my wife. Iremember also our high expectations for the future.Kathy and I had an ideal in mind that was notnecessarily peculiar to us: we were about to begin acompanionship together that would be unparalleledin the romantic history of Western civilization! Nevertheless, despite our best intentions and efforts, our ideal began to collide with reality shortly afterour brief, inexpensive honeymoon. I cannot speakfor Kathy, but I soon began to feel a small sense ofdisillusionment, a feeling that there was somethingmore to marriage than I seemed capable of producing. One small example from those early days of our marriage will illustrate the challenges we faced. Wewere living in Salt Lake City, where I was attendinglaw school and Kathy was teaching first grade. Underthe stress of being new to the city, our respectiveschools, and each other, our relationship became abit testy. One night at about dinnertime, we had aquarrel that convinced me that I need not hope fornourishment at home. So I left our modest apartmentand walked to the nearest fast-food restaurant, a block away. As I entered the north door of theestablishment, I looked to my right\u2014and much tomy surprise, I saw Kathy entering through the southdoor! We exchanged angry glances and advanced toopposing cash registers to place our orders. Wecontinued to ignore each other as we sat alone onopposite ends of the restaurant, sullenly eating ourevening meals. We then left as we had entered andtook our separate routes home. It wasn't until laterthat we reconciled and laughed together about howinfantile we had been. I realize now that such little tiffs are not uncommon in the early stages of most marriages. However, Ibelieve they are representative of the many obstaclesthat can frequently interfere with the tremendouspotential for fulfillment and happiness that existsin an eternal marriage, potential that too often goesunrealized. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 162As the Restoration unfolded, the Prophet Joseph Smith did not teach the doctrine of eternal marriageuntil several years after the organization of theChurch. When he began to do so, it was selectively.Elder Parley P. Pratt, who had been married civillythirteen years earlier, first heard about the concept ofeternal marriage from the Prophet in Philadelphia in1839. His reaction, as recorded in his autobiography,may be difficult to understand for those of us whohave grown up with the anticipation of marrying ina temple for time and all eternity. This concept wascompletely new to Elder Pratt, however, and he wasoverwhelmed by it: \"I received from [Joseph] the first idea of eternal family organization, and the eternal union of thesexes in those inexpressibly endearing relationshipswhich none but the highly intellectual, the refinedand pure in heart, know how to prize, and whichare at the very foundation of everything worthy tobe called happiness. \"Till then I had learned to esteem kindred affections and sympathies as appertaining solely to thistransitory state, as something from which the heartmust be entirely weaned, in order to be fitted for itsheavenly state. \"It was Joseph Smith who taught me how to prize the endearing relationships of father and mother,husband and wife; of brother and sister, son anddaughter. \"It was from him that I learned that the wife of my bosom might be secured to me for time and alleternity; and that the refined sympathies andaffections which endeared us to each other emanatedfrom the fountain of divine eternal love. It was fromhim that I learned that we might cultivate theseaffections, and grow and increase in the same to alleternity; while the result of our endless union wouldbe an offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven,or the sands of the sea shore. . . . \"I had loved before, but I knew not why. But now I loved\u2014with a pureness\u2014an intensity of elevated,exalted feeling, which would lift my soul from thetransitory things of this grovelling sphere and expandit as the ocean. I felt that God was my heavenlyFather indeed; that Jesus was my brother, and thatthe wife of my bosom was an immortal, eternalcompanion; a kind ministering angel, given to meas a comfort, and a crown of glory for ever and ever.In short, I could now love with the spirit and with theunderstanding also\" (Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979, pp. 297-98). In all of Latter-day Saint literature, I know of no more beautiful or powerful statement than this concerningthe potential for fulfillment and happiness we haveas we begin marriage together in the Lord's way.The opportunity for such a companionship willeventually come to all who live worthy of it. Thinkof the implications of being able to love \"with thespirit and with the understanding also.\" Considerthe power of the idea that of all people on earth, we Latter-day Saints know the most about genuineromantic love and have the greatest opportunity toachieve truly happy and enduring marriages. Will itnot be a memorable day when as a people we arebest known not just for our large families but forour truly exceptional marriages? What are the eternal gospel principles that permit us to court one another and eventually establishmarriages that are happy, fulfilling, and enduring? I will discuss a few truths that I feel are most vital.All of them are closely related to the Savior, histeachings, and the central role he plays in the gospelplan. In fact, if we want to make ourselves intoworthy eternal companions, we can first concentrateon becoming unwavering disciples of the Master. Developing Our Capacity to Love The teachings of Christ suggest that we should beginour search for an eternal companion with greaterconcern about our ability to give love than about ourneed to receive it. Of the Savior, John wrote: \"Welove him, because he first loved us\" (1 John 4:19). Indeed, it may be our own capacity to give love that makes us most lovable. The greater our own personalsubstance is and the deeper our own mental,emotional, and spiritual reserves are, the greater willbe our capacity to nurture and love others, especiallyour companion. President Marion G. Romney of theFirst Presidency posed a question that puts our abilityto genuinely care about others in perspective: \"Howcan we give if there is nothing there? Food for thehungry cannot come from empty shelves. Money toassist the needy cannot come from an empty purse.Support and understanding cannot come from theemotionally starved. Teaching cannot come fromthe unlearned. And most important of all, spiritualguidance cannot come from the spiritually weak\"(Ensign, Nov. 1982, p. 93). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 163Very little love can come from one who is not at peace with himself or herself and God. As Enoslearned, no one can be concerned about the welfareof someone else and give love to another until he orshe has taken care of his or her own soul. Thus, ourpreparation for an eternal marriage must includerepenting, learning, acquiring faith, and developingthe security that comes with a vision of our potentialas children of a Heavenly Father. Only when welove God above all others, as the Savior taught (seeMatt. 22:34-40), will we be capable of offering pure,Christlike love to our companions for all eternity. Virtue Loveth Virtue A very natural and wonderfulconsequence of becoming a personcapable of great love 88:40). If we pursue the goal of an eternal marriage with purity and with both our hearts and our minds, Ibelieve in most cases we will eventually be rewardedwith a companion who is at least our spiritual equaland who will cleave unto intelligence and light as wedo, who will receive wisdom as we receive it, whowill embrace truth as we embrace it, and who willlove virtue as we love it. To spend the eternitieswith a companion who shares the most importantfundamental values with us and who will discussthem, live them, and join in teaching them tochildren is among the most soul-satisfying experiencesof true romantic love. To know that there will besomeone who walks a parallel path of goodness andgrowth with us and yearns for the same eternalvalues and happiness is of great comfort. I witnessed a powerful example of this principle recently as I sealed a young couple in the Salt LakeTemple. After I had performed the sealing ceremonyand the couple had exchanged rings and embraces,I asked them to share their feelings about each otherand the Lord. The new bride spoke first. Her briefremarks expressed both gratitude and emotion asshe told how from her very youngest years she haddesired to keep herself virtuous and had hoped to find a companion who shared her values andrighteous aspirations. She confirmed the goodnessof her new husband by witnessing that he was allshe had hoped for and more. Then the young husband spoke. He, too, was tearful as he shared how at age fourteen he had begun topray to the Lord that the wife of his future, whoevershe might be, would be protected and would keepherself virtuous while preparing for an eternalmarriage. He also told how he had committed himselfagain and again over the years to that same path.Then he expressed his great joy at having met thiswife of his prayers, and he mentioned his highhopes for a truly exceptional marriage. This is the kind of relationship that ourHeavenly Father wishes for all of hischildren. None of his faithful childrenwill miss out on the opportunity foreternal marriage with one who isequally prepared for eternal life. Virtue loveth virtue! Truth embraceth truth! Bridling Passions The seeds of fulfilling romantic love are plantedduring courtship. During this time we should bemindful and appreciative of the truth and level ofunderstanding reflected in Alma's timeless counsel tohis son, Shiblon: \"See that ye bridle all your passions,that ye may be filled with love\" (Alma 38:12). Those of you who have grown up around horses, saddles, and bridles will perceive that Alma was notsuggesting to Shiblon that he eradicate his passionsbut rather that he control or channel them for thevery worthwhile purpose of being filled with love.During courtship, this control means deferringphysical relations until they can properly blossom inmarriage. But restraint and moderation are neededeven in marriage, for the gospel teaches that \"untoevery kingdom is given a law; and unto every lawthere are certain bounds also and conditions\" (D&C 88:38). Married Latter-day Saints must remember that not everything the world condones and encourages inthe expressing of romantic love has a place in aneternal marriage. In the words of Elder Boyd K. Packer,\"the greatest deception foisted upon the humanrace in our day is . . . overemphasis of physicalgratification as it is related to romantic love. It ismerely a repetition of the same delusion that hasbeen impressed on every generation in ages past. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 164 Very little love can come from one who is not at peace with himself or herself and God.When we learn that physical gratification is only incident to, and not the compelling force of loveitself, we have made a supreme discovery\" ( Eternal Love, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973, p. 15). As a righteous couple grow and mature in their love,they will come to know that the fine blending of thespiritual and physical dimensions of their relationshipforms a solid foundation for their eternal union. Marriage Is a Priority Because the restored gospel reveals that eternal lifewith our Heavenly Father will be lived in familyunits, we would be wise to place a high priority inthis life on preparing for and developing rewardingmarriage relationships and roles as effective fathersand mothers. If we have been regarding too lightlythe inspired counsel of the prophets on marriage,we may want to reorient our thinking. All theprophets in recent years have made powerfulstatements affirming that all who have theopportunity should work to attain eternal marriageand develop an eternal family unit. Nevertheless, Satan will seek to have us do otherwise, and enticing voices will speak to us of worldlyachievements and acquisitions that may lead us ondangerous detours from which we can return onlywith great effort. Small, seemingly insignificantchoices along the way will have large consequencesthat will determine our eventual destiny. My wife and I made an important choice early in our marriage when I was struggling as a first-yearlaw student and she was overwhelmed by her firstteaching position. We rarely met in all our individualcomings and goings, and our relationship with eachother was suffering noticeably. Even Sundays were burdensome as we tried to fulfill our Church callings and catch up on studies andschool preparation. Finally, we sat down one eveningand decided that if our marriage was a very importantpart of our lives, we had better start acting like it.We agreed to completely honor the Sabbath byrefraining from all work, including our studies, andto devote ourselves to building a stronger marriage.We experienced an immediate surge in our feelingstoward each other and noticeable improvement inother areas, including my grades and Kathy'steaching. Twenty-six years later, we are still facedwith many similar choices and issues. I hope andpray that we are resolving them in favor of thethings that matter most.Perfection Is Gradual The Savior attained perfection by the followingprocess: \"He received not of the fulness at first, butcontinued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness\" (D&C 93:13). A recognition that the Savior's perfection came gradually is comforting to two imperfect beings whoare trying to make their marriage perfect. In myown case, I recently ventured to ask my wife a veryrisky question: \"How am I doing?\" I was encouraged by her reply: \"Well, I think you are nicer than you used to be.\" I believe that those of you who are walking around with a checklist of desirable fully perfected attributesin a prospective companion may come off empty-handed. Most of those attributes will be only inembryo when you are courting and will take mostof a lifetime to perfect. Commitment Another gospel principle that significantly contributesto development of an eternal marriage is absolutecommitment to our companions, as described bythis scripture: \"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thyheart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else\"(D&C 42:22). Obviously, this also means that \"Thou shalt love thy husband with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto himand none else.\" None of us knows when we marrywhat life will bring in terms of health challenges,financial setbacks, or even transgressions. Givingourselves to one another in an eternal marriage isan unconditional giving of the whole person for thewhole journey. Recently, I visited with a widower as he stood bravely at the side of his wife's casket, surroundedby several handsome and stalwart sons. This manand his wife had been married for fifty-three years,during the last six of which she had been seriouslyill with a terminal kidney disease. He had providedthe 24-hour care she required until his own healthwas in jeopardy. I expressed my admiration for himand the great love and care he had given his wife. I felt compelled to ask, \"How did you do it?\" It was easy, he replied, when he remembered that fifty-three years earlier, he had knelt at an altar inthe temple and made a covenant with the Lord andwith his bride. \"I wanted to keep it,\" he said. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 165In an eternal marriage, the thought of ending what began with a covenant between God and each othersimply has little place. When challenges come andour individual weaknesses are revealed, the remedyis to repent, improve, and apologize, not to separateor divorce. When we make covenants with the Lordand our eternal companion, we should do everythingin our power to honor the terms. Loving Kindness A final gospel truth that will contribute to ourunderstanding of and hence the quality of ourmarriages relates to the degree in which we involvethe Savior in our relationships as husbands and wives.As designed by our Heavenly Father, marriage consistsof our first entering into a covenant relationshipwith Christ and then with each other. He and histeachings must be the focal point of our togetherness.As we become more like him and grow closer to him,we will naturally become more loving and growcloser to each other. I have personally felt the mellowing influence of Christ's example and teachings in my own marriage.I can vividly recall how easy it was to be accusingand judgmental and to find fault in the early yearsof my marriage. When I came home in the eveningshaving set the whole world in order, I would oftenwonder why Kathy in overseeing our young childrenwas struggling with her few square feet in the kitchen.Then one day a wise teacher shared with me Nephi'stouching description of the Savior: \"And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourgehim, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and hesuffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he sufferethit, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men\" (1 Ne. 19:9). I suppose \"loving kindness\" is a synonym for charity, or the pure love of Christ. I know that it is anabsolutely essential ingredient in an eternal marriageand that romantic love cannot be separated from itor flourish without it. Loving kindness is a commonthread in all the exceptional marriages with which I am acquainted, and it is the remedy for almost allmarital problems. I have only begun to scratch the surface of my topic; I have only hinted at discussing sacrifice, forgiveness,agency, and children, all of which are vital elementsin a successful eternal marriage. I could never hopeto do justice to doctrines and truths which, iffollowed, will enable us as husbands and wives to\"pass by the angels, and the gods, which are setthere, to [our] exaltation and glory in all things, ashath been sealed upon [our] heads, which glory shallbe a fulness and a continuation of the seeds foreverand ever\" (D&C 132:19). If we will strive to love with understanding, the Spirit will teach us \"all things what [we] should do\"(2 Ne. 32:5) to achieve an eternal marriage pleasingto the Lord. Under the influence of the Spirit, oursympathy and love for our eternal companions willdeepen, and we will come to know a happiness and contentment in marriage that the world willnever know. No matter what our backgrounds or the quality of marriage our grandparents or parents enjoyed, wecan in time and with the Lord's help achieve theideal. If our heritage includes a spiritually strongfamily with healthy marriages and close relationships,we will be able to build and even improve on thefoundation that has been laid. If our heritage is notas strong, we can resolve that our children willreceive a richer legacy. Above all, I hope that we will vow never to be satisfied with a mediocre marriage. Not long ago afriend told me that one of his young children hadasked, \"Do you think Grandpa ever kisses Grandma?\"I certainly hope my wife and I are sufficiently in loveand demonstrative about it that our grandchildrenwill not have to wonder. We can never afford to letour relationships become merely mutual tolerationor accommodation. Eternal marriage is godlike marriage. The term eternal describes the quality of marriage as much as its duration. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALLOVE 166MARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY SELECTED TEACHINGS Eternal Increase First Presidency\u2014Heber J. Grant, Anthony W. Ivins, Charles W. Nibley \"Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes, and even as theinfant son of an earthly father and mother is capablein due time of becoming a man, so that undevelopedoffspring of celestial parentage is capable, byexperience through ages and aeons, of evolving intoa God\" (in Clark, Messages of the First Presidency, 5:244). Elder Melvin J. Ballard \"What do we mean by endless or eternal increase? We mean that through the righteousness andfaithfulness of men and women who keep thecommandments of God they will come forth withcelestial bodies, fitted and prepared to enter intotheir great, high and eternal glory in the celestialkingdom of God; and unto them through theirpreparation, there will come spirit children. I don'tthink that is very difficult to comprehend. The natureof the offspring is determined by the nature of thesubstance that flows in the veins of the being. Whenblood flows in the veins of the being the offspringwill be what blood produces, which is tangible fleshand bone; but when that which flows in the veinsis spirit matter, a substance which is more refinedand pure and glorious than blood, the offspring ofsuch beings will be spirit children. By that I meanthey will be in the image of the parents. They willhave a spirit body and have a spark of the eternal ordivine that always did exist in them\" (Melvin J.Ballard\u2014Crusader for Righteousness, 211). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"Mortal persons who overcome all things and gain an ultimate exaltation will live eternally in thefamily unit and have spirit children, thus becomingEternal Fathers and Eternal Mothers. (D&C132:19-32.) Indeed, the formal pronouncement ofthe Church, issued by the First Presidency and theCouncil of the Twelve, states: 'So far as the stages ofeternal progression and attainment have been madeknown through divine revelation, we are tounderstand that only resurrected and glorified beingscan become parents of spirit offspring.' (Man: His Origin and Destiny, p. 129.)\" (Mormon Doctrine, 517). The New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage President Brigham Young \"We understand that we are to be made kings and priests unto God; now if I be made the king andlawgiver to my family, and if I have many sons, Ishall become the father of many fathers, for theywill have sons, and their sons will have sons, and soon, from generation to generation, and, in this way,I may become the father of many fathers, or theking of many kings. This will constitute every mana prince, king, lord, or whatever the Father sees fitto confer upon us. \"In this way we can become king of kings, and lord of lords, or father of fathers, or prince of princes,and this is the only course, for another man is notgoing to raise up a kingdom for you\" (in Discourses of Brigham Young, 195). \"The whole subject of the marriage relation is notin my reach, nor in any other man's reach on thisearth. It is without beginning of days or end ofyears; it is a hard matter to reach. We can tell somethings with regard to it; it lays the foundation forworlds, for angels, and for the Gods; for intelligentbeings to be crowned with glory, immortality, andeternal lives. In fact, it is the thread which runsfrom the beginning to the end of the holy Gospelof Salvation\u2014of the Gospel of the Son of God; it isfrom eternity to eternity\" (in Discourses of Brigham Young, 195).The ultimate purpose of all we teach is to unite parents and children in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they are happy at home, sealed in an eternal marriage. \u2014President Boyd K. Packer ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL167President Boyd K. Packer \"The ultimate purpose of all we teach is to unite parents and children in faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,that they are happy at home, sealed in an eternalmarriage, linked to their generations, and assured of exaltation in the presence of our HeavenlyFather\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 8; orEnsign, May 1995, 8). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"If righteous men have power through the gospel and its crowning ordinance of celestial marriage tobecome kings and priests to rule in exaltation forever,it follows that the women by their side (withoutwhom they cannot attain exaltation) will be queensand priestesses. (Rev. 1:6; 5:10.) Exaltation growsout of the eternal union of a man and his wife. Ofthose whose marriage endures in eternity, the Lordsays, 'Then shall they be gods' (D&C 132:20); that is, each of them, the man and the woman, will be a god. As such they will rule over their dominionsforever\" (Mormon Doctrine, 613). \"Marriages performed in the temples for time andeternity, by virtue of the sealing keys restored byElijah, are called celestial marriages. The participating parties become husband and wife in this mortal life,and if after their marriage they keep all the termsand conditions of this order of the priesthood, theycontinue on as husband and wife in the celestialkingdom of God. \"If the family unit continues, then by virtue of that fact the members of the family have gained eternallife (exaltation), the greatest of all the gifts of God, forby definition exaltation consists in the continuationof the family unit in eternity. Those so inheritingare the sons and daughters of God, the members ofhis family, those who have made their callings andelections sure. They are joint-heirs with Christ to allthat the Father hath, and they receive the fulness ofthe glory of the Father, becoming gods in their ownright. (D&C 132; Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 2, pp. 58-99.)\" (Mormon Doctrine, 117). Those Who Do Not Marry President Lorenzo Snow \"There is no Latter-day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because ofhaving failed to do certain things when opportunitieswere not furnished him or her. In other words, if ayoung man or a young woman has no opportunityof getting married, and they live faithful lives up to the time of their death, they will have all theblessings, exaltation, and glory that any man orwoman will have who had this opportunity andimproved it. That is sure and positive\" ( Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, 138). Elder Richard G. Scott \"If you are single and haven't identified a solid prospect for celestial marriage, live for it. Pray for it.Expect it in the timetable of the Lord. Do notcompromise your standards in any way that wouldrule out that blessing on this or the other side of theveil. The Lord knows the intent of your heart. Hisprophets have stated that you will have that blessingas you consistently live to qualify for it\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1999, 33; or Ensign, May 1999, 27). MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE President Spencer W. Kimball President of the ChurchIn 1976 Devotional Speeches of the Year, 142-55 I have warned the youth of Zion against the sins andvices so prevalent in our society\u2014those of sexualimpurity and all of its many ugly approaches. I havespoken of immodesty in dress and actions as one ofthe softening processes of Lucifer. I hereby expressappreciation to the many who have carefullyresponded to those exhortations and rewarn thosewho have ignored them. I spoke plainly, warning youth of the pitfalls of petting and of all the other perversions into whichyoung men and women sometimes fall. I haveendeavored, also, to give hope to those who mighthave stepped over the bounds of propriety, and Ioutlined to them the path by which total repentancemight bring them to forgiveness. I have warned the youth against the many hazards of interfaith marriage, and with all the power Ipossessed, I warned young people to avoid thesorrows and disillusionments which come from ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 168marrying out of the Church and the unhappy situations which almost invariably result when a believer marries an unbelieving spouse. I havepointed out the demands of the Church upon itsmembers in time, energy, and funds; the deepnessof the spiritual ties which tighten after marriage andas the family comes; the antagonisms that naturallyfollow such mismating; the fact that these and manyother reasons argue eloquently for marriage withinthe Church, where husband and wife have commonbackgrounds, common ideals and standards, commonbeliefs, hopes, and objectives, and, above all, wheremarriage may be eternalized through righteousentry into the holy temple. Today, it is my hope to follow with a discussion of family life. This topic is not new nor is it spectacular,but it is vital. Marriage is relevant in every life, andfamily life is the basis of our existence. Marital Happiness and Unhappiness The ugly dragon of divorce has entered into oursocial life. Little known to our grandparents and noteven common among our parents, this cancer hascome to be so common in our own day that nearlyevery family has been cursed by its destructivemachinations. This is one of the principal tools ofSatan to destroy faith, through breaking up happyhomes and bringing frustration of life and distortionof thought. Honorable, happy, and successful marriage is surely the principal goal of every normal person. One whowould purposely or neglectfully avoid its seriousimplications is not only not normal but is frustratinghis own program. There are a few people who marryfor spite or marry for wealth or marry on therebound after having been jilted. How distorted isthe thinking of such an one! Marriage is perhaps the most vital of all the decisions and has the most far-reaching effects, for it has todo not only with immediate happiness, but alsowith eternal joys. It affects not only the two peopleinvolved, but their families and particularly theirchildren and their children's children down throughthe many generations. It is absolutely appalling, the number of children today who are growing up in our society who donot have two parents, a father and a mother, andneither one is totally sufficient, if two could be had.In selecting a companion for life and for eternity,certainly the most careful planning and thinkingand praying and fasting should be done to be surethat, of all the decisions, this one must not be wrong.In true marriage there must be a union of minds as well as of hearts. Emotions must not whollydetermine decisions, but the mind and the heart,strengthened by fasting and prayer and seriousconsideration, will give one a maximum chance ofmarital happiness. Marriage is not easy; it is not simple, as evidenced by the ever-mounting divorce rate. Exact figuresastound us. The following ones come from Salt Lake County [prior to 1976], which are probablysomewhere near average. There were 832 marriagesin a single month, and there were 414 divorces.That is half as many divorces as marriages. Therewere 364 temple marriages, and of the templemarriages about 10 percent were dissolved bydivorce. This is substantially better than the average,but we are chagrined that there should be anydivorce following a temple marriage. We are grateful that this one survey reveals that about 90 percent of the temple marriages hold fast.Because of this, we recommend that people marrythose who are of the same racial backgroundgenerally, and of somewhat the same economic andsocial and educational background (some of thoseare not an absolute necessity, but preferred), andabove all, the same religious background, withoutquestion. In spite of the most favorable matings,the evil one still takes a monumental toll and is thecause for many broken homes and frustrated lives. With all conditions as nearly ideal as possible, there are still people who terminate their marriages for thereason of \"incompatibility.\" We see so many showsand read so much fiction and come in contact withso many society scandals that the people in generalcome to think of \"marrying and giving in marriage,\"divorcing and remarrying, as the normal patterns. The divorce itself does not constitute the entire evil, but the very acceptance of divorce as a cure is also a serious sin of this generation. Because a programor a pattern is universally accepted is not evidencethat it is right. Marriage never was easy. It maynever be. It brings with it sacrifice, sharing, and a demand for great selflessness. Many of the TV screen shows and stories of fiction end with marriage: \"They lived happily ever after.\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 169Since nearly all of us have experienced divorce among our close friends or relatives, we have cometo realize that divorce is not a cure for difficulty, butis merely an escape, and a weak one. We have come to realize also that the mere performance of aceremony does not bring happiness and a successfulmarriage. Happiness does not come by pressing abutton, as does the electric light; happiness is a stateof mind and comes from within. It must be earned.It cannot be purchased with money; it cannot betaken for nothing. Some think of happiness as a glamorous life of ease, luxury, and constant thrills; but true marriage isbased on a happiness which is more than that, onewhich comes from giving, serving, sharing, sacrificing,and selflessness. Two people coming from different backgrounds soon learn after the ceremony is performed that starkreality must be faced. There is no longer a life offantasy or of make-believe; we must come out ofthe clouds and put our feet firmly on the earth.Responsibility must be assumed and new dutiesmust be accepted. Some personal freedoms must be relinquished and many adjustments, unselfishadjustments, must be made. One comes to realize very soon after the marriage that the spouse has weaknesses not previouslyrevealed or discovered. The virtues which wereconstantly magnified during courtship now growrelatively smaller, and the weaknesses which seemedso small and insignificant during courtship nowgrow to sizable proportions. The hour has come forunderstanding hearts, for self-appraisal, and for goodcommon sense, reasoning, and planning. The habitsof years now show themselves; the spouse may bestingy or prodigal, lazy or industrious, devout orirreligious, may be kind and cooperative or petulantand cross, demanding or giving, egotistical or self-effacing. The in-law problem comes closer into focus,and the relationships of the spouses to them isagain magnified. Often there is an unwillingness to settle down and to assume the heavy responsibilities that immediatelyare there. Economy is reluctant to replace lavishliving, and the young people seem often too eager\"to keep up with the Joneses.\" There is often anunwillingness to make the financial adjustmentsnecessary. Young wives are often demanding that all the luxuries formerly enjoyed in the prosperoushomes of their successful fathers be continued intheir own homes. Some of them are quite willing to help earn that lavish living by continuingemployment after marriage. They consequentlyleave the home, where their duty lies, to pursueprofessional or business pursuits, thus establishingan economy that becomes stabilized so that itbecomes very difficult to yield toward the normalfamily life. Through both spouses working,competition rather than cooperation enters thefamily. Two weary workers return home with tautnerves, individual pride, increased independence,and then misunderstandings arise. Little frictionspyramid into monumental ones. Frequently, spousessinfully return to new and old romances, and finallythe seemingly inevitable break comes with a divorce,with its heartaches, bitterness, disillusionments,and always scars. While marriage is difficult, and discordant and frustrated marriages are common, yet real, lastinghappiness is possible, and marriage can be more anexultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive.This is within the reach of every couple, every person.\"Soul mates\" are fiction and an illusion; and whileevery young man and young woman will seek withall diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate withwhom life can be most compatible and beautiful,yet it is certain that almost any good man and anygood woman can have happiness and a successfulmarriage if both are willing to pay the price. There is a never-failing formula which will guarantee to every couple a happy and eternal marriage; butlike all formulas, the principal ingredients must notbe left out, reduced, or limited. The selection beforecourting and then the continued courting after themarriage process are equally important, but notmore important than the marriage itself, the successof which depends upon the two individuals\u2014notupon one, but upon two. In a marriage commenced and based upon reasonable standards as already mentioned, there are nocombinations of power which can destroy it exceptthe power within either or both of the spousesthemselves; and they must assume the responsibilitygenerally. Other people and agencies may influencefor good or bad. Financial, social, political, and othersituations may seem to have a bearing; but themarriage depends first and always on the two spouseswho can always make their marriage successful andhappy if they are determined, unselfish, andrighteous. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 170The formula is simple; the ingredients are few, though there are many amplifications of each. First, there must be the proper approach toward marriage, which contemplates the selection of aspouse who reaches as nearly as possible the pinnacleof perfection in all the matters which are ofimportance to the individuals. And then those twoparties must come to the altar in the temple realizingthat they must work hard toward this successfuljoint living. Second, there must be a great unselfishness, forgetting self and directing all of the family life and allpertaining thereunto to the good of the family,subjugating self. Third, there must be continued courting and expressions of affection, kindness, and considerationto keep love alive and growing. Fourth, there must be a complete living of the commandments of the Lord as defined in thegospel of Jesus Christ. With these ingredients properly mixed and continually kept functioning, it is quite impossiblefor unhappiness to come, misunderstandings tocontinue, or breaks to occur. Divorce attorneys wouldneed to transfer to other fields and divorce courtswould be padlocked. Unselfishness in Marriage Two individuals approaching the marriage altar mustrealize that to attain the happy marriage whichthey hope for, they must know that marriage is nota legal coverall; but it means sacrifice, sharing, andeven a reduction of some personal liberties. It meanslong, hard economizing. It means children whobring with them financial burdens, service burdens,care and worry burdens; but also it means thedeepest and sweetest emotions of all. Before marriage, each individual is quite free to go and come as he pleases, to organize and plan hislife as it seems best, to make all decisions with selfas the central point. Sweethearts should realize beforethey take the vows that each must accept literallyand fully that the good of the little new familymust always be superior to the good of either spouse.Each party must eliminate the \"I\" and the \"my\"and substitute therefore \"we\" and \"our.\" Everydecision must take into consideration that there aretwo or more affected by it. As she approaches majordecisions now, the wife will be concerned as to theeffect they will have upon the parents, the children,the home, and their spiritual lives. His choice ofoccupation, his social life, his friends, his everyinterest must now be considered in the light that heis only a part of a family, that the totalness of thegroup must be considered. Every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or the other or both parties to a marriagecontract. Someone is thinking of self\u2014comforts,conveniences, freedoms, luxuries, or ease.Sometimes the ceaseless pinpricking of an unhappy,discontented, and selfish spouse can finally add upto serious physical violence. Sometimes people aregoaded to the point where they erringly feel justifiedin doing the things which are so wrong. Nothing,of course, justifies sin. Sometimes a wife or a husband feels neglected, mistreated, and ignored until he or she wronglyfeels justified in adding to the errors. If each spousesubmits to frequent self-analysis and measures hisown imperfections by the yardstick of perfectionand the Golden Rule, and if each spouse sets aboutto correct self in every deviation found by suchanalysis rather than to set about to correct thedeviations in the other party, then transformationcomes and happiness is the result. There are manypharisaic people who marry who should memorizethe parable of the Savior in Luke\u2014people who pratetheir own virtues and pile up their own qualities ofgoodness and put them on the scales against theweaknesses of the spouse. They say, \"I fast twice aweek; I give tithes of all I possess\" (see Luke 18:12). For every friction, there is a cause; and whenever there is unhappiness, each should search self to findthe cause or at least that portion of the cause whichoriginated in that self. A marriage may not always be even and incidentless, but it can be one of great peace. A couple may havepoverty, illness, disappointment, failures, and evendeath in the family, but even these will not rob themof their peace. The marriage can be a successful oneso long as selfishness does not enter in. Troubles andproblems will draw parents together into unbreakableunions if there is total unselfishness there. Duringthe depression of the l930s there was a definitedrop in divorce. Poverty, failures, disappointment\u2014they tied parents together. Adversity can cementrelationships which prosperity can destroy. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 171The marriage that is based upon selfishness is almost certain to fail. The one who marries for wealth orthe one who marries for prestige or social plane iscertain to be disappointed. The one who marries tosatisfy vanity and pride or who marries to spite orto show up another person is fooling only himself.But the one who marries to give happiness as wellas receive it, to give service as well as to receive it,and who looks after the interests of the two andthen the family as it comes will have a good chancethat the marriage will be a happy one. Many people there are, though, who do not find divorce attorneys and who do not end theirmarriages, but who have permitted their marriagesto grow stale and weak and cheap. There are spouseswho have fallen from the throne of adoration andworship and are in the low state of mere jointoccupancy of the home, joint sitters at the table,joint possessors of certain things which cannot beeasily divided. These people are on the path thatleads to trouble. These people will do well toreevaluate, to renew their courting, to express theiraffection, to acknowledge kindnesses, and to increasetheir consideration so their marriage again canbecome beautiful, sweet, and growing. Love is like a flower, and, like the body, it needs constant feeding. The mortal body would soon beemaciated and die if there were not frequentfeedings. The tender flower wouldwither and die without food and water.And so love, also, cannot be expectedto last forever unless it is continuallyfed with portions of love, themanifestation of esteem and admiration, the expressions of gratitude, and theconsideration of unselfishness. Total unselfishness is sure to accomplish another factor in successful marriage. If one is forever seekingthe interests, comforts, and happiness of the other,the love found in courtship and cemented inmarriage will grow into mighty proportions. Manycouples permit their marriages to become stale andtheir love to grow cold like old bread or worn-outjokes or cold gravy. Certainly the foods most vitalfor love are consideration, kindness, thoughtfulness,concern, expressions of affection, embraces ofappreciation, admiration, pride, companionship,confidence, faith, partnership, equality, anddependence.To be really happy in marriage, one must have acontinued faithful observance of the commandmentsof the Lord. No one, single or married, was eversublimely happy unless he was righteous. There aretemporary satisfactions and camouflaged situationsfor the moment, but permanent, total happinesscan come only through cleanliness and worthiness.One who has a pattern of religious life with deepreligious convictions can never be happy in aninactive life. The conscience will continue to afflict,unless it has been seared, in which case the marriageis already in jeopardy. A stinging conscience canmake life most unbearable. Inactivity is destructiveto marriage, especially where the parties are inactivein varying degrees. Religious differences are the most trying and among the most unsolvable of all differences. Divinity of Marriage Institution Marriage is ordained of God. It is not merely a socialcustom. Without proper and successful marriage,one will never be exalted. Read the words of yourLord, that it is right and proper to be married. That being true, the thoughtful and intelligent Latter-day Saint will plan carefully his life to be surethere are no impediments placed in the way. To makeone serious mistake, one may place in the wayobstacles which may never be removed and which may block the way to eternal life andgodhood\u2014our ultimate destiny. If twopeople love the Lord more than theirown lives and then love each othermore than their own lives, workingtogether in total harmony with thegospel program as their basicstructure, they are sure to have this great happiness. When a husband and wife gotogether frequently to the holy temple, kneel inprayer together in their home with their family, gohand in hand to their religious meetings, keep theirlives wholly chaste, mentally and physically, so thattheir whole thoughts and desires and loves are allcentered in the one being, their companion, andboth work together for the upbuilding of thekingdom of God, then happiness is at its pinnacle. Sometimes in marriage there are other cleavings, in spite of the fact that the Lord said: \"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.\" [D&C 42:22] ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 172 Love is like a flower, and, like the body, it needs constant feeding.This means just as completely that \"thou shalt love thy husband with all thy heart and shall cleave unto himand none else.\" Frequently, people continue to cleave unto their mothers and their fathers and theirchums. Sometimes mothers will not relinquish thehold they have had upon their children; andhusbands as well as wives return to their mothersand fathers to obtain advice and counsel and toconfide, whereas cleaving should be to the wife inmost things, and all intimacies should be kept ingreat secrecy and privacy from others. Couples do well to immediately find their own home, separate and apart from that of the in-lawson either side. The home may be very modest andunpretentious, but still it is an independent domicile.Your married life should become independent ofher folks and his folks. You love them more thanever; you cherish their counsel; you appreciate theirassociation; but you live your own lives, beinggoverned by your decisions, by your own prayerfulconsiderations after you have received the counselfrom those who should give it. To cleave does notmean merely to occupy the same home; it means toadhere closely, to stick together: \"Wherefore, it is lawful that . . . they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answerthe end of its creation; \"And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world wasmade.\" [D&C 49:16-17] Our own record is not pleasing. Of 31,037 marriages, our records say only l4,169 were in the temple foreternity. This is 46 percent. There were 7,556 membersmarried out of the Church. This is terribly disturbingto us. This is 24 percent, which means that about9,000, or 30 percent, apparently thought so little ofthemselves and their posterity, they married out of thetemple, which could give them a key to eternal life.Is it possible they do not know, or do they not care? Of course, most such people who marry out of the Church and temple do not weigh the matter. Thesurvey I mentioned disclosed the fact that onlyabout one out of seven nonmember spouses wouldbe converted and baptized into the Church. This isa great loss. It means that in many cases there isnot only a loss of the unbaptized spouse, but also ofthe children and even sometimes the other spouse. We love those few who join the Church after marriage. We praise them and honor them, but theodds are against us. According to the figures givenabove, this means that nearly 6,500 of the newmarriages may never find both parties finally joiningthe Church to make the family totally united. Thisgrieves us very much. The total program of the Lordfor the family cannot be enjoyed fully if the peopleare unequally yoked in marriage. We call upon all youth to make such a serious, strong resolution to have a temple marriage thattheir determination will provide for them the richpromises of eternal marriage with its accompanyingjoys and happiness. This would please the Lord, whocounts on you so heavily. He has said that eternallife can be had only in the way he has planned it. May I quote a word or two from the scriptures before closing. \"And a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a newname written, which no man knoweth save he thatreceiveth it. The new name is the key word.\" [D&C 130:11] It is the normal thing to marry. It was arranged by God in the beginning. One is not wholly normal who does not want to be married. Remember: \"Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.\"[1 Corinthians 11:11] No one can reject this covenant (of celestial marriage) and reach the eternal kingdom of God. This is certain. \"In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; \"And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning thenew and everlasting covenant of marriage]; \"And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\"He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom.\" [D&C 131:1-4] \"For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not thatcovenant, then are ye damned.\" [D&C 132:4] And damned means stopped in progress. These are the words of the Lord. They were said directly to us. There is no question about them. \"And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of myglory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof mustand shall abide the law .... ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 173\"Therefore, when they are out of the world [after they have died] they neither marry nor are given inmarriage; but are appointed angels in heaven; whichangels are ministering servants, to minister for thosewho are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding,and an eternal weight of glory. \"For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately andsingly, without exaltation, in their saved condition,to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods,but are angels of God forever and ever.\" [D&C132:6, 16-17] And one closing thought:\"Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word,saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltationand sitteth upon his throne. . . . \"Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved.\" [D&C132:29, 32] Brothers and sisters, may I say, this is the word of the Lord. It is very, very serious, and there is nobodywho should argue with the Lord. He made the earth;he made the people. He knows the conditions. Heset the program, and we are not intelligent enoughor smart enough to be able to argue him out of theseimportant things. He knows what is right and true. We ask you to think of these things. All of you students, be sure that your marriage is right. Be surethat your life is right. Be sure that your part of themarriage is carried forward properly. Now I ask the Lord to bless you. These things worry us considerably because there are too many divorcesand they are increasing. It has come to be a commonthing to talk about divorce. The minute there is a little crisis or a little argument in the family, wetalk about divorce, and we rush and see an attorney.This is not the way of the Lord. We should go backand adjust our problems and make our marriagecompatible and sweet and blessed. I pray the Lord will bless each one who faces decisions before marriage and after marriage. I askhis blessings upon each one of you and give youmy testimony that this Church is true and divine,in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.WHAT GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER President Gordon B. Hinckley First Counselor in the First Presidency In Conference Report, Apr. 1991, 93-98; or Ensign, May 1991, 71-74 Granddaughters' Wedding Ceremonies Ten days ago, I had a beautiful and touchingexperience in the Salt Lake Temple, the buildingimmediately to the east of this tabernacle. There inthat holy sanctuary I had the privilege of sealing inmarriage, in two separate but consecutive ceremonies,two beautiful young women who are twins, each toa handsome and able young man of her choice.That evening a double wedding reception was heldwhere hundreds of friends came to express theirlove and good wishes. Mothers often shed tears at a wedding ceremony. Sisters also, and sometimes fathers. Seldom dograndparents show any emotion. But these beautifulgirls were my own granddaughters, and I mustconfess that this old grandfather choked up andhad a difficult time. I don't understand why.Certainly it was a happy occasion, a fulfillment ofdreams and prayers. Perhaps my tears were really anexpression of joy and of gratitude to God for theselovely brides and their handsome young husbands.In sacred promises, they pledged their love andloyalty one to another for time and all eternity. Marriage Is Ordained of God How wonderful a thing is marriage under the planof our Eternal Father, a plan provided in His divinewisdom for the happiness and security of Hischildren and the continuity of the race. He is our Creator, and He designed marriage from the beginning. At the time of Eve's creation, \"Adamsaid, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: . . . \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and theyshall be one flesh\" (Genesis 2:23-24). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 174Paul wrote to the Corinthian Saints, \"Neither is the man without the woman, neither the womanwithout the man, in the Lord\" (1 Corinthians 11:11). In modern revelation the Lord has said, \"And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marryis not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained ofGod unto man\" (D&C 49:15). President Joseph F. Smith once declared \"that no man can be saved and exalted in the kingdom of Godwithout the woman, and no woman can reachperfection and exaltation in the kingdom of God,alone. . . . God instituted marriage in the beginning.He made man in His own image and likeness, maleand female, and in their creation it was designedthat they should be united together in sacred bondsof marriage, and one is not perfect without theother\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1913, p. 118). Surely no one reading the scriptures, both ancient and modern, can doubt the divine concept ofmarriage. The sweetest feelings of life, the mostgenerous and satisfying impulses of the humanheart, find expression in a marriage that standspure and unsullied above the evil of the world. Such a marriage, I believe, is the desire\u2014the hoped- for, the longed-for, the prayed-for desire\u2014of menand women everywhere. Single Brethren and Sisters While riding a plane some time ago, I picked up acopy of the New York Magazine. As I thumbed through it, I came to a section titled \"Strictly Personals.\" Icounted 159 advertisements placed by lonely menand women seeking partners. It was evident thatthose who had placed the ads had labored to castthemselves in the best light possible. I wish I hadtime to read some of them to you. You would enjoythem. There was nothing of an unseemly nature. Itwas easy to sense that behind these witty and cleverdescriptions was much of sadness and loneliness, a great desire to find an amiable companion withwhom to walk the road of life. My heart reaches out to those among us, especially our single sisters, who long for marriage and cannotseem to find it. Our Father in Heaven reserves for them every promised blessing. I have far lesssympathy for the young men, who under thecustoms of our society have the prerogative to takethe initiative in these matters but in so many casesfail to do so. Strong words have been spoken tothem in the past by Presidents of this church.Marital Bliss Marriage usually means children and family. Can ayoung mother, having given birth to her first child,doubt the divinity and the wonder and the miracle ofit all? Can a young father, looking upon his newbornson or daughter, sense other than that this is a partof the design of the Almighty? Of course, all in marriage is not bliss. Years ago I clipped these words from a column written byJenkins Lloyd Jones: \"There seems to be a superstition among many thousands of our young who hold hands and smoochin the drive-ins that marriage is a cottage surroundedby perpetual hollyhocks to which a perpetuallyyoung and handsome husband comes home to aperpetually young and ravishing wife. When thehollyhocks wither and boredom and bills appearthe divorce courts are jammed. . . . \"Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting thathe has been robbed\" (\"Big Rock Candy Mountains,\"Deseret News, 12 June 1973, p. A4). Pain Is Part of the Process Stormy weather occasionally hits every household.Connected inevitably with the whole process is muchof pain\u2014physical, mental, and emotional. There ismuch of stress and struggle, of fear and worry. Formost, there is the ever-haunting battle of economics.There seems never to be enough money to coverthe needs of a family. Sickness strikes periodically.Accidents happen. The hand of death may reach inwith dread stealth to take a precious one. But all of this seems to be part of the processes of family life. Few indeed are those who get alongwithout experiencing some of it. It has been so fromthe beginning. Cain quarreled with Abel and thendid a terrible thing. How great must have been thegrief in the hearts of their parents, Adam and Eve. Love for Rebellious Children Absalom was the third son of David, a son favoredand loved. David had given him a name whichmeant \"father of peace.\" But he brought notpeace\u2014rather, anger and ambition and sorrow. Hekilled his brother and conspired against his father.In the midst of his evil actions, in his wicked pursuitfor his father's throne, while Absalom rode a mule,his head caught in the branches of an oak tree, and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 175he was left hanging helpless. Joab, nephew of David and captain of the king's army, seizing theopportunity to get rid of this rebellious andtraitorous son, pierced his heart with darts. Heapparently felt he was doing a favor to the king. But when David heard of his son's death, even though that son had conspired to destroy him, \"theking was much moved, and went up to the chamberover the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus hesaid, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,my son! . . . . cried\" (2 Samuel 18:33; 19:4). Through the history of the generations of man, the actions of rebellious children have been ladenedwith sorrow and heartbreak, but even when therehas been rebellion, the strong cords of family lifehave reached out to encircle the rebellious one. I know of no more beautiful story in all of literature than that told by the Master as recorded in thefifteenth chapter of Luke. It is the story of a headyand greedy son who demanded his inheritance,which he wasted until none was left. Penitent, hereturned to his father, and his father, seeing himafar off, ran to him and embraced him and fellupon his neck and kissed him. The Great Scourge of Divorce Some of you within the sound of my voice couldrecount family sorrows in your own experience. Butamong the greatest of tragedies, and I think themost common, is divorce. It has become as a greatscourge. The most recent issue of the World Almanac says that in the United States during the twelvemonths ending with March 1990, an estimated2,423,000 couples married. During this same period,an estimated 1,177,000 couples divorced. (See The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1991 [New York: World Almanac, 1990], p. 834.) This means that in the United States almost one divorce occurred for every two marriages. Those are only figures written on the pages of a book. But behind them lies more of betrayal, more ofsorrow, more of neglect and poverty and strugglethan the human mind can imagine. Millions ofthose divorced in this nation are lonely, frustrated,insecure, and unhappy. Millions of single parentsare struggling to rear families, carrying burdensbeyond their capacity to handle. Millions of childrenare growing up in single-parent homes from whichthe parent, usually the mother, out of necessity isabsent much of the time. These \"latch-key children\"return from school each day to empty houses,where, in many cases, there is inadequate food andonly the refuge of the television set. Not only arethe children suffering, but all of society is paying afrightful price for their circumstances. As they growolder, the incidence of drugs increases among them.Vast numbers turn to criminal behavior. Inadequatelytrained, many are unemployed. Some aimlesslysquander their lives. Millions have become the\"flotsam and jetsam\" of society, washed upon theshore by oceans of neglect, abuse, and frustration,helpless to correct their circumstances. Time magazine, discussing the problems of New York City, statedthat the most serious is the breakdown of the family.Sixty percent of those in New York City publicschools, totalling some 600,000, come from one-parent homes. Comparable studies would doubtlessbring forth similar statistics for other large cities inAmerica and most of the large cities of the world. We are building and maintaining more prisons than we can afford. The costs are enormous, almostbeyond comprehension. In an alarming percentage of the cases of those who are warehoused in these facilities, there will be foundin their background a broken home where a fatherabandoned his family and a mother struggled invain to handle the overpowering odds against her. Selfishness a Major Cause of Divorce Why all of these broken homes? What happens tomarriages that begin with sincere love and a desireto be loyal and faithful and true one to another? There is no simple answer. I acknowledge that. But it appears to me that there are some obvious reasonsthat account for a very high percentage of theseproblems. I say this out of experience in dealingwith such tragedies. I find selfishness to be the rootcause of most of it. I am satisfied that a happy marriage is not so much a matter of romance as it is an anxious concern forthe comfort and well-being of one's companion. Selfishness so often is the basis of money problems, which are a very serious and real factor affectingthe stability of family life. Selfishness is at the rootof adultery, the breaking of solemn and sacredcovenants to satisfy selfish lust. Selfishness is the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 176antithesis of love. It is a cankering expression of greed. It destroys self-discipline. It obliteratesloyalty. It tears up sacred covenants. It afflicts bothmen and women. Too many who come to marriage have been coddled and spoiled and somehow led to feel that everythingmust be precisely right at all times, that life is a seriesof entertainments, that appetites are to be satisfiedwithout regard to principle. How tragic the conse-quences of such hollow and unreasonable thinking! A Burdened Single Mother Bitter consequences are seen in the lives of childrenwho need but do not have a father who loves them,teaches them, protects them, and leads them alongthe path of life by example and precept. Let merecount for you something I heard about two yearsago in this tabernacle. The occasion was a greatgathering of single men and women. Elder Marion D.Hanks conducted a panel discussion. Included inthat panel was an attractive and able young woman,divorced, the mother of seven children then rangingin ages from five to sixteen. She said that one eveningshe went across the street to deliver something to aneighbor. Listen to her words as I recall them: \"As Iturned around to walk back home, I could see myhouse lighted up. I could hear echoes of my childrenas I had walked out of the door a few minutes earlier:'Mom, what are we going to have for dinner?' 'Canyou take me to the library?' 'I have to get someposter paper tonight.' Tired and weary, I looked atthat house and saw the light on in each of therooms. I thought of all of those children who werehome waiting for me to come and meet their needs.My burdens felt very heavy on my shoulders. \"I remember looking through tears toward the sky, and I said, 'O my Father, I just can't do it tonight.I'm too tired. I can't face it. I can't go home andtake care of all those children alone. Could I justcome to You and stay with You for just one night?I'll come back in the morning.' \"I didn't really hear the words of reply, but I heard them in my mind. The answer was, 'No, little one,you can't come to me now. You would never wishto come back. But I can come to you.'\" There are so many, so very, very many like that young mother. She recognizes a divine power available toher. She is fortunate enough to have some aroundto love her and help her, but very many do not havesuch help. In loneliness and desperation, watchingtheir children drift toward drugs and crime andhelpless to stop that drift, they weep and pray. The Golden Rule Is the Remedy There is a remedy for all of this. It is not found indivorce. It is found in the gospel of the Son of God.He it was who said, \"What therefore God hathjoined together, let not man put asunder\" (Matthew19:6). The remedy for most marriage stress is not indivorce. It is in repentance. It is not in separation. Itis in simple integrity that leads a man to square uphis shoulders and meet his obligations. It is foundin the Golden Rule. Marriage is beautiful when beauty is looked for and cultivated. It can be ugly and uncomfortable whenone is looking for faults and is blinded to virtue. AsEdgar A. Guest once remarked, \"It takes a heap o'livin' in a house t' make it home\" (\"Home,\" inCollected Verse of Edgar A. Guest [Chicago: Reilly and Lee Co., 1934], p. 12). That is true. I can show youthroughout this church hundreds of thousands offamilies who make it work with love and peace,discipline and honesty, concern and unselfishness. There must be recognition on the part of both husband and wife of the solemnity and sanctity ofmarriage and of the God-given design behind it. There must be a willingness to overlook small faults, to forgive, and then to forget. There must be a holding of one's tongue. Temper is a vicious and corrosive thing that destroys affectionand casts out love. There must be self-discipline that constrains against abuse of wife and children and self. There must bethe Spirit of God, invited and worked for, nurturedand strengthened. There must be recognition of thefact that each is a child of God\u2014father, mother,son, and daughter, each with a divine birthright\u2014and also recognition of the fact that when we offendone of these, we offend our Father in Heaven. Resist Satan's Entreaties There may be now and again a legitimate cause fordivorce. I am not one to say that it is never justified.But I say without hesitation that this plague amongus, which seems to be growing everywhere, is not ofGod, but rather is the work of the adversary ofrighteousness and peace and truth. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 177(Due to time constraints, the remainder of this talk was not given from the pulpit. President Hinckley hasasked that it be included in the Conference Report.) You need not be his victims. You can rise above his wiles and entreaties. Get rid of the titillatingentertainment, the pornography that leads to evildesires and reprehensible activity. Wives, look uponyour husbands as your precious companions andlive worthy of that association. Husbands, see inyour wives your most valued asset in time or eternity,each a daughter of God, a partner with whom youcan walk hand in hand, through sunshine and storm,through all the perils and triumphs of life. Parents,see in your children sons and daughters of yourFather in Heaven, who will hold you accountablefor them. Stand together as their guardians, theirprotectors, their guides, their anchors. God Is the Designer of the Family The strength of the nations lies in the homes of thepeople. God is the designer of the family. He intendedthat the greatest of happiness, the most satisfyingaspects of life, the deepest joys should come in ourassociations together and our concerns one foranother as fathers and mothers and children. God bless the homes of our people. May He bless those homes that there may be loyal and true fathers,and good and wonderful mothers, and obedientand ambitious children reared in \"the nurture andadmonition of the Lord\" (Enos 1:1), I humbly prayin the name of Jesus Christ, amen. WHY MARRY IN THE TEMPLE? Elder John A. Widtsoe Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Evidences and Reconciliations,297-301 Marriage, the most important event between birthand death, is a determining condition of life'shappiness. Therefore, it should be entered into withthe greatest of care. A companion for life should beone who lives righteously, to whom abundant lovemay be given, and who can be respected in his orher daily walk and talk. Likewise, the marriagecovenant should be of such a nature as to helpcreate, build, and maintain daily happiness. As thesuccessive days are, so all of life will be. Wealth,power, and fame are beggared in comparison withthe joy that comes from a happy family life. The Church offers the privilege of marriage in the temple as the foremost means of establishing andmaintaining happiness in the households of itsmembers. It is a privilege beyond compare, whichevery prospective bride and groom should seek anduse. The conditions are such that every person mayfit himself to receive this privilege, so earnestlycoveted by true Latter-day Saints. Here are nine brief answers to the question, \"Why Marry in the Temple?\" 1. It is the Lord's desire and will. The temple is by divine decree the place where marriages should if possible be performed. Marriage is of such crucialimportance in life that it should begin with fullobedience to God's law. Love is the foundation ofmarriage, but love itself is a product of law and livesby law. True love is law-abiding, for the highestsatisfactions come to a law-abiding life. Moreover, true love of man for woman always includes love of God from whom all good thingsissue. The proof of our love of God is obedience toHis law. Besides, life is so full of problems that themarried couple should from the first seek theconstant favor of the Lord. A sense of security andcomfort comes to all who are wedded within thetemple. They have obeyed the law. They have pleasedthe Lord. As law-abiding citizens in the kingdom ofGod, they have a special claim upon divine aid,blessings, and protection. Conformity to the practicesof the Church always builds happiness in life.Marriage should begin right\u2014by obedience to law. 2. It is in harmony with the sacred nature of the marriage covenant. Temple marriages are also more in harmony with the nature and importance of the occasion. They are performed in an attractive sealingroom, especially dedicated for the purpose. Theceremony itself is simple, beautiful, and profound.Relatively few witnesses are present. Quiet and orderprevail. There are no external trappings to confusethe mind. Full attention may be given to the sacredcovenants to be made, and the blessings to follow,covering the vast period of eternal existence. Theattention is focused upon the meaning of themarriage ceremony, and not upon distracting outsidefeatures which characterize a wedding in an elaboratesocial setting. Such concentration of the soul upon the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 178covenants entered into and the blessings promised, becomes a joyful, happy memory incomparablysweeter than that of the usual rush and show of awedding outside temple walls. Lovely in its simplebeauty and deep import is a temple wedding. There is ample opportunity after the ceremony in the temple for a reception, simple or elaborate, atwhich friends may gather to congratulate the coupleand to wish them happiness. 3. It tends to insure marital happiness. Experience has shown that temple marriages are generally the happiest. There are relatively fewer divorces amongcouples who have been sealed over the altars of thetemple. This is shown by dependable statistics.Today's views of marriage are notably loose; yet noperson with a decent outlook on life will enter themarriage state as an experiment. Life's happiness ismade or marred by marriage. Divorce does not returnthe individuals to their former condition. Scarsremain. Hasty weddings and the easy divorces thatfollow menace individual and public welfare. Whenthe integrity of the family, the unit of society,vanishes, and family relationships are held indisrespect, society is headed for disaster. Thedeliberation that precedes a temple marriage, thesolemnity that accompanies it, and the power thatseals and blesses it, form a bulwark against manyevils of the day. The temple marriage hedges about,and keeps inviolate, the happiness that of rightbelongs to the married state. 4. It permits the association of husband and wife for time and for all eternity. The essential difference between temple and all other marriages is of the greatest consequence. In the temple, and only there,the bridal couple are wedded for time and eternity.The contract is endless. Here and hereafter, on earthand beyond, they may travel together in lovingcompanionship. This precious gift conforms to theLatter-day Saint belief that existence in the life afterthis may be active, useful, progressive. Love, contentto end with death, is perishable, poor, and helpless.Marriage that lasts only during earth life is a sad one,for the love established between manand woman, as they live together and rear their family, should not die, butlive and grow richer with the eternalyears. True love hopes and prays for an endless continuation of association with the loved one. To those who are sealedto each other for all existence, love isever warm, more hopeful, believing, courageous,and fearless. Such people live the richer, morejoyful life. To them happiness and the making of ithave no end. Dismal, dreary, full of fear, is theoutlook upon love that ends with death. The youthof the Church dare not forego the gift of everlastingmarriage. 5. It provides the eternal possession of children and family relationship. There is yet an added blessing. Children born under the temple covenant belong to their parents for all time and eternity. That is, thefamily relationships on earth are continued, forever,here and hereafter. The family, continued fromearth into the next world, becomes a unit ineverlasting life. In the long eternities we shall notbe lonely wanderers, but side by side, with our lovedones who have gone before and those who shallfollow, we shall travel the endless journey. Whatmother does not value this promise! What fatherdoes not feel his heart warm towards the eternalpossession of his family! What heartbreakings mighthave been avoided if humanity had been true tothe truth, and had surrendered to the sealing powerof the Priesthood of God. Temple marriage becomesa promise of unending joy. 6. It acts as a restraint against evil. The powers of darkness are ever active to push mankind into evil paths. Often, we are tempted to do foolish things.In the family little things may lead to discord. Tocreate unhappiness is the aim of the adversary ofrighteousness. Here appears one of the foremostblessings of the temple marriage. Those who havebeen sealed in the temple have their eyes fixed uponeternity. They dare not forfeit the promised blessings.The family is to them an everlasting possession.They remember the covenants which make possiblethis eternal association. The temple marriage, withall that it means, becomes a restraining force in thepresence of temptation. All family acts are morelikely to be shaped in anticipation of an undyingrelationship. Under the influence of the memory ofthe temple ceremony, family differences are swallowedup in peace; hate is transmuted into love; fear, into courage; and evil is rebuked and castout. Peace is the world's great need.From the temples of the Lord, andfrom everything done within them,issues the spirit of truth which is thefoundation of peace. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 179 True love hopes and prays for an endless continuation.7. It furnishes the opportunity for endless progression. Modern revelation sets forth the high destiny of those who are sealed for everlastingcompanionship. They will be given opportunity fora greater use of their powers. That means progress.They will attain more readily to their place in thepresence of the Lord; they will increase more rapidlyin every divine power; they will approach morenearly to the likeness of God; they will morecompletely realize their divine destiny. And thisprogress is not delayed until life after death. It beginshere, today, for those who yield obedience to the law.Life is tasteless without progress. Eternal marriage,with all that it means, provides for unendingadvancement. \"Eternal increase\" is the gift to allwho enter into the eternal marriage covenant, asmade in the temples of the Lord. 8. It places the family under the protection of the power of the Priesthood. They who have won a temple marriage have been sealed for time and eternity by the power of the Holy Priesthood. This is the supremepower committed to man's keeping. That power issuesfrom the unseen world. It gives life and light to theworld. Human life with its cares and worries istransfigured into a radiant experience and adventurewhen it clings to this divine power and is blessedby it. To walk under divine authority, to possess it,to be a part of it, is to walk with heads erect, withgrateful hearts, before our fellow men and ourFather in heaven. The men and women who havecome with this power out of the Lord's holy housewill be hedged about by divine protection and walkmore safely among the perplexities of earth. Theywill be indeed the ultimate conquerors of earth, forthey come with the infinite power of God to solvethe problems of earth. Spiritual power accompaniesall who marry in the temple, if they thenceforthkeep their sacred covenants. 9. It provides a God-like destiny for human beings. \"If a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it issealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, byhim who is anointed, unto whom I have appointedthis power and the keys of this priesthood; and itshall be said unto them\u2014Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the firstresurrection, in the next resurrection; and shallinherit thrones, kingdoms, depths. . . . \"Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore they shall be from everlasting to everlasting,because they continue; then shall they be above all,because all things are subject unto them. Then shallthey be gods, because they have all power, and theangels are subject unto them.\" (D. & C. 132:19, The 220, 268, 330; 43:586). MARRIAGE Elder Boyd K. Packer Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 14-17; or Ensign, May 1981, 13-15 The prophet Jacob foretold the destruction of apeople because they were blind to ordinary things,\"which blindness,\" he said, \"came by lookingbeyond the mark.\" (Jacob 4:14.) We often seek for things we cannot seem to find when they are within easy reach\u2014ordinary, obvious things. I wish to talk about an ordinary word. I have tried for months\u2014really tried\u2014to find some way to holdthis word up in such a way that you would be veryimpressed with what it means. Marriage The word is marriage. I have wished that I could set before you a finelycarved chest, placing it where the light is just right.I would carefully unlatch it and reverently uncoverthe word\u2014marriage. Perhaps then you would see that it is priceless! I cannot show it to you that way, so I will do the best I can using other ordinary words. It is my purpose to endorse and to favor, to encourage and defend marriage. Many regard it nowadays as being, at best, semiprecious, and by some it is thought to be worthnothing at all. I have seen and heard, as you have seen and heard, the signals all about us, carefully orchestrated toconvince us that marriage is out of date and in the way. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 180Counterfeit of Marriage There is a practice, now quite prevalent, for unmarried couples to live together, a counterfeit of marriage.They suppose that they shall have all that marriagecan offer without the obligations connected with it.They are wrong! However much they hope to find in a relationship of that kind, they will lose more. Living togetherwithout marriage destroys something inside all whoparticipate. Virtue, self-esteem, and refinement ofcharacter wither away. Claiming that it will not happen does not prevent the loss; and these virtues, once lost, are not easilyreclaimed. To suppose that one day they may nonchalantly change their habits and immediately claim all thatmight have been theirs had they not made a mockeryof marriage is to suppose something that will not be. One day, when they come to themselves, they will reap disappointment. One cannot degrade marriage without tarnishing other words as well, such words as boy, girl, manhood, womanhood, husband, wife, father, mother, baby,children, family, home. Such words as unselfishness and sacrifice will then be tossed aside. Then self-respect will fade and love itself will not want to stay. If you have been tempted to enter such a relationship or if you now live with another without marriage,leave! Withdraw from it! Run away from it! Do notcontinue with it! Or, if you can, make a marriageout of it. Marriage Is Sacred Even a rickety marriage will serve good purpose aslong as two people struggle to keep it from fallingdown around them. And now a word of warning. One who destroys a marriage takes upon himself a very greatresponsibility indeed. Marriage is sacred! To willfully destroy a marriage, either your own or that of another couple, is to offend our God. Such athing will not be lightly considered in the judgmentsof the Almighty and in the eternal scheme of thingswill not easily be forgiven. Do not threaten nor break up a marriage. Do not translate some disenchantment with your ownmarriage partner or an attraction for someone elseinto justification for any conduct that woulddestroy a marriage. This monumental transgression frequently places heavy burdens upon little children. They do notunderstand the selfish yearnings of unhappy adultswho are willing to buy their own satisfaction at theexpense of the innocent. God Himself decreed that the physical expression of love, that union of male and female which has powerto generate life, is authorized only in marriage. Marriage is the shelter where families are created. That society which puts low value on marriage sowsthe wind and, in time, will reap the whirlwind\u2014and thereafter, unless they repent, bring uponthemselves a holocaust! Trouble Attracts Attention Some think that every marriage must expect to endin unhappiness and divorce, with the hopes anddreams predestined to end in a broken, sad wreck of things. Some marriages do bend, and some will break, but we must not, because of this, lose faith in marriagenor become afraid of it. Broken marriages are not typical.Remember that trouble attracts attention! We travel the highway with thousands of cars moving ineither direction without paying much attention toany of them. But should an accident occur, wenotice immediately. If it happens again, we get the false impression that no one can go safely down the road. One accident may make the front page, while a hundred million cars that safely pass are not regardedas worth mentioning. Writers think that a happy, stable marriage does not have the dramatic appeal, the conflict worthfeaturing in a book or a play or a film. Therefore,we constantly hear about the ruined ones and welose our perspective. I believe in marriage. I believe it to be the ideal pattern for human living. I know it to be ordainedof God. The restraints relating to it were designed toprotect our happiness. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL181 MARRIAGE FOR ETERNITYKeep Faith in Marriage I do not know of any better time in all of the history of the world for a young couple who are of age andprepared and who are in love to think of marriage.There is no better time because it is your time. I know that these are very troubled times. Troubleslike we have now are very hard on marriages. Do not lose faith in marriage. Not even if you have been through the unhappiness of a divorce and are surrounded with pieces of a marriage that hasfallen apart. If you have honored your vows and your partner did not do so, remember God is watching over us.One day, after all of the tomorrows have passed,there will be recompense. Those who have beenmoral and faithful to their covenants will be happyand those who have not will be otherwise. Some marriages have broken up in spite of all that one partner could do to hold the marriage together.While there may be faults on both sides, I do notcondemn the innocent one who suffers in spite ofall that was desired and done to save the marriage. And to you I say, do not lose faith in marriage itself. Do not let your disappointment leave you bitter orcynical or justify any conduct that is unworthy. If you have had no opportunity for marriage or if you have lost your companion in death, keep yourfaith in marriage. Some years ago an associate of mine lost his beloved wife. She died after a lingering illness, and he watchedin helpless agony as the doctors withdrew all hope. One day near the end she told him that when she was gone she wanted him to marry again and hewas not to wait too long a time. He protested! Thechildren were nearly grown and he would go therest of the way alone. She turned away and wept and said, \"Have I been such a failure that after all our years together youwould rather go unmarried? Have I been such afailure?\" In due time there came another, and their life together has reaffirmed his faith in marriage. And Ihave the feeling that his first beloved wife is deeplygrateful to the second one, who filled the place thatshe could not keep.Joys and Tests of Marriage Marriage is yet safe, with all its sweet fulfillment, withall its joy and love. In marriage all of the worthyyearnings of the human soul, all that is physicaland emotional and spiritual, can be fulfilled. Marriage is not without trials of many kinds. These tests forge virtue and strength. The tempering thatcomes in marriage and family life produces menand women who will someday be exalted. God has ordained that life should have its beginning within the protecting shelter of marriage, conceivedin a consummate expression of love and nurtured andfostered with that deeper love which is accompaniedalways by sacrifice. Marriage offers fulfillment all the way through life\u2014in youth and young love, the wedding and onthe honeymoon, with the coming of little childrenand the nurturing of them. Then come the goldenyears when young ones leave the nest to build oneof their own. The cycle then repeats itself, as Godhas decreed it should. Eternal Love, Eternal Marriage, Eternal Increase There is another dimension to marriage that we know of in the Church. It came by revelation. Thisglorious, supernal truth teaches us that marriage ismeant to be eternal. There are covenants we can make if we are willing, and bounds we can seal if we are worthy, that willkeep marriage safe and intact beyond the veil ofdeath. The Lord has declared, \"For behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality andeternal life of man.\" (Moses 1:39.) The ultimate end of all activity in the Church is that a man and his wife and their children can behappy at home and that the family can continuethrough eternity. All Christian doctrine is formulatedto protect the individual, the home, and the family. These lines express something of the place of marriage in the eternal progress of man: We have within a burning flame, A light to kindle lights,The sacred fire of life itself,Which if misused ignitesA smold'ring, suffocating cloud ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 182Of sorrow and distress. When used by law this power brings forthA life, a family, happiness. Temptors from the darkest realm Seek to pervert this powerIn acts of wickedness and wasteUntil there comes the hourOf judgment and of recompense,When bitter tears are shedO'er power once held to foster lifeThat now is gone and dead. I know this power to be a key, A very key to God's own planWhich brings to pass eternal lifeAnd immortality for man.And marriage is the crucibleWhere elements of life combine,Where mortal temples are conceivedWithin that plan divine. Then spirit offspring of our God Can come through mortal birthTo have a choice, to face the test\u2014The purpose of our stay on earth.Here good and evil stand alikeBefore decision's sovereign nod.Those who elect the righteous pathWill part the veil, return to God. A gift from God, the plan provides That mortal beings in humble straitBe given power, supernal power,To share their love and help createA living child, a living soul,Image of man, and of Deity.How we regard this sacred giftWill fix our course, our destiny! Eternal love, eternal marriage, eternal increase! This ideal, which is new to many, when thoughtfullyconsidered, can keep a marriage strong and safe. Norelationship has more potential to exalt a man anda woman than the marriage covenant. No obligationin society or in the Church supersedes it inimportance. I thank God for marriage. I thank God for temples. I thank God for the glorious sealing power, thatpower which transcends all that we have beengiven, through which our marriages may becomeeternal. May we be worthy of this sacred gift, I prayin the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 183MARRIAGE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS SELECTED TEACHINGS President Brigham Young \"Those who attain to the blessing of the first or celestial resurrection will be pure and holy, andperfect in body. Every man and woman that reachesto this unspeakable attainment will be as beautiful as the angels that surround the throne of God. Ifyou can by faithfulness in this life, obtain the rightto come up in the morning of the resurrection, youneed entertain no fears that the wife will bedissatisfied with her husband, or the husband withthe wife; for those of the first resurrection will befree from sin and from the consequences and powerof sin\" (\"Future State of Existence,\" Contributor, May 1890, 241). THE ENRICHING OF MARRIAGE Elder James E. Faust Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1977, 12-14; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, 9-11 Some years ago, I was consulted by a woman whodesired a divorce from her husband on groundswhich, in my opinion, were justified. After thedivorce was concluded, I did not see her again formany years. A chance meeting with her on thestreet was very surprising. The years of lonelinessand discouragement were evident in her oncebeautiful face. After passing a few pleasantries, she was quick to say that life had not been rich and rewarding for herand that she was tired of facing the struggle alone.Then came a most startling disclosure, which, withher permission, I share. She said, \"Bad as it was, if I had to do it over again, knowing what I do now, Iwould not have sought the divorce. This is worse.\" Divorce Statistically, it is difficult to avoid a divorce becausein the United States with every one hundredmarriages there are now about fifty divorces. ( World Almanac, 1976.) Unless the present rate of ever- increasing divorces diminishes, in the early 1980swith every one hundred marriages there will beseventy divorces. Divorce can be justified only in the most rare of circumstances, because it often tears people's livesapart and shears family happiness. Frequently in adivorce the parties lose much more than they gain. The traumatic experience one goes through in divorce seems little understood and not well enoughappreciated; and certainly there need to be muchmore sympathy and understanding for those whohave experienced this great tragedy and whose livescannot be reversed. For those who are divorced, thereis still much to be hoped for and expected in terms offulfillment and happiness in life, in the forgettingof self and in the rendering of service to others. Difficult Questions Why is happiness in marriage so fragile and fleetingfor so many, yet so abundant for others? Why doesthe resulting train of heartache and suffering haveto be so long and have so many innocent people on board? What are the missing enriching ingredients in so many marriages, all begun with such happiness andso many high hopes? I have long pondered these difficult questions. Having spent almost a lifetime dealing with humanexperiences, I am somewhat familiar with theproblems of unhappy marriages, of divorce, and of heartbroken families. I can also speak of greathappiness, for, thanks to my beloved Ruth, I havefound in marriage the richest fulfillment of humanexistence. We build our marriages with endless friendship, confidence, integrity, and by administering and sustaining each other. \u2014Elder James E. Faust ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL184Reasons for Divorce There are no simple, easy answers to the challenging and complex questions of happiness in marriage.There are also many supposed reasons for divorce.Among them are the serious problems of selfishness,immaturity, lack of commitment, inadequatecommunication, unfaithfulness; and all of the rest,which are obvious and well known. In my experience there is another reason which seems not so obvious but which precedes and lacesthrough all of the others. It is the lack of a constantenrichment in marriage. It is an absence of thatsomething extra which makes it precious, special,and wonderful, when it is also drudgery, difficult,and dull. Enriching a Marriage You might wonder, \"How can a marriage beconstantly enriched?\" Adam, speaking of Eve, said,\"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh.\" (Gen. 2:23.) We build our marriages with endless friendship, confidence, integrity, and by administering andsustaining each other in our difficulties. There are a few simple, relevant questions which each person, whether married or contemplating marriage,should honestly ask in an effort to become \"oneflesh.\" They are: First, am I able to think of the interest of my marriage and partner first before I think of my own desires? Second, how deep is my commitment to my companion, aside from any other interests? Third, is he or she my best friend?Fourth, do I have respect for the dignity of my partner as a person of worth and value? Fifth, do we quarrel over money? Money itself seems neither to make a couple happy, nor the lack of it,necessarily, to make them unhappy, but money isoften a symbol of selfishness. Sixth, is there a spiritually sanctifying bond between us? I commend to all the excellent discussion by Presi- dent Kimball, \"Marriage and Divorce,\" can destroy [a] marriage except thepower within either or both of the spouses them-selves.\" (Marriage and Divorce, Deseret Book, p. 17.)Prayer Marriage relationships can be enriched by bettercommunication. One important way is to praytogether. This will resolve many of the differences,if there are any, between the couple before sleepcomes. I do not mean to overemphasize differences,but they are real, and make things interesting. Ourdifferences are the little pinches of salt which canmake the marriage seem sweeter. We communicatein a thousand ways, such as a smile, a brush of thehair, a gentle touch, and remembering each day tosay \"I love you\" and the husband to say \"You'rebeautiful.\" Some other important words to say,when appropriate, are \"I'm sorry.\" Listening isexcellent communication. Trust Complete trust in each other is one of the greatestenriching factors in marriage. Nothing devastatesthe core of mutual trust necessary to maintain afulfilling relationship like infidelity. There is never a justification for adultery. Despite this destructiveexperience, occasionally marriages are saved andfamilies preserved. To do so requires the aggrievedparty to be capable of giving unreserved love greatenough to forgive and forget. It requires the errantparty to want desperately to repent and actuallyforsake evil. Our loyalty to our eternal companion should not be merely physical, but mental and spiritual as well.Since there are no harmless flirtations and no placefor jealousy after marriage, it is best to avoid thevery appearance of evil by shunning any questionablecontact with another to whom we are not married. Virtue Virtue is the strong glue which holds it all together.Said the Lord, \"Thou shalt love thy wife with allthy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.\"(D&C 42:22.) Of all that can bless marriages, there is one special enriching ingredient, which above all else will helpjoin a man and a woman together in a very real,sacred, spiritual sense. It is the presence of the divinein marriage. Shakespeare, speaking in Henry the Fifth, said, \"God, the best maker of all marriages, combineyour hearts in one.\" (Henry V , 5:2.) God is also the best keeper of marriages. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS 185There are many things which go into making a marriage enriching, but they seem to be of the husk.Having the companionship and enjoying the fruitsof a Holy and Divine Presence is the kernel of a greathappiness in marriage. Spiritual oneness is theanchor. Slow leaks in the sanctifying dimension ofmarriage often cause marriages to become flat tires. Divorces are increasing because in many cases the union lacks that enrichment which comes from thesanctifying benediction which flows from the keepingof the commandments of God. It is a lack ofspiritual nourishment. Tithing I learned in serving almost twenty years as bishop andstake president that an excellent insurance againstdivorce is the payment of tithing. Payment of tithingseems to facilitate keeping the spiritual batterycharged in order to make it through the times whenthe spiritual generator has been idle or not working. There is no great or majestic music which constantly produces the harmony of a great love. The mostperfect music is a welding of two voices into onespiritual solo. Marriage is the way provided by Godfor the fulfillment of the greatest of human needs,based upon mutual respect, maturity, selflessness,decency, commitment, and honesty. Happiness inmarriage and parenthood can exceed a thousandtimes any other happiness. Parenthood The soul of the marriage is greatly enriched and thespiritual growing process is greatly strengthenedwhen a couple become parents. Parenthood shouldbring the greatest of all happiness. Men grow becauseas fathers they must take care of their families.Women blossom because as mothers they must forgetthemselves. We understand best the full meaning oflove when we become parents. Our homes should be among the most hallowed of all earthly sanctuaries. In the enriching of marriage the big things are the little things. It is a constant appreciation for eachother and a thoughtful demonstration of gratitude.It is the encouraging and the helping of each otherto grow. Marriage is a joint quest for the good, thebeautiful, and the divine. The Savior has said, \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open thedoor, I will come in to him, and will sup with him,and he with me.\" (Rev. 3:20.) May the presence of God be found enriching and blessing all marriages and homes, especially thoseof His Saints, as part of His eternal plan, I prayhumbly in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen. HINCKLEYS TO NOTE 60TH ANNIVERSARY Dell Van Orden Church News, 19 Apr. 1997, 3 President and Sister Hinckley talked about some of the essentials for a happy marriage. \"Live the gospel,\" President Hinckley admonished.\"That is so important. That means a lot of things. That means sacrifice in some circumstances. Thatmeans love and appreciation and respect. Thatmeans self-discipline. That means curbing yourtemper and your tongue and being careful of whatyou say because words can wound just as deeplyand just as seriously as can anything that inflictsbodily harm. \"And you have to look on the bright side of things; you have to be optimistic and say, 'We can make it!'\" Develop and maintain respect for one another, he counseled. \"You have to give and take in marriage.Another thing is a soft answer, keeping your voicedown. Don't lose your temper. Speak quietly. Therewill be differences,\" President Hinckley continued,\"but don't get stirred up over them. Just be quietand calm and speak softly one to another.\" Sister Hinckley added: \"You cannot be selfish in marriage. You have to have as your first priority thehappiness and comfort of your spouse. If you workon that, then you are happy, too.\" \"Selfishness,\" said President Hinckley, \"brings about conflict and all of these difficulties that afflict sovery, very many marriages. Being plain, downrightselfish is the problem.\" Continuing, he said, \"[Marriage] requires a very substantial measure of self-discipline. Marriage isnot all romance. Marriage is work. Marriage is effort.You have to accommodate one another. You have tolook after one another. Another thing is to doeverything you can to develop the talents, theresources, the opportunities of your companion.\" \"Some people,\" said Sister Hinckley, \"try to remake their spouse.\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS 186\"Recognize your differences, \" said President Hinckley. \"You will find that is a very wholesome and stimulating thing.\" President Hinckley also counseled husbands and wives to get out of debt. \"Debt is a terrible thing.Anybody who lived through the Depression knowsthat debt is an enslaving thing. Stay out of debt andpay your bills promptly. \"There is another thing; we have always talked together. There has been no lack of communicationbetween us. I hear so many, many cases of unhappymarriages, of people who say 'we can't communicatewith one another.' \"There has been no lack of communication between us,\" President Hinckley said. \"We have had a very happy marriage,\" he continued. \"When I look back, I have no regrets. Through theyears we have been blessed beyond any measure thatwe ever dreamed of. We have been so richly blessed.We have never lacked, I can honestly say. We havepaid our tithing. That came first. We have livedmodestly but comfortably and reasonably well. Wehave plowed our little furrow and enlarged it andgone forward with our lives.\" \"There is nothing really extraordinary about our lives,\" he maintained. As the interview was ending, President Hinckley turned to his wife and said: \"What she did as aparent she is doing as a grandmother and a great-grandmother. Now we, after 60 years of marriage,are smaller; we don't stand as tall, we haveshrunken a little.\" \"We move slower,\" added Sister Hinckley.\"We move slower,\" said President Hinckley, \"but we are happy and love one another.\" Interview with President and Sister Hinckley Some Essentials for a Happy Marriage Live the gospel. Love, appreciate each other. Develop self-discipline. Curb temper and tongue. Look on the bright side of things. Develop, maintain respect for one another. Give soft answer. Speak quietly. Don't be selfish. Look after one another. Develop talents, opportunities of companion. Recognize differences. Pay tithing, stay out of debt. Develop ability to communicate with each other. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMARRIAGE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS 187MATE SELECTION SELECTED TEACHINGS Importance of Choosing Wisely President Spencer W. Kimball \"Marriage is perhaps the most vital of all the decisions and has the most far-reaching effects, forit has to do not only with immediate happiness,but also with eternal joys. It affects not only thetwo people involved, but also their families andparticularly their children and their children'schildren down through the many generations\"(\"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign, Mar. 1977, 3). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"This will be the most important decision of your life, the individual whom you marry .... \". . . Marry the right person in the right place at theright time\" (\"Life's Obligations,\" Ensign, Feb. 1999, 2). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"The most important things that any member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ever doesin this world are: 1. To marry the right person, in theright place, by the right authority; and 2. To keep thecovenant made in connection with this holy andperfect order of matrimony\" (Mormon Doctrine, 118). Background Factors President David O. McKay \"In choosing a companion, it is necessary to study the disposition, the inheritance, and training of theone with whom you are contemplating making life'sjourney\" (Gospel Ideals, 459).President Spencer W. Kimball \"The difficulties and hazards of marriage are greatly increased where backgrounds are different\"(Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 302). \"I have warned the youth against the many hazardsof interfaith marriage, and with all the power I possessed, I warned young people to avoid thesorrows and disillusionments which come frommarrying out of the Church and the unhappysituations which almost invariably result when a believer marries an unbelieving spouse. I pointedout the demands of the Church upon its membersin time, energy, and funds; the deepness of thespiritual ties which tighten after marriage and asthe family comes; the antagonisms which naturallyfollow such mismating; the fact that these andmany other reasons argue eloquently for marriagewithin the Church, where husband and wife havecommon backgrounds, common ideals and standards,common beliefs, hopes, and objectives, and, aboveall, where marriage may be eternalized throughrighteous entry into the holy temple. . . . \". . . We recommend that people marry those who are of . . . somewhat the same economic and socialand educational background (some of those are notan absolute necessity, but preferred), and above all,the same religious background, without question\"(\"Marriage and Divorce,\" 142-44). The Right Person President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Be worthy of the mate you choose. Respect him or her. Give encouragement to him or her. Love yourcompanion with all your heart. This will be themost important decision of your life, the individualwhom you marry. \"There is no substitute for marrying in the temple. It is the only place under the heavens wheremarriage can be solemnized for eternity. Don'tcheat yourself. Don't cheat your companion. Don'tshortchange your lives. Marry the right person inthe right place at the right time. \"Choose a companion of your own faith. You are much more likely to be happy. Choose a companionyou can always honor, you can always respect, onewho will complement you in your own life, one towhom you can give your entire heart, your entirelove, your entire allegiance, your entire loyalty ....'Soul mates' are fiction and an illusion; . . . it is certain that almost any good man and any good woman can have happiness and a successful marriage. \u2014President Spencer W. Kimball ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL188\". . . I could not wish for any of you more than I have had in my companionship with my beautiful wife. \"A good marriage requires time. It requires effort. You have to work at it. You have to cultivate it. Youhave to forgive and forget. You have to be absolutelyloyal one to another. Most of you will marry andhave children. They will become the source of yourgreatest pride and happiness. . . . \"All of this can come to pass if you make this most important decision, one guided by prayer as well asinstinct, of choosing a dear companion who will beyours through thick and thin forever, throughout alleternity\" (\"Life's Obligations,\" Ensign, Feb. 1999, 2, 4). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"The right person is someone for whom the natural and wholesome and normal affection that shouldexist does exist. It is the person who is living sothat he or she can go to the temple of God and makethe covenants that we there make\" (in ConferenceReport, Sept.-Oct. 1955, 13). Elder Richard G. Scott \"There is more to a foundation of eternal marriage than a pretty face or an attractive figure.There is more to consider than popularity or charisma. As you seek an eternal companion, look for someonewho is developing the essentialattributes that bring happiness: a deeplove of the Lord and of Hiscommandments, a determination tolive them, one that is kindly understanding, forgiving of others, andwilling to give of self, with the desire tohave a family cr owned with beautiful children and a commitment to teach them the principles of truth in the home. \"An essential priority of a prospective wife is the desire to be a wife and mother. She should bedeveloping the sacred qualities that God has givenHis daughters to excel as a wife and mother: patience,kindliness, a love of children, and a desire to carefor them rather than seeking professional pursuits.She should be acquiring a good education to preparefor the demands of motherhood. \"A prospective husband should also honor his priesthood and use it in service to others. Seek a manwho accepts his role as provider of the necessities oflife, has the capacity to do it, and is making concertedefforts to prepare himself to fulfill thoseresponsibilities. \"I suggest that you not ignore many possible candidates who are still developing these attributes,seeking the one who is perfected in them. You willlikely not find that perfect person, and if you did,there would certainly be no interest in you. Theseattributes are best polished together as husband andwife\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1999, 31; orEnsign, May 1999, 26). Outer Appearance and Inner Beauty President David O. McKay \"Yes, men are attracted by beauty, and thousands are ensnared by it. There are thousands of men wholook for nothing else and who desire nothing elsebut to have their senses pleased or their passionsgratified. These outward adornments will satisfy andonly outward adornment will retain. When beautyfades, the passion seeks for gratification elsewhere.'Beauty is only skin-deep,' and when outwardadornment is all a girl possesses, the admiration shecalls forth is even more shallow than her beauty. . . . \"But there is a beauty every girl has\u2014agift from God, as pure as the sunlight,and as sacred as life. It is a beauty thatall men love, a virtue that wins allmen's souls. That beauty is chastity. Chastity without skin beauty may enkindle the soul; skin beauty withoutchastity can kindle only the eye.Chastity enshrined in the mold of truewomanhood will hold true loveeternally\" (Gospel Ideals, 450). Counsel for Single Sisters President Wilford Woodruff \"When the daughters of Zion are asked by the young men to join with them in marriage, insteadof asking\u2014'Has this man a fine brick house, a spanof fine horses and a fine carriage?' they shouldask\u2014'Is he a man of God? Has he the Spirit of Godwith him? Is he a Latter-day Saint? Does he pray?Has he got the Spirit upon him to qualify him tobuild up the kingdom?' If he has that, never mindthe carriage and brick house, take hold and unite ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 189 As you seek an eternal companion, look for someone who is developing the essential attributes that bring happiness.yourselves together according to the law of God\" (in Discourses of Wilford Woodruff, 271). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Dear sisters, never lose sight of this sacred goal [of a temple marriage]. Prayerfully prepare for it and livefor it. Be married the Lord's way. Temple marriage isa gospel ordinance of exaltation. Our Father inHeaven wants each of His daughters to have thiseternal blessing. \"Therefore, don't trifle away your happiness by involvement with someone who cannot take youworthily to the temple. Make a decision now thatthis is the place where you will marry. To leave thatdecision until a romantic involvement develops isto take a risk the importance of which you cannotnow fully calculate. \"And remember, you are not required to lower your standards in order to get a mate. Keep yourselvesattractive, maintain high standards, maintain yourself-respect. Do not engage in intimacies that bringheartache and sorrow. Place yourselves in a positionto meet worthy men and be engaged in constructiveactivities. \"But also, do not expect perfection in your choice of a mate. Do not be so concerned about his physicalappearance and his bank account that you overlookhis more important qualities. Of course, he shouldbe attractive to you, and he should be able tofinancially provide for you. But, does he have a strongtestimony? Does he live the principles of the gospeland magnify his priesthood? Is he active in hisward and stake? Does he love home and family, andwill he be a faithful husband and a good father?These are qualities that really matter. \"And I would also caution you single sisters not tobecome so independent and self-reliant that youdecide marriage isn't worth it and you can do just aswell on your own. Some of our sisters indicate thatthey do not want to consider marriage until after they have completed their degrees or pursued a career. Thisis not right. Certainly we want our single sisters tomaximize their individual potential, to be welleducated, and to do well at their present employ-ment. You have much to contribute to society, to your community, and to your neighborhood. But weearnestly pray that our single sisters will desire honorable marriage in the temple to a worthy manand rear a righteous family, even though this maymean the sacrificing of degrees and careers. Ourpriorities are right when we realize there is no higher calling than to be an honorable wife andmother\" (\"To the Single Adult Sisters of the Church,\" Ensign, Nov. 1988, 96-97). Counsel for Single Brethren President Ezra Taft Benson \"Work hard educationally and in your vocation. Put your trust in the Lord, have faith, and it will work out.The Lord never gives a commandment without pro-viding the means to accomplish it (see 1 Nephi 3:7). \"Also, do not be caught up in materialism, one of the real plagues of our generation\u2014that is, acquiringthings, fast-paced living, and securing career successin the single state. \"Honorable marriage is more important than wealth, position, and status. As husband and wife, you canachieve your life's goals together. As you sacrifice foreach other and your children, the Lord will bless you,and your commitment to the Lord and your servicein His kingdom will be enhanced\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1988, 59; or Ensign, May 1988, 53). \"Now, brethren, do not expect perfection in yourchoice of a mate. Do not be so particular that youoverlook her most important qualities of having astrong testimony, living the principles of the gospel,loving home, wanting to be a mother in Zion, andsupporting you in your priesthood responsibilities. \"Of course, she should be attractive to you, but do not just date one girl after another for the sole pleasureof dating without seeking the Lord's confirmationin your choice of your eternal companion. \"And one good yardstick as to whether a person might be the right one for you is this: in herpresence, do you think your noblest thoughts, doyou aspire to your finest deeds, do you wish youwere better than you are? \"God bless you single adult brethren of the Church. May your priorities be right. I have suggested somevery important priorities this evening. May youseriously consider and ponder them\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1988, 59; or Ensign, May 1988, 53). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I hope you will not put off marriage too long. I do not speak as much to the young women as to theyoung men whose prerogative and responsibility itis to take the lead in this matter. Don't go on ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 190endlessly in a frivolous dating game. Look for a choice companion, one you can love, honor, andrespect, and make a decision\" (\"Thou Shalt NotCovet,\" Ensign, Mar. 1990, 6). The Role of Prayer and Personal Revelation Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"Use both agency and prayer. It is not, never has been, and never will be the design and purpose of the Lord\u2014however much we seek him in prayer\u2014to answer all our problems and concerns withoutstruggle and effort on our part. This mortality is aprobationary estate. In it we have our agency. Weare being tested to see how we will respond invarious situations; how we will decide issues; whatcourse we will pursue while we are here walking,not by sight, but by faith. Hence, we are to solveour own problems and then to counsel with theLord in prayer and receive a spiritual confirmationthat our decisions are correct\" (\"Why the LordOrdained Prayer,\" Ensign, Jan. 1976, 11). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"If a revelation is outside the limits of stewardship, you know it is not from the Lord, and you are notbound by it. I have heard of cases where a youngman told a young woman she should marry himbecause he had received a revelation that she was tobe his eternal companion. If this is a true revelation,it will be confirmed directly to the woman if sheseeks to know. In the meantime, she is under noobligation to heed it. She should seek her ownguidance and make up her own mind. The man canreceive revelation to guide his own actions, but hecannot properly receive revelation to direct hers.She is outside his stewardship. . . . \". . . When a choice will make a real difference in our lives\u2014obvious or not\u2014and when we are livingin tune with the Spirit and seeking his guidance, wecan be sure we will receive the guidance we need toattain our goal\" (\"Revelation,\" 25-26). \"A desire to be led by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an understanding thatour Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for ourpersonal choices. Personal decision making is one ofthe sources of the growth we are meant to experiencein mortality. Persons who try to shift all decisionmaking to the Lord and plead for revelation in everychoice will soon find circumstances in which theypray for guidance and don't receive it. For example,this is likely to occur in those numerouscircumstances in which the choices are trivial oreither choice is acceptable. \"We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed withinus. Then we should pray for guidance and act uponit if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, weshould act upon our best judgment. Persons whopersist in seeking revelatory guidance on subjectson which the Lord has not chosen to direct us mayconcoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias,or they may even receive an answer through themedium of false revelation. Revelation from God isa sacred reality, but like other sacred things, it mustbe cherished and used properly so that a greatstrength does not become a disabling weakness\"(\"Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall,\" Ensign,Oct. 1994, 13-14). Finding the Right One President Spencer W. Kimball \"While marriage is difficult, and discordant and frustrated marriages are common, yet real, lastinghappiness is possible, and marriage can be more anexultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive.This is within the reach of every couple, every person.'Soul mates' are fiction and an illusion; and whileevery young man and young woman will seek withall diligence and prayerfulness to find a mate withwhom life can be most compatible and beautiful,yet it is certain that almost any good man and anygood woman can have happiness and a successfulmarriage if both are willing to pay the price\"(\"Oneness in Marriage,\" Ensign, Mar. 1977, 4). Elder Joseph Fielding Smith \"We have no scriptural justification, however, for the belief that we had the privilege of choosing ourparents and our life companions in the spirit world.This belief has been advocated by some, and it ispossible that in some instances it is true, but it wouldrequire too great a stretch of the imagination tobelieve it to be so in all, or even in the majority ofcases. Most likely we came where those in authoritydecided to send us. Our agency may not have beenexercised to the extent of making choice of parentsand posterity\" (Way to Perfection, 44). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 191Mission or Marriage? President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Now I wish to say something to bishops and stake presidents concerning missionary service. It is asensitive matter. There seems to be growing in theChurch an idea that all young women as well as allyoung men should go on missions. We need someyoung women. They perform a remarkable work.They can get in homes where the elders cannot. \"I confess that I have two granddaughters on missions. They are bright and beautiful youngwomen. They are working hard and accomplishingmuch good. Speaking with their bishops and theirparents, they made their own decisions to go. Theydid not tell me until they turned in their papers. I had nothing to do with their decision to go. \"Now, having made that confession, I wish to say that the First Presidency and the Council of theTwelve are united in saying to our young sisters thatthey are not under obligation to go on missions. Ihope I can say what I have to say in a way that willnot be offensive to anyone. Young women shouldnot feel that they have a duty comparable to that ofyoung men. Some of them will very much wish togo. If so, they should counsel with their bishop aswell as their parents. If the idea persists, the bishopwill know what to do. \"I say what has been said before, that missionary work is essentially a priesthood responsibility. Assuch, our young men must carry the major burden.This is their responsibility and their obligation. \"We do not ask the young women to consider a mis- sion as an essential part of their life's program. Overa period of many years, we have held the age levelhigher for them in an effort to keep the number goingrelatively small. Again to the sisters I say that youwill be as highly respected, you will be considered asbeing as much in the line of duty, your efforts will beas acceptable to the Lord and to the Church whetheryou go on a mission or do not go on a mission. \"We constantly receive letters from young women asking why the age for sister missionaries is not thesame as it is for elders. We simply give them thereasons. We know that they are disappointed. Weknow that many have set their hearts on missions.We know that many of them wish this experiencebefore they marry and go forward with their adultlives. I certainly do not wish to say or imply thattheir services are not wanted. I simply say that amission is not necessary as a part of their lives. \"Now, that may appear to be something of a strange thing to say in priesthood meeting. I say it herebecause I do not know where else to say it. Thebishops and stake presidents of the Church havenow heard it. And they must be the ones who makethe judgment in this matter. \"That is enough on that subject\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1997, 72-73; or Ensign, Nov. 1997, 52). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"It does not matter if it interrupts your schooling or delays your career or your marriage\u2014or basketball.Unless you have a serious health problem, everyLatter-day Saint young man should answer the callto serve a mission\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1984, 61; or Ensign, May 1984, 42). Church Bulletin \"There is increasing evidence that some young women are being strongly encouraged to serve full-time missions. Though capable and effective, youngwomen do not have the same responsibility to servefull-time missions as do young men who hold thepriesthood. We are grateful that some desire to serveas full-time missionaries, but they should not bemade to feel obligated to do so. A young womanshould not be recommended for a mission if itwould interfere with a specific marriage proposal\"(Bulletin, 1993, no. 2, p. 2). Making the Decision at the Appropriate Time President Harold B. Lee \"I am not trying to urge you younger men to marry too early. I think therein is one of the hazards oftoday's living. We don't want a young man to thinkof marriage until he is able to take care of a family,to have an institution of his own, to be independent.He must make sure that he has found the girl of hischoice, they have gone together long enough thatthey know each other, and that they know eachother's faults and they still love each other. I havesaid to the mission presidents (some of whom havebeen reported to us as saying to missionaries, 'Now,if you are not married in six months, you are afailure as a missionary'), 'Don't you ever say that toone of your missionaries. Maybe in six months they ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 192will not have found a wife; and if they take you seriously, they may rush into a marriage that will bewrong for them.' \"Please don't misunderstand what we are saying; but, brethren, think moreseriously about the obligations ofmarriage for those who bear the holypriesthood at a time when marriageshould be the expectation of every manwho understands the responsibility;for remember, brethren, that onlythose who enter into the new andeverlasting covenant of marriage inthe temple for time and eternity, onlythose will have the exaltation in thecelestial kingdom. That is what the Lord tells us\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1973, 120; or Ensign,Jan. 1974, 100). Church Bulletin \"When full-time missionaries return home, they should be counseled concerning such matters ascontinuing their education or employment,strengthening family relationships, participatingactively in the Church, paying tithes and offerings,and preparing for temple marriage. It is unwise,however, to 'recommend that missionaries be marriedwithin a specific time. The decision to marry is soimportant that it should be made only after themost prayerful and careful consideration by theindividual.' (Mission President's Handbook [31153], 1990, p. 23)\" (Bulletin, 1993, no. 1, 2). AGENCY OR INSPIRATION? Elder Bruce R. McConkie Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles New Era, Jan. 1975, 38-43 My wife and I were having a serious discussion recently in which we were counting our manyblessings. We named a host of things that havecome to us, because of the Church, because of ourfamily, because of the glorious restoration of eternaltruth that has taken place in this day; and then she climaxed the discussion by asking this question:\"What's the greatest blessing that has ever comeinto your life?\" Without a moment's hesitation I said,\"The greatest blessing that has evercome to me was on the thirteenth dayof October in 1937 at 11:20 A.M. when I was privileged to kneel in the Salt LakeTemple at the Lord's altar and receiveyou as an eternal companion.\" She said, \"Well, you passed that test.\"I believe that the most important single thing that any Latter-day Saintever does in this world is to marry the right person, in the right place, by the rightauthority; and that then\u2014when they have been sosealed by the power and authority that Elijah theprophet restored\u2014the most important remainingthing that any Latter-day Saint can ever do is so tolive that the terms and conditions of the covenantthus made will be binding and efficacious now andforever. And so I'd like, if properly guided, to makesome suggestions that apply in all fields of choice\u2014in all fields, at least all major fields of activity\u2014butthat apply particularly to the matter of eternalmarriage, singling that out as the one thingparamount above all others. When we dwelt in the presence of God our Heavenly Father, we were endowed with agency. This gave usthe opportunity, the privilege, to choose what wewould do\u2014to make a free, untrammeled choice.When father Adam was placed in the Garden ofEden he was given this same power, and we nowpossess it. We're expected to use the gifts andtalents and abilities, the sense and judgment andagency with which we are endowed. But on the other hand we're commanded to seek the Lord, to desire his Spirit, to get the spirit ofrevelation and inspiration in our lives. We comeinto the Church and a legal administrator places hishands upon our head and says, \"Receive the HolyGhost.\" This gives us the gift of the Holy Ghost,which is the right to the constant companionship ofthat member of the Godhead, based on faithfulness. And so we're faced with two propositions. One is that we ought to be guided by the spirit of inspiration,the spirit of revelation. The other is that we're hereunder a direction to use our agency, to determinewhat we ought to do on our own; and we need to ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 193 The most important single thing that any Latter-day Saint ever does in this world is to marry the right person, in the right place.strike a fine balance between these two, if we're going to pursue a course that will give us joy,satisfaction, and peace in this life and lead to eternalreward in our Father's kingdom. When we were with our Father in the preexistent sphere, he observed and studied us and he knewhow we would respond to his laws when we were inhis presence, when we had the knowledge that hewas our Father and that the teachings presented tous came from him. We walked by sight. Now he'sfinding out how we'll respond when we walk byfaith, when we're outside his presence and we haveto rely on things other than the personal counselthat we once received from him. I'd like to present three case studies, out of which, perhaps, we can draw some very realistic and soundconclusions as to what ought to be in our lives. I'lltake these illustrations out of the revelations thatthe Lord has given us. \"You Have Not Understood\" Case study number one: There was a man named Oliver Cowdery. In the early days he operated as [a scribe] to the Prophet. . . . He wrote down thewords that the Prophet dictated while the Spiritrested upon him in the translation processes (theBook of Mormon was then being translated). BrotherCowdery was relatively spiritually immature at that time, and he sought and desired to do somethingbeyond his then present spiritual capacity. Hewanted to translate. And so he importuned theProphet, the Prophet took the matter up with the Lord, and they got a revelation. The Lord said,\"Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, thatassuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God andyour Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive aknowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask infaith, with an honest heart, believing that you shallreceive. . . .\" And then one thing he might receive is defined as, \"a knowledge concerning the engravingsof old records, which are ancient, which containthose parts of my scripture of which has beenspoken by the manifestation of my Spirit.\" Having thus dealt with the specific problem, then the Lord revealed a principle that applies to it andall other like situations: \"Yea, behold, I will tell youin your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost,which shall come upon you and which shall dwellin your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit ofrevelation.\" (D&C 8:1-3.)Oliver did what a good many of us would havedone. He had the instructions I have read, and heassumed that they meant what they seemed on thesurface to say, which was that if in faith he askedGod, he'd have power to translate. But in hiscondition of relative spiritual immaturity, he hadn'tyet learned what was involved in asking of God, orhow to generate the kind of faith or do the specificthing that has to be done in order to get an answerto a prayer. And so he asked. And as you know, hefailed; he was totally unable to translate. Thiscaused some concern, I suppose, to him and theProphet. The matter was referred back to the Lord,whose promise they had been attempting toconform to; and the answer came, the reason came,why he couldn't translate: \"Behold, you have notunderstood; you have supposed that I would give itunto you, when you took no thought save it was toask me.\" (D&C 9:7.) Now, seemingly, that's all he'd been instructed to do, to ask in faith; but implicit in asking in faith isthe precedent requirement that we do everything inour power to accomplish the goal that we seek. Weuse the agency with which we have been endowed.We use every faculty and capacity and ability thatwe possess to bring about the eventuality that maybe involved. This is translating the Book of Mormon,it's choosing a wife, it's choosing employment, it'sdoing any one of ten thousand important thingsthat arise in our lives. The Lord continued:\". . . I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, andif it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burnwithin you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. \"But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought thatshall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong;therefore, you cannot write that which is sacredsave it be given you from me.\" (D&C 9:8-9.) How do you choose a wife? I've heard a lot of young people from Brigham Young University and elsewheresay, \"I've got to get a feeling of inspiration. I've gotto get some revelation. I've got to fast and pray andget the Lord to manifest to me whom I shouldmarry.\" Well, maybe it will be a little shock to you,but never in my life did I ever ask the Lord whom I ought to marry. It never occurred to me to ask him.I went out and found the girl I wanted; she suitedme; I evaluated and weighed the proposition, and it ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 194just seemed a hundred percent to me as though this ought to be. Now, if I'd done things perfectly, I'dhave done some counseling with the Lord, which I didn't do; but all I did was pray to the Lord andask for some guidance and direction in connectionwith the decision that I'd reached. A more perfectthing to have done would have been to counselwith him relative to the decision and get a spiritualconfirmation that the conclusion, which I by myagency and faculties had arrived at, was the right one. \"Why Are You Asking Me?\" Now, case study number two: There was a man whosename is not preserved to us in the ancient record.He's known as the brother of Jared. From othersources we know his name was Moriancumer. He wasthe spiritual leader, initially, of the Jaredite people.As they started their progress from the tower of Babelto their American promised land, he was the onewho communed with the Lord to get the direction,the spiritual guidance that they as a people needed. And some very interesting things occurred. They got to the waters that they were going to cross, andthe Lord said to him, \"Build some barges.\" But inter-estingly, the Lo rd didn't tell him how to build the barges. The brother of Jared had done it on a previousoccasion; he didn't need instruction; he didn't needrevelation to guide him. So he built the barges. But this time they were going to be used under some peculiar and difficult circumstances, and heneeded something more than was now present inthem: he needed some air. And this was a problemthat was beyond him. So he took that matter upwith the Lord, and because it was totally beyond hiscapacity to solve, the Lord solved it for him andsaid, \"Do thus and so and you'll have air.\" But then the brother of Jared\u2014having confidence because he was talking to the Lord, because he wascommuning and getting answers\u2014asked anotherquestion: he asked for a solution to a problem thathe should have figured out by himself and nottaken up with the Lord. He said, \"What will we dofor light in the vessels?\" And the Lord talked to him about it a little and then he said this: \"What will ye that I should dothat ye may have light in your vessels?\" (Eth. 2:23.)In effect, \"What are you asking me for? This issomething you should have solved.\" And he talkeda little more, and he repeated in essence the question:\"What will ye that I should prepare for you that yemay have light when ye are swallowed up in thedepths of the sea?\" (Eth. 2:25.) In other words,\"Moriancumer, this is your problem. Why are youtroubling me? I've given you your agency; you areendowed with capacity and ability. Get out andsolve the problem.\" Well, the brother of Jared got the message. He went up into a mount called Shelem, and the record sayshe \"did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones;and they were white and clear, even as transparentglass.\" (Eth. 3:1.) Well, the brother of Jared took sixteen little crystals of some sort (he could hold all of them in his hands)up on the mount. The record says, \"He did carrythem in his hands upon the top of the mount\"(Eth. 3:1), and then he said in effect to the Lord,\"Now this is what I hope you will do.\" You reallydon't tell the Lord what to do, but you get someinspiration, and you use your judgment, and then youtalk the matter over with him. And so Moriancumersaid to the Lord: \"Touch these stones, O Lord, withthy finger, and prepare them that they may shineforth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto usin the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.\" (Eth. 3:4.) And the Lord did what the brother of Jared asked, and this is the occasion when he then saw the fingerof the Lord; and, while he was in tune, he receivedrevelation that exceeded anything that any prophethad ever gained up to that moment. The Lordrevealed more to him about his nature and personalitythan ever theretofore had come forth, and it allcame about because he'd done everything that hecould do and because he counseled with the Lord. There's a fine balance between agency and inspiration. We're expected to do everything in our power andthen to seek an answer from the Lord, a confirmingseal that we've reached the right conclusion; andsometimes, happily, in addition, we get addedtruths and knowledge that we hadn't even supposed. \"They Shall Counsel between Themselves and Me\" Now, case study number three: In the early history of the Church, the Lord commanded the Saints toassemble in a certain place in Missouri. The decreewent forth: \"Assemble.\" Specifically, the decree wentforth, \"Let the Presiding Bishop come here and do ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 195such and such.\" Now notice what happened. The Lord is talking: \". . . as I spake concerning my servant Edward Partridge, this land is the land of his residence, andthose whom he has appointed for his counselors;and also the land of the residence of him whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse; \"Wherefore, let them bring their families to this land, [and here's the point] as they shall counselbetween themselves and me.\" (D&C 58:24-25.) You see, the Lord said \"assemble\" to Zion. The details and the arrangements, however, the howand the when and the circumstances, are to be determined by the agency of those who are called to assemble, butthey are to counsel with the Lord. Now, when youcounsel with the Lord, you talk something over. Ibring my children in and we counsel on a problem.I don't tell them what ought to be; I say, \"What doyou think? What's your evaluation? What do youwant to do in this situation? What's the best thingto do?\" And they tell me what they think, and if Ihappen to have any wisdom or judgment on thematter, I express my views. The Lord has all wisdom,all knowledge, and all power; he knows how togovern and control and direct us in a perfect manner.He lets us determine what we should do, but heexpects us to counsel with him. Now, after the Lord had said this to the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, he gave the principle thatgoverned in that situation, and it governs in allsituations. And this is one of our glorious revealedtruths. He said: \"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things,the same is a slothful and not a wise servant;wherefore he receiveth no reward. \"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own freewill, and bring to pass much righteousness; \"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do goodthey shall in nowise lose their reward. \"But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment withdoubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, thesame is damned.\" (D&C 58:26-29.) The Prophet Joseph Smith was asked, \"How do you govern so great and diverse a people as the Latter-day Saints?\"He replied, \"I teach them correct principles andthey govern themselves.\" Now, that's the order of heaven. That's how the Almighty operates. That's how the Church issupposed to operate. We're supposed to learn correctprinciples and then govern ourselves. We make ourown choices, and then we present the matter to theLord and get his approving, ratifying seal. \"Counsel with the Lord in All Thy Doings\" Those are the three case studies; let us come to therevealed conclusion. There was a man named Alma,a mighty and a great prophet. He had a son namedHelaman, who was a holy and righteous man,following the pattern that his father had set. And toHelaman, Alma said this: \"O, remember, my son, andlearn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youthto keep the commandments of God. Yea, and cryunto God for all thy support.\" (Al. 37:35-36.) Doyou think that if you're counseled to pray to theLord for support, both temporal and spiritual, thatthat's all you have to do? The Lord's prayer says,\"Give us this day our daily bread.\" Do you go outand sit down in the desert or on the mountain andpray with all the fervor you can possess, \"Give usthis day our daily bread,\" or do you go out and plantcrops and raise herds and do everything that youcan in your situation to accomplish the end result? Continuing: \"Yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in theLord; yea, let thy thoughts be directed unto theLord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placedupon the Lord forever.\" (Al. 37:36.) Now note:\"Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and hewill direct thee for good.\" (Al. 37:37.) What was Oliver Cowdery's problem? \"You took no thought save it was to ask . . . you must study it outin your mind.\" (D&C 9:7-8.) Well, do you want a wife? Do you want anything that's right and proper? You go to work, and youuse the agency and power and ability that God hasgiven you. You use every faculty, you get all thejudgment that you can centered on the problem,you make up your own mind, and then, to be surethat you don't err, you counsel with the Lord. Youtalk it over. You say, \"This is what I think; what doyou think?\" And if you get the calm, sweet suretythat comes only from the Holy Spirit, you knowyou've reached the right conclusion; but if there'sanxiety and uncertainty in your heart, then you'd ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 196better start over, because the Lord's hand is not in it, and you're notgetting the ratifying seal that, as amember of the Church who has thegift of the Holy Ghost, you are entitledto receive. \". . . yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that hemay watch over you in your sleep, andwhen thou risest in the morning let thyheart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do thesethings, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.\"(Al. 37:37.) If you learn how to use the agency thatGod has given you, and if you try to make yourown decisions, and if you reach conclusions thatare sound and right, and if you counsel with theLord and get his ratifying seal of approval upon theconclusions you've reached, then you've receivedrevelation, for one thing; and for another thing,you're going to have the great reward of eternal lifeand be lifted up at the last day. We're not all equalby any means; some have one talent and capacityand some another. But if we use the talents wehave, somehow we'll come out all right. One Monday when we were celebrating Washington's birthday, I was down at my mother's sawing a login the backyard. She came out to give me somedirection and see how I was doing it, and she wasn'tvery pleased. She thought I ought to do it differently.She went back into the house and in a few minutesmy younger brother arrived. She said to him, \"Ithink you'd better go out in the backyard and giveBruce some help and see that he does this thingright.\" And then she said to him, \"Bruce isn't verybright.\" Well, so I'm not. So I start where I am, andI go forward from there. I start using such talent asI have, and I begin to apply the principles of eternaltruth to my life. I consult and counsel with the Lordin the process, and no matter where I am, the gospeltakes me forward and onward and upward, andblessings flow to me that will ennoble and sanctifyand improve me in this life and eventually give meglory and honor and dignity in the life to come. We Have the Spirit of Revelation I think we've said enough; the principles are before us. Let me just do one thing more. Let me do, ineffect, what my friend Alma would do. After he'dpreached a sermon, he said, \"And this is not all. Doye not suppose that I know of thesethings myself?\" (Al. 5:45.) That is he'dgiven them the case studies, he'dquoted the revelations, he'd told themwhat was involved, and then he borepersonal testimony. This is what weought to do in the Church. We oughtto learn how to teach by the power ofthe Spirit, so that when we get through talking about the gospel subjects we'll know whether what we've said is right,and we'll be in a position to bear testimony, notalone of the truth and the divinity of the work, butalso that the doctrine we proclaim and the everlastingtruths we expound are right, that they are the mind and voice and will of the Lord. The glorious,wondrous thing about this work and about thesedoctrines is that they are true. There isn't anythingin this world, no truth that we can conceive of, tocompare with the truth that the work we're engagedin is true, that the Lord's hand is here. It's a literalfact that we have the gift and power of the HolyGhost. We have the spirit of revelation, the spirit oftestimony, the spirit of prophecy. These things mustbe, or we're not in the Church and kingdom of God;we're not the Lord's people. The fact is that we do have them; revelation works. Don't shy away from getting revelation. Joseph Smithsaid, \"God hath not revealed anything to Joseph,but what he will make known unto the Twelve, andeven the least Saint may know all things as fast as heis able to bear them.\" (Teachings of the Prophet JosephSmith, 149.) We're entitled to the spirit of revelation, but what I'm attempting to teach is that there's ahow and a procedure, and there are conditionsprecedent. It is our obligation to go to work on ourproblems and then counsel with the Lord and getthe ratifying seal of the Holy Spirit on the conclusionsthat we've reached; and that ratifying seal is thespirit of revelation. God grant us wisdom in these things. God grant us the courage and the ability to stand on our own feetand use our agency and the abilities and capacitieswe possess; then let's be sufficiently humble andamenable to the Spirit to bow our will to his will, toget his ratifying, confirming seal of approval, to getin our lives in that way the spirit of revelation. Andif we so do, there's no question about the result; it'speace in this life; it's glory and honor and dignityin the life to come. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATE SELECTION 197 If you get the calm, sweet surety that comes only from the Holy Spirit, you know you've reached the right conclusion.MATURITY SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"Two years make a tremendous difference in the life of a young man. He goes out a boy and comes backa man. He goes out immature, he comes back matureand strong, gracious, and a worker and willing toserve. He goes back to college in most cases andthere he will make higher grades than he ever madebefore, because he has purpose in his life. He isalready enjoying purpose, and now he has a newpurpose\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 590-91). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Each of us, with discipline and effort, has the capacity to control his thoughts and his actions.This is part of the process of developing spiritual,physical, and emotional maturity\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1987, 57; or Ensign, May 1987, 47). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"Some weeks ago a man holding a high office in the Church asked a special favor of me. 'Would yoube good enough to take the time to listen while amother, father, and their teenage daughter, specialfriends of mine, try to talk to each other?' \"As the four of us sat together, it immediately became obvious that all channels of communication werejammed with prejudice, threats, accusations, andresentment. As the verbal storms developed withbitter intensity, I found myself the only listener.Even though they had individually and collectivelyagreed I would be the counselor, judge, arbiter, orreferee, if you please, I found myself waiting patientlyfor an opportunity to be heard. During the heatedand emotional confrontation, the teenager repeatedlyexpressed her resentment with: 'You can't talk tome like that. I am an adult now. You can't treat melike that. I am an adult now. You can't dominatemy life anymore. I am an adult now.'\"Each time she said 'I am an adult now,' I cringed.By definition, an adult is a person who has attainedthe age of maturity\u2014full grown. While it is true aperson may be legally classified as an adult when heor she reaches a certain age, for our purposes todaythe kind of adult status we are talking about mustbe earned by actions and attitude. \"I am not quite sure who has the right or responsi- bility to declare someone an adult, but I am quitecertain that often the least qualified to make thedeclaration would be the individual himself. If aperson is mature, he or she will not need to announceit. Personal conduct is the only true measurementof maturity. Adult classification, when it pertains tobehavior, does not come with age, wrinkles, or grayhair. Perhaps it is not too far off the mark to sayadult conduct is a process. Mature conduct is gener-ally developed through self-discipline, resilience,and continuing effort. \"In fairness to the teenager, even though her declaration of 'I am an adult now' didn't impressme favorably, there were times during the visitwhen I thought she showed more maturity thanothers in the room. When we who are more senioruse an expression like 'I am older than you' toclinch a point, I am not too sure it is very effective.How much better it is to gain respect and lovethrough worthy parental conduct than to seek itthrough the means of the age differential. \"Young men and young women worldwide, you, as well as your parents, need not announce or proclaimyour maturity. By your faith and works you will beknown for what you are. By your fruits you will beknown and classified. Those among us who useabusive arguments, temper tantrums, demeaningand painful criticism, fruitless counter-complaints,and disrespect will benefit no one. Let us put awaypetty malice, resentment, and retaliatory practicesthat are self-destructive and return to a path ofsafety well marked by the Good Shepherd. \"It takes courage to flee from verbal contention. When maturity begins to set in, adult lives set in. 'Letall bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, andevil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: \"'And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sakehath forgiven you' (Ephesians 4:31-32). It isalarming how many older people go through lifewithout ever becoming real adults. Personal conduct is the only true measurement of maturity. \u2014Elder Marvin J. Ashton ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL198\"For many years I have had a very vivid picture in my mind of Jesus Christ standing before Pilate.While Jesus stood in front of an angry mob, whosneered and condemned, Pilate tried to get Him torespond and retaliate. He tried to get Him to declarehimself a king. Jesus was silent. His life was hissermon. He was perfect in character, a worthy son,the Only Begotten of the Father. His maturity, ifyou please, would speak for itself\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1987, 78-79; or Ensign, May 1987, 65). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Just as the capacity to defer gratification is a sign of real maturity, likewise the willingness to wait fordeferred explanation is a sign of real faith and oftrust spread over time\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1985, 91; or Ensign, May 1985, 71). Elder Richard G. Scott \"We are here on earth to gain experience we can obtain in no other way. We are given the opportunityto grow, to develop, and to gain spiritual maturity. Todo that, we must learn to apply truth. How we facechallenges and resolve difficult problems is cruciallyimportant to our happiness\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1989, 38; or Ensign, Nov. 1989, 30). Elder Marion D. Hanks \"'We live in a universe of moral law. We can choose evil and get what we want right now and then payfor it afterward. Or we can choose good and pay forit first, before we get it.' (Fosdick.) So it is with a lifeof honesty and responsibility, of sexual purity, ofintegrity, of selfless service. . . . \"When Paul spoke of charity out of the 'pure heart,' I believe he was talking about the sense of honest,unselfish concern for others that is the mark of moraland spiritual maturity. . . . To truly care about others,to be considerate and kind and responsible reflectstrue maturity\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1967,59-60). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMATURITY 199MEN'S DIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SELECTED TEACHINGS President Harold B. Lee \"All women have a desire for companionship. They want to be wives; they want to be mothers; and whenmen refuse to assume their responsibility of marriage,for no good reason, they are unable to consummatemarriage. Brethren, we are not doing our duty asholders of the priesthood when we go beyond themarriageable age and withhold ourselves from anhonorable marriage to these lovely women, who areseeking the fulfillment of a woman's greatest desire tohave a husband, a family, and a home\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1973, 119-20; or Ensign, Jan. 1974, 100). President Spencer W. Kimball \"The Lord organized the whole program in the begin- ning with a father who procreates, provides, and loves and directs, and a mother who conceives andbears and nurtures and feeds and trains. The Lordcould have organized it otherwise but chose to havea unit with responsibility and purposeful associationswhere children train and discipline each other andcome to love, honor, and appreciate each other. Thefamily is the great plan of life as conceived andorganized by our Father in heaven\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1973, 151; or Ensign, July 1973, 15). President Howard W. Hunter \"Together with your wife, you determine the spiritual climate of your home\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1994, 69; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 51).FATHER, CONSIDER YOUR WAYS Pamphlet Brethren, have you considered the challenge it is to be a successful father? It takes hard work andplanning to rear your children in righteousness andhave unity with your wife, to build a constantfeeling of love and harmony in the home. Why isbeing a successful, righteous father such a challengefor almost any man? The Lord's plan of salvation requires that you pass through trials in this mortal life. Those trials seemto be greatest when you reach fatherhood; but beassured\u2014fatherhood, in a sense, is an apprenticeshipto godhood. This presentation will help give you abroader perspective of what it means to be a father;to give you an understanding and a feeling of yourworth to your Father in heaven. Father, consideryour ways! Through his Son, Jesus Christ, God created the heavens and the earth. At this time you lived withhim as his spirit child, and you shouted for joy whenthis earth was formed. You knew the necessity ofcoming to earth, of gaining a physical body, and ofpassing through the many trials of earth life. Youknew that at times you would make mistakes. Youalso knew that through the atoning sacrifice of yourBrother and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, you couldrepent of these mistakes and be found clean. You also knew that Jesus Christ was to be your example and would show you the way to return backto your Father in heaven. \"So God created man in hisown image . . . male and female created he them.\"(Genesis 1:27.) And he gave man dominion, orstewardship, over all things on the earth and madehim accountable for them. His greatest stewardshipand accountability would be for children. Marriage, as ordained of God, is the lawful union of man and wife, not only for this earth life, but forall eternity. A paramount purpose of marriage is toclothe spirit children of our Father in heaven withearthly bodies. When your first child is born, youbecome a father. The title father is sacred and eternal. It is significant that of all the titles of respect andhonor and admiration that are given to Deity, hehas asked us to address him as Father. A father is the presiding authority in his family. On this earth your initial experience of being a father ofa family gives you opportunities to learn to governThe title father is sacred and eternal. It is significant that of all the titles of respect and honor and admiration that are given to Deity, he has asked us to address him as Father. \u2014Father, Consider Your Ways ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL200with love and patience, and with your wife to teach each of your children correct principles; to preparethem to become proper fathers and mothers. Whenyou do this according to the pattern given us by theLord, and you endure to the end, your family willbe added upon eternally. A righteous family is aneternal unit. On this earth, priesthood quorums andall other organizations of the Church aid you, thefather, and your wife and family in achieving theseeternal goals. Father, with your wife you have entrusted to you from God the power to be cocreators with him, to multiply and replenish the earth. As cocreators,you have delegated to you the opportunity andresponsibility to bring into mortality and teach inlight and truth spirit children of our Father in heaven. When you recognize the importance of teaching your children, you become humble, because at onceyou realize that this is accomplished by precept andexample. You cannot be one thing and effectivelyteach another. You must live and study and pray forthe constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.You must purify and organize your life so that yourexample and leadership reflect the light of thegospel of Jesus Christ. You must plan your day as guided by the Spirit of the Lord, earnestly seeking your own welfare andthe welfare of your family before other cares blindyou to these first responsibilities. As we have beentaught by living prophets, \"No other success in lifecan compensate for failure in the home,\" (seeDavid O. McKay in Conference Report, Apr. 1964, p. 5) and \"The greatest work you will ever do willbe within the walls of your own home.\" (SeeHarold B. Lee, Strengthening the Home, 1973, p. 7.) It must be emphasized that as a father, you arealways teaching. For good or ill your family learnsyour ways, your beliefs, your heart, your ideas, yourconcerns. Your children may or may not choose tofollow you, but the example you give is the greatestlight you hold before your children, and you areaccountable for that light. At one time a young father acted somewhat unkindly to his wife. Three days later this same man saw histhree-year-old daughter use his very words in actingunkindly to her mother. The man was sobered andcame to ask himself this question, \"Do I love mychildren and family enough to repent, to changemy life for their welfare?\"The obligations, the burdens, the responsibility of being a proper father may seem overwhelming.Fortunately, you are not required to preside andjudge and act without counsel, without assistance.You have a wife\u2014a companion, a counselor, a partner,a helpmeet, a friend. Is she one with you? Do you thank the Lord daily for her? Do you keep the covenants you made withher and with the Lord in the temple? Do you alwaysstrive to keep your thoughts and words and actionspure? Do you realize that when you offend her in anyway it is like offending yourself, since you are one? Does she know of your love for her? Is your relationship one of continual courtship? Do youregularly spend time together\u2014alone, where yourexpression and actions reassure her of yourappreciation and reliance on her companionship?Do you exercise righteous leadership with her? Do you always keep sight of your marriage goal, the creation of an eternal unit bound together by loveand by the power and ordinances of the priesthood? Father, you are accountable to the Lord for what you have and what you are. In the future you willsurely stand before him. What will be your reportconcerning your family? Will you be able to reportthat your home was a place of love, a bit of heaven?That daily family prayer and secret prayer werefostered? That it was a house of fasting? That infamily home evenings and at other times you andyour wife taught your children the basic principlesof the gospel? Will you be able to report that you created an environment in your home to build faith in a livingGod, to encourage learning, to teach order, obedience,and sacrifice? That you often shared your testimonyof the reality of your Father in heaven, of thetruthfulness of the restored gospel with your wifeand children? Will you be able to report that youfollowed the living prophets? That your home waswhere your tender children could feel protected andsafe, and where they felt the love, and acceptance,and warmth of you and their mother? And what will be your report concerning the temporal welfare of your family? It is God's plan that youwork for what you get. Your occupation should behonorable and should provide sufficiently to meetthe needs of your family. Are your duties and laborsundertaken with a joyful and thankful spirit? Doyour wife and children feel secure because you feel ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 201good about your occupation? Do you practice frugality and thrift and avoid debt by living withinyour income, your tithed income? Do your wife andchildren feel a sense of tradition and stability becausethe family home is not relocated on a whim, forunsound reasons? Father, are you committed to the eternal welfare of each of your children? Do you labor and love andstrive with them as long as they live? Fatherhood is leadership, the most important kind of leadership. It has always been so; it always willbe so. Father, with the assistance and counsel andencouragement of your eternal companion, youpreside in the home. It is not a matter of whetheryou are most worthy or best qualified, but it is amatter of law and appointment. You preside at themeal table, at family prayer. You preside at familyhome evening; and as guided by the Spirit of theLord, you see that your children are taught correctprinciples. It is your place to give direction relatingto all of family life. You give father's blessings. You take an active part in establishing family rules and discipline. As a leaderin your home you plan and sacrifice to achieve theblessing of a unified and happy family. To do all ofthis requires that you live a family-centered life. Now, you are a son of God. You were sent to this earth to gain a physical body and to prove yourselfin the trials and experiences of this earth life. It isthe plan of your Father in heaven that you havebeen or will be sealed for eternity to a companion.In marriage, you and your wife are one in purposeas you strive to fulfill the purposes of the Lord. As a cocreator with God you bring forth children. You prepare your family and each member in the family to serve their fellowman, to build the kingdomof God on earth. You conscientiously provide fortheir material well-being. In the family you learn togovern righteously. You teach your family generallyand each child individually the doctrines of thekingdom. The day will come when you will stand before the Lord and report your stewardship as a father on earth.Father, consider your ways. What will be your report?A Summary 1. Your fatherhood is, in a sense, an apprenticeship to godhood. 2. Your earth life is a part of the plan of salvation that enables you to become like your Father inheaven. 3. Jesus Christ is your example to show you the way to return to your Father in heaven. 4. A righteous family is an eternal unity. 5. You are the presiding authority in the home.6.

An Eternal Calling Fathers, yours is an eternal calling fromwhich you are never released. Callingsin the Church, as important as theyare, by their very nature are only for aperiod of time, and then an appropriaterelease takes place. But a father'scalling is eternal, and its importance transcendstime. It is a calling for both time and eternity. President Harold B. Lee truly stated that \"the most important of the Lord's work that you [fathers] willever do will be the work you do within the walls ofyour own home. Home teaching, bishopric's work,and other Church duties are all important, but themost important work is within the walls of yourhome\" (Strengthening the Home [pamphlet, 1973], p. 7). What, then, is a father's specific responsibilitywithin the sacred walls of his home? May I suggesttwo basic responsibilities of every father in Israel. Provide for Material Needs First, you have a sacred responsibility to provide forthe material needs of your family. The Lord clearly defined the roles of providing for and rearing a righteous posterity. In the beginning,Adam, not Eve, was instructed to earn the bread bythe sweat of his brow.The Apostle Paul counsels husbands and fathers,\"But if any provide not for his own, and speciallyfor those of his own house, he hath denied thefaith, and is worse than an infidel\" (1 Timothy 5:8). Early in the history of the restored Church, the Lord specifically charged men with the obligationto provide for their wives and family. In January of1832 He said, \"Verily I say unto you, that everyman who is obliged to provide for his own family,let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose hiscrown\" (D&C 75:28). Three months later the Lordsaid again, \"Women have claim on their husbandsfor their maintenance, until their husbands aretaken\" (D&C 83:2). This is the divine right of a wifeand mother. While she cares for and nourishes herchildren at home, her husband earns the living forthe family, which makes this nourishing possible. In a home where there is an able-bodied husband, he is expected to be the breadwinner. Sometimes we hear of husbands who, because of economicconditions, have lost their jobs and expect the wives to go out of the home and work,even though the husband is stillcapable of providing for his family. Inthese cases, we urge the husband to doall in his power to allow his wife toremain in the home caring for thechildren while he continues to providefor his family the best he can, even though the job he is able to secure may not be idealand family budgeting may have to be tighter. Also, the need for education or material things does not justify the postponing of children in order to keepthe wife working as the breadwinner of the family. Counsel of President Kimball I remember the counsel of our beloved prophet Spencer W. Kimball to married students. He said: \"Ihave told tens of thousands of young folks that whenthey marry they should not wait for children untilthey have finished their schooling and financialdesires. . . . They should live together come. . . . \". . know of no President Kimball continued, \"where an authorization is given toyoung wives to withhold their families and go towork to put their husbands through school. Thereare thousands of husbands who have worked theirown way through school and have reared families ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 203 Fathers, yours is an eternal calling from which you are never released.at the same time\" (\"Marriage Is Honorable,\" in Speeches of the Year, 1973 [Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1974], p. 263). A Mother's Role in the Home Brethren of the priesthood, I continue to emphasize the importance of mothers staying home to nurture,care for, and train their children in the principles ofrighteousness. As I travel throughout the Church, I feel that the great majority of Latter-day Saint mothers earnestlywant to follow this counsel. But we know thatsometimes the mother works outside of the homeat the encouragement, or even insistence, of herhusband. It is he who wants the items of conveniencethat the extra income can buy. Not only will thefamily suffer in such instances, brethren, but yourown spiritual growth and progression will behampered. I say to all of you, the Lord has chargedmen with the responsibility to provide for theirfamilies in such a way that the wife is allowed tofulfill her role as mother in the home. Family Preparedness More Urgent Today Fathers, another vital aspect of providing for thematerial needs of your family is the provision youshould be making for your family in case of an emer-gency. Family preparedness has been a long-estab- lished welfare principle. It is even more urgent today. I ask you earnestly, have you provided for your family a year's supply of food, clothing, and, wherepossible, fuel? The revelation to produce and storefood may be as essential to our temporal welfaretoday as boarding the ark was to the people in thedays of Noah. Also, are you living within your income and saving a little? Are you honest with the Lord in the payment of your tithes? Living this divine law will bring bothspiritual and material blessings. Yes, brethren, as fathers in Israel you have a great responsibility to provide for the material needs ofyour family and to have the necessary provisions incase of emergency. Provide Spiritual Leadership Second, you have a sacred responsibility to providespiritual leadership in your family.In a pamphlet published some years ago by theCouncil of the Twelve, we said the following:\"Fatherhood is leadership, the most important kindof leadership. It has always been so; it always willbe so. Father, with the assistance and counsel andencouragement of your eternal companion, youpreside in the home\" (Father, Consider Your Ways[pamphlet, 1973], pp. 4-5). However, along with that presiding position come important obligations. We sometimes hear accountsof men, even in the Church, who think that beinghead of the home somehow puts them in a superiorrole and allows them to dictate and make demandsupon their family. The Apostle Paul points out that \"the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church\" (Ephesians 5:23; italics added). That isthe model we are to follow in our role of presidingin the home. We do not find the Savior leading theChurch with a harsh or unkind hand. We do notfind the Savior treating His Church with disrespector neglect. We do not find the Savior using force orcoercion to accomplish His purposes. Nowhere dowe find the Savior doing anything but that whichedifies, uplifts, comforts, and exalts the Church.Brethren, I say to you with all soberness, He is themodel we must follow as we take the spiritual leadin our families. Particularly is this true in your relationship with your wife. Love Your Wives Here again the counsel from the Apostle Paul is mostbeautiful and to the point. He said simply, \"Husbands,love your wives, even as Christ also loved thechurch\" (Ephesians 5:25). In latter-day revelation the Lord speaks again of this obligation. He said, \"Thou shalt love thy wife with allthy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else\"(D&C 42:22). To my knowledge there is only oneother thing in all scripture that we are commandedto love with all our hearts, and that is God Himself.Think what that means! This kind of love can be shown for your wives in so many ways. First and foremost, nothing except GodHimself takes priority over your wife in your life\u2014not work, not recreation, not hobbies. Your wife isyour precious, eternal helpmate\u2014your companion. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 204What does it mean to love someone with all your heart? It means to love with all your emotionalfeelings and with all your devotion. Surely whenyou love your wife with all your heart, you cannotdemean her, criticize her, find fault with her, orabuse her by words, sullen behavior, or actions. What does it mean to \"cleave unto her\"? It means to stay close to her, to be loyal and faithful to her,to communicate with her, and to express your lovefor her. Love means being sensitive to her feelings and needs. She wants to be noticed and treasured. She wants tobe told that you view her as lovely and attractive andimportant to you. Love means putting her welfareand self-esteem as a high priority in your life. You should be grateful that she is the mother of your children and the queen of your home, grateful thatshe has chosen homemaking and motherhood\u2014tobear, to nourish, to love, and to train yourchildren\u2014as the noblest calling of all. Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regardingfamily plans, family activities, and family budgeting.Don't be stingy with your time or with your means. Give her the opportunity to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially as well as spiritually. Remember, brethren, love can be nurtured and nourished by little tokens. Flowers on specialoccasions are wonderful, but so is your willingnessto help with the dishes, change diapers, get up witha crying child in the night, and leave the televisionor the newspaper to help with the dinner. Those arethe quiet ways we say \"I love you\" with our actions.They bring rich dividends for such little effort. This kind of loving priesthood leadership applies to your children as well as to your wife. A Father's Role in the Home Mothers play an important role as the heart of the home, but this in no way lessens the equally impor-tant role fathers should play, as head of the home,in nurturing, training, and loving their children. As the patriarch in your home, you have a serious responsibility to assume leadership in working withyour children. You must help create a home wherethe Spirit of the Lord can abide. Your place is to givedirection to all family life. You should take an activepart in establishing family rules and discipline.Your homes should be havens of peace and joy foryour family. Surely no child should fear his ownfather\u2014especially a priesthood father. A father'sduty is to make his home a place of happiness andjoy. He cannot do this when there is bickering,quarreling, contention, or unrighteous behavior. Thepowerful effect of righteous fathers in setting anexample, disciplining and training, nurturing andloving is vital to the spiritual welfare of his children. Give Spiritual Leadership With love in my heart for the fathers in Israel, mayI suggest ten specific ways that fathers can givespiritual leadership to their children: 1. Give father's blessings to your children. Baptize and confirm your children. Ordain your sons to the priesthood. These will become spiritualhighlights in the lives of your children. 2. Personally direct family prayers, daily scripture reading, and weekly family home evenings. Yourpersonal involvement will show your childrenhow important these activities really are. 3. Whenever possible, attend Church meetings together as a family. Family worship under yourleadership is vital to your children's spiritualwelfare. 4. Go on daddy-daughter dates and father-and-sons' outings with your children. As a family, go oncampouts and picnics, to ball games and recitals,to school programs, and so forth. Having Dadthere makes all the difference. 5. Build traditions of family vacations and trips and outings. These memories will never be forgottenby your children. 6. Have regular one-on-one visits with your children. Let them talk about what they would like to.Teach them gospel principles. Teach them truevalues. Tell them you love them. Personal timewith your children tells them where Dad putshis priorities. 7. Teach your children to work, and show them the value of working toward a worthy goal.Establishing mission funds and education fundsfor your children shows them what Dad considersto be important. 8. Encourage good music and art and literature in your homes. Homes that have a spirit ofrefinement and beauty will bless the lives ofyour children forever. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2059. As distances allow, regularly attend the temple with your wife. Your children will then better understand the importance of temple marriageand temple vows and the eternal family unit. 10. Have your children see your joy and satisfaction in service to the Church. This can becomecontagious to them, so they, too, will want toserve in the Church and will love the kingdom. Your Most Important Calling Oh, husbands and fathers in Israel, you can do somuch for the salvation and exaltation of yourfamilies! Your responsibilities are so important. Remember your sacred calling as a father in Israel\u2014 your most important calling in time and eternity\u2014acalling from which you will never be released. May you always provide for the material needs of your family and, with your eternal companion atyour side, may you fulfill your sacred responsibilityto provide the spiritual leadership in your home. To this end I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. BEING A RIGHTEOUS HUSBAND AND FATHER President Howard W. HunterPresident of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 66-70; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 49-51 My dear brethren of the priesthood, I consider it a privilege to meet with you this evening in thisgeneral priesthood meeting. The priesthood is thegreatest brotherhood on the earth. I feel great strengthin seeing your faithfulness and feeling your loveand sustaining vote. We are particularly grateful tohave so many of our Aaronic Priesthood brethrenhere with their fathers or advisers. Marriage Is a Sacred Privilege and Obligation The subject of my address this evening will be more particularly directed to the husbands and fathers.All of you who hold the Aaronic Priesthood willsoon arrive at the years of marriage and fatherhood.Therefore, what I say tonight has application to allpresent. I wish to speak of the relationship that a man holding the priesthood should have with his wifeand children. With a knowledge of the plan ofsalvation as a foundation, a man who holds thepriesthood looks upon marriage as a sacred privilegeand obligation. It is not good for man nor for womanto be alone. Man is not complete without woman.Neither can fill the measure of their creation withoutthe other (see 1 Corinthians 11:11; Moses 3:18).Marriage between a man and a woman is ordainedof God (see D&C 49:15-17). Only through the newand everlasting covenant of marriage can theyrealize the fulness of eternal blessings (see D&C131:1-4; 132:15-19). As a matter of priesthoodresponsibility, a man, under normal circumstances,should not unduly postpone marriage. Brethren,the Lord has spoken plainly on this matter. It isyour sacred and solemn responsibility to follow hiscounsel and the words of his prophets. The prophets of the past have spoken also of those who may not have opportunity to marry in thislife. President Lorenzo Snow said: \"There is no Latter-day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because ofhaving failed to do certain things when opportunitieswere not furnished him or her. In other words, if ayoung man or a young woman has no opportunityof getting married, and they live faithful lives up tothe time of their death, they will have all theblessings, exaltation, and glory that any man orwoman will have who had this opportunity andimproved it. That is sure and positive\" (The Teachingsof Lorenzo Snow, comp. Clyde J. Williams [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984], p. 138). I believe President Snow's statement to be true. Show Perfect Moral Fidelity A man who holds the priesthood shows perfect moral fidelity to his wife and gives her no reason to doubthis faithfulness. A husband is to love his wife with allhis heart and cleave unto her and none else (see D&C42:22-26). President Spencer W. Kimball explained: \"The words none else eliminate everyone and everything. The spouse then becomes pre-eminent in the life of the husband or wife and neither sociallife nor occupational life nor political life nor anyother interest nor person nor thing shall ever take ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 206precedence over the companion spouse\" ( The Miracle of Forgiveness [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969], p. 250). The Lord forbids and his church condemns any and every intimate relationship outside of marriage.Infidelity on the part of a man breaks the heart ofhis wife and loses her confidence and the confidenceof his children (see Jacob 2:35). Be faithful in your marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. Pornography, flirtations, andunwholesome fantasies erode one's character andstrike at the foundation of a happymarriage. Unity and trust within amarriage are thereby destroyed. Onewho does not control his thoughts andthus commits adultery in his heart, if he does not repent, shall not have theSpirit but shall deny the faith and shallfear (see D&C 42:23; 63:16). Show Reverence for Motherhood A man who holds the priesthood has reverence for motherhood. Mothers are given a sacred privilege to\"bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of[the] Father continued, that he may be glorified\"(D&C 132:63). The First Presidency has said: \"Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumedby mankind\" (in James R. Clark, comp., Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965-75], 6:178). priesthood cannot out its destiny, nor can God's purposes be fulfilled,without our helpmates. Mothers perform a labor thepriesthood cannot do. For this gift of life, the priest- hood should have love unbounded for the mothersof their children. Honor your wife's unique and divinely appointed role as a mother in Israel and her special capacity to bear and nurture children. We are under divinecommandment to multiply and replenish the earthand to bring up our children and grandchildren inlight and truth (see Moses 2:28; D&C 93:40). Youshare, as a loving partner, the care of the children.Help her to manage and keep up your home. Helpteach, train, and discipline your children. You should express regularly to your wife and children your reverence and respect for her. Indeed,one of the greatest things a father can do for hischildren is to love their mother.Regard the Family as Most Important A man who holds the priesthood regards the family asordained of God. Your leadership of the family is yourmost important and sacred responsibility. The familyis the most important unit in time and in eternityand, as such, transcends every other interest in life. We reiterate what was stated by President David O. McKay: \"No other success [in life] can compensatefor failure in the home\" (quoting J. E. McCulloch, Home: the Savior of Civilization, p. 42; in Conference Report, Apr. 1935,p. 116) and President Harold B. Lee:\"The most important of the Lord'swork you and I will ever do will bewithin the walls of our own homes\"(Stand Ye in Holy Places [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974], p. 255). Effective family leadership, brethren, requires bothquantity and quality time. The teaching andgovernance of the family must not be left to yourwife alone, to society, to school, or even to theChurch. Accept Wife as an Equal Partner A man who holds the priesthood accepts his wife asa partner in the leadership of the home and familywith full knowledge of and full participation in alldecisions relating thereto. Of necessity there mustbe in the Church and in the home a presiding officer(see D&C 107:21). By divine appointment, theresponsibility to preside in the home rests upon thepriesthood holder (see Moses 4:22). The Lord intendedthat the wife be a helpmeet for man ( meet means equal)\u2014that is, a companion equal and necessary in full partnership. Presiding in righteousnessnecessitates a shared responsibility between husbandand wife; together you act with knowledge andparticipation in all family matters. For a man tooperate independently of or without regard to thefeelings and counsel of his wife in governing thefamily is to exercise unrighteous dominion. Be Tender in the Intimate Relationship Keep yourselves above any domineering or unworthybehavior in the tender, intimate relationship betweenhusband and wife. Because marriage is ordained ofGod, the intimate relationship between husbands andwives is good and honorable in the eyes of God. Hehas commanded that they be one flesh and that theymultiply and replenish the earth (see Moses 2:28; 3:24). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 207 Be faithful in your marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed.You are to love your wife as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for it (see Ephesians 5:25-31). Tenderness and respect\u2014never selfishness\u2014must be the guiding principles in the intimate relationshipbetween husband and wife. Each partner must beconsiderate and sensitive to the other's needs anddesires. Any domineering, indecent, or uncontrolledbehavior in the intimate relationship betweenhusband and wife is condemned by the Lord. Be Loving, Not Abusive Any man who abuses or demeans his wife physicallyor spiritually is guilty of grievous sin and in need ofsincere and serious repentance. Differences should beworked out in love and kindness and with a spiritof mutual reconciliation. A man should always speakto his wife lovingly and kindly, treating her withthe utmost respect. Marriage is like a tender flower,brethren, and must be nourished constantly withexpressions of love and affection. You who hold the priesthood must not be abusive in your relationship with children. Seek always toemploy the principles of priesthood government setforth in the revelations (see D&C 93:40; 121:34-36,41-45). President George Albert Smith wisely counseled: \"We should not lose our tempers and abuse oneanother. . . . Nobody ever abused anybody else whenhe had the spirit of the Lord. It is always when wehave some other spirit\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1950, p. 8). No man who has been ordained to the priesthood of God can with impunity abuse his wife or child.Sexual abuse of children has long been a cause forexcommunication from the Church. We encourage you, brethren, to remember that priesthood is a righteous authority only. Earn therespect and confidence of your children through yourloving relationship with them. A righteous fatherprotects his children with his time and presence in their social, educational, and spiritual activitiesand responsibilities. Tender expressions of love and affection toward children are as much theresponsibility of the father as the mother. Tell yourchildren you love them. Provide Temporal Support You who hold the priesthood have the responsibility,unless disabled, to provide temporal support foryour wife and children. No man can shift theburden of responsibility to another, not even to hiswife. The Lord has commanded that women andchildren have claim on their husbands and fathersfor their maintenance (see D&C 83; 1 Timothy 5:8).President Ezra Taft Benson has stated that when ahusband encourages or insists that his wife workout of the home for their convenience, \"not onlywill the family suffer in such instances, . . . but [his]own spiritual growth and progression will behampered\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987, pp.60-61; or Ensign, Nov. 1987, p. 49). We urge you to do all in your power to allow yourwife to remain in the home, caring for the childrenwhile you provide for the family the best you can.We further emphasize that men who abandon theirfamily and fail to meet their responsibility to carefor those they have fathered may find their eligibilityfor a temple recommend and their standing in theChurch in jeopardy. In cases of divorce or separation,men must demonstrate that they are meetingfamily support payments mandated by law andobligated by the principles of the Church in orderto qualify for the blessings of the Lord. Lead Family in Church Participation A man who holds the priesthood leads his family inChurch participation so they will know the gospeland be under the protection of the covenants andordinances. If you are to enjoy the blessings of theLord, you must set your own homes in order.Together with your wife, you determine the spiritualclimate of your home. Your first obligation is to getyour own spiritual life in order through regularscriptural study and daily prayer. Secure and honoryour priesthood and temple covenants; encourageyour family to do the same. Teach the Gospel to Family Members Take seriously your responsibility to teach thegospel to your family through regular family homeevening, family prayer, devotional and scripturereading time, and other teaching moments. Givespecial emphasis to preparation for missionary serviceand temple marriage. As patriarch in the home,exercise your priesthood through performing theappropriate ordinances for your family and by givingblessings to your wife and children. Next to your ownsalvation, brethren, there is nothing so importantto you as the salvation of your wife and children. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 208Brethren, I have spoken plainly to you regarding your responsibility as holders of the holy priesthood.If there are areas in your life where improvementmay be needed, I encourage you to make this a matter of prayerful consideration. I testify that this is what the Lord would have the brethren of the priesthood receive at this time. May you be blessed in your efforts to be righteoushusbands and fathers, I pray as I bear solemn witnessof the truthfulness of that which has been spokenthis evening and do so in the name of the LordJesus Christ, amen. LIVING WORTHY OF THE GIRL YOU WILL SOMEDAY MARRY President Gordon B. Hinckley President of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Apr. 1998, 66-69; or Ensign, May 1998, 49-51 A week ago President [James E.] Faust and theYoung Women general presidency spoke to theyoung women of the Church in this Tabernacle. As I looked at that gathering of beautiful young women, the question moved through my mind, \"Are we rearing a generation of young men worthy of them?\" Those girls are so fresh and vibrant. They are beautiful. They are bright. They are able. They arefaithful. They are virtuous. They are true. They aresimply wonderful and delightful young women. And so tonight, in this great priesthood meeting, I wish to speak to you young men, their counterpart.The title of my talk: \"Living Worthy of the Girl YouWill Someday Marry.\" The girl you marry will take a terrible chance on you. She will give her all to the young man she marries.He will largely determine the remainder of her life.She will even surrender her name to his name. As Adam declared in the Garden of Eden:\"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. . . .\"Therefore shall a man leave his father and hismother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and theyshall be one flesh\" (Genesis 2:23-24). As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as young men holding thepriesthood of God, you have a tremendousobligation toward the girl you marry. Perhaps youare not thinking much of that now. But the timeisn't far away when you will think of it, and now isthe time to prepare for that most important day ofyour lives when you take unto yourself a wife andcompanion equal with you before the Lord. Be Absolutely Loyal That obligation begins with absolute loyalty. As the old Church of England ceremony says, you willmarry her \"for richer or for poorer, in sickness andin health, for better or for worse.\" She will be yoursand yours alone, regardless of the circumstances ofyour lives. You will be hers and hers alone. Therecan be eyes for none other. There must be absoluteloyalty, undeviating loyalty one to another.Hopefully you will marry her forever, in the houseof the Lord, under the authority of the everlastingpriesthood. Through all the days of your lives, youmust be as true one to another as the polar star. Be a Young Man of Virtue The girl you marry can expect you to come to themarriage altar absolutely clean. She can expect youto be a young man of virtue in thought and wordand deed. I plead with you boys tonight to keep yourselves free from the stains of the world. You must notindulge in sleazy talk at school. You must not tellsultry jokes. You must not fool around with theInternet to find pornographic material. You mustnot dial a long-distance telephone number to listento filth. You must not rent videos with pornographyof any kind. This salacious stuff simply is not foryou. Stay away from pornography as you wouldavoid a serious disease. It is as destructive. It canbecome habitual, and those who indulge in it get so they cannot leave it alone. It is addictive. It is a five-billion-dollar business for those who produce it. They make it as titillating and attractiveas they know how. It seduces and destroys its victims.It is everywhere. It is all about us. I plead with youyoung men not to get involved in its use. You simplycannot afford to. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 209The girl you marry is worthy of a husband whose life has not been tainted by this ugly and corrosivematerial. Live the Word of Wisdom Look upon the Word of Wisdom as more than a commonplace thing. I regard it as the mostremarkable document on health of which I know. It came to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833, whenrelatively little was known of dietary matters. Nowthe greater the scientific research, the more certainbecomes the proof of Word of Wisdom principles.The evidence against tobacco is now overwhelming,yet we see a tremendous increase in its use byyoung men and women. The evidence againstliquor is just as great. To me it is an ironic thing that service stations offer beer sales. An individual can get as drunk on beerand be as dangerous on the road as he can on anyother alcoholic substance. It is simply a matter ofhow much he drinks. How absolutely inconsistentit is for a service station, where you get gas so youcan drive, to also sell beer that can cause you todrive \"under the influence\" and become a terriblemenace on the highway. Stay away from it. It will do you no good. It could do you irreparable harm. Suppose you drink anddrive and cause the death of someone. You willnever get over it as long as you live. It will hauntyou night and day. The one simple thing to do issimply to not touch it. Likewise, stay away from illegal drugs. They can absolutely destroy you. They will take away yourpowers of reason. They will enslave you in a viciousand terrible way. They will destroy your mind andyour body. They will build within you such cravingsthat you will do anything to satisfy them. Would any girl in her right mind ever wish to marry a young man who has a drug habit, who is theslave of alcohol, who is addicted to pornography? Avoid Profanity Avoid profanity. It is all around you in school.Young people seem to pride themselves on usingfilthy and obscene language as well as indulging inprofanity, taking the name of our Lord in vain. Itbecomes a vicious habit which, if indulged in whileyou are young, will find expression throughoutyour life. Who would wish to be married to a manwhose speech is laden with filth and profanity? Learn Now to Control Your Temper There is another serious thing to which many youngmen become addicted. This is anger. With the leastprovocation they explode into tantrums ofuncontrolled rage. It is pitiful to see someone so weak.But even worse, they are prone to lose all sense ofreason and do things which bring later regret. We hear much these days of the phenomenon called road rage. Drivers become provoked over somesmall irritation. They fly into a rage, even resultingin murder. A life of regret follows. As the writer of Proverbs has said, \"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rulethhis spirit than he that taketh a city\" (Proverbs 16:32). If you have a temper, now is the time to learn to control it. The more you do so while you are young,the more easily it will happen. Let no member ofthis Church ever lose control of himself in such anunnecessary and vicious manner. Let him bring tohis marriage words of peace and composure. I constantly deal with those cases of members of the Church who have been married in the temple andwho later divorce and then apply for a cancellationof their temple sealing. When first married, they arefull of great expectations, with a wonderful spirit of happiness. But the flower of love fades in anatmosphere of criticism and carping, of mean wordsand uncontrolled anger. Love flies out the windowas contention enters. I repeat, my brethren, if anyof you young men have trouble controlling yourtemper, I plead with you to begin the work ofmaking that correction now. Otherwise you willbring only tears and sorrow into the homes whichyou will someday establish. Jacob, in the Book ofMormon, condemns his people for their wickednessin marriage. Says he: \"Behold, ye have done greateriniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye havebroken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost theconfidence of your children, because of your badexamples before them; and the sobbings of theirhearts ascend up to God against you. And becauseof the strictness of the word of God, which comethdown against you, many hearts died, pierced withdeep wounds\" (Jacob 2:35). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 210Work for an Education Work for an education. Get all the training that you can. The world will largely pay you what it thinksyou are worth. Paul did not mince words when hewrote to Timothy, \"But if any provide not for hisown, and specially for those of his own house, hehath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel\"(1 Timothy 5:8). It is your primary obligation to provide for your family. Your wife will be fortunate indeed if she does not have to go out and compete in the marketplace. Shewill be twice blessed if she is able toremain at home while you become the breadwinner of the family. Education is the key to economic opportunity. The Lord has laid amandate upon us as a people to acquirelearning \"by study, and also by faith\" (D&C 109:14).It is likely that you will be a better provider if your mind and hands are trained to do somethingworthwhile in the society of which you will becomea part. Be Modest in Your Wants Be modest in your wants. You do not need a bighome with a big mortgage as you begin your livestogether. You can and should avoid overwhelmingdebt. There is nothing that will cause greater tensionsin marriage than grinding debt, which will make ofyou a slave to your creditors. You may have toborrow money to begin ownership of a home. Butdo not let it be so costly that it will preoccupy yourthoughts day and night. When I was married, my wise father said to me, \"Get a modest home and pay off the mortgage sothat if economic storms should come, your wifeand children will have a roof over their heads.\" The girl who marries you will not wish to be married to a tightwad. Neither will she wish to be marriedto a spendthrift. She is entitled to know all aboutfamily finances. She will be your partner. Unlessthere is full and complete understanding betweenyou and your wife on these matters, there likely willcome misunderstandings and suspicions that willcause trouble that can lead to greater problems.Go on a Mission and Be Married in the Temple She will wish to be married to someone who loves her, who trusts her, who walks beside her, who isher very best friend and companion. She will wishto be married to someone who encourages her inher Church activity and in community activitieswhich will help her to develop her talents andmake a greater contribution to society. She willwant to be married to someone who has a sense ofservice to others, who is disposed to contribute tothe Church and to other good causes. She will wish to be married to someone who loves the Lord and seeks to do His will. It iswell, therefore, that each of you youngmen plan to go on a mission, to giveunselfishly to your Father in Heaven a tithe of your life, to go forth with aspirit of total unselfishness to preach the gospel of peace to the world wherever you maybe sent. If you are a good missionary, you willreturn home with the desire to continue to servethe Lord, to keep His commandments, and to doHis will. Such behavior will add immeasurably tothe happiness of your marriage. As I have said, you will wish to be married in one place and one place only. That is the house of theLord. You cannot give to your companion a greatergift than that of marriage in God's holy house,under the protective wing of the sealing covenantof eternal marriage. There is no adequate substitutefor it. There should be no other way for you. Prepare to Become a Righteous Father Choose carefully and wisely. The girl you marry willbe yours forever. You will love her and she will loveyou through thick and thin, through sunshine andstorm. She will become the mother of your children.What greater thing in all this world can there bethan to become the father of a precious child, a sonor daughter of God, our Father in Heaven, for whomwe are given the rights and responsibilities ofmortal stewardship. How precious a thing is a baby. How wonderful a thing is a child. What a marvelous thing is a family.Live worthy of becoming a father of whom yourwife and children will be proud. The Lord has ordained that we should marry, that we shall live together in love and peace and harmony, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 211 Education is the key to economic opportunity.that we shall have children and rear them in His holy ways. And so, my dear young men, you may not think seriously about it now. But the time will come whenyou will fall in love. It will occupy all of your thoughtsand be the stuff of which your dreams are made.Make yourself worthy of the loveliest girl in all theworld. Keep yourself worthy through all the days ofyour life. Be good and true and kind one to another.There is so much of bitterness in the world. There is so much of pain and sorrow that come of angrywords. There is so much of tears that follow disloyalty.But there can be so much of happiness if there is aneffort to please and an overwhelming desire tomake comfortable and happy one's companion. When all is said and done, this is what the gospel is about. The family is a creation of God. It is the basiccreation. The way to strengthen the nation is tostrengthen the homes of the people. I am satisfied that if we would look for the virtues in one another and not the vices, there would be muchmore of happiness in the homes of our people. Therewould be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity,much less of anger and rancor and quarreling. Therewould be more of forgiveness, more of love, moreof peace, more of happiness. This is as the Lordwould have it. Now Is the Time to Prepare for the Future Young men, now is the time to prepare for the future.And in that future for most of you is a beautifulyoung woman whose greatest desire is to bond withyou in a relationship that is eternal and everlasting. You will know no greater happiness than that found in your home. You will have no more seriousobligation than that which you face in your home.The truest mark of your success in life will be thequality of your marriage. God bless you, my dear young men. I could wish for you nothing more wonderful than the love, theabsolute total love of a companion of whom youare proud and worthy in every respect.This choice will be the most importantof all the choices you make in yourlife. I pray that heaven may smileupon you in the choice you make, thatyou may be guided, that you may livewithout regret, in the name of JesusChrist, amen.OUR SACRED DUTY TO HONOR WOMEN Elder Russell M. Nelson Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1999, 50-53; or Ensign, May 1999, 38-40 It is a joy to be with you tonight, brethren, andwonderful to see so many young men with theirfathers. We are assembled because of our desire tohearken to the leaders of the Church. But thiscongregation is unique. I don't see any mothers.Not one of us could be here without a mother, yetwe are all here\u2014without our mothers. Tonight I am attending with a son, sons-in-law, and grandsons. Where are their mothers? Gathered inthe kitchen of our home! What are they doing?Making large batches of homemade doughnuts!And when we return home, we will feast on thosedoughnuts. While we enjoy them, these mothers,sisters, and daughters will listen intently as each ofus speaks of things he learned here tonight. It's anice family tradition, symbolic of the fact thateverything we learn and do as priesthood bearersshould bless our families. 1 Let us speak about our worthy and wonderful sisters,particularly our mothers, and consider our sacredduty to honor them. A Young Man's Sin Dishonors His Mother When I was a young university student, one of myclassmates urgently pleaded with a group of us\u2014hisLatter-day Saint friends\u2014to donate blood for hismother, who was bleeding profusely. We went directlyto the hospital to have our blood typed and tested.I'll never forget our shock when told that one of theprospective donors was unfit because of a positiveblood test for a venereal disease. That infected blood was his own! Fortunately, his mothersurvived, but I'll never forget hislingering sorrow. He bore the burdenof knowing that his personalimmorality had disqualified him fromgiving needed aid to his mother, andhe had added to her grief. I learned agreat lesson: if one dishonors the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 212 This choice will be the most important of all the choices you make in your life.commandments of God, one dishonors mother, and if onedishonors mother, one dishonors the commandments of God. 2 Honor Motherhood During my professional career as adoctor of medicine, I was occasionally asked why I chose to do that difficultwork. I responded with my opinionthat the highest and noblest work inthis life is that of a mother. Since that option wasnot available to me, I thought that caring for the sick might come close. I tried to care for my patients as compassionately and competently as Mother caredfor me. Many years ago the First Presidency issued a statement that has had a profound and lastinginfluence upon me. \"Motherhood,\" they wrote, \"isnear to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service tobe assumed by mankind. It places her who honorsits holy calling and service next to the angels.\" 3 Because mothers are essential to God's great plan of happiness, their sacred work is opposed by Satan,who would destroy the family and demean theworth of women. You young men need to know that you can hardly achieve your highest potential without the influenceof good women, particularly your mother and, in a few years, a good wife. Learn now to show respectand gratitude. Remember that your mother is yourmother. She should not need to issue orders. Her wish,her hope, her hint should provide direction thatyou would honor. Thank her and express your lovefor her. And if she is struggling to rear you withoutyour father, you have a double duty to honor her. A Mother's Letter Saves Her Child The influence of your mother will bless you throughoutlife, especially when you serve as a missionary. Longyears ago, Elder Frank Croft was serving in the state ofAlabama. While preaching to the people, he wasforcefully abducted by a vicious gang, to be whippedand lashed across his bare back. Elder Croft was orderedto remove his coat and shirt before he was tied to a tree.As he did so, a letter he had recently received from hismother fell to the ground. The vile leader of the gangpicked up the letter. Elder Croft closed his eyes anduttered a silent prayer. The attacker read the letter fromElder Croft's mother. From a copy of that letter, I quote:\"My beloved son, . . . remember thewords of the Savior when He said, . . .'Blessed are ye when men shall revileyou and persecute you and say allmanner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake. Rejoice and beexceedingly glad for you will haveyour reward in Heaven for sopersecuted they the prophets whichwere before you.' Also remember theSavior upon the cross suffering from the sins of the world when He had uttered theseimmortal words, 'Father forgive them, for theyknow not what they do.' Surely, my boy, they whoare mistreating you . . . know not what they do orthey would not do it. Sometime, somewhere, theywill understand and then they will regret theiraction and they will honor you for the gloriouswork you are doing. So be patient, my son, lovethose who mistreat you and say all manner of evilagainst you and the Lord will bless you andmagnify you. . . . Remember also, my son, that dayand night, your mother is praying for you.\" Elder Croft watched the hateful man as he studied the letter. He would read a line or two, then sit andponder. He arose to approach his captive. The mansaid: \"Feller, you must have a wonderful mother.You see, I once had one, too.\" Then addressing themob, he said: \"Men, after reading this Mormon'smother's letter, I just can't go ahead with the job.Maybe we had better let him go.\" Elder Croft wasreleased without harm. 4 We are deeply grateful for the faithful mothers andfathers of our wonderful missionaries. The love theybear for their children is sublime. Honor Your Sisters We who bear the holy priesthood have a sacred dutyto honor our sisters. We are old enough and wiseenough to know that teasing is wrong. We respectsisters\u2014not only in our immediate families but all thewonderful sisters in our lives. As daughters of God,their potential is divine. Without them, eternal lifewould be impossible. Our high regard for them shouldspring from our love of God and from an awarenessof their lofty purpose in His great eternal plan. Hence, I warn against pornography. It is degrading of women. It is evil. It is infectious, destructive, andaddictive. The body has means by which it cancleanse itself from harmful effects of contaminated ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 213 If one dishonors the commandments of God, one dishonors mother, and if one dishonors mother, one dishonors the commandments of God.food or drink. But it cannot vomit back the poison of pornography. Oncerecorded, it always remains subject torecall, flashing its perverted imagesacross your mind, with power to drawyou away from the wholesome thingsin life. Avoid it like the plague! Honor Your Wife To you who are not yet married, think about yourfuture marriage. Choose your companion well.Remember the scriptures that teach the importanceof marriage in the temple: \"In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; \"And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning thenew and everlasting covenant of marriage]; \"And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\" 5 The highest ordinances in the house of the Lord are received by husband and wife together andequally\u2014or not at all! In retrospect, I see that the most important day of my life was the day when my sweetheart, Dantzel,and I were married in the holy temple. Without herI could not have the highest and most enduringblessings of the priesthood. Without her I would notbe the father to our wonderful children or grandfatherto our precious grandchildren. As fathers we should have love unbounded for the mothers of our children. We should accord to themthe gratitude, respect, and praise that they deserve.Husbands, to keep alive the spirit of romance in yourmarriage, be considerate and kind in the tenderintimacies of your married life. Let your thoughtsand actions inspire confidence and trust. Let yourwords be wholesome and your time together beuplifting. Let nothing in life take priority over yourwife\u2014neither work, recreation, nor hobby. An ideal marriage is a true partnership between two imperfect people, each striving to complement theother, to keep the commandments, and to do thewill of the Lord. The Family Is Ordained of God The family is the most important unit of society and of the Church. The family is ordained of God.It is central to His plan for the eternal destiny ofHis children. 6\"God has established families to bring happiness to his children, to allow them to learncorrect principles in a lovingatmosphere, and to prepare them foreternal life.\" 7 Fathers Preside over the Family in Love Parents have the primary responsibility for the welfare of their children.8The Church does not replace that parental responsi-bility. Ideally, the Latter-day Saint family is presidedover by a worthy man who holds the priesthood.This patriarchal authority has been honored amongthe people of God in all dispensations. It is ofdivine origin, and that union, if sealed by properauthority, will continue throughout eternity. Hewho is the Father of us all and the source of thisauthority demands that governance in the home bein love and righteousness. 9 You fathers can help with the dishes, care for a cryingbaby, and change a diaper. And perhaps someSunday you could get the children ready for Church,and your wife could sit in the car and honk. \"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it.\" 10With that kind of love, brethren, we will be better husbands andfathers, more loving and spiritual leaders. Happinessat home is most likely to be achieved when practicesthere are founded upon the teachings of JesusChrist. 11Ours is the responsibility to ensure that we have family prayer, scripture study, and familyhome evening. Ours is the responsibility to prepareour children to receive the ordinances of salvationand exaltation and the blessings promised to tithepayers. Ours is the privilege to bestow priesthoodblessings of healing, comfort, and direction. The home is the great laboratory of love. There the raw chemicals of selfishness and greed are meldedin the crucible of cooperation to yield compassionateconcern and love one for another. 12 Express Love to Your Wife, Mother, Sisters Honor the special sisters in your lives, brethren.Express your love to your wife, to your mother, and tothe sisters. Praise them for their forbearance with youeven when you are not at your best. Thank the Lordfor these sisters who\u2014like our Heavenly Father\u2014loveus not only for what we are but for what we maybecome. Humbly I thank God for my mother, mysisters, my daughters, granddaughters, and for myspecial sweetheart, companion, and friend\u2014my wife! ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 214 We who bear the holy priesthood have a sacred duty to honor our sisters.May God bless us to honor each virtuous woman I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

HollandOf the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1999, 15-19; or Ensign, May 1999, 14-16 Gratitude to God the Father On this Easter weekend I wish to thank not only theresurrected Lord Jesus Christ but also His true Father,our spiritual Father and God, who, by accepting the sacrifice of His firstborn, perfect Son, blessed all of His children in those hours of atonement andredemption. Never more than at Easter time is thereso much meaning in that declaration from the bookof John which praises the Father as well as the Son:\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his onlybegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in himshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\" 1 I am a father, inadequate to be sure, but I cannotcomprehend the burden it must have been for Godin His heaven to witness the deep suffering andCrucifixion of His Beloved Son in such a manner.His every impulse and instinct must have been tostop it, to send angels to intervene\u2014but He did notintervene. He endured what He saw because it wasthe only way that a saving, vicarious payment couldbe made for the sins of all His other children, fromAdam and Eve to the end of the world. I am eternallygrateful for a perfect Father and His perfect Son,neither of whom shrank from the bitter cup norforsook the rest of us who are imperfect, who fallshort and stumble, who too often miss the mark. Jesus' Relationship with His Father In considering such beauty of the \"at-one-ment\" inthat first Easter season, we are reminded that thisrelationship between Christ and His Father is one of the sweetest and most moving themes runningthrough the Savior's ministry. Jesus' entire being,His complete purpose and delight, were centered inpleasing His Father and obeying His will. Of HimHe seemed always to be thinking; to Him He seemedalways to be praying. Unlike us, He needed no crisis,no discouraging shift in events to direct His hopesheavenward. He was already instinctively, longinglylooking that way. In all His mortal ministry Christ seems never to have had a single moment of vanity or self-interest.When one young man tried to call Him \"good,\" Hedeflected the compliment, saying only one wasdeserving of such praise\u2014His Father. In the early days of His ministry He said humbly, \"I can of mine own self do nothing: . . . I seek notmine own will, but the will of the Father whichhath sent me.\" 2 Following His teachings, which stunned the audiencewith their power and authority, He would say: \"Mydoctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. . . . I amnot come of myself, but he that sent me is true.\" 3 Later he would say again, \"I have not spoken of ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 215myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what Ishould speak.\" 4 To those who wanted to see the Father, to hear fromGod directly that Jesus was what He said He was,He answered, \"If ye had known me, ye should haveknown my Father also. . . . He that hath seen mehath seen the Father.\" 5When Jesus wanted to preserve unity among His disciples, He prayed usingthe example of His own relationship with God:\"Holy Father, keep through thine own name thosewhom thou hast given me, that they may be one,as we are [one].\" 6 Even as He moved toward the Crucifixion, Herestrained His Apostles who would have intervenedby saying, \"The cup which my Father hath given me,shall I not drink it?\" 7When that unspeakable ordeal was finished, He uttered what must have been themost peaceful and deserved words of His mortalministry. At the end of His agony, He whispered, \"Itis finished. . . . Father, into thy hands I commend myspirit.\" 8Finally it was over. Finally He could go home. I confess that I have reflected at length upon thatmoment and the Resurrection, which was shortly tofollow it. I have wondered what that reunion musthave been like: the Father that loved this Son somuch, the Son that honored and revered His Fatherin every word and deed. For two who were one asthese two were one, what must that embrace havebeen like? What must that divine companionshipbe yet? We can only wonder and admire. And wecan, on an Easter weekend, yearn to live worthily of some portion of that relationship ourselves. Strengthen Relationships with Children As a father, I wonder if I and all other fathers coulddo more to build a sweeter, stronger relationship withour sons and daughters here on earth. Dads, is it toobold to hope that our children might have somesmall portion of the feeling for us that the DivineSon felt for His Father? Might we earn more of thatlove by trying to be more of what God was to Hischild? In any case, we do know that a young person'sdeveloping concept of God centers on characteristicsobserved in that child's earthly parents. 9 Absence of Fathers Damages Children For that reason and many others, I suppose no bookI have read in recent months has alarmed me morethan a work entitled Fatherless America. In this study the author speaks of \"fatherlessness\" as \"themost harmful demographic trend of this generation,\"the leading cause of damage to children. It is, he isconvinced, the engine driving our most urgent socialproblems, from poverty to crime to adolescentpregnancy to child abuse to domestic violence.Among the principal social issues of our time is the flight of fathers from their children's lives. 10 Of even greater concern than the physical absenteeismof some fathers is the spiritually or emotionallyabsent father. These are fatherly sins of omission thatare probably more destructive than sins of commis-sion. Why are we not surprised that when 2,000children of all ages and backgrounds were asked whatthey appreciated most about their fathers, theyanswered universally, \"He spends time with me\"? 11 A young Laurel I met on a conference assignmentnot long ago wrote to me after our visit and said, \"Iwish my dad knew how much I need him spirituallyand emotionally. I crave any kind comment, anywarm personal gesture. I don't think he knows howmuch it would mean to me to have him take anactive interest in what is going on in my life, tooffer to give me a blessing, or just spend some timetogether. I know he worries that he won't do theright thing or won't say the words well. But just tohave him try would mean more than he could everknow. I don't want to sound ungrateful because Iknow he loves me. He sent me a note once andsigned it 'Love, Dad.' I treasure that note. I hold itamong my dearest possessions.\" 12 Most Fathers Are Wonderful Well, as with that young woman, I don't want thistalk to sound ungrateful, nor is it meant to makefathers feel they have fallen short. Most fathers arewonderful. Most dads are terrific. I don't know whowrote these little storybook verses rememberedfrom my youth, but they go something like this: Only a dad with a tired face, Coming home from the daily race, . . .Toiling and striving from day to day,Facing whatever may come his way ,... Glad in his heart that his own rejoiceTo see him come home and to hear his voice. . . .Only a dad, but he gives his all,[Smoothing] the way for his children small,Doing with courage [so] stern and grimThe deeds that his father did for him. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMEN'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 216These are the lines that for him I pen: Only a dad, but the best of men.13 Follow God's Example of Fatherhood And, brethren, even when we are not \"the best ofmen,\" even in our limitations and inadequacy, wecan keep making our way in the right directionbecause of the encouraging teachingsset forth by a Divine Father anddemonstrated by a Divine Son. With aHeavenly Father's help we can leavemore of a parental legacy than wesuppose. One new father wrote: \"Often as I watch my son watch me, I am takenback to moments with my own dad, remembering how vividly I wanted to be just likehim. I remember having a plastic razor and my owncan of foaming cream, and each morning I wouldshave when he shaved. I remember following hisfootsteps back and forth across the grass as hemowed the lawn in summer. \"Now I want my son to follow my lead, and yet it terrifies me to know he probably will. Holding thislittle boy in my arms, I feel a 'heavenly homesickness,'a longing to love the way God loves, to comfort theway He comforts, to protect the way He protects.The answer to all the fears of my youth was always'What would Dad do?' Now that I have a child toraise I am counting on a Heavenly Father to tell meexactly that.\" 14 Influence of a Father's Love A friend from college days wrote to me recently,saying: \"Much in my chaotic childhood wasuncertain, but one thing I knew for sure: that mydad loved me. That certainty was the anchor of myyoung life. I came to know and love the Lord becausemy father loved him. I have never called anyone a fool or taken the Lord's name in vain because hetold me the Bible said I shouldn't. I have always paidmy tithing because he taught me it was a privilegeto do so. I have always tried to take responsibility formy mistakes because my father did. Even though hewas estranged from the Church for a [time], at theend of his life he served a mission and workedfaithfully in the temple. In his will he said that anymoney left over from taking care of his [family]should go to the Church. He loved the Church withall of his heart. And because of him, so do I.\" 15Surely that must be the spiritual application of LordByron's couplet: \"Yet in my lineaments they trace /Some features my father's face.\" 16 Scriptural Examples of a Father's Impact At a vulnerable moment in young Nephi's life, his prophetic future was determined when he said, \"I did believe all the words which hadbeen spoken by my father.\" 17At the turning point of the prophet Enos'slife, he said it was \"the words which I had often heard my father speak\" 18 which prompted one of the greatrevelations recorded in the Book ofMormon. And sorrowing Alma theYounger, when confronted by the excruciating memory of his sins, \"remembered alsoto have heard [his] of . Jesus Christ, a Son of God, toatone for the sins of the world.\" 19That brief memory, that personal testimony offered by his father at atime when the father may have felt nothing wassinking in, not only saved the spiritual life of this,his son, but changed forever the history of the Bookof Mormon people. Of Abraham, the grand patriarch, God said, \" I know him. . . . He will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.\" 20 I bear my witness this Easter weekend that \"greatthings [will] be required at the hand[s] of [the]fathers,\" as the Lord declared to the Prophet JosephSmith. 21Surely the greatest of those things will be to have done all they could for the happiness andspiritual safety of the children they are to nurture. In that most burdensome moment of all human history, with blood appearing at every pore and ananguished cry upon His lips, Christ sought Himwhom He had always sought\u2014His Father. \"Abba,\"He cried, \"Papa,\" or from the lips of a youngerchild, \"Daddy.\" 22 This is such a personal moment it almost seems asacrilege to cite it. A Son in unrelieved pain, a FatherHis only true source of strength, both of them stayingthe course, making it through the night\u2014together. Fathers, this Easter weekend may we be renewed in our task as parents, bolstered by images of this Fatherand this Son as we embrace our children and standwith them forever, I pray in the name of JesusChrist, amen.

Kimball \"Immorality does not begin in adultery or perversion. It begins with little indiscretions like sex thoughts,sex discussions, passionate kissing, petting and such,growing with every exercise. The small indiscretionseems powerless compared to the sturdy body, thestrong mind, the sweet spirit of youth who giveway to the first temptation. But soon the strong hasbecome weak, the master the slave, spiritual growthcurtailed. But if the first unrighteous act is never givenroot, the tree will grow to beautiful maturity and theyouthful life will grow toward God, our Father .... \"The early apostles and prophets mention numeroussins that were reprehensible to them. Many of themwere sexual sins\u2014adultery, being without naturalaffection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, inordinate sexual relations outsidemarriage\u2014petting, sex perversion, masturbation, andpreoccupation with sex in one's thoughts and talking.Included are every hidden and secret sin and allunholy and impure thoughts and practices. . . . \"Conscience tells the individual when he is entering forbidden worlds, and it continues to prick untilsilenced by the will or by sin's repetition. \"Can anyone truthfully say he did not know such things were wrong? These unholy practices, whatevermay be their unmentionable names with all theirapproaches and numerous manifestations, arecondemned by the Lord and his church. Some maybe more heinous than others, but all are sin, in spiteof statements to the contrary of those who falselypretend to know. The Lord's prophets declare theyare not right.\"The world may have its norm; the Church has adifferent one. . . . The world may countenancepremarital sex experiences, but the Lord and hischurch condemn in no uncertain terms any andevery sex relationship outside of marriage. . . . \"Since courtship is prelude to marriage and encourages close associations, many have convincedthemselves that intimacies are legitimate\u2014a part ofthe courting process. Many have cast off bridle andharness and have relaxed the restraints. Instead ofremaining in the field of simple expressions ofaffection, some have turned themselves loose tofondling, often called 'necking,' with its intimatecontacts and its passionate kissing. Necking is theyounger member of this unholy family. Its biggersister is called 'petting.' When the intimacies havereached this stage, they are surely the sinscondemned by the Savior .... \"Who would say that he or she who pets has notbecome lustful, has not become passionate? Is it notthis most abominable practice that God rebuked inhis modern reiteration of the Ten Commandments:'Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, norkill, nor do anything like unto it' (D&C 59:6). \"What, may I ask you, is like unto adultery if it is not petting? Did not the Lord recognize that thisheinous sin is but the devil's softening process for thefinal acts of adultery or fornication? Can a personin the light of the Lord's scriptures pursue the pathof petting with clear conscience? Can anyoneconvince himself that this is not deep sin? \"We must repeat what we have said many times: Fornication with all its big and little brothers andsisters was evil and wholly condemned by the Lordin Adam's day, in Moses' day, in Paul's day, and inour own day. The Church has no tolerance for anykind of perversions. The Lord has indicated his lackof tolerance, stating: \"'For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance' (D&C 1:31). \"When the scriptures are so plain, how can anyone justify immoralities and call them love? Is blackwhite? Is evil good? Is purity filthiness? \"That the Church's stand on morality may be understood, we declare firmly and unalterably, it isnot an outworn garment, faded, old-fashioned, andthreadbare. God is the same yesterday, today, andforever, and his covenants and doctrines areimmutable; and when the sun grows cold and the Modesty reflects an attitude of humility, decency, and propriety. \u2014President N. Eldon Tanner ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL219stars no longer shine, the law of chastity will still be basic in God's world and in the Lord's church. Oldvalues are upheld by the Church not because theyare old, but rather because through the ages theyhave proved right. It will always be the rule\"(\"President Kimball Speaks Out on Morality,\"Ensign, Nov. 1980, 95-96). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Watchmen\u2014what of the night? We must respond by saying that all is not well in Zion. As Moronicounseled, we must cleanse the inner vessel (seeAlma 60:23), beginning first with ourselves, thenwith our families, and finally with theChurch. . . . \"The plaguing sin of this generation is sexual immorality. This, the ProphetJoseph said, would be the source ofmore temptations, more buffetings,and more difficulties for the elders of Israel thanany other. (See Journal of Discourses, 8:55.) \"President Joseph F. Smith said that sexual impuritywould be one of the three dangers that wouldthreaten the Church within\u2014and so it does.

It is in thepopular literature. It is on the Internet. You can'tafford to watch it, my dear friends. You cannot affordto let that filthy poison touch you. Stay away fromit. Avoid it. You can't rent videos and watch themas they portray degrading things. You young menwho hold the priesthood of God cannot mix thisfilth with the holy priesthood. . . . \"And while I speak of such matters I want to give emphasis again to the matter of pornography. It hasbecome a $10 billion industry in the United States,where a few men grow rich at the expense ofthousands upon thousands who are their victims.Stay away from it. It is exciting, but it will destroyyou. It will warp your senses. It will build withinyou an appetite that you will do anything to appease.And don't try to create associations through theInternet and chat rooms.

You may think that you can hide it.Long experience has shown that you cannot. Toserve an effective mission you must have the Spiritof the Lord, and truth withheld does not mix withthat Spirit. Sooner or later you will feel compelledto confess your earlier transgressions. Well did SirGalahad say, 'My strength is as the strength of ten,because my heart is pure' (Alfred, Lord Tennyson,Sir Galahad [1842], st. 1). \"My dear young friends, in matters of sex you knowwhat is right. You know when you are walking on dangerous ground, when it is so easyto stumble and slide into the pit oftransgression.

Consequences of Obedience or Disobedience Jacob 2:28-29, 33 The Nephites were warned that if they did not live the law of chastity, they would not prosper in theland. Violation of the law of chastity brings \"a sorecurse, even unto destruction.\" Helaman 13:38 Those who seek happiness in the lusts of the flesh will not find it because doing iniquity is contrary tothe nature of happiness. Compare with Alma 41:10,\"Wickedness never was happiness.\" 3 Nephi 6:16-18 The Nephites became so morally corrupted that they were \"carried about by the temptations of thedevil whithersoever he desired to carry them, andto do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should.\" Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 Virtue, when combined with charity and faith, gives you confidence in your relationship with God andallows the doctrines of the priesthood to \"distil uponthy soul as the dews from heaven.\" Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"Among the most common sexual sins our young people commit are those of necking and petting.Not only do these improper relations often lead tofornication and abortions\u2014both ugly sins\u2014but inand of themselves they are pernicious evils, and it isoften difficult for youth to distinguish where oneends and another begins. They awaken lust and stirevil thoughts and sex desires. They are but parts ofthe whole family of related sins and indiscretions. . . .\"Because of the seriousness of this sin [homosexuality]it carries a heavy penalty for the unrepentant. Theoffender may realize that disfellowshipment orexcommunication is the penalty for heavy petting,adultery, fornication and comparable sins if there isnot adequate repentance, yet he often supposes thatbecause his acts have not been committed with theopposite sex he is not in sin. Let it therefore beclearly stated that the seriousness of the sin ofhomosexuality is equal to or greater than that offornication or adultery; and that the Lord's Church will as readily take action to disfellowship orexcommunicate the unrepentant practicing homosexualas it will the unrepentant fornicator or adulterer \" (Miracle of Forgiveness, 65, 81-82). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Those who mock the traditional moral values should heed this lesson of history from the Durants: \"'A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires;and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws,he may ruin his life before he matures sufficientlyto understand that sex is a river of fire that must bebanked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it isnot to consume both the individual and the group'(Will and Ariel Durant, The Lessons of History [New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968], pp. 35-36). \"Lasciviousness wrongly celebrates the capacity to feel, so that people lose their capacity to feel! Threedifferent prophets in three different the feelings, it also impairsthe intellect\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1993, 95;or Ensign, May 1993, 77). Modesty 1 Timothy 4:12 \"Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\" President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I am not disposed to discuss in this forum the merits or otherwise of sex education in the public schools.But in passing, I am inclined to agree with one whowas recently quoted in the newspaper USA Today: 'More sex education in public schools will not reverse ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 221the damaging legacy of the sexual revolution unless the clear message is premarital chastity and 12A)\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1987, 58; or Ensign, May 1987, 47). President N. Eldon Tanner \"Modesty in dress is a quality of mind and heart, born of respect for oneself, one's fellowmen, andthe Creator of us all. Modesty reflects an attitude of humility, decency, and propriety. Consistent withthese principles and guided by the Holy Spirit, letparents, teachers, and youth discuss the particularsof dress, grooming, and personal appearance, andwith free agency accept responsibility and choosethe right\" (\"Friend to Friend,\" Friend, June 1971, 3). Elder L. Tom Perry \"President [Spencer W.] Kimball delivered a great talk many years ago at Brigham Young University entitled'A Style of Our Own.' He encouraged us not to beamong those who would follow worldly, immodeststyles, but to have the courage to dress in a waywhich will send a message that our standards aredifferent. Our dress will reflect the way we intend tolive, founded on principles of the gospel of our Lordand Savior. It is impossible to expect a child who hasbeen taught to love to dress in the immodest styletrends of the day, to then change overnight to anentirely different wardrobe when they enter a Churchuniversity or a missionary training center, or whenthey are married in the temple, or even when theydress for the Sabbath day. Modest, proper stylesmust be taught almost from birth\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1988, 88; or Ensign, Nov. 1988, 75). Elder James E. Faust \"In forsaking the great principle of modesty, society has paid a price in the violation of a greater butrelated principle\u2014that of chastity. The purveyors of the concept of irresponsible sexual relations thatdegrade and brutalize the participants have grosslymasqueraded and completely missed the purpose of these divine gifts\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1981, 8; or Ensign, May 1981, 9).Modesty in Thought Mosiah 4:29-30 \"I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means,even so many that I cannot number them. \"But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, andyour deeds, and observe the commandments of God,and continue in the faith of what ye have heardconcerning the coming of our Lord, even unto theend of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man,remember, and perish not.\" Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 \"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtuegarnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thyconfidence wax strong in the presence of God; andthe doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thysoul dews from heaven.\" Modesty in Language Proverbs 15:26 \"The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord: but the words of the pure are pleasantwords.\" Matthew 12:36 \"I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in theday of judgment.\" Modesty in Dress President Spencer W. Kimball \"Style is blamed for those extremes, but we wonder again if there might not be some satisfactions, sexualand otherwise, in what seems a wanton disregard of modest decency. Are the very scant bathing suitsworn for style or to shock or stir or tempt? Canthere be in all these expressions total . . . \"We cannot overemphasize immodesty as one of the pitfalls to be avoided if we would shun temptationand keep ourselves clean\" ( Miracle of Forgiveness, 227). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 222President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Now comes the craze of tattooing one's body. I cannot understand why any young man\u2014or youngwoman, for that matter\u2014would wish to undergo thepainful process of disfiguring the skin with variousmulticolored representations of people, animals,and various symbols. With tattoos, the process ispermanent, unless there is another painful andcostly undertaking to remove it. Fathers, cautionyour sons against having their bodies tattooed.They may resist your talk now, but the time willcome when they will thank you. A tattoo is graffition the temple of the body. \"Likewise the piercing of the body for multiple rings in the ears, in the nose, even in the tongue. Canthey possibly think that is beautiful? It is a passingfancy, but its effects can be permanent. Some havegone to such extremes that the ring had to beremoved by surgery. The First Presidency and theQuorum of the Twelve have declared that wediscourage tattoos and also 'the piercing of thebody for other than medical purposes.' We do not,however, take any position 'on the minimalpiercing of the ears by women for one pair ofearrings'\u2014one pair\" (in Conference Report, Oct.2000, 70-71; or Ensign, Nov. 2000, 52). Elder James E. Faust \"I was struck by the lack of self-esteem revealed in the manner by which so many people now clothethemselves in public. To attract attention or in thename of comfort and informality, many have sunknot only to immodesty but to slovenliness. Againsttheir own self-interest, they present themselves toothers in the worst possible way\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1981, 8; or Ensign, May 1981, 9). Modest Behavior 2 Nephi 15:20 \"Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness,that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\" Articles of Faith 1:13 \"We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, wemay say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u2014Webelieve all things, we hope all things, we have enduredmany things, and hope to be able to endure all things.If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good reportor praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\" President Ezra Taft Benson \"Modesty in dress and language and deportment is a true mark of refinement and a hallmark of avirtuous Latter-day Saint woman. Shun the low and the vulgar and the suggestive\" (\"To the YoungWomen of the Church,\" Ensign, Nov. 1986, 83). PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD President Harold B. Lee President of the ChurchStand Ye in Holy Places: Selected Sermons and Writings of PresidentHarold B. Lee, 330-39 The Apostle Paul demonstrates his great ability asan inspired teacher as he pictures each of us as awarrior being clothed with the essential armor toprotect the four parts of the human body whichapparently Satan and his hosts, by their vigilant spysystem, have found to be the most vulnerable partsthrough which the enemies of righteousness mightmake their \"landing,\" as it were, and invade thehuman soul. Here are his inspired teachings: \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; \"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. \"And take the helmet of salvation. . . .\" (Ephesians 6:14-15, 17.) Did you note carefully the four main parts of your bodies to be guarded: 1. A girdle about your loins.2. A breastplate over your heart.3. Your feet shod.4. A helmet on your head.These instructions take on full significance when it is remembered the loins are those portions of thebody between the lower ribs and the hips in whichare located the vital generative organs, and also thatin the scriptures and other inspired writings the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 223loins symbolize virtue or moral purity and vital strength. The heart suggests our daily conduct inlife, for as the Master taught: \". . . out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man . . . forth evilthings.\" (Matthew 12:34-35.) The feet typify the course you chart in the journey of life. The head, of course, represents your intellect. But now pay careful heed to the fabric from which the various parts of your armor are to be fashioned. Truth is to be the substance of which the girdle about your loins is to be formed if your virtue andvital strength are to be safeguarded. How can truthprotect you from one of the deadliest of all evils,unchastity? First, for a definition of truth: Truth isknowledge, so the Lord tells us, \"knowledge of thingsas they are, and as they were, and as they are tocome.\" (D&C 93:24.) Now consider for a fewmoments the essential knowledge which will put toflight immorality, the ever-present enemy of youth: Man and woman are the offspring of God and created after His own image and likeness as mortal beings.One of the first commandments given to our firstmortal parents, \"to multiply and to replenish theearth,\" has been repeated as a sacred instruction toevery faithful and true Latter-day Saint young manand young woman married in holy wedlock. To the end that this sacred purpose of parenthood berealized, our Creator has placed within the breast of every true man and woman a strong mutualattraction for each other, which acquaintance ripensin friendship, thence through the romance ofcourtship, and finally matures into happy marriage.But now mark you, never once has God issued such a command to unmarried persons! Indeed, to the contrary; he has written high on the decalogue of crime andsecond only to murder the divine injunction, \"Thoushalt not commit adultery\" (which is unquestionablyinterpreted to mean all unlawful sexual association,inasmuch as the Master used interchangeably thewords adultery and fornication in defining sexual impurity, and it has been severely condemned inevery dispensation by authorized church leaders). Those who make themselves worthy and enter into the new and everlasting covenant of marriage inthe temple for time and all eternity will be layingthe first cornerstone for an eternal family home inthe celestial kingdom that will last forever. Theirreward is to have \"glory added upon their headsforever and forever.\" These eternal truths, if youbelieve them with all your soul, will be as a girdleof armor about your loins to safeguard your virtueas you would protect your life. But now again may I put you on guard as to Satan's methods used in an attempt to destroy you. TheLord, after giving us the definition of truth quotedabove, said this: \"And whatsoever is more or lessthan this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning.\" (D&C 93:25.) When you are prompted to immodesty in dress or to unclean or obscene speech or brazen conduct inyour courtship, you are playing Satan's game andare becoming the victim of his lying tongue. Justso, if you allow the vain theories of men to causeyou to doubt your relationship to God, the divinepurpose of marriage, and your future prospects foreternity, you are being victimized by the master oflies, because all such is contrary to truth, whichsaves you from these perils. Now, what about the breastplate which will safeguard your heart or your conduct in life? TheApostle Paul says that breastplate shall be made of a stuff called righteousness. The righteous man,although far superior to his fellows who are not, is humble and does not parade his righteousness tobe seen of men but conceals his virtues as he wouldmodestly conceal his nudity. The righteous manstrives for self-improvement knowing that he hasdaily need of repentance for his misdeeds or hisneglect. He is not so much concerned about whathe can get but more about how much he can giveto others, knowing that along that course only canhe find true happiness. He endeavors to make eachday his masterpiece so that at night's close he canwitness in his soul and to his God that whateverhas come to his hand that day, he has done to thebest of his ability. His body is not dissipated andweakened by the burdens imposed by the demandsof riotous living; his judgment is not renderedfaulty by the follies of youth; he is clear of vision,keen of intellect, and strong of body. The breastplateof righteousness has given him \"the strength often\u2014because his heart is clean.\" But to continue with your coat of armor. Your feet, which are to represent your goals or objectives inlife, are to be shod. Shod with what? \"With thepreparation of the gospel of peace.\" The apostle whowrote that phrase certainly knew life from actual ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 224experience\u2014\"preparation of the gospel of peace\"! He knew that preparedness is the way to victoryand that \"eternal vigilance is the price of safety.\"Fear is the penalty of unpreparedness and aimlessdawdling with opportunity. Whether in speech orin song, whether in physical or moral combat, thetide of victory rests with him who is prepared. The old philosophers understood the importance of having this preparation begin in the formative periodof life, for we are admonished to \"train up a childin the way he should go: and when he is old, hewill not depart from it.\" (Proverbs 22:6.) To pointout this same truth one old adage declared: \"If youfollow the river you will reach the and anothersuggests a warning: \"Following the course of leastresistance makes men and rivers crooked.\" Embodied in the gospel of Jesus Christ are the straightforward negative injunctions divinely givento the later positivedeclarations in the Sermon on the Mount, whichoutline a veritable blueprint for your course throughlife. The gospel plan enjoins us to the observance ofprayer, to walk uprightly, to honor our parentage,to keep the Sabbath Day holy, and to refrain fromidleness. Happy is that one whose feet are shod withthe preparation of these teachings from his youthto withstand the evil day. He has foundthe way to peace by \"overcoming theworld.\" He has built his house upona rock, and when the storms come,the winds blow, and the rains do beatupon the house, it will not fall becauseit is founded upon a rock. (SeeMatthew 7:24-25.) Such a one is notafraid; he will not be overcome by asurprise attack, for he is ready for anyemergency: he is prepared! And now finally to the last piece of the prophet- teacher's armored dress. We will put a helmet uponthe head. Our head or our intellect is the controllingmember of our body. It must be well protected againstthe enemy, for \"as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\" (Proverbs 23:7.) But now in order for thishelmet to be effective, it must be of an exquisitedesign. It must be of a super-material to be effectivein our eternal conflict with the invisible enemyof all righteousness. Ours is to be the \"helmet ofsalvation.\" Salvation means the attainment of theeternal right to live in the presence of God theFather and the Son as a reward for a good life inmortality.With the goal of salvation ever in our mind's eye as the ultimate to be achieved, our thinking andour decisions which determine action will alwayschallenge all that would jeopardize that gloriousfuture state. Lost indeed is that soul who isintellectually without the \"helmet of salvation\"which tells him that death is the end and that thegrave is a victory over life, and brings to defeat thehopes, the aspirations, and the accomplishments oflife. Such a one might well conclude that he may aswell \"eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\" The conclusion reached by a committee of eminent divines appointed to investigate the cause of thewave of \"student suicides\" which swept over thecountry a few years ago was very significant. Thesummary of their findings declared: \"The philosophyof the students who took their lives was such thatthey had never given religion serious thought, andwhen a test came they had nothing to hold fast to.\" In contrast to the tragic picture, the one who confidently looks forward to an eternal reward for hisefforts in mortality is constantly sustained throughhis deepest trials; when his bank fails, he does notcommit suicide; when his loved ones die, he doesnot despair; when war and destruction dissipate hisfortune, he does not falter. He lives above his worldand never loses sight of the goal of his salvation. Our intellects, so protected, mustalways measure learning by the gospel criteria: Is it true? Is it uplifting? Willit benefit mankind? In the choicesof life\u2014our friends, our education, our vocation, our companion inmarriage\u2014all these and more mustbe made with an eye single to eternal life. Our thoughts must \"smell of thesunshine\" if our association would be inspiring and uplifting. If we would refrain frommurder, we must learn not to become angry; if we would free ourselves from sexual sin, we must control immoral thought; if we would avoid thepenalty of imprisonment for theft, we must learnnot to covet. So taught Jesus, the Master Teacherand our Savior. (See Matthew 5:21-28.) \"O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! Whenthey are learned they think they are wise, and theyhearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set itaside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore,their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth themnot. And they shall perish.\" (2 Nephi 9:28.) Our intellects . . . must always measure learning by the gospel criteria: Is it true? Is it uplifting?Children of the covenant who have upon their heads the helmet of salvation are not as these. The thrillof victory is within their grasp. But now may I call your attention to one significant fact concerning the armor with which you now havebeen clothed. You have no armor whatsoever toprotect you from the rear. Does this suggest yetanother quality essential to this eternal conflict with\"spiritual wickedness in high places\"? Evidently noone can win this battle running from the enemy. The contest must be face to face. There must be noretreat. So came the clear-ringing counsel of the FirstPresidency to our boys during the last World War:\"Boys, keep yourselves clean! Better die clean thanto come home unclean.\" Courage and determinationand continual aggressiveness to the right are theessential qualities for the battle of life, else all thearmor in the world suggested for our protectionwould be of no avail. Thus equipped within andwithout, we are now ready. But wait a moment! Are we to have no weapons with which to fight? Are we to be mere targets forthe enemy to attack? Let's read nowwhat Paul, the great apostle-teacher,said about our weapons: \"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quenchall the fiery darts of the wicked. \"And take . . . the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\" (Ephesians 6:16-17.) May I attempt to describe briefly that shield of faith? Faith is a gift from God, and blessed is theman who possesses it. \"He who carries the lampwill not despair,\" wrote one of the great industrialleaders with reference to a business crisis, \"nomatter how dark the night. That lamp I call faith.\"Suppose we examine a few of life's problems to seejust how effective the shield of faith can be. In what we might liken unto a great \"pincer movement\" of enemy forces to encircle us, we arebeing surfeited with the doctrine that we can get\"something for nothing.\" When the smoke of thepresent frenzied social conflict has cleared away andthe carnage resulting therefrom carefully counted,we shall have had proved again that we cannot getsomething for nothing and continue to prosper,and that the habit of giving instead of getting is theway to happiness. Then our faith in those tried andtrusted virtues of thrift, self-sacrifice, and frugalitywill have triumphed over the vices of recklessspending, selfishness, and a disregard for decentstandards of common civic virtue and morality. It was the faith of our pioneer fathers that prompted them, as they pitched camp to begin a newsettlement, to devoutly invoke the blessings ofAlmighty God upon their efforts. They prayed forthe rains to come, for the fertility of the soil, forprotection against destructive forces to the end thattheir crops would grow and that a harvest would begathered. When a bounteous harvest came, theythanked God; for the protection of loved ones, theygave recognition to an Omnipotent Power; in deathand sorrow, in floods and in storm, they saw theworkings of a Divine Will. Out of such faith therewas born in them, and can be likewise in you, a conviction that \"a man and the Lord are a bigmajority in any test.\" If we have faith in our kinship to a Great Creator, we recognize by that same token our relationship to man. Such faith banishes hate in time of war andsupplants therefore a sympathy for our enemy; the envies and jealousies of human societybecome, in the white light of faith,merely the growing pains of a family ofchildren growing up to maturity and toa better understanding of how, asgrownups, they should act. By faith wesurmount daily obstacles and disappointments, and our defeats we thus interpret as necessary for our experience and development; we r ealize that to be thrown upon one's own resources is to be cast into the lap of fortune where our faculties undergo an unexpected development. With faith we become pioneers forthe generations yet unborn and find ourselves becoming joyous in the contemplation of service wemay render to our fellowmen even though thereward be but a martyr's crown. Note now how the \"shield of faith\" and the \"sword of the spirit which is the word of God\" work together,perfectly coordinated as weapons in the hands ofone who has upon him the \"armor of righteousness.\"The scriptures declare, \"faith cometh by hearing,and hearing by the word of God.\" (Romans 10:17.)Just as one in hand-to-hand combat with only a shield and without a sword would soon beovercome, just so without the word of God fromthe scriptures and by revelation, our faith becomesweak in the face of modern destructionists who ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 226 By faith we surmount daily obstacles and disappointments.call themselves \"liberals.\" Shielded by faith, the commandments known as the Decalogue fromMount Sinai are transformed from mere platitudesof a philosopher to the thundering voice of authorityfrom on high, and the teachings of the scripturesbecome the revealed word of God to guide us to ourcelestial home. Obedience to civil law would becomea moral and a religious obligation, as well as a civicduty, if we believed that \"the powers that be areordained of God. Whosoever therefore God. . . .\"(Romans 13:1-2.) Armed with the word of God, the shattered dreams of youth and the frustrations which result from thestresses of war and the vigors of life do not embitterus or stifle our ambitions or prompt us in ourdespondency to cry out in despair, \"Oh, what's theuse?\" Guided by faith taught by the word of God,we view life as a great process of soul-training.Under the ever-watchful eye of a loving Father, we learn by \"the things which we suffer,\" we gainstrength by overcoming obstacles, and we conquerfear by triumphant victory in places where dangerlurks. By faith, as the word of God teaches, weunderstand that whatever contributes in life to thelofty standard of Jesus\u2014\"Be ye therefore perfect,even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\"(Matthew 5:48)\u2014is for our good and for our eternalbenefit even though into that molding may go thesevere chastening of an all-wise receiveth.\" (Hebrews 12:6.) Thus schooled and drilled for the contest with the powers of darkness and with spiritual wickedness,we may be \"troubled on every side, yet not distressed;we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted,but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.\"(2 Corinthians 4:8-9.) \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let usput on the armour of light. \"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,not in strife and envying.\" (Romans 13:12-13.) Youth of Zion, put on the whole armor of God!THE LAW OF CHASTITY President Ezra Taft BensonPresident of the ChurchIn Brigham Young University 1987-88 Devotional and Fireside Speeches, 51-54 Do not be misled by Satan's lies. There is no lastinghappiness in immorality. There is no joy to be foundin breaking the law of chastity. Just the opposite istrue. There may be momentary pleasure. For a timeit may seem like everything is wonderful. But quicklythe relationship will sour. Guilt and shame set in.We become fearful that our sins will be discovered.We must sneak and hide, lie and cheat. Love beginsto die. Bitterness, jealousy, anger, and even hatebegin to grow. All of these are the natural results of sin and transgression. On the other hand, when we obey the law of chastity and keep ourselves morally clean, we will experiencethe blessings of increased love and peace, greatertrust and respect for our marital partners, deepercommitment to each other, and, therefore, a deepand significant sense of joy and happiness. We must not be misled into thinking these sins are minor, or that consequences are not that serious.One of the most sobering statements about beingunchaste is that of Alma to his son Corianton:\"Know ye not, my son,\" he said, \"that these thingsare an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea,most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?\"(Alma 39:5; emphasis added). Very few of us willever be guilty of murder or of the sin against theHoly Ghost. But the law of chastity is frequentlybroken, and yet it stands next to these other sins in seriousness in the eyes of the Lord. My beloved brothers and sisters, are we living in accordance with these scriptures? Do we clearlyunderstand the seriousness of sexual sins? Do weconstantly stress the blessings that come fromobedience to this law? I say again, as have all theprophets before me, there is one standard of virtueand chastity, and all are expected to adhere to it.What the Lord says unto one, He says unto all: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 227\"Ye must practice virtue and holiness before me continually\" (D&C 46:33). Six Steps to Prepare and Prevent There is an old saying that states: It is better toprepare and prevent than it is to repair and repent.How true that is of the law of chastity. The first lineof defense in keeping ourselves morally clean is toprepare ourselves to resist temptation and preventourselves from falling into sin. For those who are pure and chaste, may I give six steps that are steps of preparation and prevention,steps that will insure that you never fall into thistransgression: 1.Decide now to be chaste. The decision to be chaste and virtuous need only be made once. Make that decision now and let it be so firm and with suchdeep commitment that it can n ever be shaken. Don't wait until you are alone in a parked car or caught in a compromising situation to decide tobe chaste. Decide now! 2.Control your thoughts. No one steps into immorality in an instant. The first seeds of immorality arealways sown in the mind. When we allow ourthoughts to linger on lewd or immoral things,the first step on the road to immorality has beentaken. I especially warn you against the evils ofpornography. Again and again we hear from thosecaught in deep sin that often the first step on theirroad to transgression began with pornographicmaterials. The Savior taught that even when aman looks upon a woman to lust after her, or inother words, when he lets his thoughts begin toget out of control, he has already committedadultery with her in his heart (see Matthew 5:28,D&C 63:16). 3.Always pray for the power to resist temptation.Temptation will come to all of us. It will takemany forms and appear in many disguises, butthe Lord has given us the key for resisting it. Hesaid to the Prophet Joseph: \"Pray always, thatyou may come off conqueror; yea, that you mayconquer Satan, and that you may escape thehands of the servants of Satan that do upholdhis work\" (D&C 10:5). It should be part of ourdaily prayers to ask the Lord for constant strengthto resist temptations, especially temptations thatinvolve the law of chastity.4.If you are married, avoid flirtations of any kind.Sometimes we hear of a married man going to lunch with his secretary or other women inthe office. Men and women who are marriedsometimes flirt with and tease members of theopposite sex. So-called harmless meetings arearranged or inordinate amounts of time are spenttogether. In all of these cases, people rationalizeby saying that these are natural expressions offriendship. But what may appear to be harmlessteasing or simply having a little fun with someoneof the opposite sex can easily lead to more seriousinvolvement and eventual infidelity. A goodquestion to ask ourselves is this: Would myspouse be pleased if he or she knew I was doingthis? Would a wife be pleased to know that herhusband lunches alone with his secretary?Would a husband be pleased if he saw his wifeflirting and being coy with another man? Mybeloved brothers and sisters, this is what Paulmeant when \"Abstain from all appearanceof evil\" (1 Thessalonians 5:22). 5.If you are married, avoid being alone with membersof the opposite sex whenever possible. Many of the tragedies of immorality begin when a man andwoman are alone in the office or at church ordriving in a car. At first there may be no intentor even thought of sin. But the circumstancesprovide a fertile seedbed for temptation. Onething leads to another, and very quickly tragedymay result. It is so much easier to avoid suchcircumstances from the start so that temptationgets no chance for nourishment. 6.For those who are single and dating members of theopposite sex, carefully plan positive and constructiveactivities so that you are not left to yourselves withnothing to do but share physical affection. Once again this is the principle of filling one's life withthe positive so that the negative has no chance tothrive. When young people are left to themselvesfor long periods of time with no specific plannedactivities, often they turn to necking and pettingto fill the empty hours. Five Steps to Repair and Repent But I realize that there may be some, even nowwithin the sound of my voice, for whom the counselto prepare and prevent is too late. You may alreadybe deeply entangled in serious sin. If this is thecase, there is no choice now but to repair your lives ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 228and repent of your sins. To you I would suggest five important things you can do to come back to a stateof moral purity. 1.Flee immediately from any situation you are in that is either causing you to sin or that may cause you tosin.When Joseph of Egypt was entrapped by Potiphar's wife alone in the house, it would havebeen easy for Joseph to have rationalized. After all,he had not encouraged her. After all, he was herservant. After all, it would hurt her feelings if herefused. Had Joseph stood there and rationalized,he could easily have fallen. There is a great lessonin how he did respond. The scripture says, \"Andhe left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out\" (Genesis 39:12; emphasis added). He fledand got him out. My beloved brothers and sisters,if you are currently in a situation where your moral purity is being or could be compromised,follow Joseph's example. Flee from it and getyourself out. You cannot linger in sin and expectto have success in repentance. 2.Plead with the Lord for the power to overcome. One of Satan's most effective strategies with those hehas lured into sin is to whisper in their ears thatthey are not worthy to pray. He will tell you thatHeavenly Father is so displeased with you thatHe will never hear your prayers. This is a lie, andhe says it to deceive us. The power of sin is great.If we are to extricate ourselves from it, especiallyserious sin, we must have a power greater thanourselves. No one is more anxious to help youflee from sin than your Father in Heaven. Go toHim. Acknowledge your sin, confess your shameand your guilt, and then plead with Him forhelp. He has the power to help you triumph. 3.Let your priesthood leaders help you resolve thetransgression and come back into full fellowshipwith the Lord. Certain sins are of such gravity that they put our standing in the Church in jeopardy.Sexual sins are among those of such seriousness(see D&C 42:24). Full repentance of such sinsrequires that we not only confess our sins andresolve them with the Lord, but that we also doso with the Church. This is done throughappropriate priesthood leaders. The bishops andstake presidents have been appointed by revelationto serve as watchmen over the Church and asjudges in Israel. While only the Lord can forgivesins, the priesthood leaders play a critical role inthe process of repentance. Even if we aredisfellowshipped or excommunicated, it is abeginning step in the process of repentance, andthe sooner one begins, the sooner one can findthe sweet peace and joy that come with themiracle of forgiveness. 4.Drink from the divine fountain and fill your liveswith positive sources of power. It is not enough simply to try to resist evil or empty our lives ofsin. We must also fill our lives with righteousness.We must engage in activities that bring spiritualpower. I speak of such activities as immersingourselves in the scriptures. There is a power thatflows into our lives when we read and study thescriptures on a daily basis that cannot be foundin any other way. Daily prayer is another sourceof great power. Fasting for specific strength orspecial blessings can strengthen us beyond ournormal ability. Christian service, churchattendance, service in the kingdom\u2014all can addto our storehouse of strength and power. Wemust do more than simply remove the negativeinfluences from our lives. We must replace themwith righteous activities that fill us with thestrength and determination to live as we should. 5.Remember that through proper repentance you canbecome clean again. that \"despair cometh because of iniquity\" (Moroni 10:22).Those who are caught in immorality may beexperiencing the devastating effects of despair.But there is an alternative. For those who paythe price required by true repentance, thepromise is sure. You can be clean again. Thedespair can be lifted. The sweet peace offorgiveness will flow into your lives. Finding Joy The words of the Lord through Isaiah are sure:\"Come now, and let us reason together, saith theLord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be aswhite as snow; though they be red like crimson,they shall be as wool\" (Isaiah 1:18). And in this dispensation the Lord spoke with equal clarity when He said, \"Behold, he who has repentedof his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord,remember them no more\" (D&C 58:42). As I said earlier, when it comes to the law of chastity, it is better to prepare and prevent than it is torepair and repent. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 229My beloved brothers and sisters in the gospel, our Heavenly Father desires nothing for us but to behappy. He tells us only those things that will bringus joy. And one of the surest principles given byGod to help us find that joy is the law of chastity. I pray with all my heart that you will consider most solemnly the joyful consequences of keeping this lawand the tragic consequence of violating it. And I dothis in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. OFFICE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salt Lake City, Utah 84150November 14, 1991To: All Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Dear Brethren and Sisters: Standards of Morality and Fidelity We call upon members to renew their commitment to live the Lord's standard of moral conduct. Parentsshould teach their children the sacred nature ofprocreative powers and instill in them a desire to bechaste in thought and deed. A correct understandingof the divinely appointed roles of men and womenwill fortify all against sinful practices. Our only realsafety, physically and spiritually, lies in keeping theLord's commandments. The Lord's law of moral conduct is abstinence outside of lawful marriage and fidelity within marriage.Sexual relations are proper only between husbandand wife appropriately expressed within the bondsof marriage. Any other sexual contact, includingfornication, adultery, and homosexual and lesbianbehavior, is sinful. Those who persist in suchpractices or who influence others to do so aresubject to Church discipline. We remind you of scriptures that make clear the relationship between one's thoughts and actions(see immoral and feelings andparticipating in either immoral heterosexual or anyhomosexual behavior. However, such thoughts andfeelings, regardless of their causes, can and should beovercome and sinful behavior should be eliminated.This can be achieved through faith in God, sincererepentance, and persistent effort. The help of othersmay be needed. We commend and encourage thosewho are overcoming inappropriate thoughts andfeelings. We plead with those involved in suchbehavior to forsake it. We love them and pray forthem. We are confident that through repentanceand obtaining needed help, they can experience thepeace that comes from conforming their lives toGod's teachings. Individuals and their families desiring help with these matters should seek counsel from their bishop,branch president, stake or district president. Weencourage Church leaders and members to reachout with love and understanding to those strugglingwith these issues. Many will respond to Christlikelove and inspired counsel as they receive an invitationto come back and apply the atoning and healingpower of the Savior (see Isaiah 53:4-5; Mosiah 4:2-3). Sincerely your brethren,Ezra Taft Benson Gordon B. HinckleyThomas S. MonsonThe First Presidency OUR MORAL ENVIRONMENT Elder Boyd K. Packer Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1992, 91-95; or Ensign, May 1992, 66-68 I have been a General Authority for over thirtyyears and a member of the Quorum of the TwelveApostles for twenty-two. During those years I have interviewed I don't know how many, surely thousands, of members of the Church and have talked with them in intimate terms of theirworthiness, their sorrow, and their happiness. Imention that only in the hope that the credentialof experience may persuade you to consider matterswhich have us deeply worried. Moral Environment Today I speak to members of the Church as anenvironmentalist. My message is not on the physicalbut on the moral and spiritual environment in which we must raise our families. As we test the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 230moral environment, we find the pollution index is spiraling upward. The Book of Mormon depicts humanity struggling through a \"mist of darkness\" and defines thedarkness as the \"temptations of the devil\" (1 Nephi8:23; 12:17). So dense was that moral pollution that many followed \"strange roads\" and \"fell away intoforbidden paths and were lost\" (see 1 Nephi 8:23-32). The deliberate pollution of the fountain of life now clouds our moral environment. The gift of mortallife and the capacity to kindle other lives is a supernalblessing. Its worth is incalculable! The Spiritual Environment The rapid, sweeping deterioration of values ischaracterized by a preoccupation\u2014even anobsession\u2014with the procreative act. Abstinencebefore marriage and fidelity within it are openlyscoffed at, marriage and parenthood ridiculed asburdensome, unnecessary. Modesty, a virtue of a refined individual or society, is all but gone. The Tempter The adversary is jealous toward all who have thepower to beget life. He cannot beget life; he isimpotent. He and those who followed him werecast out and forfeited the right to a mortal body.His angels even begged to inhabit the bodies ofswine (see Matthew 8:31). And the revelations tellus that \"he seeketh that all men might be miserablelike unto himself\" (2 Nephi 2:27). With ever fewer exceptions, what we see and read and hear have the mating act as a central theme.Censorship is forced offstage as a violation ofindividual freedom. That which should be absolutely private is disrobed and acted out center stage. In the shadows backstageare addiction, pornography, perversion, infidelity,abortion, incest, and molestation. In company withthem now is a plague of biblical proportion. And allof them are on the increase. Society excuses itself from responsibility except for teaching the physical process of reproduction tochildren in school to prevent pregnancy and diseaseand providing teenagers with devices which aresupposed to protect them from both. When any effort is made to include values in these courses\u2014basic universal values, not just values ofthe Church, but of civilization, of society itself\u2014theprotest arises, \"You are imposing religion upon us,infringing upon our freedom.\" Freedom to Choose While we pass laws to reduce pollution of the earth,any proposal to protect the moral and spiritualenvironment is shouted down and marched againstas infringing upon liberty, agency, freedom, theright to choose. Interesting how one virtue, when given exaggerated or fanatical emphasis, can be used to batter downanother, with freedom, a virtue, invoked to protectvice. Those determined to transgress see any regulation of their life-style as interfering with theiragency and seek to have their actions condoned bymaking them legal. People who are otherwise sensible say, \"I do not intend to indulge, but I vote for freedom of choicefor those who do.\" Flawed Argument Regardless of how lofty and moral the \"pro-choice\"argument sounds, it is badly flawed. With that samelogic one could argue that all traffic signs and barrierswhich keep the careless from danger should bepulled down on the theory that each individual mustbe free to choose how close to the edge he will go. No Free Agency The phrase \"free agency\" does not appear in scripture. The only agency spoken of there is moral agency, \"which,\" the Lord said, \"I have given unto him, thatevery man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.\" (D&C 101:78; italics added.) Heeding the Warning And the Lord warned members of his Church, \"Letnot that which I have appointed be polluted bymine enemies, by the consent of those who callthemselves after my name: For this is a very sore and grievous sin against me, and against my people\"(D&C 101:97-98; italics added). Because the laws of man, by and large, do not raise moral issues, we are taught to honor, sustain, andobey the law (see Articles of Faith 1:12) and that\"he that keepeth the laws of God hath no need tobreak the laws of the land\" (D&C 58:21). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 231The Right to Speak Out When a moral issue does arise, it is the responsibility of the leaders of the Church to speak out. Gambling,for instance, certainly is a moral issue. Life is a moralissue. When morality is involved, we have both theright and the obligation to raise a warning voice. We do not as a church speak on political issues unlessmorality is involved. In thirty years and thousandsof interviews, I have never once asked members ofthe Church what political party they belonged to. Physical and Moral Laws There are both moral and physical laws \"irrevocablydecreed in heaven before the foundations of thisworld\" (D&C 130:20) which man cannot overrule. For instance, do you think a vote to repeal the law of gravity would do any good? Unenforceable Suppose a law decreed that all children would betaken from their parents and raised by the state.Such a law would be wicked but probably could beenforced. Such things have been done before. But suppose an article of that law stated, \"Within fifteen days the mother will cease all emotional tiesto her child.\" That provision is absolutely unenforceable. No matter how severe the penalty or the number of enforcers,it is absolutely unenforceable because it contravenesboth natural and moral law. No matter if fifteen weeks or months or fifteen years were allowed, it cannot be enforced! It may work withanimals, but \"all flesh,\" the scriptures teach, \"is notthe same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men,another flesh of beasts\" (1 Corinthians 15:39). Itcannot be made to work with human mothers. Never! A man-made law against nature would be as impossible to defend as a law annulling love betweenmother and child would be impossible to enforce! Children of God No greater ideal has been revealed than the supernaltruth that we are the children of God, and we differ,by virtue of our creation, from all other living things(see Moses 6:8-10, 22, 59).The Evil Idea No idea has been more destructive of happiness; no philosophy has produced more sorrow, moreheartbreak and mischief; no idea has done more todestroy the family than the idea that we are not theoffspring of God, only advanced animals, compelledto yield to every carnal urge. Animals are not subject to moral law. Nevertheless, while by and large they are promiscuous inresponding to their mating instincts, their matingrituals have set patterns and have rigid limitations.For instance, animals do not pair up with their owngender to satisfy their mating instincts. Nor arethese instincts expressed in the molestation of theiroffspring. The source of life is now relegated to the level of unwed pleasure, bought and sold and even defiledin satanic rituals. Children of God can willfullysurrender to their carnal nature and, withoutremorse, defy the laws of morality and degradethemselves even below the beasts. Most Abominable If we pollute our fountains of life, there will bepenalties \"exquisite\" and \"hard to bear\" (see D&C19:15), more than all of the physical pleasure evercould be worth. Alma told his son Corianton, \"Knowye not, my son, that these things are an abominationin the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominableabove all sins save it be the shedding of innocentblood or denying the Holy Ghost?\" (Alma 39:5). The code for moral law is found in the scriptures, stated as simply as, \"Wickedness never was happiness\"(Alma 41:10). The scriptures speak in general terms,leaving us free to apply the principles of the gospelto meet the infinite variety of life. But when theysay \"thou shalt not,\" we had better pay attention. The only legitimate employment of the power of procreation is between husband and wife, man andwoman, who have been legally and lawfully married.Anything else violates the commandments of God.From Alma, \"If ye speak against it, it matters not, forthe word of God must be fulfilled\" (Alma 5:58). . . . Repentance In the battle of life, the adversary takes enormousnumbers of prisoners, and many who know of noway to escape and are pressed into his service. Every ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 232soul confined to a concentration camp of sin and guilt has a key to the gate. The adversary cannothold them if they know how to use it. The key islabeled Repentance. The twin principles of repentance and forgiveness exceed in strength the awesomepower of the adversary. I know of no sins connected with the moral standard for which we cannot be forgiven. I do not exemptabortion. The formula is stated in forty words: \"Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no more. \"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins\u2014behold, he will confess them and forsakethem\" (D&C 58:42-43). I Will Remember Your Sins No More However long and painful the process of repentance,the Lord has said: \"This is the covenant . I will make with them. . . . I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; \"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more\" (Hebrews 10:16-17; italics added).Civilizations, like Sodom and Gomorrah, destroyed themselves by disobedience to the laws of morality.\"For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive withman. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with God grant that we will come to our senses and protect our moral environment from this mist ofdarkness which deepens day by day. The fate of allhumanity hangs precariously in the balance. And may we have the protection of Him who is our Father and our God, and may we merit the love andblessings of His Son, our Redeemer, in whose name,even the name of Jesus Christ, I bear witness, amen.PERSONAL PURITY Elder Jeffrey R. Holland Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1998, 98-102; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 75-78 Personal Purity As modern winds of immorality swirl luridly aroundthem, I am concerned for any of our youth or youngadults who may be confused about principles ofpersonal purity, about obligations of total chastitybefore marriage and complete fidelity after it.Against what is happening in the world they seeand hear, and hoping to fortify parents as they teachtheir children a higher standard, I wish to speaktoday about moral cleanliness. Because this subjectis as sacred as any I know, I earnestly pray for theHoly Spirit to guide me in remarks that are morecandid than I would wish to make. Today I knowhow Jacob in the Book of Mormon felt when hesaid on the same topic, \"It grieveth me that I mustuse so much boldness of speech.\" 1 In approaching this subject, I do not document a host of social ills for which the statistics are as grimas the examples are offensive. Nor will I presenthere a checklist of do's and don'ts about dating andboy-girl relationships. What I wish to do is morepersonal\u2014I wish to try to answer questions some of you may have been asking: Why should we be morally clean? Why is it such an important issue to God? Does the Church have to be so strict about it? How could anything society exploits and glamorizesso openly be very sacred or serious? A River of Fire May I begin with a lesson from civilization's long,instructive story. Will and Ariel Durant have written:\"No the laboratory of history. Ayouth boiling with hormones will wonder why heshould not give full freedom to his sexual desires;[but] if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws,he may ruin his life before he . . . understand[s] thatsex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 233by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.\"2 A more important scriptural observation is offeredby the writer of Proverbs: \"Can a man take fire inhis bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Can onego upon hot coals, and his feet dishonour he get; and hisreproach shall not be wiped away.\" 3 Why Is Sexual Purity So Important? Why is this matter of sexual relationships so severethat fire is almost always the metaphor, with passionpictured vividly in flames? What is there in thepotentially hurtful heat of this that leaves one'ssoul\u2014or the whole world, for that matter\u2014destroyedif that flame is left unchecked and those passionsunrestrained? What is there in all of this that promptsAlma to warn his son Corianton that sexual transgres-sion is \"an abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shed-ding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?\" 4 By assigning such seriousness to a physical appetiteso universally bestowed, what is God trying to tell usabout its place in His plan for all men and women?I submit to you He is doing precisely that\u2014commenting about the very plan of life itself. Clearlyamong His greatest concerns regarding mortality arehow one gets into this world and how one gets outof it. He has set very strict limits in these matters. Fortunately, in the case of how life is terminated, most seem to be quite responsible. But in thesignificance of giving life, we sometimes find near- criminal irresponsibility. May I offer three reasonswhy this is an issue of such magnitude andconsequence in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Doctrine of the Human Soul First is the revealed, restored doctrine of the humansoul. One of the \"plain and precious\" truths restored in this dispensation is that \"the spirit and the body arethe soul of man\" 5and that when the spirit and body are separated, men and women \"cannot receive a fulness of joy.\" 6That is the reason why obtaining a body is so fundamentally important in the firstplace, why sin of any kind is such a serious matter(namely because it is sin that ultimately brings bothphysical and spiritual death), and why the resurrectionof the body is so central to the great triumph ofChrist's Atonement. The body is an essential part of the soul. This distinctive and very important Latter-day Saint doctrine underscores why sexual sin is so serious. We declarethat one who uses the God-given body of anotherwithout divine sanction abuses the very soul of thatindividual, abuses the central purpose and processesof life\u2014\"the very key\" 7to life, as President Boyd K. Packer once called it. In exploiting the body ofanother\u2014which means exploiting his or her soul\u2014one desecrates the Atonement of Christ, which savedthat soul and which makes possible the gift of eternallife. And when one mocks the Son of Righteousness,one steps into a realm of heat hotter and holier thanthe noonday sun. You cannot do so and not beburned. Please, never say: \"Who does it hurt? Why not a little freedom? I can transgress now and repent later.\"Please don't be so foolish and so cruel. You cannotwith impunity \"crucify Christ afresh.\" 8\"Flee fornication,\" Paul cries,9and like unto it,\"10the Doctrine and Covenants adds. Why? Well, for one reason because of the incalculable sufferingin both body and spirit endured by the Savior of theworld so that we could flee. 11We owe Him something for that. Indeed, we owe Him everything for that. \"Yeare not your own,\" Paul says. \"Ye [have been] boughtwith a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.\" 12In sexual transgression the soul is at stake\u2014the body and the spirit. The Ultimate Symbol of Total Union Secondly, may I stress that human intimacy isreserved for a married couple because it is theultimate symbol of total union, a totality and a union ordained and defined by God. From theGarden of Eden onward, marriage was intended tomean the complete merger of a man and a woman\u2014their hearts, hopes, lives, love, family, future,everything. Adam said of Eve that she was bone ofhis bones and flesh of his flesh, and that they wereto be \"one flesh\" in their life together. 13This is a union of such completeness that we use the wordsealto convey its eternal promise. The Prophet Joseph Smith once said we perhaps could render such a sacred bond as being \"welded\" 14one to another. But such a total union, such an unyieldingcommitment between a man and a woman, can onlycome with the proximity and permanence afforded ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 234in a marriage covenant, with solemn promises and the pledge of all they possess\u2014their very hearts andminds, all their days and all their dreams. Can you see the moral schizophrenia that comes from pretending you are one, pretending you have made solemn promises before God, sharing thephysical symbols and the physical intimacy of yourcounterfeit union but then fleeing, retreating,severing all such other aspects of what was meantto be a total obligation? In matters of human intimacy, you must wait! You must wait until you can give everything, and you cannot give everything until you are legally andlawfully married. To give illicitly that which is notyours to give (remember, \"you are not your own\")and to give only part of that which cannot befollowed with the gift of your whole self is emotionalRussian roulette. If you persist in pursuing physicalsatisfaction without the sanction of heaven, yourun the terrible risk of such spiritual, psychic damagethat you may undermine both your longing for physical intimacy andyour ability to give wholehearted devotion to a later, truer love. Youmay come to that truer moment of ordained love,of real union, only to discover to your horror thatwhat you should have saved you have spent, andthat only God's grace can recover the piecemealdissipation of the virtue you so casually gave away.On your wedding day the very best gift you cangive your eternal companion is your very best self\u2014clean and pure and worthy of such purity in return. A Symbol of the Relationship with God Thirdly, may I say that physical intimacy is notonly a symbolic union between a husband and awife\u2014the very uniting of their souls\u2014but it is alsosymbolic of a shared relationship between them andtheir Father in Heaven. He is immortal and perfect.We are mortal and imperfect. Nevertheless we seekways even in mortality whereby we can unite withHim spiritually. In so doing we gain some access toboth the grace and the majesty of His power. Thosespecial moments include kneeling at a marriagealtar in the house of the Lord, blessing a newbornbaby, baptizing and confirming a new member ofthe Church, partaking of the emblems of the Lord'sSupper, and so forth. These are moments when we quite literally unite our will with God's will, our spirit with His spirit, wherecommunion through the veil becomes very real. Atsuch moments we not only acknowledge His divinitybut we quite literally take something of that divinityto ourselves. One aspect of that divinity given tovirtually all men and women is the use of His powerto create a human body, that wonder of all wonders,a genetically and spiritually unique being neverbefore seen in the history of the world and never to be duplicated again in all the ages of eternity. Achild, your child\u2014with eyes and ears and fingersand toes and a future of unspeakable grandeur. Probably only a parent who has held that newborn infant in his or her arms understands the wonder ofwhich I speak. Suffice it to say that of all the titlesGod has chosen for Himself, Father is the one He favors most, and creation is His watchword\u2014especially human creation, creation in His image. You and I have been given something of that godliness, but under the most serious and sacred of restrictions. Theonly control placed on us is self-control \u2014self-control born of respect for the divine sacramental powerthis gift represents. Control Sacred Procreative Powers My beloved friends, especially my young friends, canyou see why personal purity is such a serious matter?Can you understand why the First Presidency andCouncil of the Twelve Apostles would issue aproclamation declaring that \"the means by whichmortal life is created [is] divinely appointed\" andthat \"the sacred powers of procreation are to beemployed only between man and woman, lawfullywedded as husband and wife\"? 15Don't be deceived and don't be destroyed. Unless such powers arecontrolled and commandments kept, your futuremay be burned; your world could go up in flames.Penalty may not come on the precise day oftransgression, but it comes surely and certainlyenough. And unless there is true repentance andobedience to a merciful God, then someday,somewhere, the morally cavalier and unclean willpray like the rich man who wished Lazarus to \"dip. . . his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\" 16 The Peace and Renewal of Repentance I have declared here the solemn word of revelationthat the spirit and the body constitute the soul ofman, and that through the Atonement of Christ thebody shall rise from the grave to unite with thespirit in an eternal existence. That body is therefore ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 235something to be kept pure and holy. Do not be afraid of soiling its hands in honest labor. Do notbe afraid of scars that may come in defending thetruth or fighting for the right, but beware scars thatspiritually disfigure, that come to you in activitiesyou should not have undertaken, that befall you inplaces where you should not have gone. Beware thewounds of any battle in which you have beenfighting on the wrong side. 17 If some of you are carrying such wounds\u2014and I know that you are\u2014to you is extended the peaceand renewal of repentance available through theatoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ. In suchserious matters the path of repentance is not easilybegun nor painlessly traveled. But the Savior of theworld will walk that essential journey with you. Hewill strengthen you when you waver. He will beyour light when it seems most dark. He will takeyour hand and be your hope when hope seems allyou have left. His compassion and mercy, with alltheir cleansing and healing power, are freely givento all who truly wish complete forgiveness and willtake the steps that lead to it. Glorify God in Body and Spirit I bear witness of the great plan of life, of the powersof godliness, of mercy and forgiveness and theAtonement of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014all of whichhave profound meaning in matters of moralcleanliness. I testify that we are to glorify God inour body and in our spirit. I thank heaven forlegions of the young who are doing just that andhelping others do the same. I thank heaven forhomes where this is taught. That lives of personalpurity may be reverenced by all, I pray in the nameof purity Himself, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMORALITY AND MODESTY 236MOTHERS' EMPLOYMENTOUTSIDE THE HOME SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"The husband is expected to support his family and only in an emergency should a wife secure outsideemployment. Her place is in the home, to build thehome into a heaven of delight. \"Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out intothe world into employment. Two incomes raise thestandard of living beyond its norm. Two spousesworking prevent the complete and proper home life,break into the family prayers, create an independencewhich is not cooperative, causes distortion, limits thefamily and frustrates the children already born. . . . \". . . I beg of you, you who could and should be bearing and rearing a family: Wives, come homefrom the typewriter, the laundry, the nursing, comehome from the factory, the caf\u00e9. \"No career approaches in importance that of wife, homemaker, mother\u2014cooking meals, washing dishes,making beds for one's precious husband and children. \"Come home, wives, to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives, to yourchildren, born and unborn. Wrap the motherly cloakabout you and unembarrassed help in a major roleto create the bodies for the immortal souls whoanxiously wait. \"When you have fully complemented your husband in home life and borne the children, growing up fullof faith, integrity, responsibility and goodness, thenyou have achieved your accomplishments supreme,without peer, and you will be the envy throughtime and eternity\" (fireside address in San Antonio,Texas, 27, 32-33). \"How do you feel the Lord looks upon those who would trade flesh-and-blood children for pianos ortelevision or furniture or an automobile, and is thisnot actually the case when people will buy theseluxuries and yet cannot afford to have theirchildren?\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 329). \"We have often said, This divine service ofmotherhood can be rendered only by mothers. Itmay not be passed to others. Nurses cannot do it;public nurseries cannot do it. Hired help cannot do it; kind relatives cannot do it. Only by mother,aided as much as may be by a loving father,brothers and sisters, and other relatives, can the fullneeded measure of watchful care be given\" (\"TheBlessings and Responsibilities of Womanhood,\"Ensign, Mar. 1976, 73). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Take time to always be at the crossroads when your children are either coming or going\u2014whenthey leave and return from school, when they leaveand return from dates, when they bring friends home.Be there at the crossroads whether your children aresix or sixteen. In Proverbs we read, 'A child left tohimself bringeth his mother to shame' (Proverbs29:15). Among the greatest concerns in our societyare the millions of latchkey children who comehome daily to empty houses, unsupervised byworking parents\" ( To the Mothers in Zion, 8). \"In a home where there is an able-bodied husband,he is expected to be the breadwinner. Sometimes wehear of husbands who, because of economicconditions, have lost their jobs and expect the wivesto go out of the home and work, even though thehusband is capable of providing for his family. Inthese cases, we urge the husband to do all in hispower to allow his wife to remain in the home caringfor the children while he continues to provide forhis family the best he can, even though the job heis able to secure may not be ideal and familybudgeting may have to be tighter .... \"Sometimes the mother works outside of the homeat the encouragement, or even insistence, of herhusband. It is he who wants the items or conven-iences that the extra income can buy. Not only willthe family suffer in such instances, brethren, butyour own spiritual growth and progression will be It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. \u2014President Gordon B. Hinckley ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL237hampered. I say to all of you, the Lord has charged men with the responsibility to provide for theirfamilies in such a way that the wife is allowed tofulfill her role as mother in the home. . . . \"One apparent impact of the women's movement has been the feelings of discontent it has createdamong young women who have chosen the role ofwife and mother. They are often made to feel thatthere are more exciting and self-fulfilling roles forwomen than housework, diaper changing, andchildren calling for mother. This view loses sight ofthe eternal perspective that God elected women tothe noble role of mother and that exaltation iseternal fatherhood and eternal motherhood. ['Tothe Elect Women of the Kingdom of God,' NauvooIllinois Relief Society Dedication, 30 June 1978.]\"(Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, 506-7, 548-49). \"There are voices in our midst which would attemptto convince you that these home-centered truthsare not applicable to our present-day conditions. Ifyou listen and heed, you will be lured away fromyour principal obligations. \"Beguiling voices in the world cry out for 'alternative life-styles' for women. They maintain that somewomen are better suited for careers than for marriageand motherhood. \"These individuals spread their discontent by the propaganda that there are more exciting and self-fulfilling roles for women than homemaking. Someeven have been bold to suggest that the Churchmove away from the 'Mormon woman stereotype'of homemaking and rearing children. They also sayit is wise to limit your family so you can have moretime for personal goals and self-fulfillment\" (\"TheHonored Place of Woman,\" Ensign, Nov. 1981, 105). \"The first priority for a woman is to prepare herselffor her divine and eternal mission, whether she ismarried soon or late. It is folly to neglect thatpreparation for education in unrelated fields just toprepare temporarily to earn money. Women, whenyou are married it is the husband's role to provide,not yours. Do not sacrifice your preparation for an eternally ordained mission for the temporaryexpediency of money-making skills which you mayor may not use\" (\"In His Steps,\" 64). \"It is time that the hearts of us fathers be turned to our children and the hearts of the children be turnedto us fathers, or we shall both be cursed. The seedsof divorce are often sown and the blessings ofchildren delayed by wives working outside thehome. Working mothers should remember thattheir children usually need more of mother than of money\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1970, 24). President Howard W. Hunter See quotation on page 208. President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Sisters, guard your children. They live in a world of evil. The forces are all about them. I am proud of somany of your sons and daughters who are livinggood lives. But I am deeply concerned about manyothers who are gradually taking on the ways of theworld. Nothing is more precious to you as mothers,absolutely nothing. Your children are the mostvaluable thing you will have in time or all eternity.You will be fortunate indeed if, as you grow old andlook at those you brought into the world, you findin them uprightness of life, virtue in living, andintegrity in their behavior. \"I think the nurture and upbringing of children is more than a part-time responsibility. I recognizethat some women must work, but I fear that thereare far too many who do so only to get the meansfor a little more luxury and a few fancier toys. \"If you must work, you have an increased load to bear. You cannot afford to neglect your children.They need your supervision in studying, in workinginside and outside the home, in the nurturing thatonly you can adequately give\u2014the love, the blessing,the encouragement, and the closeness of a mother. \"Families are being torn asunder everywhere. Family relationships are strained as women try tokeep up with the rigors of two full-time jobs. \"I have many opportunities to speak with leaders who decry what is going on\u2014gangs on the streetsof our cities, children killing children, spendingtheir time in practices that can lead only to prisonor to death. We face a great overwhelming tide ofchildren born to mothers without husbands. Thefutures of such children are almost inevitably blightedfrom the day they are born. Every home needs agood father and a good mother. \"We cannot build prisons fast enough in this country to accommodate the need. \"I do not hesitate to say that you who are mothers can do more than any other group to change this ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMOTHERS ' E MPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE HOME 238situation. All of these problems find their root in the homes of the people. It is broken homes thatlead to a breakup in society. \"And so tonight, my beloved sisters, my message to you, my challenge to you, my prayer is that youwill rededicate yourselves to the strengthening ofyour homes\" (\"Walking in the Light of the Lord,\"Ensign, Nov. 1998, 99-100). \"Some years ago President Benson delivered amessage to the women of the Church. He encouragedthem to leave their employment and give theirindividual time to their children. I sustain theposition which he took. \"Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has become very many,in fact) who have to work to provide for the needsof their families. To you I say, do the very best youcan. I hope that if you are employed full-time youare doing it to ensure that basic needs are met andnot simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home,fancy cars, and other luxuries. The greatest job thatany mother will ever do will be in nurturing,teaching, lifting, encouraging, and rearing herchildren in righteousness and truth. None other can adequately take her place. \"It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. I know howsome of you struggle with decisions concerning thismatter. I repeat, do the very best you can. You knowyour circumstances, and I know that you are deeplyconcerned for the welfare of your children. Each ofyou has a bishop who will counsel with you andassist you. If you feel you need to speak with anunderstanding woman, do not hesitate to get intouch with your Relief Society president. \"To the mothers of this Church, every mother who is here today, I want to say that as the years pass, youwill become increasingly grateful for that whichyou did in molding the lives of your children in thedirection of righteousness and goodness, integrityand faith. That is most likely to happen if you canspend adequate time with them\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1996, 93-94; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 69). \"To you women who find it necessary to work whenyou would rather be at home, may I speak briefly. Iknow that there are many of you who find yourselvesin this situation. Some of you have been abandonedand are divorced, with children to care for. Some ofyou are widows with dependent families. I honoryou and respect you for your integrity and spirit ofself-reliance. I pray that the Lord will bless you withstrength and great capacity, for you need both. Youhave the responsibilities of both breadwinner andhomemaker. I know that it is difficult. I know thatit is discouraging. I pray that the Lord will bless youwith a special wisdom and the remarkable talentneeded to provide your children with time andcompanionship and love and with that specialdirection which only a mother can give. I pray alsothat he will bless you with help, unstintingly given,from family, friends, and the Church, which will liftsome of the burden from your shoulders and helpyou in your times of extremity. \"We sense, at least in some small degree, the loneliness you must occasionally feel and thefrustrations you must experience as you try to copewith problems that sometimes seem beyond yourcapacity to handle. Sometimes you need food foryour tables, and we trust that bishops will be thereto supply food and other goods and services underthe great program which the Lord has provided inhis Church. But we know that more often yourgreater need is for understanding and appreciationand companionship. We shall try a little harder tocultivate these virtues, and I urge you sisters whoare in a position to do so to reach out with greaterconcern to those who find themselves in these lessfortunate circumstances. \"Now to others who work when it is not necessary and who, while doing so, leave children to the careof those who often are only poor substitutes, I offera word of caution. Do not follow a practice whichwill bring you later regret. If the purpose of your dailyemployment is simply to get money for a boat or a fancy automobile or some other desirable butunnecessary thing, and in the process you lose thecompanionship of your children and the opportunityto rear them, you may find that you have lost thesubstance while grasping at the shadow\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1983, 114; or Ensign, Nov. 1983, 83). The Family: A Proclamation to the World \"By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and areresponsible to provide the necessities of life andprotection for their families. Mothers are primarilyresponsible for the nurture of their children. Inthese sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMOTHERS ' E MPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE HOME 239are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances maynecessitate individual adaptation. Extended familiesshould lend support when needed\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Elder Howard W. Hunter \"In a personal way, I recall the experiences my dear wife and I went through after deciding the course Ishould take for my life's work. I had taken somecourses in pharmacy with the plan in mind ofconverting to a career in medicine. As many of usdo, I changed my mind and engaged in anotherbusiness, banking. We were blessed with steadyemployment, but I felt attracted toward the professionof law. This was a serious decision because I wasmarried and had a family to support but after fastingand prayer and obtaining the facts as to the best wayto proceed, I completed my undergraduate work andentered law school. I took classes at night because itwas necessary to be employed during the daytime.These were not easy years for us, but desires areusually accomplished if we are willing to make adetermined effort. Needless to say, I had the helpand support of my wife. She remained a homemakerand cared for our children. What she gave in love,encouragement, frugality, and companionship wasfar in excess of any material contribution she mighthave made by taking employment. \"Our wives deserve great credit for the heavy work load they carry day in and day out within our homes.No one expends more energy than a devoted motherand wife. In the usual arrangement of things,however, it is the man to whom the Lord hasassigned the breadwinner's role. \"There are impelling reasons for our sisters to plan toward employment also. We want them to obtainall the education and vocational training possiblebefore marriage. If they become widowed or divorcedand need to work, we want them to have dignifiedand rewarding employment. If a sister does notmarry, she has every right to engage in a professionthat allows her to magnify her talents and gifts.\"Brothers and Sisters, we need to do everythingnecessary to adequately prepare ourselves foremployment or careers. We owe it to ourselves todo our best, and we owe our best in providing forour families\" (\"Prepare for HonorableEmployment,\" Ensign, Nov. 1975, 123-24). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The First Presidency counseled that 'the mother who entrusts her child to the care of others, thatshe may do non-motherly work, whether for gold,for fame, or for civic service, should remember that\"a child left to himself bringeth his mother toshame.\" (Prov. 29:15) In our day the Lord has saidthat unless parents teach their children thedoctrines of the Church \"the sin be upon \"That message and warning from the First Presidency is needed more, not less, today thanwhen it was given [in 1942]. And no voice from anyorganization of the Church on any level ofadministration equals that of the First Presidency\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 30; or Ensign,Nov. 1993, 23). Elder Richard G. Scott \"President Benson has taught that a mother with children should be in the home. He also said, 'Werealize . . . that some of our choice sisters arewidowed and divorced and that others findthemselves in unusual circumstances where, out ofnecessity, they are required to work for a period oftime. But these instances are the exception, not therule' (Ezra Taft Benson, To the Mothers in Zion [pamphlet, 1987], pp. 5-6).

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALMOTHERS ' E MPLOYMENT OUTSIDE THE HOME 240PARENTHOOD: CREATING A GOSPEL-CENTERED HOME SELECTED TEACHINGS Parental Success President Spencer W. Kimball \"I have sometimes seen children of good families rebel, resist, stray, sin, and even actually fight God.In this they bring sorrow to their parents, who havedone their best to set in movement a current and toteach and live as examples. But I have repeatedlyseen many of these same children, after years ofwandering, mellow, realize what they have beenmissing, repent, and make great contribution to thespiritual life of their community. The reason I believethis can take place is that, despite all the adversewinds to which these people have been subjected,they have been influenced still more, and muchmore than they realized, by the current of life in thehomes in which they were reared. When, in lateryears, they feel a longing to recreate in their ownfamilies the same atmosphere they enjoyed aschildren, they are likely to turn to the faith thatgave meaning to their parents' lives\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1974, 160; or Ensign, Nov. 1974, 111). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Nurture your children with love and the admonitions of the Lord. \"Rearing happy, peaceful children is no easy challenge in today's world, but it can be done, andit is being done. \"Responsible parenthood is the key.\"Above all else, children need to know and feel they are loved, wanted, and appreciated. They need to beassured of that often. Obviously, this is a role parentsshould fill, and most often the mother can do itbest. . . . \"Children must be taught to pray, to rely on the Lord for guidance, and to express appreciation forthe blessings that are theirs. I recall kneeling at thebedsides of our young children, helping them withtheir prayers. \"Children must be taught right from wrong. They can and must learn the commandments of God.They must be taught that it is wrong to steal, lie,cheat, or covet what others have. \"Children must be taught to work at home. They should learn there that honest labor develops dignityand self-respect. They should learn the pleasure ofwork, of doing a job well. \"The leisure time of children must be constructively directed to wholesome, positive pursuits. Too muchtime viewing television can be destructive, andpornography in this medium should not be tolerated.It is estimated that growing children today watchtelevision over twenty-five hours per week. \"Communities have a responsibility to assist the family in promoting wholesome entertainment.What a community tolerates will become tomorrow'sstandard for today's youth. \"Families must spend more time together in work and recreation. Family home evenings should bescheduled once a week as a time for recreation, workprojects, skits, songs around the piano, games, specialrefreshments, and family prayers. Like iron links ina chain, this practice will bind a family together, inlove, pride, tradition, strength, and loyalty. \"Family study of the scriptures should be the practice in our homes each Sabbath day. \"Daily devotionals are also a commendable practice, where scripture reading, singing of hymns, andfamily prayer are a part of our daily routine. \". . . Parents must prepare their children for the ordinances of the gospel. ... \"'The home is what needs reforming.

Elder Orson F. Whitney \"The Prophet Joseph Smith declared\u2014and he never taught more comforting doctrine\u2014that the eternalsealings of faithful parents and the divine promisesmade to them for valiant service in the Cause ofTruth, would save not only themselves, but likewisetheir posterity.

Either in this life or the lifeto come, they will return. They will have to pay theirdebt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; andmay tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last,like the penitent Prodigal, to a loving and forgivingfather's heart and home, the painful experience willnot have been in vain. Pray for your careless anddisobedient children; hold on to them with yourfaith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 110). Elder Howard W. Hunter \"A successful parent is one who has loved, one who has sacrificed, and one who has cared for, taught,and ministered to the needs of a child. If you havedone all of these and your child is still wayward ortroublesome or worldly, it could well be that youare, nevertheless, a successful parent. Perhaps thereare children who have come into the world thatwould challenge any set of parents under any set ofcircumstances. Likewise, perhaps there are otherswho would bless the lives of, and be a joy to, almostany father or mother\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1983, 94; or Ensign, Nov. 1983, 65). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Obviously, family values mirror our personal priorities. Given the gravity of current conditions,would parents be willing to give up just one outsidething, giving that time and talent instead to thefamily? Parents and grandparents, please scrutinizeyour schedules and priorities in order to ensure thatlife's prime relationships get more prime time!

The Presidencywrote: 'If the Saints obey this counsel, we promisethat great blessings will result. Love at home andobedience to parents will increase. Faith will bedeveloped in the hearts of the youth of Israel, andthey will gain power to combat the evil influenceand temptations which beset them.' \"President David O. McKay gave the same promise in 1965 and added that the youth will gain power'to choose righteousness and peace, and be assuredan eternal place in the family circle of our Father.'In 1976 the Presidency reaffirmed that 'regularparticipation in family home evening will developincreased personal worth, family unity, love for ourfellowmen, and trust in our Father in heaven.'\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1993, 86-87; or Ensign,May 1993, 70-71). Elder Joe J. Christensen \"Hold family home evenings every week without fail. This is a wonderful time to share your testimony with your children. Give them an opportunity to sharetheir feelings about the gospel. Help them learn torecognize when they feel the presence of the Spirit.Family home evenings will help create an island ofrefuge and security within your own home\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1993, 14; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 12). Family Council Processes President Spencer W. Kimball \"We also said last year that we have paused on some plateaus long enough, and then we gave an emphasisto councils\u2014family councils, ward and stake councils,and on through to area and Churchwide councils.\"If you continue to observe carefully, you will see how all these developments are pointing us in onedirection. As a people, we are being positioned todo more perfectly that which the Lord has given usto do\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1980, 5; orEnsign, May 1980, 4). \"Think of the learning that accompanies a familycouncil on the family budget. How do Mom andDad feel when a teenage son who, because he isincluded and understands the budgeting process,volunteers part of his summer's income to helpreplace that tired refrigerator?\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1977, 125; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, 78). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Every family has problems and challenges. But successful families try to work together towardsolutions instead of resorting to criticism andcontention. They pray for each other, discuss, andgive encouragement. Occasionally these families fasttogether in support of one of the family members. \"Strong families support each other.\"Successful families do things together: family projects, work, vacations, recreation, and reunions. \"Successful parents have found that it is not easy to rear children in an environment polluted with evil.Therefore, they take deliberate steps to provide thebest of wholesome influences. Moral principles aretaught. Good books are made available and read.Television watching is controlled. Good and upliftingmusic is provided. But most importantly, thescriptures are read and discussed as a means to helpdevelop spiritual-mindedness\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1984, 6-7; or Ensign, May 1984, 6). \"I mention family councils because of our persistentemphasis on family unity and family solidarity. Byencouraging parents to hold family councils, weimitate in our homes a heavenly pattern\" (inConference Report, Mar.-Apr. 1979, 124; or Ensign, May 1979, 88). President Stephen L. Richards \"The genius of our Church government is government through councils. . . . I have had enough experience to know the value of councils. Hardly a day passesbut that I see the wisdom, God's wisdom, in creatingcouncils: to govern his Kingdom\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1953, 86). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 244Elder L. Tom Perry \"I would make the family home evening times on Monday night a family council meeting wherechildren were taught by parents how to prepare fortheir roles as family members and prospective parents.Family home evening would begin with a familydinner together, followed by a council meeting,where such topics as the following would be discussedand training would be given: temple preparation,missionary preparation, home management, familyfinances, career development, education, communityinvolvement, cultural improvement, acquisitionand care of real and personal property, familyplanning calendars, use of leisure time, and workassignments. The evening could then be climaxedwith a special dessert and time for parents to haveindividual meetings with each child\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1980, 8-9; or Ensign, Nov. 1980, 9). \"Each family organization should include a familycouncil comprised of all members of the familyunit. Here the basic responsibilities of the familyorganization can be taught to the children. They canlearn how to make decisions and act upon thosedecisions. Too many are growing to marriageable ageunprepared for this responsibility. Work ethics andself-preparedness can be taught in a most effectiveway in a family council. President J. Reuben Clark, Jr.,has paraphrased an old statement. '\"All work andno play makes Jack a dull boy,\"' he would say. 'Butall play and no work makes Jack a useless boy.' (Asquoted by Harold B. Lee, 'Administering TrueCharity,' address delivered at the welfare agriculturalmeeting, 5 Oct. 1968)\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1981, 119; or Ensign, May 1981, 88). See quotation on page 99. Elder M. Russell Ballard \"Let us remember that the basic council of the Church is the family council.Fathers and mothers should applydiligently the principles I have discussedin their relationships with each otherand with their children. As we do so,our homes can become a heaven onearth\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1994, 34; or Ensign, May 1994, 26).Elder Ronald E. Poelman \"Unity in temporal matters, as in spiritual matters, is essential to our success. At each step, consensus of thecouncil members must be obtained, through prayerand discussion, to achieve that unity which isprerequisite to the Lord's help. To be effective,decisions must be reached by divine consensus, notby compromise. Participants are not competingadvocates, representing special interests, but rathercontributing members of a unified body\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1980, 126; or Ensign, May 1980, 91). Good Marriages Bless Children President Howard W. Hunter \"You should express regularly to your wife and children your reverence and respect for her. Indeed,one of the greatest things a father can do for hischildren is to love their mother\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 68; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 50). Elder Delbert L. Stapley \"If parents are immature and cannot settle their differences without anger, fighting, and name-calling,a child becomes most insecure, and as he growsolder he is apt to take up with the wrong type offriends just to get away from an unhappy homeenvironment\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1970, 45). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"Often parents communicate most effectively with their children by the way they listen to and addresseach other. Their conversations showing gentlenessand love are heard by our ever-alert, impressionablechildren\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1976, 81; orEnsign, May 1976, 53). Elder LeGrand R. Curtis \"Perhaps the best gift parents can give their children is to love each other, toenjoy each other, and even to holdhands and demonstrate their love bythe manner in which they talk to eachother\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1990, 13; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 12). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 245 Perhaps the best gift parents can give their children is to love each other.Bishop Robert D. Hales \"It helps children to see that good parents can have differing opinions and that these differences can beworked out without striking, yelling, or throwingthings. They need to see and feel calm communica-tion with respect for each other's viewpoints sothey themselves will know how to work throughdifferences in their own lives\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1993, 10; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 9). Parenting: An Eternal Perspective President Spencer W. Kimball \"From the beginning, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has emphasized family life. Wehave always understood that the foundations of thefamily, as an eternal unit, were laid even before thisearth was created! Society without basic family lifeis without foundation and will disintegrate intonothingness\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1980, 3;or Ensign, Nov. 1980, 4). President Howard W. Hunter \"The prophets of the past have spoken also of those who may not have opportunity to marry in this life.President Lorenzo Snow said: \"'There is no Latter-day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because ofhaving failed to do certain things when opportunitieswere not furnished him or her. In other words, if ayoung man or a young woman has no opportunityof getting married, and they live faithful lives up tothe time of their death, they will have all theblessings, exaltation, and glory that any man orwoman will have who had this opportunity andimproved it. That is sure and positive' ( The Teachings of Lorenzo Snow, comp. Clyde J. Williams [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1984], p. 138). \"I believe President Snow's statement to be true\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 67; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 49-50). President Boyd K. Packer \"Although our thoughts are centered in this sacred and solemn assembly on the noble titles High Priest,President, Apostle, Prophet, Seer, Revelator, theheavens are not offended if we at once speak offather, mother, child, brother, sister, family\u2014evendad, mom, grandma, grandpa, baby.\"If you are reverent and prayerful and obedient, theday will come when there will be revealed to you whythe God of heaven has commanded us to addresshim as Father, and the Lord of the Universe as Son. Then you will have discovered the pearl of greatprice spoken of in the scriptures and willingly goand sell all that you have that you might obtain it. \"The great plan of happiness (see Alma 42:8, 16) revealed to prophets is the plan for a happy family.It is the love story between husband and wife,parents and children, that renews itself through theages\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 8-9; orEnsign, May 1995, 9). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"'Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to be assumed by mankind. It placesher who honors its holy calling and service next tothe angels' [in Conference Report, Oct. 1942, pp.12-13]. \"That message and warning from the First Presidency is needed more, not less, today than when it wasgiven. And no voice from any organization of theChurch on any level of administration equals thatof the First Presidency\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1993, 30; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 23). \"When one knows the gospel of Jesus Christ, thereis cause to rejoice. The words joyand rejoice appear through the scriptures repetitively. Latter-day Saintsare happy people. When one knows the doctrine,parenthood becomes a sacred obligation, thebegetting of life a sacred privilege. Abortion wouldbe unthinkable. No one would think of suicide.And all the frailties and problems of men wouldfade away\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1983, 23; or Ensign, Nov. 1983, 18). Elder Bruce R. McConkie \"It follows that everything we have in the Church centers around celestial marriage, and that salvationis a family affair .... \". . . Thus the family unit is the most importantorganization in time or in eternity. \"And thus we should have more interest in and concern for our families than for anything else in life. \"Every major decision should be made on the basis of the effect it will have on the family unit. Our ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 246courtship, schooling, and choice of friends; our employment, hobbies, and place of residence; oursocial life, the organizations we join, and the servicewe render mankind; and above all, our obedience orthe lack of it to the standards of revealed truth\u2014allthese things should be decided on the basis of theireffect on the family unit. \"There is nothing in this world as important as the creation and perfection of family units of the kindcontemplated in the gospel of Jesus Christ\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1970, 27). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"I stand in awe when I consider the great confidence Heavenly Father has placed in you and me when heallows us the privilege of being the mortal fathersand mothers to his eternal spirit offspring. We mustnever forget that he has a vested interest in everyone of us, and we must realize how important eachhuman soul is in God's eternal plan. When weunderstand the importance of each soul, we can gobefore him confidently in prayer to seek his guidanceand direction in our sacred assignment as parents.He said, 'This is my work and my glory\u2014to bring topass the immortality and eternal life of man' (Moses1:39). This seems to me to best sum up the importantrole that mortal parents have in the great eternalplan of life for each member of our families\" (inConference Report, Sept.-Oct. 1978, 99; or Ensign,Nov. 1978, 66). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland \"I am deeply moved that God finds His ultimate purpose and meaning in being a parent\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1997, 47; or Ensign, May 1997, 36). Elder J. Richard Clarke \"Throughout the ages, evil forces have attacked the family. Why do you suppose Satan is so obsessedwith its dissolution? Because it stands for everythinghe wants and cannot have. He cannot be a husband,a father, or a grandfather. He cannot have posteritynow or ever. Satan cannot even keep those he hasled away from God. He has no eternal kingdom orinheritance\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 74;or Ensign, May 1989, 60).The Joy of Parenthood President Spencer W. Kimball \"We agree with Pestalozzi:\"'Our home joys are the most delightful earth affords, and the joy of parents in their children is the mostholy joy of humanity. It makes their hearts pureand good. It lifts them up to their Father in Heaven.' \"You and I well understand that this great, superior joy lies well within the realm of every set of parents,if they have properly performed their marriage andtheir family responsibilities and if high ideals ofmarriage and family life have prevailed\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1976, 159; or Ensign, May 1976, 108). President N. Eldon Tanner \"I can think of nothing sweeter than a home where a man is living his religion, magnifying hispriesthood, with his wife supporting him in everyway, where love and harmony exists, and wheretogether they are trying to raise a family of righteoussons and daughters whom they can take back intothe presence of their Heavenly Father. This maysound like an impossible dream, but I can assure youthat there are thousands of such families within theChurch, and it is something that can be a reality forevery one of us as we accept and live the teachingsof Jesus Christ. How fortunate a child is to live insuch a home, and how great will be the joy of theparents in their posterity!\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1973, 127; or Ensign, Jan. 1974, 10). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The ultimate end of all activity in the Church is that a man and his wife and their children can behappy at home and that the family can continuethrough eternity. All Christian doctrine is formulatedto protect the individual, the home, and thefamily\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 17; orEnsign, May 1981, 15). Elder James E. Faust \"While few human challenges are greater than that of being good parents, few opportunities offer greaterpotential for joy. Surely no more important work isto be done in this world than preparing our childrento be God-fearing, happy, honorable, and productive.Parents will find no more fulfilling happiness than to ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 247have their children honor them and their teachings. It is the glory of parenthood. John testified, 'I haveno greater joy than to hear that my children walkin truth' (3 John 1:4)\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1990, 40; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 32-33). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"The commandment to honor our parents echoes the sacred spirit of family relationships in which\u2014at their best\u2014we have sublime expressions ofheavenly love and care for one another. We sensethe importance of these relationships when werealize that our greatest expressions of joy or painin mortality come from the members of ourfamilies\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1991, 17; or Ensign, May 1991, 15). Teaching Children the Gospel President Ezra Taft Benson \"These promises\u2014increased love and harmony in the home, greater respect between parent and child,increased spirituality and righteousness\u2014are notidle promises, but exactly what the Prophet JosephSmith meant when he said the Book of Mormonwill help us draw nearer to God\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1986, 6; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 7). \"We have not been using the Book of Mormon as weshould. Our homes are not as strong unless we areusing it to bring our children to Christ\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1975, 96; or Ensign, May 1975, 65). \"We encourage parents to teach their children fundamental spiritual principles that will instillfaith in God\" (\"Righteousness Exalteth a Nation,\" 5). \"What should we teach? The Lord has revealed the specific curriculum that parents should teach. HearHis words: 'Teach . . . unto your children, that allmen, everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowiseinherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing candwell there, or dwell in his presence.' (Moses 6:57.) \"As further noted in this revelation, the fundamental doctrines consist of the doctrine of theFall, the mission of Christ and His atonement, andthe first principles and ordinances of the gospel,which include faith in Christ, repentance, baptismfor the remission of sins, and the gift of the HolyGhost as the means to a sanctified life (see Moses6:58-59)\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1981, 48; or Ensign, May 1981, 36). President N. Eldon Tanner \"Parents also should teach their children early in life the glorious concept and fact that they are spiritchildren of God, and that choosing to follow theteachings of Jesus Christ is the only way to enjoysuccess and happiness here and eternal life hereafter.They must be taught that Satan is real and that hewill use all agencies at his disposal to tempt themto do wrong, to lead them astray, make them hiscaptives, and keep them from the supreme happinessand exaltation they could otherwise enjoy\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1973, 58; or Ensign, July 1973, 8). President Marion G. Romney \"There is another reason why we should read the Book of Mormon: By doing so we will fill and refreshour minds with a constant flow of that 'water' whichJesus said would be in us 'a well of water springingup into everlasting life' (John 4:14). We must obtaina continuing supply of this water if we are to resistevil and retain the blessings of being born again. . . . \"I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly,both by themselves and with their children, the spiritof that great book will come to permeate our homesand all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverencewill increase; mutual respect and consideration foreach other will grow. The spirit of contention willdepart. Parents will counsel their children in greaterlove and wisdom. Children will be more responsiveand submissive to the counsel of their parents.Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, andcharity\u2014the pure love of Christ\u2014will abound inour homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace,joy, and happiness\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1980, 88, 90; or Ensign, May 1980, 66-67). Elder Mark E. Petersen \"What will parents barter for the souls of their little children, these tiny ones who are given into theircare by the Almighty himself, to whom they shouldteach the principles of righteousness, and whomthese parents should lead into the proper pathwaysof life?\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1973, 142; or Ensign, Jan. 1974, 111). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 248Elder L. Tom Perry \"At the time I was a new parent, President David O. McKay presided over the Church. His counsel wasclear and direct regarding our responsibilities to ourchildren. He taught us the most precious gift a manand woman can receive is a child of God, and thatthe raising of a child is basically, fundamentally,and most exclusively a spiritual process. \"He directed us to basic principles we need to teachour children. The first and most important innerquality you can instill in a child is faith in God. The first and most important action a child can learn is obedience. And the most powerful tool you have with which to teach a child is love. (See Instructor, Dec. 1949, p. 620)\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1983, 106; or Ensign, May 1983, 78). Elder David B. Haight \"We are to teach and train our children in the ways of the Lord. Children should not be left to their owndevices in learning character and family values, orin listening to and watching unsupervised music ortelevision or movies as a means of gaining knowledgeand understanding as to how to live their lives! \"The Lord has clearly commanded that parents are to teach their children to do good (see Alma 39:12)and to teach them 'the doctrine of repentance, faithin Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptismand the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on ofthe hands, when eight years old, [or] the sin [shall]be upon the heads of the parents. . . .'\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1992, 105; 1992, 75-76). Elder James E. Faust \"A principal purpose for discipline is to teach obedi- ence. President David O. McKay stated: 'Parents whofail to teach obedience to their children, if [their]homes do not develop obedience society will demandit and get it. It is therefore better for the home,with its kindliness, sympathy and understanding, totrain the child in obedience rather than callously toleave him to the brutal and unsympathetic disciplinethat society will impose if the home has not alreadyfulfilled its obligation' ( The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children, p. 3)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 41-42; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 34).Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"They are to teach and guide their children 'by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness andmeekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, . . .reproving betimes with sharpness, when movedupon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forthafterwards an increase of love' (D&C 121:41-43).Parents then will earn the respect of their children,and children will honor their parents, unifyingfamilies\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1993, 87-88;or Ensign, May 1993, 71). Elder H. Verlan Andersen \"Although the Lord chastised the leading brethren, and indeed all parents in Zion, for parentaldelinquency, he indicated that repentance is possible.But he also said that if we did not repent, we wouldbe removed out of our place. (See D&C 93:41-50.) \"Not only do the scriptures instruct us on when teaching is best done (see D&C 68:25-32;Deuteronomy 8:5-9) but also on what should andshould not be taught (see Moroni 7:14-19; 2 Nephi9:28-29) and who should and should theteaching (see 2 Nephi 28:14, 31; Mosiah 23:14)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1991, or Ensign,Nov. 1991, 81). Bishop Robert D. Hales \"My father taught me respect for the priesthood. While serving in the Aaronic Priesthood, we passedthe sacrament using stainless steel sacrament trayswhich, as a result of spilled water, were often dulledwith hard water spots. As a holder of the AaronicPriesthood, I was responsible for helping preparethe sacrament. Father asked me to bring home thetrays, and together we cleaned them with steel wooluntil every tray sparkled. When I passed thesacrament, I knew we had participated in makingthe sacrament ordinance a little more sacred. . . . \"I learned respect for womanhood from my father's tender caring for my mother, my sister, and hissisters. Father was the first to arise from dinner toclear the table. My sister and I would wash and drythe dishes each night at Father's request. If we werenot there, Father and Mother would clean the kitchentogether\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 9; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 9). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 249Teaching Children to Work Doctrine and Covenants 68:31-32 \"Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers amongthem; and their children are also growing up inwickedness; they also seek not earnestly the richesof eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness. \"These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them; wherefore, let my servantOliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the land of Zion.\" President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Work together. I do not know how many generations or centuries ago someone first said, 'An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' Children need to work withtheir parents, to wash dishes with them, to mopfloors with them, to mow lawns, to prune trees\"(\"Four Simple Things to Help Our Families and OurNations,\" Ensign, Sept. 1996, 7). The Family: A Proclamation to the World \"Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer,repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion,work\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread' is not outdated counsel. It is basic to personal welfare.One of the greatest favors parents can do for theirchildren is to teach them to work. Much has beensaid over the years about children and monthlyallowances, and opinions and recommendationsvary greatly. I'm from the 'old school.' I believechildren should earn their money needs throughservice and appropriate chores. Some financialrewards to children may also be tied to educationaleffort and the accomplishment of other worthwhilegoals. I think it is unfortunate for a child to growup in a home where the seed is planted in thechild's mind that there is a family money tree thatautomatically drops 'green stuff' once a week oronce a month\" (One for the Money, 8). Elder James E. Faust \"An essential part of teaching children to be disciplined and responsible is to have them learn towork. As we grow up, many of us are like the manwho said, 'I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit andlook at it for hours' (Jerome Klapka Jerome, in The International Dictionary of Thoughts, comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, and Thomas C. Jones[Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969],p. 782). Again, the best teachers of the principle of work are the parents themselves. For me, workbecame a joy when I first worked alongside myfather, grandfather, uncles, and brothers. I am surethat I was often more of an aggravation than a help,but the memories are sweet and the lessons learnedare valuable. Children need to learn responsibilityand independence. Are the parents personally takingthe time to show and demonstrate and explain sothat children can, as Lehi taught, 'act for Oct. 1990, 42; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 34). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"The remarks of President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., given fifty-six years ago, are instructive today. He said: 'Itis the eternal, inescapable law that growth comesonly from work and preparation, whether the growthbe material, mental, or spiritual. Work has nosubstitute' (in Conference Report, Apr. 1933, p. 103).More recently, Elder Howard W. Hunter counseled:'The first recorded instruction given to Adam afterthe Fall dealt with the eternal principle of work.The Lord said: \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thoueat bread.\" (Gen. 3:19.) Our Heavenly Father lovesus so completely that he has given us acommandment to work. This is one of the keys to eternal life. He knows that we will learn more, grow more, achieve more, serve more, and benefit morefrom a life of industry than from a life of ease'(Ensign, Nov. 1975, p. 122)\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 9; or Ensign, May 1989, 8). Elder Joe J. Christensen \"Teach your children to work and to take responsibility . Especially in urban settings, too many children are growing up in an environment where they do nothave enough to do. They are like the youngthirteen-year-old boy who was asked what he did all day in the summer. \"He said, 'Well, I get up in the morning about ten or eleven. Then my mom gets me something to eat.Then maybe I'll go with some of the guys and play ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 250a little basketball, maybe watch TV , and then go down to the mall and \"hang out\" for a while\u2014sortawatch the girls and stuff.' . \"I like what President Spencer W. Kimball has said on this topic: \"'We want you parents to create work for your children'\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 13; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 12). A Father's Duty President Howard W. Hunter See \"Being a Righteous Husband and Father\" on pages 206-9. Elder James E. Faust \"I hasten to acknowledge that there are too many husbands and fathers whoare abusive to their wives and childrenand from whom the wives and childrenneed protection. Yet modernsociological studies powerfully reaffirmthe essential influence of a caring father in the life of a child\u2014boy or girl. In the past twentyyears, as homes and families have struggled to stay intact, sociological studies reveal this alarming fact: much of the crime and many of the behavioraldisorders in the United States come from homeswhere the father has abandoned the children. Inmany societies the world over, child poverty, crime,drug abuse, and family decay can be traced toconditions where the father gives no male nurturing.Sociologically it is now painfully apparent thatfathers are not optional family baggage. \"We need to honor the position of the father as the primary provider for physical and spiritual support.I state this with no reluctance because the Lord hasrevealed that this obligation is placed upon husbands.'Women have claim on their husbands for theirmaintenance, until their husbands are taken' (D&C83:2). Further, 'All children have claim upon theirparents for their maintenance until they are of age'(D&C 83:4). In addition, their spiritual welfareshould be 'brought to pass by the faith and covenantof their fathers' (D&C 84:99). As regards little children,the Lord has promised that 'great things may berequired at the hands of their fathers' (D&C 29:48). \"It is useless to debate which parent is most important. No one would doubt that a mother'sinfluence is paramount with newborns and in thefirst years of a child's life. The father's influenceincreases as the child grows older. However, eachparent is necessary at various times in a child'sdevelopment. Both fathers and mothers do manyintrinsically different things for their children. Bothmothers and fathers are equipped to nurture children,but their approaches are different. Mothers seem totake a dominant role in preparing children to livewithin their families, present and future. Fathersseem best equipped to prepare children to functionin the environment outside the family. \"One authority states: 'Studies showthat fathers have a special role to playin building a child's self-respect.

He continues: 'Research alsoshows that are critical inestablishment of gender in children.Interestingly, fatherly involvementproduces stronger sexual identity and character in both boys and girls. It is wellestablished that the masculinity of sons and thefemininity of daughters are each greater whenfathers are active in family life' (Karl Zinsmeister,\"Do Children Need Fathers?\" Crisis, Oct. 1992). \"Parents in any marital situation have a duty to setaside personal differences and encourage each other'srighteous influence in the lives of their children. . . . \"Perhaps we regard the power bestowed by Elijah as something associated only with formal ordinancesperformed in sacred places. But these ordinancesbecome dynamic and productive of good only asthey reveal themselves in our daily lives.

This sealing powerthus reveals itself in family relationships, in attributesand virtues developed in a nurturing environment,and in loving service. These are the cords that bindfamilies together, and the priesthood advances theirdevelopment. In imperceptible but real ways, the'doctrine of the priesthood shall distill upon thysoul as the dews from heaven'(D&C 121:45). \"I so testify that the blessings of the priesthood, honored by fathers and husbands and revered by ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 251 Both mothers and fathers are equipped to nurture children, but their approaches are different.wives and children, can indeed cure the cancer that plagues our society.

Tenorio \"In ancient times a fortress required regular inspections to ensure that no weak spots developedthat an enemy could take advantage of, and guardsin the watchtowers ensured that no enemy couldapproach undetected. In other words, once a citywas fortified, a constant effort was made to maintainthe fortress so that it could serve its purpose. \"By establishing a security system of our own, we can prevent the enemy from finding and exploitingweaknesses in our family fortress through which hecould gain access to, and harm, our most precioustreasure, our family. \"One of the watchtowers on our fortress can be the regular habit of a father's interview with each memberof his family. Personal interviews are an importantresource in maintaining the integrity of our fortress.Through them we become better acquainted withour children, learn about their problems andconcerns, and establish open communication andtrust that will enable us to foresee any danger, helpthem make decisions, and support them duringdifficult times. Our Heavenly Father has given us asparents the stewardship of caring for and protectingour families. It is a responsibility that we cannotand must not delegate. \"In Doctrine and Covenants section 93, verses 39 and 40, it says: \"'And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from thechildren of men, and because of the tradition oftheir fathers. \"'But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.' \"A loving interview guided by the Spirit can give direction to our children's lives, bring aboutnecessary adjustments or changes, and may evenresult in miracles\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1994, 29-30; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 23-24).A Mother's Duty President David O. McKay \"Motherhood consists of three principal attributes or qualities: namely, (1) the power to bear, (2) theability to rear, (3) the gift to love. . . . \"This ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing toexpress it in soul development, make motherhoodthe noblest office or calling in the world\" ( Gospel Ideals, 453).

Why is it that the children we love become so frequently the targetsof our harsh words? Why is it that these childrenwho love their fathers and mothers sometimes speakas if with daggers that cut to the quick?

Faust \"To have successful homes, values must be taught, and there must be rules, there must be standards, andthere must be absolutes.

I do not know who is wiseenough to say what discipline is too harsh or what ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 252is too lenient except the parents of the children themselves, who love them most. It is a matter ofprayerful discernment for the parents. Certainly theoverarching and undergirding principle is that thediscipline of children must be motivated more bylove than by punishment. . . . Direction anddiscipline are, however, certainly an indispensablepart of child rearing.

Without discipline,children will not respect either the rules of thehome or of society\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1990, 40-41; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 32-34). Elder Ben B. Banks \"Discipline with love. '\"Discipline\" and \"punishment\" are not synonymous. Punishment suggests hurting, paying someone back for a wrong committed.Discipline implies an action directed toward a goal. . . of helping the recipient to improve himself'(William E. Homan, 'How to Be a Better Parent,'Reader's Digest, Oct. 1969, p. 188). Discipline should always be with love\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1993, 40; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 29). Personal Righteousness Prepares Parents President Brigham Young \"No man can ever become a ruler in the Kingdom of God, until he can perfectly rule himself; then ishe capable of raising a family of children who willrise up and call him blessed\" (Discourses of BrighamYoung, 265). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Setting your home in order is keeping the command- ments of God. This brings harmony and love in the home between you and your companion and betweenyou and your children. It is daily family prayer. It isteaching your family to understand the gospel of JesusChrist. It is each family member keeping thecommandments of God. It is you and yourcompanion being worthy to receive a templerecommend, all family members receiving the ordinances of exaltation, and your family beingsealed together for eternity. It is being free fromexcessive debt, with family members paying honesttithes and offerings\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1981, 48-49; or Ensign, May 1981, 36).President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Pray together. Is prayer such a difficult thing?

Packer \"Parents, can we first consider the most painful part of your problem? If you want to reclaim your sonor daughter, why don't you leave off trying to alteryour child just for a little while and concentrate onyourself. The changes must begin with you, notwith your children. \"You can't continue to do what you have been doing (even though you thought it was right) and expect tounproduce some behavior in your child, when yourconduct was one of the things that produced it. \"There! It's been said! After all the evading, all the concern for wayward children. After all the blamingof others, the care to be gentle with parents. It's out! \"It's you, not the child, that needs immediate attention. \"Now parents, there is substantial help for you if you will accept it. I add with emphasis that thehelp we propose is not easy, for the measures areequal to the seriousness of your problem. There isno patent medicine to effect an immediate cure. \"And parents, if you seek for a cure that ignores faith and religious doctrine, you look for a curewhere it never will be found. When we talk ofreligious principles and doctrines and quotescripture, interesting, isn't it, how many don't feelcomfortable with talk like that. But when we talk ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 253about your problems with your family and offer a solution, then your interest is intense. \"Know that you can't talk about one without talking about the other, and expect to solve your problems.Once parents know that there is a God and that weare his children, they can face problems like thisand win. \"If you are helpless, he is not.\"If you are lost, he is not.\"If you don't know what to do next, he knows.\"It would take a miracle, you say?\"Well, if it takes a miracle, why not\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1970, 119-20). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Small equivocations in parents can produce large deviations in their children!\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1992, 89; or Ensign, Nov. 1992, 66). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"Modern revelation commands parents to 'teach their children to pray' (D&C 68:28). This requiresparents to learn and pray with the special languageof prayer. We learn our native language simply bylistening to those who speak it. This is also true ofthe language with which we address our HeavenlyFather. The language of prayer is easier and sweeterto learn than any other tongue. We should give ourchildren the privilege of learning this language bylistening to their parents use it in the variousprayers offered daily in our homes\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1993, 20; or Ensign, May 1993, 18). Spending Time with Children President Howard W. Hunter \"Effective family leadership, brethren, requires both quantity and quality time. The teaching andgovernance of the family must not be left to yourwife alone, to society, to school, or even to theChurch\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 68; orEnsign, Nov. 1994, 50). President Thomas S. Monson \"So frequently we mistakenly believe that our children need more things, when in reality theirsilent pleadings are simply for more of our time.The accumulation of wealth or the multiplication of assets belies the Master's teaching:\"'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,where moth and rust doth corrupt, and wherethieves break through and steal: \"'But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thievesdo not break through nor steal.'\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1994, 80; or Ensign, May 1994, 62).

Elder L. Tom Perry \"There are two areas I would determine to improve if that privilege were granted to me to have youngchildren in our home once again. \"The first would be to spend more time as husband and wife in a family executive committee meetinglearning, communicating, planning, and organizingto better fulfill our roles as parents. \"The second wish I would like, if I could have those years over, would be to spend more family time\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1994, 49; or Ensign, May 1994, 37). \"Build traditions in your families that will bring you together, for they can demonstrate your devotion,love, and support for one another.

THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN THE WORLD\u2014GOOD PARENTING Elder James E. Faust Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 39-43; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 32-35 Being a Parent Is a Divine Calling My beloved brothers and sisters and friends, I askfor your faith and prayers this afternoon as I feelmoved upon to discuss a subject which I havechosen to call the greatest challenge in the world. It has to do with the privilege andresponsibility of being good parents.On this subject there are about asmany opinions as there are parents, yet there are few who claim to have all ofthe answers. I am certainly not one of them. I feel that there are more outstanding young men and women among our people at present than atany other moment in my lifetime. This presupposesthat most of these fine young people have comefrom good homes and have committed, caringparents. Even so, the most conscientious parentsfeel that they may have made some mistakes. Onetime, when I did a thoughtless thing, I remembermy own mother exclaiming, \"Where did I fail?\" The Lord has directed, \"Bring up your children in light and truth\" (D&C 93:40). To me, there is nomore important human effort. Being a father or a mother is not only a great challenge, it is a divine calling. It is an effortrequiring consecration. President David O. McKaystated that being parents is \"the greatest trust thathas been given to human beings\" (The Responsibilityof Parents to Their Children [pamphlet, n.d.], p. 1). Creating Successful Homes While few human challenges are greater than thatof being good parents, few opportunities offergreater potential for joy. Surely no more importantwork is to be done in this world than preparing ourchildren to be God-fearing, happy, honorable, andproductive. Parents will find no more fulfillinghappiness than to have their children honor themand their teachings. It is the glory of parenthood.John testified, \"I have no greater joy than to hearthat my children walk in truth\" (3 John 1:4). In my opinion, the teaching, rearing, and training of children requires more intelligence, intuitiveunderstanding, humility, strength, wisdom,spirituality, perseverance, and hard work than anyother challenge we might have in life. This isespecially so when moral foundations of honor anddecency are eroding around us. To have successfulhomes, values must be taught, and there must berules, there must be standards, and there must beabsolutes. Many societies give parents very littlesupport in teaching and honoring moral values. A number of cultures are becoming essentiallyvalueless, and many of the younger people in those societies are becoming moral cynics. As societies as a whole have decayed and lost their moral identity and somany homes are broken, the best hope is to turn greater attention andeffort to the teaching of the next generation\u2014our children. In order to do this, wemust first reinforce the primary teachers of children.Chief among these are the parents and other familymembers, and the best environment should be inthe home. Somehow, some way, we must try harderto make our homes str onger so that they will stand as sanctuaries against the unwholesome, pervasive moral dry rot around us. Harmony, happiness,peace, and love in the home can help give childrenthe required inner strength to cope with life'schallenges. Barbara Bush, wife of President GeorgeBush, a few months ago said to the graduates ofWellesley College: \"But whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: Fathers and mothers, ifyou have children, they must come first. You mustread to your children and you must hug your ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 255 To have successful homes, values must be taught.children and you must love your children. Your success as a family, our success as a society, dependsnot on what happens in the White House but onwhat happens inside your house\" ( Washington Post, 2 June 1990, p. 2). To be a good father and mother requires that the parents defer many of their own needs and desires infavor of the needs of their children. As a consequenceof this sacrifice, conscientious parents develop anobility of character and learn to put into practicethe selfless truths taught by the Savior Himself. I have the greatest respect for single parents who struggle and sacrifice, trying against almostsuperhuman odds to hold the family together. They should be honored and helped in their heroicefforts. But any mother's or father's task is mucheasier where there are two functioning parents inthe home. Children often challenge and tax thestrength and wisdom of both parents. . . . Parents Must Set the Example When parents try to teach their children to avoiddanger, it is no answer for parents to say to theirchildren, We are experienced and wise in the waysof the world, and we can get closer to the edge ofthe cliff than you. Parental hypocrisy can makechildren cynical and unbelieving of what they aretaught in the home. For instance, when parentsattend movies they forbid their children to see,parental credibility is diminished. If children areexpected to be honest, parents must be honest. Ifchildren are expected to be virtuous, parents mustbe virtuous. If you expect your children to behonorable, you must be honorable. Among the other values children should be taught are respect for others, beginning with the child'sown parents and family; respect for the symbols offaith and patriotic beliefs of others; respect for lawand order; respect for the property of others; respectfor authority. Paul reminds us that children should\"learn first to shew piety at home\" (1 Timothy 5:4). Disciplining Children One of the most difficult parental challenges is toappropriately discipline children. Child rearing is soindividualistic. Every child is different and unique.What works with one may not work with another. I do not know who is wise enough to say whatdiscipline is too harsh or what is too lenient exceptthe parents of the children themselves, who lovethem most. It is a matter of prayerful discernmentfor the parents. Certainly the overarching andundergirding principle is that the discipline ofchildren must be motivated more by love than bypunishment. Brigham Young counseled, \"If you areever called upon to chasten a person, never chastenbeyond the balm you have within you to bind up\"(in Journal of Discourses, 9:124-25). Direction and discipline are, however, certainly an indispensablepart of child rearing. If parents do not discipline theirchildren, then the public will discipline them in away the parents do not like. Without discipline,children will not respect either the rules of thehome or of society. A principal purpose for discipline is to teach obedience. President David O. McKay stated: \"Parentswho fail to teach obedience to their children, if[their] homes do not develop obedience society willdemand it and get it. It is therefore better for thehome, with its kindliness, sympathy andunderstanding to train the child in obediencerather than callously to leave him to the brutal andunsympathetic discipline that society will impose ifthe home has not already fulfilled its obligation\"(The Responsibility of Parents to Their Children, p. 3). Teaching Children to Work An essential part of teaching children to be disciplinedand responsible is to have them learn to work. As wegrow up, many of us are like the man who said, \"Ilike work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it forhours\" (Jerome Klapka Jerome, in The International Dictionary of Thoughts, comp. John P. Bradley, Leo F. Daniels, and Thomas C. Jones [Chicago: J. G.Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969], p. 782). Again, thebest teachers of the principle of work are the parentsthemselves. For me, work became a joy when I firstworked alongside my father, grandfather, uncles,and brothers. I am sure that I was often more of anaggravation than a help, but the memories aresweet and the lessons learned are valuable. Childrenneed to learn responsibility and independence. Arethe parents personally taking the time to show anddemonstrate and explain so that children can, asLehi taught, \"act for themselves the world's greatest horticulturists, said, \"If we had paid no moreattention to our plants than we have to our children, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 256we would now be living in a jungle of weeds\" (in Elbert Hubbard's Scrap Book [New York: Wm. H. Wise and Co., 1923], p. 227). Special Challenges for Parents Children are also beneficiaries of moral agency bywhich we are all afforded the opportunity to progress,grow, and develop. That agency also permits childrento pursue the alternate choice of selfishness,wastefulness, self-indulgence, and self-destruction.Children often express this agency when very young. Let parents who have been conscientious, loving, and concerned and who have lived the principles of righteousness as best they could be comforted inknowing that they are good parents despite theactions of some of their children. The childrenthemselves have a responsibility to listen, obey,and, having been taught, to learn. Parents cannotalways answer for all their children's misconductbecause they cannot ensure the children's goodbehavior. Some few children could tax evenSolomon's wisdom and Job's patience. There is often a special challenge for those parents who are affluent or overly indulgent. In a sense,some children in those circumstances hold theirparents hostage by withholding their support ofparental rules unless the parents acquiesce to thechildren's demands. Elder Neal A. Maxwell has said,\"Those who do too much for their children will soon find they can do nothing with their children. So many children have been so much done for they are almost done in\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1975, p. 150; or Ensign, May 1975, p. 101). It seems to be human nature that we do not fully appreciatematerial things we have not ourselves earned. There is a certain irony in the fact that some parents are so anxious for their children to be accepted byand be popular with their peers; yet these sameparents fear that their children may be doing thethings their peers are doing. Helping Children Internalize Values Generally, those children who make the decisionand have the resolve to abstain from drugs, alcohol,and illicit sex are those who have adopted andinternalized the strong values of their homes as livedby their parents. In times of difficult decisions theyare most likely to follow the teachings of their parentsrather than the example of their peers or thesophistries of the media which glamorize alcoholconsumption, illicit sex, infidelity, dishonesty, andother vices. They are like Helaman's two thousandyoung men who \"had been taught by their mothers,that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them\"from death (Alma 56:47). \"And they rehearsed . . .the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubtour mothers knew it\" (56:48). What seems to help cement parental teachings and values in place in children's lives is a firm belief inDeity. When this belief becomes part of their verysouls, they have inner strength. So, of all that isimportant to be taught, what should parents teach?The scriptures tell us that parents are to teach theirchildren \"faith in Christ the Son of the living God,and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost,\" and\"the doctrine of repentance\" (D&C 68:25). Thesetruths must be taught in the home. They cannot betaught in the public schools, nor will they be fosteredby the government or by society. Of course, Churchprograms can help, but the most effective teachingtakes place in the home. A Thousand Threads of Love Parental teaching moments need not be big ordramatic or powerful. We learn this from the MasterTeacher. Charles Henry Parkhurst said: \"The completed beauty of Christ's life is only the added beauty of little inconspicuous acts ofbeauty\u2014talking with the woman at the well; . . .showing the young ruler the stealthy ambition laidaway in his heart that kept him out of the kingdomof Heaven; . . . . . kindling a fire and broiling fishthat his disciples might have a breakfast waiting forthem when they came ashore from a night offishing, cold, tired, and discouraged. All of thesethings, you see, let us in so easily into the realquality and tone of [Christ's] interests, so specific,so narrowed down, so enlisted in what is small, soengrossed with what is minute\" (\"Kindness andLove,\" in Leaves of Gold [Honesdale, Pa.: Coslet Publishing Co., 1938], p. 177). And so it is with being parents. The little things are the big things sewn into the family tapestry by athousand threads of love, faith, discipline, sacrifice,patience, and work. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 257Children of the Covenant There are some great spiritual promises which may help faithful parents in this church. Children ofeternal sealings may have visited upon them thedivine promises made to their valiant forebears whonobly kept their covenants. Covenants rememberedby parents will be remembered by God. The childrenmay thus become the beneficiaries and inheritors ofthese great covenants and promises. This is becausethey are the children of the covenant (see Orson F.Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, pp.110-11).God bless the struggling, sacrificing, honorableparents of this world. May He especially honor thecovenants kept by faithful parents among our peopleand watch over these children of the covenant. I pray that this may be so in the sacred name ofJesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPARENTHOOD : C REATING A GOSPEL -CENTERED HOME 258PLAN OF SALVATION \"THE GREAT PLAN OF HAPPINESS\" Elder Dallin H. Oaks Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 96-102; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 72-75 Plan of Salvation a Road Map of Eternity Questions like, Where did we come from? Why arewe here? and Where are we going? are answered inthe gospel of Jesus Christ. Prophets have called it theplan of salvation and \"the great plan of happiness\"(Alma 42:8). Through inspiration we can understandthis road map of eternity and use it to guide ourpath in mortality. The gospel teaches us that we are the spirit children of heavenly parents. Before our mortal birth we had\"a pre-existent, spiritual personality, as the sons anddaughters of the Eternal Father\" (statement of theFirst Presidency, Improvement Era, Mar. 1912, p. 417; see also Jeremiah 1:5). We were placed here onearth to progress toward our destiny of eternal life.These truths give us a unique perspective anddifferent values to guide our decisions from thosewho doubt the existence of God and believe thatlife is the result of random processes. The Council in Heaven Our understanding of life begins with a council inheaven. There the spirit children of God were taughthis eternal plan for their destiny. We had progressedas far as we could without a physical body and anexperience in mortality. To realize a fulness of joy,we had to prove our willingness to keep thecommandments of God in a circumstance where wehad no memory of what preceded our mortal birth. In the course of mortality, we would become subject to death, and we would be soiled by sin. To reclaimus from death and sin, our Heavenly Father's planprovided us a Savior, whose atonement wouldredeem all from death and pay the price necessaryfor all to be cleansed from sin on the conditions heprescribed (see 2 Nephi 9:19-24). Satan had his own plan. He proposed to save all the spirit children of God, assuring that result byremoving their power to choose and thus eliminatingthe possibility of sin. When Satan's plan was rejected,he and the spirits who followed him opposed theFather's plan and were cast out. All of the myriads of mortals who have been born on this earth chose the Father's plan and fought forit. Many of us also made covenants with the Fatherconcerning what we would do in mortality. In waysthat have not been revealed, our actions in thespirit world influence us in mortality. Satan Seeks to Destroy God's Plan Although Satan and his followers have lost theiropportunity to have a physical body, they arepermitted to use their spirit powers to try to frustrateGod's plan. This provides the opposition necessaryto test how mortals will use their freedom to choose.Satan's most strenuous opposition is directed atwhatever is most important to the Father's plan.Satan seeks to discredit the Savior and divineauthority, to nullify the effects of the Atonement,to counterfeit revelation, to lead people away fromthe truth, to contradict individual accountability, to confuse gender, to undermine marriage, and todiscourage childbearing (especially by parents whowill raise children in righteousness). Gender, Marriage, and Childbearing Are Essential to the Plan Maleness and femaleness, marriage, and the bearing and nurturing of children are all essential to thegreat plan of happiness. Modern revelation makesclear that what we call gender was part of ourexistence prior to our birth. God declares that hecreated \"male and female\" E. Talmage explained:\"The distinction between male and female is no We who know God's plan for his children, we who have covenanted to participate, have a clear responsibility. \u2014Elder Dallin H. Oaks ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL259condition peculiar to the relatively brief period of mortal life; it was an essential characteristic of ourpre-existent condition\" ( Millennial Star, 24 Aug. 1922, p. 539). To the first man and woman on earth, the Lord said, \"Be fruitful, and multiply\" (Moses 2:28; Genesis 1:28;see also Abraham 4:28). This commandment was firstin sequence and first in importance. It was essentialthat God's spirit children have mortal birth and an opportunity to progress toward eternal life.Consequently, all things related to procreation areprime targets for the adversary's efforts to thwartthe plan of God. Necessity of the Fall When Adam and Eve received the first command-ment, they were in a transitional state, no longer inthe spirit world but with physical bodies not yetsubject to death and not yet capable of procreation.They could not fulfill the Father's first command-ment without transgressing the barrier between thebliss of the Garden of Eden and the terrible trialsand wonderful opportunities of mortal life. For reasons that have not been revealed, this transition, or \"fall,\" could not happen without atransgression\u2014an exercise of moral agency amountingto a willful breaking of a law (see Moses 6:59). Thiswould be a planned offense, a formality to serve aneternal purpose. The Prophet Lehi explained that \"if Adam had not transgressed he would not havefallen\" but would have remained in the same statein which he was created (2 Nephi 2:22). \"And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence,having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing nogood, for they knew no sin\" (v. 23). But the Fall was planned, Lehi concludes, because \"all things have been done in the wisdom of himwho knoweth all things\" (v. 24). Eve's Wisdom and Courage It was Eve who first transgressed the limits of Edenin order to initiate the conditions of mortality. Heract, whatever its nature, was formally a transgressionbut eternally a glorious necessity to open thedoorway toward eternal life. Adam showed hiswisdom by doing the same. And thus Eve and\"Adam fell that men might be\" (v. 25).Some Christians condemn Eve for her act, concludingthat she and her daughters are somehow flawed byit. Not the Latter-day Saints! Informed by revelation,we celebrate Eve's act and honor her wisdom andcourage in the great episode called the Fall (seeBruce R. McConkie, \"Eve and the Fall,\" Book Co., 1979], pp. 67-68).Joseph Smith taught that it was not a \"sin\" becauseGod had decreed it (see The Words of Joseph Smith, ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook [Provo: ReligiousStudies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980],p. 63). Brigham Young declared, \"We should neverblame Mother Eve, not the least\" (in Journal ofDiscourses, 13:145). Elder Joseph Fielding Smith said: \"I never speak of the part Eve took in this fall as a sin,nor do I accuse Adam of a sin. . . . This was atransgression of the law, but not a sin . . . for it wassomething that Adam and Eve had to do!\" (Doctrines of Salvation, comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954-56], 1:114-15). Contrast between Sin and Transgression This suggested contrast between a sinand a transgression reminds us of the careful wording in the second article of faith: \"We believe that men willbe punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression\" (italics added). It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some acts, like murder, arecrimes because they are inherently wrong. Otheracts, like operating without a license, are crimesonly because they are legally prohibited. Under thesedistinctions, the act that produced the Fall was nota sin\u2014inherently wrong\u2014but a transgression\u2014wrongbecause it was formally prohibited. These words arenot always used to denote something different, butthis distinction seems meaningful in thecircumstances of the Fall. First Parents Knew the Fall's Necessity Modern revelation shows that our first parentsunderstood the necessity of the Fall. Adam declared,\"Blessed be the name of God, for because of mytransgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall seeGod\" (Moses 5:10). Note the different perspective and the special wisdom of Eve, who focused on the purpose andeffect of the great plan of happiness: \"Were it notfor our transgression we never should have hadseed, and never should have known good and evil, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPLAN OF SALVATION 260and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient\" (Moses5:11). In his vision of the redemption of the dead,President Joseph F. Smith saw \"the great and mightyones\" assembled to meet the Son of God, and amongthem was \"our glorious Mother Eve\" (D&C 138:38-39). When we understand the plan of salvation, we also understand the purpose and effect of the command-ments God has given his children. He teaches uscorrect principles and invites us to govern ourselves.We do this by the choices we make in mortality. We live in a day when there are many political, legal, and social pressures for changes that confuse genderand homogenize the differences between men andwomen. Our eternal perspective sets us againstchanges that alter those separate duties and privilegesof men and women that are essential to accomplishthe great plan of happiness. We do not oppose allchanges in the treatment of men and women, sincesome changes in laws or customs simply correct oldwrongs that were never grounded in eternal principles. Use and Misuse of Creative Power The power to create mortal life is the most exaltedpower God has given his children. Its use wasmandated in the first commandment, but anotherimportant commandment was given to forbid itsmisuse. The emphasis we place on the law of chastityis explained by our understanding of the purpose ofour procreative powers in the accomplishment ofGod's plan. The expression of our procreative powers is pleasing to God, but he has commanded that this be confinedwithin the relationship of marriage. PresidentSpencer W. Kimball taught that \"in the context oflawful marriage, the intimacy of sexual relations isright and divinely approved. There is nothing unholyor degrading about sexuality in itself, for by thatmeans men and women join in a process of creationand in an expression of love\" (The Teachings ofSpencer W. Kimball, . . . p. 311). Outside the bonds of marriage, all uses of theprocreative power are to one degree or another asinful degrading and perversion of the most divineattribute of men and women. The Book of Mormonteaches that unchastity is \"most abominable aboveall sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood ordenying the Holy Ghost\" (Alma 39:5). In our ownday the First Presidency of the Church has declaredthe doctrine of this church \"that sexual sin\u2014the illicitsexual relations of men and women\u2014stands, in itsenormity, next to murder\" (in James R. Clark, comp.,Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints, 6 vols. [Salt 6:176). Some who do plan salvation behave like promiscuousanimals, but Latter-day Saints\u2014especially those whoare under sacred covenants\u2014have no such latitude.We are solemnly responsible to God for thedestruction or misuse of the creative powers he has placed within us. Abortion The ultimate act of destruction is to take a life. Thatis why abortion is such a serious sin. Our attitudetoward abortion is not based on revealed knowledgeof when mortal life begins for legal purposes. It isfixed by our knowledge that according to an eternalplan, all of the spirit children of God must come tothis earth for a glorious purpose, and that individualidentity began long before conception and willcontinue for all the eternities to come. We rely onthe prophets of God, who have told us that whilethere may be \"rare\" exceptions, \"the practice ofelective abortion is shalt . . . like unto it' (Doctrine and Covenants 59:6)\"(1991 Supplement to the 1989 General Handbook ofInstructions, p. 1). Our knowledge of the great plan of happiness alsogives us a unique perspective on the subject ofmarriage and the bearing of children. In this wealso run counter to some strong current forces incustom, law, and economics. Marriage Is Necessary in God's Plan Marriage is disdained by an increasing number of couples, and many who marry choose to forgochildren or place severe limits on their number. In recent years strong economic pressures in manynations have altered the traditional assumption of a single breadwinner per family. Increases in thenumber of working mothers of young childreninevitably signal a reduced commitment of parentaltime to nurturing the young. The effect of thesereductions is evident in the rising numbers ofabortions, divorces, child neglect, and juvenile crime. We are taught that marriage is necessary for the accomplishment of God's plan, to provide the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPLAN OF SALVATION 261approved setting for mortal birth, and to prepare family members for eternal life. \"Marriage is ordainedof God unto man,\" the Lord said, \"that the earthmight answer the end of its creation; and that itmight be filled with the measure of man, accordingto his creation before the world was made\" (D&C49:15-17). Our concept of marriage is motivated by revealed truth, not by worldly sociology. The Apostle Paultaught, \"Neither is the man without the woman,neither the woman without the man, in the Lord\"(1 Corinthians 11:11). President Spencer W. Kimballexplained, \"Without proper and successful marriage,one will never be exalted\" ( Marriage and Divorce [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1976], p. 24). According to custom, men are expected to take the initiative in seeking marriage. That is why PresidentJoseph F. Smith directed his prophetic pressure atmen. He said, \"No man who is marriageable is fullyliving his religion who remains unmarried\" ( Gospel Doctrine [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939], p. 275). We hear of some worthy LDS men in theirthirties who are busy accumulating property andenjoying freedom from family responsibilitieswithout any sense of urgency about marriage.Beware, brethren. You are deficient in a sacred duty. Bear and Nurture Children Knowledge of the great plan of happiness also givesLatter-day Saints a distinctive attitude toward thebearing and nurturing of children. In some times and places, children have been regarded as no more thanlaborers in a family economicenterprise or as insurers of support fortheir parents. Though repelled bythese repressions, some persons in ourday have no compunctions againstsimilar attitudes that subordinate thewelfare of a spirit child of God to thecomfort or convenience of par ents. The Savior taught that we should notlay up treasures on earth but should lay up treasures in heaven (see Matthew 6:19-21). In light of theultimate purpose of the great plan of happiness, Ibelieve that the ultimate treasures on earth and inheaven are our children and our posterity. President Kimball said, \"It is an act of extreme selfishness for a married couple to refuse to havechildren when they are able to do so\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1979, p. 6; or Ensign, May 1979, p. 6). When married couples postpone childbearing untilafter they have satisfied their material goals, themere passage of time assures that they seriouslyreduce their potential to participate in furtheringour Heavenly Father's plan for all of his spiritchildren. Faithful Latter-day Saints cannot afford tolook upon children as an interference with whatthe world calls \"self-fulfillment.\" Our covenantswith God and the ultimate purpose of life are tiedup in those little ones who reach for our time, ourlove, and our sacrifices. How many children should a couple have? All they can care for! Of course, to care for children meansmore than simply giving them life. Children mustbe loved, nurtured, taught, fed, clothed, housed,and well started in their capacities to be good parentsthemselves. Exercising faith in God's promises to blessthem when they are keeping his commandments,many LDS parents have large families. Others seekbut are not blessed with children or with the numberof children they desire. In a matter as intimate asthis, we should not judge one another. President Gordon B. Hinckley gave this inspired counsel to an audience of young Latter-day Saints: \"I like to think of the positive side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purposeof this estate in our eternal journey, of the need forthe experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is tobe found only where there arechildren in the home, of the blessingsthat come of good posterity. When Ithink of these values and see themtaught and observed, then I am willingto leave the question of numbers tothe man and the woman and theLord\" (\"If I Were You, What Would IDo?\" Brigham Young University 1983-84 Fireside and Devotional Speeches [Provo: University Publications, 1984], p. 11). No Blessing Will Be Denied Some who are listening to this message are probablysaying, \"But what about me?\" We know that manyworthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lackthe ideal opportunities and essential requirementsfor their progress. Singleness, childlessness, death,and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPLAN OF SALVATION 262 The great plan of happiness also gives Latter-day Saints a distinctive attitude toward the bearing and nurturing of children.fulfillment of promised blessings. In addition, some women who desire to be full-time mothers andhomemakers have been literally compelled to enterthe full-time workforce. But these frustrations areonly temporary. The Lord has promised that in theeternities no blessing will be denied his sons anddaughters who keep the commandments, are trueto their covenants, and desire what is right. Many of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is thetime for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the greatplan of happiness for all of our Father's worthychildren. We know that will be true of templeordinances. I believe it will also be true of familyrelationships and experiences. Do All Things in Wisdom and Order I pray that we will not let the challenges andtemporary diversions of mortality cause us to forgetour covenants and lose sight of our eternal destiny.We who know God's plan for his children, we whohave covenanted to participate, have a clearresponsibility. We must desire to do what is right,and we must do all that we can in our owncircumstances in mortality. In all of this, we should remember King Benjamin's caution to \"see that all these things are done inwisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a manshould run faster than he has strength\" (Mosiah4:27). I think of that inspired teaching whenever I feel inadequate, frustrated, or depressed. When we have done all that we are able, we can rely on God's promised mercy. We have a Savior, who has taken upon him not just the sins, but also\"the pains and the sicknesses of his people . . . thathe may know according to the flesh how to succorhis people according to their infirmities\" (Alma7:11-12). He is our Savior, and when we have doneall that we can, he will make up the difference, inhis own way and in his own time. Of that I testifyin the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPLAN OF SALVATION 263PORNOGRAPHY SELECTED TEACHINGS Effects of Pornography on Dating, Marriages, and Families President Spencer W. Kimball \"We urge, with Peter, '. . . Abstain from lusts, which war against the soul.' (1 Pet. 2:11.) No indecentexposure or pornography or other aberrations todefile the mind and spirit\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1974, 8; or Ensign, May 1974, 7). \"We hope that our parents and leaders will nottolerate pornography. It is really garbage, but todayis peddled as normal and satisfactory food. Manywriters seem to take delight in polluting theatmosphere with it. Seemingly, it cannot be stoppedby legislation. There is a link between pornographyand the low, sexual drives and perversions. We livein a culture which venerates the orgasm, streaking,trading wives, and similar crazes. How low canhumans plunge! We pray with our Lord that we maybe kept from being in the world. It is sad that decentpeople are thrown into a filthy area of mental andspiritual pollution. We call upon all of our people todo all in their power to offset this ugly revolution. \"It is ridiculous to imply that pornography has no effect. There is a definite relationship to crime.Murder, robbery, rape, prostitution, andcommercialized vice are fed on this immorality. Sex crime statistics seem to reflect a relationshipbetween crime and pornography. \"It is utterly without redeeming social value. We urge our families to protect their children in everyway possible. We live in a permissive world, but wemust make certain we do not become a part of thatpermissive world, that degenerate world. We areshocked at the depths to which many people of thisworld go to assert their freedom. We fear that thetrends of permissiveness toward immorality aredestroying the moral fabric of our generation. . . . \"Every form of homosexuality is sin. Pornography is one of the approaches to that transgression. Thereis no halfway\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1974,7-8; or Ensign, Nov. 1974, 7-8). \"'Pornography degrades sex and humanity. Sex is anextremely delicate part of our human relationships.When you assault that and degrade it, you make itan animalistic act and it is an assault on ourhumanity generally. \"'As that spreads, it has an over-all effect on our population.

We need toconstantly guard against immorality, pornography,and sexual permissiveness that would destroy thepurity of the family members, young and old\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1979, 5; or Ensign, May 1979, 5). President Ezra Taft Benson \"Virtue is akin to holiness, an attribute of godliness. A priesthood holder should actively seek for thatwhich is virtuous and lovely and not that which isdebasing or sordid. Virtue will garnish his thoughtsunceasingly (see D&C 121:45).

Lee \"There are insidious forces among us that are constantly trying to knock at our doors and trying tolay traps for our young men and women, particularlythose who are unwary and unsophisticated in theways of the world.

Hunter \"Be faithful in your marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. Pornography, flirtations, andunwholesome fantasies erode one's character andstrike at the foundation of a happy marriage. Unityand trust within a marriage are thereby destroyed.One who does not control his thoughts and thuscommits adultery in his heart, if he does not repent,shall not have the Spirit but shall deny the faith andshall fear (see D&C 42:23; 63:16)\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 67; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 50). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"As we have been reminded, this is a season of great evil in the world. No one needs to be reminded ofthat. We are constantly exposed to the muck andfilth of pornography, to salacious and evil behaviortotally unbecoming anyone who holds the priesthoodof God\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1999, 68; orEnsign, May 1999, 51). \"There is an ever-growing plague of pornographyswirling about us. . . . Many a man who haspartaken of forbidden fruit and then discoveredthat he has destroyed his marriage, lost his self-respect, and broken his companion's heart, hascome to realize that the booby-trapped jungle trailhe has followed began with the reading or viewingof pornographic material. . . . \"Portrayals of sexual perversion, violence, and bestiality become increasingly available for thosewho succumb to their lures.

A bishop reported that he had observedthat the spiritual level of the young priesthoodbearers in his ward was declining. Through hispersonal interviews with them, he discovered thatmany of them were watching R-rated movies. Whenhe asked them where they went to see such trash,they said, 'We don't go anywhere. We watch them ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPORNOGRAPHY 266at home. We have cable television, and when our parents are gone we watch anything we want to.' \"Fathers, you may want to reconsider having unrestricted cable or unsupervised television sets in your home and particularly in your children'sbedrooms. \"It is very unreasonable to suppose that exposure to profanity, nudity, sex, and violence has no negativeeffects on us.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPORNOGRAPHY 267PRIDE CLEANSING THE INNER VESSEL President Ezra Taft Benson President of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Apr. 1986, 3, 5-6; or Ensign, May 1986, 4, 6-7 Watchmen\u2014what of the night? We must respondby saying that all is not well in Zion. As Moronicounseled, we must cleanse the inner vessel (seeAlma 60:23), beginning first with ourselves, thenwith our families, and finally with the Church. Changed People! A prophet of God stated, \"Ye shall clear away thebad according as the good shall grow . . . until thegood shall overcome the bad.\" (Jacob 5:66.) It takesa Zion people to make a Zion society, and we mustprepare for that. . . . Pride May I now discuss a subject of grave concern thatdeserves deeper development than we have time. Itis the subject of pride. In the scriptures there is no such thing as righteous pride. It is always considered as a sin. We are notspeaking of a wholesome view of self-worth, whichis best established by a close relationship with God.But we are speaking of pride as the universal sin, assomeone has described it. Mormon writes that \"the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven theirdestruction\" (Moroni 8:27). The Lord says in theDoctrine and Covenants, \"Beware of pride, lest yebecome as of old\" (D&C 38:39). is a \"my will\" rather than \"thywill\" approach to life. The opposite of pride ishumbleness, meekness, submissiveness (see Alma13:28), or teachableness. In the early days of the restored church, the Lord warned two of its prominent members about pride.To Oliver Cowdery, He said, \"Beware of pride, lestthou shouldst into temptation\" (D&C 23:1).To Emma Smith, He said, \"Continue in and beware of pride\" (D&C 25:14). \"Thou shalt not be proud Lord warns us (D&C 42:40). \"Humble yourselves beforeGod,\" says the Book of Mormon (Mosiah 4:10). When the earth is cleansed by burning in the last days, the proud shall be as stubble. (See 3 Nephi25:1; D&C 29:9; 64:24.) The great and spacious building which Lehi saw was the pride of the world where the multitude of theearth was gathered. (See 1 Nephi 11:35-36.) Thosewho walked the straight and narrow path and heldonto the word of God and partook of the love ofGod were mocked and scorned by those in thebuilding. (See 1 Nephi 8:20, 27, 33; 11:25.) (2 Nephi 28:14). Not MyWill But Thine Pride does not look up to God and care about what is right. It looks sideways to man and argues who isright. Pride is manifest in the spirit of contention. Was it not through pride that the devil became the devil? Christ wanted to serve. The devil wanted torule. Christ wanted to bring men to where He was.The devil wanted to be above men. Christ removed self as the force in His perfect life. It was not my will, but thine be done. Pride is characterized by \"What do I want out oflife?\" rather than by \"What would God have me dowith my life?\" It is self-will as opposed to God'swill. It is the fear of man over the fear of God. Humility responds to God's will\u2014to the fear of His judgments and the needs of those around us. To the Essentially, pride is a \"my will\" rather than \"thy will\" approach to life. \u2014President Ezra Taft Benson ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL268proud, the applause of the world rings in their ears; to the humble, the applause of heaven warms theirhearts. Someone has said, \"Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of itthan the next man.\" Of one brother, the Lord said,\"I, the Lord, am not well pleased with him, for heseeketh to excel, and he is not sufficiently meekbefore me\" (D&C 58:41). The \"Learned, and the Rich\" The two groups in the Book of Mormon that seemedto have the greatest difficulty with pride are the\"learned, and the rich\" (2 Nephi 28:15). But theword of God can pull down pride. (See Alma 4:19.) With pride, there are many curses. With humility, there come many blessings. For example, \"Be thouhumble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee bythe hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers\"(D&C 112:10). The humble will \"be made strong,and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge\"(D&C 1:28). The Lord is \"merciful unto those whoconfess their sins with humble hearts\" (D&C 61:2).Humility can turn away God's anger. (See Helaman11:11.) Must Cleanse the Inner Vessel My beloved brethren and sisters, as we cleanse theinner vessel, there will have to be changes made inour own personal lives, in our families, and in theChurch. The proud do not change to improve, butdefend their position by rationalizing. Repentancemeans change, and it takes a humble person tochange. But we can do it. We have made some wonderful strides in the past. We will be lengthening our stride in the future. Todo so, we must first cleanse the inner vessel byawaking and arising, being morally clean, using theBook of Mormon in a manner so that God will liftthe condemnation, and finally conquering pride byhumbling ourselves. We can do it. I know we can. That we will do so is my prayer for all of us. God bless you for all thegood you have done and will be doing. I leave myblessings on all of you and do so in the name of theLord Jesus Christ, amen.BEWARE OF PRIDE President Ezra Taft Benson President of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 3-7; or Ensign, May 1989, 4-7 My beloved brethren and sisters, I rejoice to be withyou in another glorious general conference of theChurch. How grateful I am for the love, prayers,and service of the devoted members of the Churchthroughout the world. May I commend you faithful Saints who are striving to flood the earth and your lives with the Book of Mormon. Not only must we move forward in a monumental manner more copies of the Book of Mormon, but we must move boldly forward intoour own lives and throughout the earth more of itsmarvelous messages. This sacred volume was written for us\u2014for our day. Its scriptures are to be likened unto ourselves (see1 Nephi 19:23). The Sin of Pride The Doctrine and Covenants tells us that the Bookof Mormon is the \"record of a fallen people\" (D&C20:9). Why did they fall? This is one of the majormessages of the Book of Mormon. Mormon givesthe answer in the closing chapters of the book inthese words: \"Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven theirdestruction\" (Moroni 8:27). And then, lest we missthat momentous Book of Mormon message fromthat fallen people, the Lord warns us in theDoctrine and Covenants, \"Beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old\" (D&C 38:39). I earnestly seek an interest in your faith and prayers as I strive to bring forth light on this Book of Mormonmessage\u2014the sin of pride. This message has beenweighing heavily on my soul for some time. I knowthe Lord wants this message delivered now. \"Beware of Pride\" In the premortal council, it was pride that felledLucifer, \"a son of the morning\" (2 MANUALPRIDE 269see also D&C 76:25-27; Moses 4:3). At the end of this world, when God cleanses the earth by fire, theproud will be burned as stubble and the meek shallinherit in the Doctrine and Covenants the Lord uses the phrase \"beware of pride,\" including awarning to the second elder of the Church, OliverCowdery, and to Emma Smith, the wife of theProphet (D&C 23:1; see also D&C 25:14; 38:39). God's Definition of Pride Pride is a very misunderstood sin, and many aresinning in ignorance (see Mosiah 3:11; 3 Nephi 6:18).In the scriptures there is no such thing as righteouspride\u2014it is always considered a sin. Therefore, no matter how the world uses the term, we mustunderstand how God uses the term so we canunderstand the language of holy writ and profitthereby (see 2 Nephi 4:15; Mosiah 1:3-7; Alma 5:61). Most of us think of pride as self-centeredness, conceit, boastfulness, arrogance, or haughtiness. All of theseare elements of the sin, but the heart, or core, isstill missing. The central feature of pride is enmity\u2014enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. Enmity means \"hatred toward, hostility to, or a state ofopposition.\" It is the power by which Satan wishesto reign over us. Enmity toward God Pride is essentially competitive in nature. We pit ourwill against God's. When we direct our pride towardGod, it is in the spirit of \"my will and not thine bedone.\" As Paul said, they \"seek their own, not thethings which are Jesus Christ's\" (Philippians 2:21). Our will in competition to God's will allows desires, appetites, and passions to go unbridled (see Alma38:12; 3 Nephi 12:30). The proud cannot accept the authority of God giving direction to their lives (see Helaman 12:6). They pittheir perceptions of truth against God's great knowl-edge, their abilities versus God's priesthood power, their accomplishments against His mighty works. Our enmity toward God takes on many labels, such as rebellion, hard-heartedness, stiff-neckedness,unrepentant, puffed up, easily offended, and signseekers. The proud wish God would agree withthem. They aren't interested in changing theiropinions to agree with God's. Enmity toward Fellowmen Another major portion of this very prevalent sin of pride is enmity toward our fellowmen. We aretempted daily to elevate ourselves above others anddiminish them (see Helaman 6:17; D&C 58:41). The proud make every man their adversary by pitting their intellects, opinions, works, wealth, talents, orany other worldly measuring device against others.In the words of C. S. Lewis: \"Pride gets no pleasureout of having something, only out of having moreof it than the next man. . . . It is the comparisonthat makes you proud: the pleasure of being abovethe rest. Once the element of competition has gone,pride has gone\" (Mere Christianity [New In the pre-earthly council, Lucifer placed his proposal in competition with the Father's plan asadvocated by Jesus Christ (see Moses 4:1-3). Hewished to be honored above all others (see 2 Nephi24:13). In short, his prideful desire was to dethroneGod (see D&C 29:36; 76:28). Consequences of Pride The scriptures abound with evidences of the severeconsequences of the sin of pride to individuals,groups, cities, and nations. \"Pride goeth beforedestruction\" (Proverbs 16:18). It destroyed theNephite nation and the city of Sodom (see Moroni8:27; Ezekiel 16:49-50). It was through pride that Christ was crucified. The Pharisees were wroth because Jesus claimed to bethe Son of God, which was a threat to their position,and so they plotted His death (see John 11:53). Saul became an enemy to David through pride. He was jealous because the crowds of Israelite womenwere singing that \"Saul hath slain his thousands,and David his ten thousands\" (1 Samuel 18:7; seealso 18:6, 8). The proud stand more in fear of men's judgment than of God's judgment (see D&C 3:6-7; will men think me?\" weighs heavierthan \"What will God think of me?\" King Noah was about to free the prophet Abinadi, but an appeal to his pride by his wicked priests sentAbinadi to the flames (see Mosiah 17:11-12). Herod ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIDE 270sorrowed at the request of his wife to behead John the Baptist. But his prideful desire to look good to\"them which sat with him at meat\" caused him tokill John (Matthew 14:9; see also Mark 6:26). Fear of men's judgment manifests itself in competition for men's approval. The proud love\"the praise of men more than the praise of God\"(John 12:42-43). Our motives for the things we doare where the sin is manifest. Jesus said He did\"always those things\" that pleased God (John 8:29).Would we not do well to have the pleasing of Godas our motive rather than to try to elevate ourselvesabove our brother and outdo another? Some prideful people are not so concerned as to whether their wages meet their needs as they arethat their wages are more than someone else's.Their reward is being a cut above the rest. This isthe enmity of pride. When pride has a hold on our hearts, we lose our independence of the world and deliver our freedomsto the bondage of men's judgment. The world shoutslouder than the whisperings of the Holy Ghost. Thereasoning of men overrides the revelations of God,and the proud let go of the iron rod (see 1 Nephi8:19-28; 11:25; 15:23-24). Manifestations of Pride Pride is a sin that can readily be seen in others butis rarely admitted in ourselves. Most of us considerpride to be a sin of those on the top, such as therich and the learned, looking down at the rest of us(see 2 Nephi 9:42). There is, however, a far morecommon ailment among us\u2014and that is pride fromthe bottom looking up. It is manifest in so manyways, such as faultfinding, gossiping, backbiting,murmuring, living beyond our means, envying,coveting, withholding gratitude and praise that mightlift another, and being unforgiving and jealous. Disobedience is essentially a prideful power struggle against someone in authority over us. It can be aparent, a priesthood leader, a teacher, or ultimatelyGod. A proud person hates the fact that someone isabove him. He thinks this lowers his position. Selfishness is one of the more common faces of pride. \"How everything affects me\" is the center ofall that matters\u2014self-conceit, self-pity, worldly self-fulfillment, self-gratification, and self-seeking.Pride results in secret combinations which are builtup to get power, gain, and glory of the world (seeHelaman 7:5; Ether 8:9, 16, 22-23; Moses 5:31). Thisfruit of the sin of pride, namely secret combinations,brought down both the Jaredite and the Nephitecivilizations and has been and will yet be the causeof the fall of many nations (see Ether 8:18-25). Another face of pride is contention. Arguments, fights, unrighteous dominion, generation gaps,divorces, spouse abuse, riots, and disturbances allfall into this category of pride. Contention in our families drives the Spirit of the Lord away. It also drives many of our familymembers away. Contention ranges from a hostilespoken word to worldwide conflicts. The scripturestell us that \"only by pride cometh contention\"(Proverbs 13:10; see also Proverbs 28:25). The scriptures testify that the proud are easily offended and hold grudges (see 1 Nephi 16:1-3).They withhold forgiveness to keep another in theirdebt and to justify their injured feelings. The proud do not receive counsel or correction easily (see Proverbs 15:10; Amos 5:10). Defensiveness isused by them to justify and rationalize their frailtiesand failures (see Matthew 3:9; John 6:30-59). Theproud depend upon the world to tell them whetherthey have value or not. Their self-esteem isdetermined by where they are judged to be on theladders of worldly success. They feel worthwhile asindividuals if the numbers beneath them inachievement, talent, beauty, or intellect are large enough. Pride is ugly. It says, \"If you succeed, I ama failure.\" If we love God, do His will, and fear His judgment more than men's, we will have self-esteem. \"A Damning Sin\" Pride is a damning sin in the true sense of that word.It limits or stops progression (see Alma 12:10-11). Theproud are not easily taught (see 1 Nephi 15:3, 7-11).They won't change their minds to accept truths,because to do so implies they have been wrong. Pride adversely affects all our relationships\u2014our relationship with God and His servants, betweenhusband and wife, parent and child, employer andemployee, teacher and student, and all mankind. Ourdegree of pride determines how we treat our God and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIDE 271our brothers and sisters. Christ wants to lift us to where He is. Do we desire to do the same for others? Pride fades our feelings of sonship to God and brotherhood to man. It separates and divides us by\"ranks,\" according to our \"riches\" and our \"chancesfor learning\" (3 Nephi 6:12). Unity is impossible fora proud people, and unless we are one we are notthe Lord's (see Mosiah 18:21; D&C 38:27; 105:2-4;Moses 7:18). The Cost of Pride Think of what pride has cost us in the past and whatit is now costing us in our own lives, our families,and the Church. Think of the repentance that could take place with lives changed, marriages preserved, and homesstrengthened, if pride did not keep us from confessingour sins and forsaking them (see D&C 58:43). Think of the many who are less-active members of the Church because they were offended and theirpride will not allow them to forgive or fully sup atthe Lord's table. Think of the tens of thousands of additional young men and couples who could be on missions exceptfor the pride that keeps them from yielding theirhearts unto God (see Alma 10:6; Helaman 3:34-35). Think how temple work would increase if the time spent in this godly service were more important thanthe many prideful pursuits that compete for our time. The Universal Sin Pride affects all of us at various times and in variousdegrees. Now you can see why the building in Lehi'sdream that represents the pride of the world waslarge and spacious and great was the multitude thatdid enter into it (see 1 Nephi 8:26, 33; 11:35-36). Pride is the universal sin, the great vice. Yes, pride is the universal sin, the great vice. Humility: The Antidote for Pride The antidote for pride is humility\u2014meekness, submissiveness (see Alma 7:23). It is the brokenheart so well: The tumult and the shouting dies; The captains and the kings depart.Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,An humble and a contrite heart.Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,Lest we forget, lest we forget. (\"God of Our Fathers, Known of Old,\" Hymns, no. 80.) Choose to Be Humble God will have a humble people. Either we can choose to be humble or we can be compelled to behumble. Alma said, \"Blessed are they who humblethemselves without being compelled to be humble\"(Alma 32:16). Let us choose to be humble.We can choose to humble ourselves by conquering enmity toward our brothers and sisters, esteemingthem as ourselves, and lifting them as high orhigher than we are (see D&C 38:24; 81:5; 84:106). We can choose to humble ourselves by receiving counsel and chastisement can choose to humble ourselves by forgiving those who have offended us (see 3 Nephi 13:11, 14;D&C 64:10). We can choose to humble ourselves by rendering selfless service (see Mosiah 2:16-17). We can choose to humble ourselves by going on missions and preaching the word that can humbleothers (see Alma 4:19; 31:5; 48:20). We can choose to humble ourselves by getting to the temple more frequently. We can choose to humble ourselves by confessing and forsaking our sins and being born of God (seeD&C 58:43; Mosiah 27:25-26; Alma 5:7-14, 49). We can choose to humble ourselves by loving God, submitting our will to His, and putting Him first inour lives (see 3 Nephi 11:11; 13:33; Moroni 10:32). Let us choose to be humble. We can do it. I know we can. The Great Stumbling Block to Zion My dear brethren and sisters, we must prepare toredeem Zion. It was essentially the sin of pride thatkept us from establishing Zion in the days of theProphet Joseph Smith. It was the same sin of pridethat brought consecration to an end among theNephites (see 4 Nephi 1:24-25). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIDE 272Pride is the great stumbling block to Zion. I repeat: Pride isthe great stumbling block to Zion. We must cleanse the inner vessel by conqueringpride (see Alma 6:2-4; Matthew 23:25-26). We must yield \"to the enticings of the Holy put \"natural \"as child, submissive, meek, humble\"(Mosiah 3:19; see also Alma 13:28). That we may do so and go on to fulfill our divine destiny is my fervent prayer in the name of JesusChrist, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIDE 273PRINCIPLES SELECTED TEACHINGS President Ezra Taft Benson \"We should make daily study of the scriptures a lifetime pursuit. . . . \". . . One of the most important things you can do . . . is to immerse yourselves in the scriptures. Searchthem diligently. Feast upon the words of Christ. Learnthe doctrine. Master the principles\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1986, 61; or Ensign, Nov. 1986, 47). President Boyd K. Packer \"That word principle in the revelation is a very important one. A principle is an enduring truth, a law, a rule you can adopt to guide you in makingdecisions. Generally principles are not spelled outin detail. That leaves you free to find your way withan enduring truth, a principle, as your anchor\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1996, 22; or Ensign, May 1996, 17). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"From doctrine, we learn principles of conduct, how to respond to problems of everyday living,even to failures, for they too are provided for in thedoctrines\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1994, 26; orEnsign, May 1994, 20). \"Some things cannot be changed. Doctrine cannotbe changed. \"'Principles which have been revealed,' President Wilford Woodruff said, 'for the salvation andexaltation of the children of men . . . are principlesyou cannot annihilate. They are principles that nocombination of men can destroy. They are principles that can never die. . . . They are beyond the reachof man to destroy.' [In Journal ofDiscourses, 22:342; italics added.]\" (in Conference 1993, 29; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 22). \"Organization, programs, procedures, policies, and principles\u2014all are important. But they are not ofequal importance. . . . \"If you do not know the principles\u2014by principles I mean the principles of the gospel, the doctrines,what's in the revelations\u2014if you do not know whatthe revelations say about justice or mercy, or whatthey reveal on reproof or forgiveness, how can youmake inspired decisions in those difficult cases thatrequire your judgement? . . . \"There are principles of the gospel underlying every phase of Church administration. These are not explained in the handbooks. They are found in thescriptures. They are the substance of and the purposefor the revelations. \"Procedures, programs, the administrative policies, even some patterns of organization are subject tochange. We are quite free, indeed, quite obliged toalter them from time to time. But the principles, the doctrines, never change. . . . \". . . What we really need is a revival of the basicgospel principles in the lives of all the Latter-daySaints. The true essence of priesthood administrationis not a procedure\u2014it is in principle, in doctrine! \"The prophet Joseph Smith gave us the key. He said, with reference to administration, 'I teach themcorrect principles and they govern themselves.'\" (\"Principles,\" Ensign, Mar. 1985, 6, 8). Elder James E. Faust \"Great temporal and spiritual strength flows from following those who have the keys of the kingdomof God in our time. Personal strength and powerresult from obedience to eternal principles taughtby the living legates of the Lord\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 97; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 74). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Orthodoxy ensures balance between the gospel's powerful and correct principles. . . . But the gospel'sprinciples do require synchronization. When pulled apart from each other or isolated, men'sinterpretations and implementations of thesedoctrines may be wild\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1993, 97; or Ensign, May 1993, 78).A principle is an enduring truth, a law, a rule you can adopt to guide you in making decisions. \u2014President Boyd K. Packer ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL274Elder Richard G. Scott \"As you seek spiritual knowledge, search for principles. Carefully separate them from the detailused to explain them. Principles are concentratedtruth, packaged for application to a wide variety ofcircumstances. A true principle makes decisionsclear even under the most confusing andcompelling circumstances. It is worth great effort toorganize the truth we gather to simple statementsof principle\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 117;or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 86). \"Man has always benefitted from obedience to trueprinciples. The fearless Polynesians in precarious craftcrossed an immense ocean for destinations thousandsof miles away. That feat was accomplished not bychance but by adherence to sound principles ofcelestial navigation. They prepared carefully and didnot succumb to temptations to deviate from theircourse or delay en route. In like manner, you and Ican be assured of reaching worthy objectives in lifeby understanding and consistently following correctprinciples rooted in revealed truth. \"Principles are anchors of safety. They are like the steel anchors a mountaineer uses to conquer otherwiseimpossible cliffs. They will help you have confidencein new and unfamiliar circumstances. They willprovide you protection in life's storms of adversity. \"All of the self-inflicted tragedy that occurs today from violation of the Lord's commandments could beavoided by careful, consistent observance of revealedtruth.

The Lord uses that patternwith us. You will find correct principles in theteachings of the Savior, His prophets, and thescriptures\u2014especially the Book of Mormon. \"While easy to find, true principles are not easy to live until they become an established pattern of life.They will require you to dislodge false ideas. Theycan cause you wrenching battles within the secretchambers of your heart and decisive encounters toovercome temptation, peer pressure, and the falseallure of the 'easy way out.' Yet as you resolutelyfollow correct principles, you will forge strength ofcharacter available to you in times of urgent need.Your consistent adherence to principle overcomesthe alluring yet false lifestyles that surround you.Your faithful compliance to correct principles willgenerate criticism and ridicule from others, yet theresults are so eternally worthwhile that theywarrant your every sacrifice. \"Now, the most important principle I can share: Anchor your life in Jesus Christ, your Redeemer.Make your Eternal Father and His Beloved Son themost important priority in your life\u2014more importantthan life itself, more important than a belovedcompanion or children or anyone on earth. Maketheir will your central desire. Then all that you needfor happiness will come to you\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1993, 40-41, 43; or Ensign, May 1993, 32, 34). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRINCIPLES 275PRIORITIES AND BALANCE SELECTED TEACHINGS Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"The highest challenge we have in mortality is to use our free agency well, making right choices inthe interplay of time and talents. Time is one of theblessings we are given. Generally speaking, it is wewho let ourselves get fragmented too much. It is theresult of not establishing (and then persisting in)certain priorities in our life. I am not denying thereality of the challenge you put, but neither do I thinkit is unmanageable\" (Deposition of a Disciple, 68). \"Does all this mean that in letting go of the world,it will be easy to set priorities? No! It is often harder,for now we choose, not between task A, which is a tainted task, and B, which is good; but now wemust allot time and talent between C, which isimportant and good, and D, which is good andimportant\" (Wherefore, Ye Must Press Forward, 19). \"Just as the Lord was able to summarize His prioritiesso succinctly that it is his 'work and . . . glory to bringto pass the immortality and eternal life of man' (Moses1:39), so we, too, will need to be able to manage ourtime and talents in such a way that we, too, knowour real priorities and focus on them. When we aresettled in our hearts on that which really matters,then our talent and time as well as our treasure will bethus deployed!\" ( We Will Prove Them Herewith, 66-67). Spiritual Priorities President Spencer W. Kimball \"I am impressed that our various Church programs are like keys on the keyboard of a piano. Some ofthe keys are used much more often than others, butall of them are needed from time to time to produceharmony and balance in our lives. So often, therefore,what we are doing in our various talks and meetingsis to remind ourselves of the need for balance, theneed for fresh emphasis here or there, and the needto do the things that matter most without leavingthe other things undone\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1976, 70; or Ensign, May 1976, 46). President Ezra Taft Benson \"When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place or drop out of our lives. Our loveof the Lord will govern the claims of our affection,the demands on our time, the interests we pursue,and the order of our priorities\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1988, 13; or Ensign, May 1988, 4). \"To be successful, we must have the Spirit of theLord. We have been taught that the Spirit will notdwell in unclean tabernacles. Therefore, one of ourfirst priorities is to make sure our own personal livesare in order\" (Come unto Christ, 92). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"Our priorities determine what we seek in life. 'Wherefore, seek not the things of this world butseek ye first to build up the kingdom of God, and toestablish his righteousness' (JST Matthew 6:38), Jesustaught his disciples. As we read in modern revelation:'Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, themysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, andthen shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hatheternal life is rich.' (D&C 6:7.)\" (Pure in Heart, 6). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"Sometimes we need a personal crisis to reinforce in our minds what we really value and cherish. Thescriptures are filled with examples of people facingcrises before learning how to better serve God andothers. Perhaps if you, too, search your hearts andcourageously assess the priorities in your life, youmay discover, as I did, that you need a better balanceamong your priorities\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1987, 14-15; or Ensign, May 1987, 13). Family Priorities President Spencer W. Kimball \"The Lord says in definite terms: 'Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave untoher and none else.' (D&C 42:22.)Search your hearts and courageously assess the priorities in your life. \u2014Elder M. Russell Ballard ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL276\"The words none else eliminate everyone and everything. The spouse then becomes preeminent in the life of the husband or wife, and neither sociallife nor occupational life nor political life nor anyother interest nor person nor thing shall ever takeprecedence over the companion spouse\" (Teachingsof Spencer W. Kimball, 310-11). President Ezra Taft Benson \"The question is sometimes asked by younger priesthood holders, 'Where do I place my greatestpriorities\u2014to the Church, to my family, or to myprofession?' I have answered that question byemphasizing that heads of families have four majorresponsibilities. Certainly the first is to the homeand family. There should be no question about this.A man may succeed in business or his Church calling,but if he fails in his home he will face eternity indisappointment. . . . Home is the place where theLord intended a father's greatest influence to befelt\" (Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, 509-10). Elder John A. Widtsoe \"The Church is composed of homes. Church and home cannot be separated. Neither one comes first.They are one\" (Evidences and Reconciliations, 318). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"Given the gravity of current conditions, would parents be willing to give up just one outside thing,giving that time and talent instead to the family?Parents and grandparents, please scrutinize yourschedules and priorities in order to ensure that life'sprime relationships get more prime time.

A LETTER TO CHURCH MEMBERS FROM THE FIRST PRESIDENCY Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley, Thomas S. Monson,James E. Faust Church News, 27 Feb. 1999, 3 To: Members of the Church throughout the World(To Be Read in Sacrament Meeting and Delivered by Home Teachers)Dear Brothers and Sisters: . . . We counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospelstudy and instruction, and wholesome familyactivities. However worthy and appropriate otherdemands or activities may be, they must not bepermitted to displace the divinely-appointed dutiesthat only parents and families can adequatelyperform. We urge bishops and other Church officers to do all they can to assist parents in seeing that they havetime and help, where needed, as they nurture theirfamilies and bring them up in the way of the Lord.Wherever possible, Sunday meetings, other thanthose under the three-hour schedule and perhapscouncil meetings on early Sunday mornings orfiresides later in the evening, should be avoided sothat parents may be with their children. As westrengthen families, we will strengthen the entireChurch. Faithfully your brethren, The First Presidency PARENTS IN ZION President Boyd K. Packer Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1998, 27-30; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 22 Parents in Zion In 1831 the Lord gave a revelation to parents in Zion.1It is about parents that I wish to speak. I have served in the Quorum of the Twelve for 28 years, and 9 years as an Assistant to the T welve. Put together, that makes 37 years\u2014exactly half my life. But I have another calling which I have held even longer. I am a parent\u2014a father and a grandfather. Ittook years to earn the grandfather title\u2014another 20 years the title of great-grandfather. These titles\u2014 father, grandfather, mother, grandmother \u2014carry responsibility and an authority which comes in partfrom experience. Experience is a compelling teacher. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 277Balancing Family and Church My calling in the priesthood defines my position in the Church; the title grandfather, my position in the family. I want to talk about both of them together. Parenthood stands among the most important activities to which Latter-day Saints may devotethemselves. Many members face conflicts as theystruggle to balance their responsibility as parentstogether with faithful activity in the Church. There are things vital to the well-being of a family which can be found only by going to church. Thereis the priesthood, which empowers a man to leadand bless his wife and children, and covenants whichbind them together forever. The Church was commanded to \"meet together often\" 2and told, \"When ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other.\"3Alma the Elder and Alma the Younger gave the sameinstruction to their people. 4 We are commanded to \"turn theheart[s] of the fathers to the children,and the heart[s] of the children totheir fathers.\" 5 The Lord addressed Joseph Smith Jr.by name and said, \"You have not keptthe commandments, and must needsstand rebuked.\" 6He had failed to teach his children. That is the only time the wordrebuke is used in correcting him. His counselor Frederick G. Williams was under thesame condemnation: \"You have not taught yourchildren light and truth.\" 7Sidney Rigdon was told the same thing, as was Bishop Newel K. Whitney,8 and the Lord added, \"What I say unto one I sayunto all.\" 9 Church's Inspired Guidance for Families We have watched the standards of morality sinkever lower until now they are in a free-fall. At thesame time we have seen an outpouring of inspiredguidance for parents and for families. The whole of the curriculum and all of the activities of the Church have been restructured and correlatedwith the home: Ward teaching became home teaching. Family home evening was reestablished. Genealogy was renamed family history and set to collect records of all the families. And then the historic proclamation on the family was issued by the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The family became, and remains, a prevailing theme in meetings, conferences, and councils. All as a prelude to an unprecedented era of building temples wherein the authority to sealfamilies together forever is exercised. Can you see the spirit of inspiration resting uponthe servants of the Lord and upon parents? Can weunderstand the challenge and the assault nowleveled at the family? Use Care in Scheduling Activities In providing out-of-home activities for the family, wemust use care; otherwise, we could be like a father determined to provide everything forhis family. He devotes every energy tothat end and succeeds; only then does he discover that what they neededmost\u2014to be together as a family\u2014has been neglected. And he reaps sorrow inplace of contentment. How easy it is, in our desire to provide schedules of programs and activities, to overlook the responsibilities of the parent and the essential need for families to havetime together. We must be careful lest programs and activities of the Church become too heavy for some families tocarry. The principles of the gospel, where understoodand applied, strengthen and protect both individualsand families. Devotion to the family and devotionto the Church are not different and separate things. Keep Family and Church in Perspective I recently saw a woman respond when it was said ofanother, \"Since she had the new baby, she isn't doinganything in the Church.\" You could almost see ababy in her arms as she protested with emotion:\"She isdoing something in the Church. She gave that baby life. She nurtures and teaches it. She isdoing the most important thing that she can do inthe Church.\" How would you respond to this question: \"Because of their handicapped child, she is confined to the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 278 There are things vital to the well- being of a family which can be found only by going to church.home and he works two jobs to meet the extra expenses. They seldom attend\u2014can we count themas active in the Church?\" And have you ever heard a woman say, \"My husband is a very good father, but he's never been a bishopor a stake president or done anything important inthe Church.\" In response to that, a father vigorouslysaid, \"What is more important in the Church thanbeing a good father?\" Faithful attendance at church, together with careful attention to the needs of the family, is a near-perfectcombination. In church we are taught the great planof happiness. 10At home we apply what we have learned. Every call, every service in the Church bringsexperience and valuable insights which carry overinto family life. Would our perspective be more clear if we could, for a moment, look upon parenthood as a calling in theChurch? Actually, it is so much more than that; butif we could look at it that way for a moment, wecould reach a better balance in the way we schedulefamilies. Do Not Burden Families Unnecessarily I do not want anyone to use what I say to excusethem in turning down an inspired call from theLord. I do want to encourage leaders to carefully consider the home lest they issue calls or scheduleactivities which place an unnecessary burden onparents and families. Recently I read a letter from a young couple whose callings in the Church frequently require them tohire a sitter for their small children in order forthem to attend their meetings. It has become verydifficult for both of them to be home with theirchildren at the same time. Can you see somethingout of balance there? Every time you schedule a youngster, you schedule a family\u2014particularly the mother. Consider the mother who, in addition to her own Church calling and that of her husband, must gether children ready and run from one activity toanother. Some mothers become discouraged\u2014evendepressed. I receive letters using the word guilt because they cannot do it all. Attending church is, or should be, a respite from the pressures of everyday life. It should bring peaceand contentment. If it brings pressure anddiscouragement, then something is out of balance.And the Church is not the only responsibility parentshave. Other agencies have a very legitimate reasonto call upon the resources of the family\u2014schools,employers, community\u2014all need to be balanced in. Recently a mother told me her family had moved from a rural, scattered ward where, of necessity,activities were consolidated into one weekday night.It was wonderful. They had time for their family. I can see them sitting around the table together. They moved west into a larger ward where members were closer to the chapel. She said, \"Now our familyis scheduled Tuesday night, Wednesday night,Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, andSunday night. It is very hard on our family.\" Remember, when you schedule a youngster, you schedule a family\u2014particularly the mother. Most families try very hard; but some, when burdened with problems of health and finance, simply becomeexhausted trying to keep up, and eventually theywithdraw into inactivity. They do not see that theyare moving from the one best source of light andtruth, of help with their family, into the shadowswhere danger and heartbreak await. I must touch upon what must surely be the most difficult problem to solve. Some youngsters receivevery little teaching and support at home. There isno question but that we must provide for them. Butif we provide a constant schedule of out-of-homeactivities sufficient to compensate for the loss inthose homes, it may make it difficult for attentiveparents to have time to be with and teach their ownchildren. Only prayer and inspiration can lead us tofind this difficult balance. Importance of Learning at Home We often hear, \"We must provide frequent andexciting activities lest our youth will go to lesswholesome places.\" Some of them will. But I havethe conviction that if we teach parents to beresponsible and allow them sufficient time, over the long course their children will be at home. There, at home, they can learn what cannot be effectively taught in either Church or school. At home they can learn to work and to takeresponsibility. They learn what to do when theyhave children of their own. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 279For example, in the Church children are taught the principle of tithing, but it is at home that theprinciple is applied. At home even young children canbe shown how to figure a tithe and how it is paid. One time President and Sister Harold B. Lee were in our home. Sister Lee put a handful of pennies on atable before our young son. She had him slide theshiny ones to one side and said, \"These are yourtithing; these belong to the Lord. The others areyours to keep.\" He thoughtfully looked from onepile to the other and then said, \"Don't you haveany more dirty ones?\" That was when the realteaching moment began! Use the Ward Council to Establish Balance The ward council is the perfect place to establishthe balance between home and Church. Here thebrethren of the priesthood, themselves fathers, andsisters of the auxiliaries, themselves mothers, can,with inspired insight, coordinate the work of theorganizations, each of which serves differentmembers of the family. Members of the council can compare what each organization is providing for each member and howmuch time and money are required. They can uniterather than divide families and provide watch careover single parents, the childless, the unmarried, theelderly, the handicapped\u2014and provide much morethan just activities for the children and young people. The ward council has resources often overlooked. For instance, grandparents, while not filling callings,can help young families who are finding their wayalong the same path they once walked. The Lord warned parents, \"Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, . . . that teach them not tounderstand the doctrine of repentance, faith inChrist the Son of the living God, and of baptismand the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on ofthe hands, when eight years old, the sin be uponthe heads of the parents.\" 11 The ward council is ideal for our present need. Herethe home and the family can be anchored in place,and the Church can support rather than supplantthe parents. Fathers and mothers will understandboth their obligation to teach their children andthe blessings provided by the Church.Most Important Things Learned at Home As the world grows ever more threatening, the powersof heaven draw ever closer to families and parents. I have studied much in the scriptures and have taught from them. I have read much from what the prophetsand apostles have spoken. They have had a profoundinfluence upon me as a man and as a father. But most of what I know about how our Father in Heaven really feels about us, His children, I havelearned from the way I feel about my wife and mychildren and their children. This I have learned athome. I have learned it from my parents and frommy wife's parents, from my beloved wife and frommy children, and I can therefore testify of a lovingHeavenly Father and of a redeeming Lord. In thename of Jesus Christ, amen. Notes 1. See Doctrine and Covenants 68:25. 2. Doctrine and Covenants 20:75.3. Doctrine and Covenants 43:8.4. See Mosiah Nephi Doctrine and Covenants 2:2-3. 6.

KEEPING LIFE'S DEMANDS IN BALANCE Elder M. Russell BallardOf the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1987, 15-18; or Ensign, May 1987, 14-16 A periodic review of the covenants we have madewith the Lord will help us with our priorities andwith balance in our lives. This review will help us ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 280see where we need to repent and change our lives to ensure that we are worthy of the promises thataccompany our covenants and sacred ordinances.Working out our own salvation requires goodplanning and a deliberate, valiant effort. I have a few suggestions that I hope will be valuable to those of you concerned with balancing life'sdemands. These suggestions are very basic; theirconcepts can easily be overlooked if you are notcareful. You will need a strong commitment andpersonal discipline to incorporate them into your life. Use an Eternal Perspective to Set Priorities First, think about your life and set your priorities.Find some quiet time regularly to think deeply aboutwhere you are going and what you will need to doto get there. Jesus, our exemplar, often \"withdrewhimself into the wilderness, and prayed\" (Luke 5:16).We need to do the same thing occasionally torejuvenate ourselves spiritually as the Savior did.Write down the tasks you would like to accomplisheach day. Keep foremost in mind the sacred covenantsyou have made with the Lord as you write downyour daily schedules. Set Reasonable Short-Term Goals Second, set short-term goals that you can reach. Setgoals that are well balanced\u2014not too many nor toofew, and not too high nor too low. Write down yourattainable goals and work on them according totheir importance. Pray for divine guidance in yourgoal setting. You recall that Alma said he would like to be an angel so he could \"speak with the trump of God, . . . toshake the earth, and cry (Alma 29:1). He then said, \"But behold, Iam a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to becontent with the things which the Lord hathallotted unto me. . . . \". . . Why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called?\" (Alma 29:3, 6). Become Financially Responsible and Secure Third, everyone faces financial challenges in life.Through wise budgeting, control your real needsand measure them carefully against your manywants in life. Far too many individuals and familieshave incurred too much debt. Be careful of themany attractive offers to borrow money. It is mucheasier to borrow money than it is to pay it back.There are no shortcuts to financial security. Thereare no get-rich-quick schemes that work. Perhapsno one needs the principle of balance in their livesmore than those who are driven toward accumulating\"things\" in this world. Do not trust your money to others without a thorough evaluation of any proposed investment.Our people have lost far too much money bytrusting their assets to others. In my judgment, we never will have balance in our lives unless ourfinances are securely under control. The prophet Jacob said to his people: \"Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth,nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy.Hearken diligently unto me, and remember thewords which I have spoken; and come unto theHoly One of Israel, and feast upon that whichperisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and letyour soul delight in fatness\" (2 Nephi 9:51). Brothers and sisters, remember to always pay a full tithing. Build Close Relationships with Family and Friends Fourth, stay close to your spouse, children, relatives, and friends. They will help you keep a balance inyour life. In a recent study by the Church, adults in the United States were asked to identify a timewhen they were very happy and to describe theexperience. They were also asked to describe a timewhen they were very unhappy. For most people,one thing that had made them the most happy orthe most sad was their personal relationships withothers. Much less important were their personalhealth, employment, money, and other materialthings. Build relationships with your family andfriends through open and honest communication. A good marriage and good family relationships can be maintained through gentle, loving, thoughtfulcommunication. Remember that often a glance, awink, a nod, or a touch will say more than words. A sense of humor and good listening are also vitalparts of good communication. Study the Scriptures Fifth, study the scriptures. They offer one of the bestsources we have to keep in touch with the Spirit ofthe Lord. One of the ways I have gained my sureknowledge that Jesus is the Christ is through mystudy of the scriptures. President Ezra Taft Benson ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 281has called upon members of the Church to make the study of the Book of Mormon a daily habit anda lifetime pursuit. The Apostle Paul's advice toTimothy is good counsel for each of us. He wrote,\"From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,which are able to make thee wise unto salvationthrough faith which is in Christ Jesus. \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, forinstruction in righteousness\" (2 Timothy 3:15-16). Rest, Exercise, and Relax Sixth, many people, including me, have difficultyfinding the time for sufficient rest, exercise, andrelaxation. We must schedule time on our dailycalendars for these activities if we are to enjoy ahealthy and balanced life. Good physical appearanceenhances our dignity and self-respect. \"Teach One Another the Gospel\" Seventh, the prophets have taught repeatedly thatfamilies should teach one another the gospel,preferably in a weekly family home evening. Thisfamily practice, if we are not very careful, can slowlydrift away from us. We must not lose this specialopportunity to \"teach one another the doctrine ofthe kingdom\" (D&C 88:77), which will lead familiesto eternal life. Satan is always working to destroy our testimonies, but he will not have the power to tempt or disturbus beyond our strength to resist when we arestudying the gospel and living its commandments. Pray Often My last suggestion is to pray often as individuals andas families. Parents need to exercise the disciplinerequired to lead out and motivate children to jointogether for regular family prayers. Our youth canknow the right decisions to make each day throughconstant, sincere prayer. The prophet Alma summarized the importance of prayer in these words: \"But that ye would humbleyourselves before the Lord, and call on his holyname, and watch and pray continually, that ye maynot be tempted above that which ye can bear, andthus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble,meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering\" (Alma 13:28). When I am in tunespiritually, I find that I can balance everything inmy life much more easily.Do All Things in Wisdom and Order I realize, brothers and sisters, that other suggestions could be added to these. However, I believe thatwhen we focus on a few basic objectives, we aremore likely to be able to manage the many demandsthat life makes on us. Remember, too much ofanything in life can throw us off-balance. At thesame time, too little of the important things can dothe same thing. King Benjamin counseled \"that allthese things are done in wisdom and order\"(Mosiah 4:27). Often the lack of clear direction and goals can waste away our time and energy and contribute to imbalance in our lives. A life that gets out ofbalance is much like a car tire that is out of balance.It will make the operation of the car rough andunsafe. Tires in perfect balance can give a smoothand comfortable ride. So it is with life. The ridethrough mortality can be smoother for us when westrive to stay in balance. Our main goal should beto seek \"immortality and eternal life\" (Moses 1:39).With this as our goal, why not eliminate from ourlives the things that clamor for and consume ourthoughts, feelings, and energies withoutcontributing to our reaching that goal? Help Rather than Hinder Just a word to Church leaders: Be very careful thatwhat you ask from members will help them attaineternal life. For Church members to be able tobalance their lives, Church leaders must be surethey do not require so much from members thatthey have no time to accomplish their personal andfamily goals. Do Your Best Each Day Not long ago, one of my children said, \"Dad,sometimes I wonder if I will ever make it.\" Theanswer I gave to her is the same as I would give toyou if you have had similar feelings. Just do thevery best you can each day. Do the basic thingsand, before you realize it, your life will be full ofspiritual understanding that will confirm to youthat your Heavenly Father loves you. When aperson knows this, then life will be full of purposeand meaning, making balance easier to maintain. Live every day with joy in your heart, brothers and sisters. I humbly testify that life can be wonderful,in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPRIORITIES AND BALANCE 282PROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE SELECTED TEACHINGS President Ezra Taft Benson \"My message is to return to the God-ordained fundamentals that will ensure love, stability, andhappiness in our homes. . . . \". . . A husband and wife must attain righteous unity and oneness in their goals, desires, and actions.\"Marriage itself must be regarded as a sacred covenant before God. A married couple have an obligation notonly to each other, but to God. He has promisedblessings to those who honor that covenant. \"Fidelity to one's marriage vows is absolutely essential for love, trust, and peace. Adultery isunequivocally condemned by the Lord. \"Husbands and wives who love each other will find that love and loyalty are reciprocated. This love willprovide a nurturing atmosphere for the emotionalgrowth of children. Family life should be a time ofhappiness and joy that children can look back onwith fond memories and associations. \"Restraint and self-control must be ruling principles in the marriage relationship. Couples must learn tobridle their tongues as well as their passions. \"Prayer in the home and prayer with each other will strengthen your union. Gradually thoughts,aspirations, and ideas will merge into a onenessuntil you are seeking the same purposes and goals.Rely on the Lord, the teachings of the prophets,and the scriptures for guidance and help, particularlywhen there may be disagreements and problems.\"Spiritual growth comes by solving problemstogether\u2014not by running from them. Today'sinordinate emphasis on individualism brings egotismand separation. Two individuals becoming 'oneflesh' is still the Lord's standard. (See Gen. 2:24.) \"The secret of a happy marriage is to serve God and each other. The goal of marriage is unity andoneness, as well as self-development. Paradoxically,the more we serve one another, the greater is ourspiritual and emotional growth\" (\"Salvation\u2014AFamily Affair,\" Ensign, July 1992, 2-4; see also Conference Report, Oct. 1982, 85-86; or Ensign,Nov. 1982, 59-60). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"We live in a day when the adversary stresses on every hand the philosophy of instant gratification.We seem to demand instant everything, including instant solutions to our problems. \"We are indoctrinated that somehow we should always be instantly emotionally comfortable. Whenthat is not so, some become anxious\u2014and all toofrequently seek relief from counseling, from analysis,and even from medication. \"It was meant to be that life would be a challenge. To suffer some anxiety, some depression, somedisappointment, even some failure is normal. \"Teach our members that if they have a good, miserable day once in a while, or several in a row,to stand steady and face them. Things willstraighten out. \"There is great purpose in our struggle in life. . . .\"Bishop, those who come to you are children of God. Counsel them in the Lord's own way. Teachthem to ponder it in their minds, then to pray overtheir problems. \"Remember that soothing, calming effect of reading the scriptures. Next time you are where they areread, notice how things settle down. Sense thefeeling of peace and security that comes. . . . \"In the name of Jesus Christ, amen\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1978, 135-40; or Ensign, May 1978, 91-93).Spiritual growth comes by solving problems together\u2014not by running from them. \u2014President Ezra Taft Benson ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL283MARRIAGE AND THE GREAT PLAN OF HAPPINESS Elder Joe J. Christensen Of the Presidency of the Seventy In Conference Report, Apr. 1995, 84-87; or Ensign, May 1995, 64-66 Barbara and I have been blessed with six children.Some years ago, when we had taken all of them tovisit with their grandparents, my father said, \"Joe, I think you and Barbara have started something youcan't stop.\" At this Easter season we declare to all the world that Jesus is the Christ and that through his holy priesthood and its sealing power, marriages andfamilies need never stop\u2014need never come to an end. Today I would like to speak to all of you about our marriages. Here are eight practical suggestions that,hopefully, may be of value in strengthening ourmarriages, now and in the future. Remember the Importance of Marriage 1. Remember the central importance of your marriage.Listen to these words from Elder Bruce R. McConkieon the importance of marriage in our Father inHeaven's \"great plan of happiness\" (Alma 42:8): \"From the moment of birth into mortality to the time we are married in the temple, everything wehave in the whole gospel system is to prepare andqualify us to enter that holy order of matrimonywhich makes us husband and wife in this life andin the world to come. . . . \"There is nothing in this world as important as the creation and perfection of family units\" (\"SalvationIs a Family Affair,\" Improvement Era, June 1970,pp. 43-44). Pray for the Success of Your Marriage 2. Pray for the success of your marriage. Years ago,when it was common for a General Authority to toura mission and interview all the missionaries, ElderSpencer W. Kimball, then a member of the Quorumof the Twelve, was visiting with an elder who wasjust about to finish his mission.\"When you get released, Elder, what are your plans?\" \"Oh, I plan to go back to college.\" And then with a smile he added, \"Then I hope to fall in love and getmarried.\" Elder Kimball shared this wise counsel: \"Well, don't just pray to marry the one you love. Instead, pray tolove the one you marry.\" We should pray to become more kind, courteous, humble, patient, forgiving, and, especially, less selfish. In order to recognize our personal problems orweaknesses which hinder us from being bettermarriage partners, we should come to the Lord inprayer and reap the benefits of this powerful Bookof Mormon promise: \"If men come unto me I willshow unto them their weakness . . . ; for if theyhumble themselves before me, and have faith inme, then will I make weak things become strongunto them\" (Ether 12:27). And so the need to pray. Many Church leaders and marriage counselors indicate that they have not seenone marriage in serious trouble where the couplewas still praying together daily. When problemsarise and marriages are threatened, praying togetheras a couple may be the most important remedy. Listen to Your Spouse 3. Listen. Make the time to listen to your spouse;even schedule it regularly. Visit with each other andassess how you are doing as a marriage partner. Brother Brent Barlow posed a question to a group of priesthood brethren: \"How many of you would liketo receive a revelation?\" Every hand went up. Hethen suggested that they all go home and ask theirwives how they could be better husbands. He added,\"I followed my own advice, and had a veryinformative discussion with [my wife] Susan for morethan an hour that afternoon!\" (\"To Build a BetterMarriage,\" Ensign, Sept. 1992, p. 17). A conversation like that could be a revelation for any of us. Have any of you brethren ever had your wife say something like I heard recently: \"Joe, are youlistening?\" She wasn't the only one who wonderedif I was listening. Some time ago I was taking a napand our little granddaughter Allison came and liftedup one of my eyelids and said, \"Grandpa, are youin there?\" We should be \"in there\" and responsiveto our mate. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM IN MARRIAGE 284Avoid Ceaseless Pinpricking 4. Avoid \"ceaseless pinpricking.\" Don't be too critical of each other's faults. Recognize that none of us isperfect. We all have a long way to go to become asChristlike as our leaders have urged us to become. \"Ceaseless pinpricking,\" as President Kimball called it, can deflate almost any marriage (\"Marriage andDivorce,\" 1976 Devotional Speeches of the Year [Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 1977], p. 148).Generally each of us is painfully aware of ourweaknesses, and we don't need frequent reminders.Few people have ever changed for the better as aresult of constant criticism or nagging. If we are notcareful, some of what we offer as constructive criticism is actually destructive. At times it is better to leave some things unsaid. Asa newlywed, Sister Lola Walters read in a magazinethat in order to strengthen a marriage, couplesshould have regular, candid sharing sessions inwhich they would list any mannerisms they foundto be annoying. She wrote: \"We were to name five things we found annoying, and I started off. . . . I told him that I didn't like theway he ate grapefruit. He peeled it and ate it like anorange! Nobody else I knew ate grapefruit like that.Could a girl be expected to spend a lifetime, andeven eternity, watching her husband eat grapefruitlike an . \"After I finished [with my five], it was his turn to tell the things he disliked about me. [He] said, 'Well, totell the truth, I can't think of anything I don't likeabout you, Honey.' \"Gasp.\"I quickly turned my back, because I didn't know how to explain the tears that had filled my eyesand were running down my face.\" Sister Walters concluded, \"Whenever I hear of married couples being incompatible, I always wonder if theyare suffering from what I now call the GrapefruitSyndrome\" (\"The Grapefruit Syndrome,\" Ensign, Apr. 1993, p. 13). Yes, at times, it is better to leave some things unsaid. Keep Your Courtship Alive 5. Keep your courtship alive. Make time to do things together\u2014just the two of you. As important as it isto be with the children as a family, you need regularweekly time alone together. Scheduling it will letyour children know that you feel that your marriageis so important that you need to nurture it. Thattakes commitment, planning, and scheduling. It doesn't need to be costly. The time together is the most important element. Once when my father-in-law was leaving the house after lunch to return to the field to work, mymother-in-law said, \"Albert, you get right back inhere and tell me you love me.\" He grinned andjokingly said, \"Elsie, when we were married, I toldyou I loved you, and if that ever changes, I'll letyou know.\" It's hard to overuse the expression \"Ilove you.\" Use it daily. Be Quick to Say, \"I'm Sorry\" 6. Be quick to say, \"I'm sorry.\" As hard as it is toform the words, be swift to say, \"I apologize, andplease forgive me,\" even though you are not theone who is totally at fault. True love is developedby those who are willing to readily admit personalmistakes and offenses. When differences do arise, being able to discuss and resolve them is important, but there are instanceswhen it is best to take a time-out. Biting your tongueand counting to ten or even a hundred is important.And occasionally, even letting the sun go down onyour wrath can help bring you back to the problemin the morning more rested, calm, and with a betterchance for resolution. Occasionally we hear something like, \"Why, we have been married for fifty years, and we have never hada difference of opinion.\" If that is literally the case,then one of the partners is overly dominated by theother or, as someone said, is a stranger to the truth.Any intelligent couple will have differences ofopinion. Our challenge is to be sure that we knowhow to resolve them. That is part of the process ofmaking a good marriage better. Live within Your Means 7. Learn to live within your means. Some of themost difficult challenges in marriage arise in thearea of finances. \"The American Bar Association . . .indicated that 89 percent of all divorces could betraced to quarrels and accusations over money\"(Marvin J. Ashton, \"One for the Money,\" Ensign,July 1975, p. 72). Be willing to postpone or forgosome purchases in order to stay within your budget. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE 285Pay your tithing first, and avoid debt insofar as possible. Remember that spending fifty dollars amonth less than you receive equals happiness andspending fifty more equals misery. The time mayhave come to get out the scissors and your creditcards and perform what Elder Jeffrey R. Hollandcalled some \"plastic surgery\" (\"Things We HaveLearned\u2014Together,\" Ensign, June 1986, p. 30). Share Home and Family Responsibilities 8. Be a true partner in home and familyresponsibilities. Don't be like the husband who sitsaround home expecting to be waited on, feelingthat earning the living is his chore and that his wifealone is responsible for the house and taking care ofthe children. The task of caring for home andfamily is more than one person's responsibility. Remember that you are in this partnership together. Barbara and I have discovered that we can make ourbed every morning in less than a minute and it'sdone for the day. She says that she lets me do it tohelp me feel good about myself all day, and I guessthere may be something to that. Find time to study the scriptures together, and follow this sound counsel from President Kimball:\"When a husband and wife go together frequentlyto the holy temple, kneel in prayer together in theirhome with their family, go hand in hand to theirreligious meetings, keep their lives wholly chaste,mentally and physically, . . . and both are workingtogether for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God,then happiness is at its pinnacle\" (Marriage andDivorce [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1976], p. 24). In summary: Remember the central importance of your marriage. Pray for its success. Listen. Avoid \"ceaseless pinpricking.\" Keep your courtship alive. Be quick to say, \"I'm sorry.\" Learn to live within your means. Be a true partner in home and family responsibilities. I testify that Jesus is the Christ, that the tomb was empty on that third day, and that \"as in Adam alldie, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\"(1 Corinthians 15:22). Thus with gratitude for thesealing power within the restored gospel of JesusChrist, we can confidently say with the poet, \"Ishall but love thee better after death\" (ElizabethBarrett Browning, Sonnets from the Portuguese, no. 43, line 14). In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. OVERCOMING THOSE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION: A FORMULA FOR FINDING UNITY IN MARRIAGE Elder Robert E. Wells Of the First Quorum of the Seventy Ensign, Jan. 1987, 60-62 Whenever two people live together, they are bound to have differences of opinion. Misunderstandingscan easily arise over almost every aspect of theirlives\u2014important or unimportant\u2014such as childdiscipline, housekeeping, meals, money management,decorating, which radio station to play, which movieto go to, and on and on. Since to some extent each of us is a product of our past environments and experiences, it's only naturalthat we have occasional differences. People whogrew up in the city do some things differently fromthose who grew up in the country. People from onepart of the world do things differently from thosein another part. Different ethnic, educational,financial, and religious backgrounds also producedifferences in the ways we go about the daily detailsof living. There is also a natural difference betweenmale and female points of view. But being different doesn't necessarily mean that one person is right and the other is wrong\u2014or thatone way is better than another. Unity in marriagerequires a willingness to compromise, a commitmentto make the relationship work, and a dependenceon the Lord. Even though there may be differencesof opinion, habit, or background, husbands andwives can have \"their hearts knit together in unityand in love one towards another.\" (Mosiah 18:21.) The Church has more than thirty thousand missionaries in the field today; yet serious problems ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE 286between companions are relatively few. Part of the reason is an excellent formula found in the Missionary Handbook given to all full-time missionaries. Here's what it says: \"Being able to communicate with your companion is a fundamental step in becoming a successfulmissionary. Hold an inventory session with yourcompanion. \"This is a meeting in which you discuss and set goals for your work, your companion relationship,and your personal life. . . . \"Use this time to resolve any companion conflicts by bringing them out and solving them together.\"(pp. 25-26; stock no. PBMI4201.) Of course, missionary companions are often either perfect strangers or only passing acquaintances whenthey are assigned to work together. Roommates, too,are often strangers\u2014or friends who think they knoweach other well. But hopefully, a marriage begins onmuch stronger footing, with two people who havehad sufficient time to come to know each other well. Whatever the situation, the basic ideas behind the missionary inventory session are outlined in Doctrineand Covenants 6:19: \"Admonish [your companion]in his faults, and him.Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience,faith, hope and charity.\" Following are some of myobservations on how to apply these ideas specificallyto marriage. Criticism One of the hardest things to live with in anyrelationship is criticism, real or implied. Yet somehusbands and wives demand sharply, \"Why in theworld did you do that?\" or \"I wouldn't have done itthat way!\" or \"We don't do it that way where I comefrom!\" or \"That was a dumb thing to say.\" Repeatedcriticisms of this negative and acid nature can wearaway the bonds of love until the marital fabric isweakened and ruined\u2014with sad results for bothparties. Too often, criticism attacks tender, unprotected feelings. When we criticize, we are implying blame,censure, condemnation, reprobation, anddenunciation\u2014and we're setting ourselves up asjudges, as if we were qualified to point out someoneelse's faults and weaknesses. For some people, sharp questions or quick rejoinders are habits. Criticism is a form of humor for them, andthey enjoy feeling superior when they see someoneelse's discomfort. This is a tragic, sinful attitude thatmust be changed. Talking It Out The structure of any husband/wife discussion is, of course, flexible. It could be spontaneous, occurringwhenever you or your partner sees a need. Or youcould plan to hold a session regularly just to touchbase\u2014maybe weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Someprefer to keep it very informal; they discuss theseitems while driving in the car, while taking a walk,or while on a date together. Others prefer a morestructured approach with an opening and closingprayer, a review of how things went last week (orlast month), a look at the calendar for upcomingactivities, and a discussion of personal andhusband/wife goals. However and whenever it is held, the discussion should focus on listening and understanding eachother, solving problems, and giving loving supportfor the good things that are happening in therelationship. I'd suggest that you start with the good things. Begin by expressing gratitude for each other and foryour blessings. Tell your spouse the things you'remost grateful for\u2014things you most like about himor her. Be specific. Mention detailed instances andevents that clearly illustrate good things your partnerhas done. And express your honest feelings ofgratitude and love. Relationships thrive on positivethoughts, positive words, positive actions. After sharing sincere feelings of gratitude and appreciation, you may feel that this is an appropriatetime to discuss frustrations or problems in yourrelationship. As you do, remember Paul's words: \"Letthe husband render unto the wife due benevolence:and likewise also the wife unto the husband.\"(I Cor. 7:3.) Warmth, sensitivity, and considerationshould be dominant feelings during the discussion. One of you might begin by asking, \"What can I do to be a better husband (or wife)?\" Then the otherresponds kindly with ideas and suggestions. As you share your feelings and give your partner suggestions, be humble and nonthreatening. Don'tassume that you're always the offended one andthat your spouse is the guilty one. Remember, too,that in many situations, it's not a matter of who isright and who is wrong\u2014it's simply a matter ofunderstanding each other. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE 287I'd suggest that you avoid a written list of faults. This is a time when relying on memory is moreconsiderate than reading a host of complaints.Another rule you might establish is for each of youto limit the number of suggestions you bring at onetime\u2014no more than two or three at most. That waythe experience isn't as likely to be so overwhelming. As you're the one receiving the suggestions, don't become defensive. Avoid the urge to say: \"Don'tnitpick! That doesn't happen very often!\" Avoid theurge to ask for evidence that you're guilty: \"Whendid I ever say that?\" Recognize that if it's importantenough for your companion to mention, it'ssomething that is bothering him or her. And avoidthe martyr's response: \"You expect too much.\" When your spouse suggests a way you can improve, you might respond by saying: \"You're right. I shouldpick up my dirty clothes and keep the bedroomcleaner. Please forgive me\u2014and please remind mewhen I forget. I appreciate your patience and help.\" Then ask what else you can do to be a better partner, giving your companion a chance to bring up theother things he or she wants to talk about duringthe session. After you've discussed those additional items, the tables are turned. It's time for the other partner totake the initiative and ask for suggestions forimprovement. The objective is to understand each other's feelings, to see things from the other person's point of view,and to discuss ways to resolve problems. Again, inmany cases, it's not a matter of who is right orwrong; it's often just a matter of different habitsand customs. But your willingness to talk aboutthese matters and look for solutions shows a greatdeal of love and consideration. Compromises are often necessary. As we compromise, we protect feelings and respect the other's right tobe different. But items that are important are mentioned and resolved. So, let's review this procedure proposed for your consideration and adaptation. After you have begunby expressing your love andappreciation for each other, yourdiscussion might go something like this: A husband asks: \"Honey, what can I do to be a better husband? Be honest with me. I really want to know how I canimprove.\"His wife's response, given with kindness, might be:\"There are a few little things that might help out.For example, you haven't seemed to notice, butlately you've contradicted me or disagreed with meseveral times in front of the children. That doesn'tcreate a good atmosphere in our home, and it reallyconfuses the children. I think it would be better forus and for them if we were more united.\" The husband may not think he has really been guilty of this. But it does no good at all to be defensive andask for specific illustrations of the last three timeshe has done this. If his wife thinks it's importantenough to mention, he should realize that it'simportant enough for him to change his behavior. He could say, \"I'm sorry, dear, and I'll try to watch it. If you see this kind of situation developing, pleasehelp me by giving me a signal\u2014such as saying thatwe haven't had a chance to discuss that subjectalone yet.\" Next, the wife might make the observation that her husband has been teasing a sensitive daughter toomuch about her boyfriends. Or she may remindhim that the weekly date he promised as a NewYear's resolution hasn't materialized. Then it's her turn to ask, \"Honey, what can I do to be a better wife?\" Her husband might then suggest with love that he has noticed several unbudgeted purchases lately,and encourage her to control impulse buying. Or he might mention that he prefers fried eggs to hardboiled, even if an article she read recently didcaution against fried foods. In such discussions between husband and wife, it is normal to point out many such details about livingtogether. Some are of great consequence; others mayseem trivial. But all are important for husband/wifeharmony. Turning to the Lord Wisdom suggests that prayer is an important part of marriage. We must seek the Lord's help inunderstanding each other, resolving challenges, and reaching appropriate decisions\u2014allwithout becoming defensive. Even more important, we must seek his helpin changing our behavior and ourhearts. As we invite the Lord to softenour hearts toward one another and as we sincerely repent of our weaknesses, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE 288 Wisdom suggests that prayer is an important part of marriage.he will change our hearts. He will turn us from our selfish, petty, worldly attitudes and fill us with pure,Christlike love. No amount of talking andcommunicating will really resolve our differencesunless our marriages are based upon true gospelprinciples, such as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,repentance, and obedience.As we draw near to the Lord, he can help us growcloser to one another. Only through his grace can webe blessed with Christlike love\u2014the ability to \"lovethy wife [or husband] with all heart, and . her [or him] and none else\" 42:22). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROBLEM SOLVING IN MARRIAGE 289PROPHETIC COUNSEL FINDING SAFETY IN COUNSEL Elder Henry B. Eyring Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Apr. 1997, 31-35; or Ensign, May 1997, 24-26 The Savior Wants to Lead Us to Safety The Savior has always been the protector of thosewho would accept His protection. He has said morethan once, \"How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not\"(3 Nephi 10:5). The Lord expressed the same lam ent in our own dispensation after describing the many ways in which He calls us to safety: \"How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, andby mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings,and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice oftempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, andgreat hailstorms, and by the voice of famines andpestilences of every kind, and by the great sound ofa trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by thevoice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice ofglory and honor and the riches of eternal life, andwould have saved you with an everlasting salvation,but ye would not!\" (D&C 43:25). He Counsels Us through Prophets There seems to be no end to the Savior's desire tolead us to safety. And there is constancy in the wayHe shows us the path. He calls by more than onemeans so that His message will reach those willingto accept it. And those means always includesending the message by the mouths of His prophetswhenever people have qualified to have the prophetsof God among them. Those authorized servants arealways charged with warning the people, tellingthem the way to safety. When tensions ran high in northern Missouri in the fall of 1838, the Prophet Joseph Smith called forall the Saints to gather to Far West for protection.Many were on isolated farms or in scatteredsettlements. He specifically counseled Jacob Haun,founder of a small settlement called Haun's Mill. Arecord of that time includes this: \"Brother Josephhad sent word by Haun, who owned the mill, toinform the brethren who were living there to leaveand come to Far West, but Mr. Haun did message\" (Philo Dibble, in History,\" in Four Faith Promoting Classics [1968], 90). Later, the Prophet Joseph recorded inhis history: \"Up to this day God had given mewisdom to save the people who took counsel. None had ever been killed who [had abided] by mycounsel\" (History of the Church, 5:137). Then the Prophet recorded the sad truth that innocent livescould have been saved at Haun's Mill had hiscounsel been received and followed. In our own time, we have been warned with counsel on where to find safety from sin and from sorrow.One of the keys to recognizing those warnings isthat they are repeated. For instance, more thanonce in these general conferences, you have heardour prophet say that he would quote a precedingprophet and would therefore be a second witnessand sometimes even a third. Each of us who haslistened has heard President [Spencer W.] Kimballgive counsel on the importance of a mother in thehome and then heard President [Ezra Taft] Bensonquote him, and we have heard President [Gordon B.]Hinckley quote them both. The Apostle Paul wrotethat \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses shallevery word be established\" (2 Corinthians 13:1).One of the ways we may know that the warning isfrom the Lord is that the law of witnesses, authorizedwitnesses, has been invoked. When the words ofprophets seem repetitive, that should rivet ourattention and fill our hearts with gratitude to live in such a blessed time. Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith. \u2014Elder Henry B. Eyring ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL290Follow the Prophet or Choose Another Influence Looking for the path to safety in the counsel of prophets makes sense to those with strong faith.When a prophet speaks, those withlittle faith may think that they hearonly a wise man giving good advice.Then if his counsel seems comfortableand r easonable, squaring with what they want to do, they take it. If it does not, they consider it either faultyadvice or they see their circumstancesas justifying their being an exceptionto the counsel. Those without faithmay think that they hear only men seeking to exertinfluence for some selfish motive. They may mockand deride, as did a man named Korihor, with thesewords recorded in the Book of Mormon: \"And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to yourown desires; and ye keep them down, even as itwere in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves withthe labors of their hands, that they durst not lookup with boldness, and that they durst not enjoytheir rights and privileges\" (Alma 30:27). Korihor was arguing, as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of time, that totake counsel from the servants of God is to surrenderGod-given rights of independence. But the argumentis false because it misrepresents reality. When wereject the counsel which comes from God, we do notchoose to be independent of outside influence. Wechoose another influence. We reject the protectionof a perfectly loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Fatherin Heaven, whose whole purpose, as that of HisBeloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to give us allthat He has, and to bring us home again in familiesto the arms of His love. In rejecting His counsel, wechoose the influence of another power, whosepurpose is to make us miserable and whose motiveis hatred. We have moral agency as a gift of God.Rather than the right to choose to be free ofinfluence, it is the inalienable right to submitourselves to whichever of those powers we choose. Another fallacy is to believe that the choice to accept or not accept the counsel of prophets is no morethan deciding whether to accept good advice andgain its benefits or to stay where we are. But thechoice not to take prophetic counsel changes thevery ground upon which we stand. It becomes moredangerous. The failure to take prophetic counsellessens our power to take inspired counsel in thefuture. The best time to have decided to help Noahbuild the ark was the first time he asked. Each timehe asked after that, each failure to r espond would have lessened sensitivity to the Spirit. And so each time his request wouldhave seemed more foolish, until therain came. And then it was too late. Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspiredcounsel or decided that I was anexception, I came to know that I hadput myself in harm's way. Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets, feltit confirmed in prayer, and then followed it, I have found that I moved toward safety. Along the path, Ihave found that the way had been prepared for meand the rough places made smooth. God led me tosafety along a path which was prepared with lovingcare, sometimes prepared long before. Those with Priesthood Keys Lead Us to Safety The account at the beginning of the Book of Mormon is of a prophet of God, Lehi. He was also the leaderof a family. He was warned by God to take those heloved to safety. Lehi's experience is a type of whathappens as God gives counsel through His servants.Of Lehi's family, only those who had faith and whothemselves received confirming revelation saw boththe danger and the way to safety. For those withoutfaith, the move into the wilderness seemed notonly foolish but dangerous. Like all prophets, Lehi,to his dying day, tried to show his family wheresafety would lie for them. He knew that the Savior holds responsible those to whom He delegates priesthood keys. With those keyscomes the power to give counsel that will show usthe way to safety. Those with keys are responsible towarn even when their counsel might not be followed.Keys are delegated down a line which passes fromthe prophet through those responsible for eversmaller groups of members, closer and closer tofamilies and to individuals. That is one of the waysby which the Lord makes a stake a place of safety.For instance, I have sat with my wife in a meetingof parents called by our bishop, our neighbor, sothat he could warn us of spiritual dangers faced byour children. I heard more than the voice of my ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROPHETIC COUNSEL 291 The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future.wise friend. I heard a servant of Jesus Christ, with keys, meeting his responsibility to warn and passingto us, the parents, the responsibility to act. Whenwe honor the keys of that priesthood channel bylistening and giving heed, we tie ourselves to a lifeline which will not fail us in any storm. Our Heavenly Father loves us. He sent His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. He knew that inmortality we would be in grave danger, the worst ofit from the temptations of a terrible adversary. Thatis one of the reasons why the Savior has providedpriesthood keys so that those with ears to hear andfaith to obey could go to places of safety. Accept Counsel Humbly Having listening ears requires humility. You rememberthe Lord's warning to Thomas B. Marsh. He wasthen the President of the Quorum of the TwelveApostles. The Lord knew that President Marsh andhis brethren of the Twelve would be tested. He gavecounsel about taking counsel. The Lord said, \"Bethou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead theeby the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers\"(D&C 112:10). The Lord added a warning that is applicable to any who follow a living prophet: \"Exalt not yourselves;rebel not against my servant Joseph; for verily I sayunto you, I am with him, and my hand shall beover him; and the keys which I have given untohim, and also to youward, shall not be taken fromhim till I come\" (D&C 112:15). Follow Counsel for the Safety of Others God offers us counsel not just for our own safety,but for the safety of His other children, whom weshould love. There are few comforts so sweet as toknow that we have been an instrument in the handsof God in leading someone else to safety. Thatblessing generally requires the faith to follow counselwhen it is hard to do. An example from Churchhistory is that of Reddick Newton Allred. He was oneof the rescue party sent out by Brigham Young tobring in the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies.When a terrible storm hit, Captain Grant, captainof the rescue party, decided to leave some of thewagons by the Sweetwater River as he pressed aheadto find the handcart companies. With the blizzardshowling and the weather becoming life-threatening,two of the men left behind at the Sweetwater decidedthat it was foolish to stay. They thought that either the handcart companies had wintered oversomewhere or had perished. They decided to returnto the Salt Lake Valley and tried to persuade everyoneelse to do the same. Reddick Allred refused to budge. Brigham had sent them out, and his priesthood leader had told himto wait there. The others took several wagons, allfilled with needed supplies, and started back. Evenmore tragic, each wagon they met coming out fromSalt Lake they turned back as well. They turned back77 wagons, returning all the way to Little Mountain,where President Young learned what was happeningand turned them around again. When the WillieCompany was finally found, and had made thatheartrending pull up and over Rocky Ridge, it wasReddick Allred and his wagons that waited for them.(See Rebecca Bartholomew and Leonard J. Arrington,Rescue of the 1856 Handcart Companies [1992], 29, 33-34.) In this conference you will hear inspired counsel, for instance, to reach out to the new members of theChurch. Those with the faith of Reddick NewtonAllred will keep offering friendship even when itseems not to be needed or to have no effect. Theywill persist. When some new member reaches thepoint of spiritual exhaustion, they will be thereoffering kind words and fellowship. They will thenfeel the same divine approval Brother Allred felt whenhe saw those handcart pioneers struggling towardhim, knowing he could offer them safety becausehe had followed counsel when it was hard to do. While the record does not prove it, I am confident that Brother Allred prayed while he waited. I amconfident that his prayers were answered. He thenknew that the counsel to stand fast was from God.We must pray to know that. I promise you answersto such prayers of faith. Be Patient When Counsel Seems Not to Apply Sometimes we will receive counsel that we cannot understand or that seems not to apply to us, evenafter careful prayer and thought. Don't discard thecounsel, but hold it close. If someone you trustedhanded you what appeared to be nothing morethan sand with the promise that it contained gold,you might wisely hold it in your hand awhile,shaking it gently. Every time I have done that withcounsel from a prophet, after a time the gold flakeshave begun to appear and I have been grateful. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROPHETIC COUNSEL 292We are blessed to live in a time when the priesthood keys are on the earth. We are blessed to know whereto look and how to listen for the voice that will fulfillthe promise of the Lord that He will gather us tosafety. I pray for you and for me that we will havehumble hearts, that we will listen, that we will pray,that we will wait for the deliverance of the Lord,which is sure to come as we are faithful. I testify thatGod, our Heavenly Father, lives and loves us. This is the Church of Jesus Christ. He lives and loves us. He isthe head of the Church, and He is our Savior. I testifythat Gordon B. Hinckley holds all the keys of thepriesthood of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALPROPHETIC COUNSEL 293SAME-GENDER ATTRACTION SELECTED TEACHINGS President Gordon B. Hinckley \"What is your Church's attitude toward homosexuality?\"In the first place, we believe that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God. We believethat marriage may be eternal through exercise of thepower of the everlasting priesthood in the house ofthe Lord. \"People inquire about our position on those who consider themselves so-called gays and lesbians. Myresponse is that we love them as sons and daughtersof God. They may have certain inclinations whichare powerful and which may be difficult to control.Most people have inclinations of one kind or anotherat various times. If they do not act upon theseinclinations, then they can go forward as do allother members of the Church. If they violate thelaw of chastity and the moral standards of theChurch, then they are subject to the discipline ofthe Church, just as others are. \"We want to help these people, to strengthen them, to assist them with their problems and to help themwith their difficulties. But we cannot stand idle ifthey indulge in immoral activity, if they try to upholdand defend and live in a so-called same-sex marriagesituation. To permit such would be to make light of the very serious and sacred foundation of God-sanctioned marriage and its very purpose, therearing of families\" (in Conference Report, Oct.1998, 91; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 71).The Family: A Proclamation to the World \"All human beings\u2014male and female\u2014are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, eachhas a divine nature and destiny. Gender is anessential characteristic of individual premortal,mortal, and eternal identity and purpose\" ( Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). SAME-GENDER ATTRACTION Elder Dallin H. Oaks Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Ensign, Oct. 1995, 7-14 Every Latter-day Saint knows that God has forbidden all sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage.Most are also aware of the Savior's teaching that itis sinful for a man to look upon and lust after awoman (see Matt. 5:28; D&C 42:23; 63:16). Attraction between man and woman was instilled by the Creator to ensure the perpetuation of mortallife and to draw husband and wife together in thefamily setting he prescribed for the accomplishmentof his purposes, including the raising of children. Incontrast, deviations from God's commandments inthe use of procreative powers are grave sins.President Joseph F. Smith taught: \"Sexual union is lawful in wedlock, and if participated in with right intent is honorable and sanctifying.But without the bonds of marriage, sexual indulgenceis a debasing sin, abominable in the sight of Deity.\" 1 Some Latter-day Saints face the confusion and painthat result when a man or a woman engages insexual behavior with a person of the same sex, oreven when a person has erotic feelings that couldlead toward such behavior. How should Churchleaders, parents, and other members of the Churchreact when faced with the religious, emotional, andfamily challenges that accompany such behavior orfeelings? What do we say to a young person whoreports that he or she is attracted toward or has eroticthoughts or feelings about persons of the same sex?How should we respond when a person announcesthat he is a homosexual or she is a lesbian and that Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. \u2014The Family: A Proclamation to the World ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL294scientific evidence \"proves\" he or she was \"born that way\"? How do we react when persons who donot share our beliefs accuse us of being intolerantor unmerciful when we insist that erotic feelingstoward a person of the same sex are irregular andthat any sexual behavior of that nature is sinful? Gospel Doctrines Our attitudes toward these questions are dictated bygospel doctrines we know to be true. 1. God created us \"male and female\" (D&C 20:18; Moses 2:27; Gen. 1:27). What we call gender was an essential characteristic of our existence priorto our birth. 2 2. The purpose of mortal life and the mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints isto prepare the sons and daughters of God for theirdestiny\u2014to become like our heavenly parents. 3. Our eternal destiny\u2014exaltation in the celestial kingdom\u2014is made possible only through theatonement of Jesus Christ (through which webecame and can remain \"innocent before God\"[D&C 93:38]) and is only available to a man and a woman who have entered into and beenfaithful to the covenants of an eternal marriagein a temple of God (see D&C 131:1-4; 132). 4. Through the merciful plan of our Father in Heaven, persons who desire to do what is rightbut through no fault of their own are unable tohave an eternal marriage in mortal life will havean opportunity to qualify for eternal life in aperiod following mortality, if they keep thecommandments of God and are true to theirbaptismal and other covenants. 3 5. In addition to the cleansing effect of the Atonement, God has given us agency\u2014the powerto choose between good (the path of life) andevil (the path of spiritual death and destruction[see 2 Ne. 2:27; Moses 4:3]). Although theconditions of mortality can limit our freedom(such as by restricting our mobility or our powerto act on certain options), when we have reachedthe age or condition of accountability (see Moro.8:5-12; D&C 68:27; 101:78) no mortal or spiritualpower can deprive us of our agency. 6. To accomplish one of the purposes of mortal life, it is essential that we be tested against oppositionto see if we will keep the commandments ofGod (see 2 Ne. 2:11; Abr. 3:25-26). To providethat opposition, Satan and his followers arepermitted to tempt us to use our agency and ourfreedom to choose evil and to commit sin. 7. Because Satan desires that \"all men might be miserable like unto himself\" (2 Ne. 2:27), his moststrenuous efforts are directed at encouragingthose choices and actions that will thwart God'splan for his children. He seeks to undermine theprinciple of individual accountability, to persuadeus to misuse our sacred powers of procreation,to discourage marriage and childbearing byworthy men and women, and to confuse what itmeans to be male or female. 8. In all of this, the devil, who has no body, seeks to persuade mortals to corrupt their bodies by\"choos[ing] eternal death, according to the willof the flesh . . . , which giveth the of thedevil power to captivate, to bring [them] downto hell, that he may reign over [them] in his ownkingdom\" (2 Ne. 2:29). 9. The First Presidency has declared that \"there is a distinction between [1] immoral thoughts andfeelings and [2] participating in either immoralheterosexual or any homosexual behavior.\" 4 Although immoral thoughts are less serious thanimmoral behavior, such thoughts also need tobe resisted and repented of because we knowthat \"our thoughts will also condemn us\" (Alma12:14). Immoral thoughts (and the less seriousfeelings that lead to them) can bring aboutbehavior that is sinful. 10. Because of God's great love for his children, even the worst sinners (or almost all of them)will ultimately be rewarded with assignment to akingdom of glory. 5Persons who have lived good lives and received most of the ordinances ofsalvation but have failed to qualify for exaltationthrough eternal marriage will be saved in a lesserplace in the celestial kingdom where there is noeternal increase (see D&C 131:1-4). 11. In the midst of the challenges and choices of mortal life, we are all under the Savior'scommandment to \"love one another\" (John15:12, 17). As the First Presidency said in a recent message: \"We are asked to be kinder with one another, moregentle and forgiving. We are asked to be slower toanger and more prompt to help. We are asked toextend the hand of friendship and resist the hand ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 295of retribution. We are called upon to be true disciples of Christ, to love one another with genuinecompassion, for that is the way Christ loved us.\" 6 Kindness, compassion, and love are powerfulinstruments in strengthening us to carry heavyburdens imposed without any fault of our own and to do what we know to be right. Application of Doctrines and Responsibilities These doctrines, commandments, and responsibilities guide us in answering the questions posed earlier inthis article. Our doctrines obviously condemn those who engage in so-called \"gay bashing\"\u2014physical or verbal attackson persons thought to be involved in homosexualor lesbian behavior. We should extend compassion to persons who suffer from ill health, including those who are infectedwith HIV or who are ill with AIDS (who may or maynot have acquired their condition from sexualrelations). We should encourage such persons toparticipate in the activities of the Church. Applying the First Presidency's distinction to the question of same-sex relationships, we shoulddistinguish between (1) homosexual (or lesbian)\"thoughts and feelings\" (which should be resistedand redirected), and (2) \"homosexual behavior\"(which is a serious sin). We should note that the words homosexual, lesbian, and gayare adjectives to describe particular thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. We should refrain from using these words as nouns to identify particular conditionsor specific persons. Our religious doctrine dictatesthis usage. It is wrong to use these words to denotea condition, because this implies that a person is consigned by birth to a circumstance in which heor she has no choice in respect to the criticallyimportant matter of sexual behavior. Feelings are another matter. Some kinds of feelingsseem to be inborn. Others are traceable to mortalexperiences. Still other feelings seem to be acquiredfrom a complex interaction of \"nature and nurture.\"All of us have some feelings we did not choose, butthe gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that we stillhave the power to resist and reform our feelings (asneeded) and to assure that they do not lead us toentertain inappropriate thoughts or to engage insinful behavior.Different persons have different physicalcharacteristics and different susceptibilities to thevarious physical and emotional pressures we mayencounter in our childhood and adult environments.We did not choose these personal susceptibilitieseither, but we do choose and will be accountablefor the attitudes, priorities, behavior, and \"lifestyle\"we engraft upon them. Essential to our doctrinal position on these matters is the difference between our freedom and our agency.Our freedom can be limited by various conditionsof mortality, but God's gift of agency cannot belimited by outside forces, because it is the basis forour accountability to him. The contrast betweenfreedom and agency can be illustrated in the contextof a hypothetical progression from feelings tothoughts to behavior to addiction. This progressioncan be seen on a variety of matters, such asgambling and the use of tobacco and alcohol. Just as some people have different feelings than others, some people seem to be unusually susceptibleto particular actions, reactions, or addictions.Perhaps such susceptibilities are inborn or acquiredwithout personal choice or fault, like the unnamedailment the Apostle Paul called \"a thorn in the flesh,the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I shouldbe exalted above measure\" (2 Cor. 12:7). One personmay have feelings that draw him toward gambling,but unlike those who only dabble, he becomes a compulsive gambler. Another person may have ataste for tobacco and a susceptibility to its addiction.Still another may have an unusual attraction toalcohol and the vulnerability to be readily propelledinto alcoholism. Other examples may include a hottemper, a contentious manner, a covetous attitude,and so on. In each case (and in other examples that could be given) the feelings or other characteristics thatincrease susceptibility to certain behavior may havesome relationship to inheritance. But the relationshipis probably very complex. The inherited elementmay be nothing more than an increased likelihoodthat an individual will acquire certain feelings if heor she encounters particular influences during thedevelopmental years. But regardless of our differentsusceptibilities or vulnerabilities, which representonly variations on our mortal freedom (in mortalitywe are only \"free according to the flesh\" [2 Ne. 2:27]),we remain responsible for the exercise of our agencyin the thoughts we entertain and the behavior we ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 296choose. I discussed this contrast in a talk I gave at Brigham Young University several years ago: \"Most of us are born with [or develop] thorns in the flesh, some more visible, some more serious thanothers. We all seem to have susceptibilities to onedisorder or another, but whatever our susceptibilities,we have the will and the power to control ourthoughts and our actions. This must be so. God hassaid that he holds us accountable for what we do andwhat we think, so our thoughts and actions must becontrollable by our agency. Once we have reached theage or condition of accountability, the claim 'I wasborn that way' does not excuse actions or thoughtsthat fail to conform to the commandments of God.We need to learn how to live so that aweakness that is mortal will notprevent us from achieving the goalthat is eternal. \"God has promised that he will consecrate our afflictions for our gain(see 2 Ne. 2:2). The efforts we expendin overcoming any inherited [ordeveloped] weakness build a spiritualstrength that will serve us throughouteternity. Thus, when Paul prayed thricethat his 'thorn in the flesh' would depart from him,the Lord replied, 'My grace is sufficient for thee: formy strength is made perfect in weakness.' Obedient,Paul concluded: \"'Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. \"'Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, indistresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak,then am I strong' (2 Cor. 12:9-10). \"Whatever our susceptibilities or tendencies [feelings], they cannot subject us to eternal consequencesunless we exercise our free agency to do or thinkthe things forbidden by the commandments of God.For example, a susceptibility to alcoholism impairsits victim's freedom to partake without addiction,but his free agency allows him to abstain and thusescape the physical debilitation of alcohol and thespiritual deterioration of addiction. \". . . Beware the argument that because a person has strong drives toward a particular act, he has no powerof choice and therefore no responsibility for hisactions. This contention runs counter to the mostfundamental premises of the gospel of Jesus Christ. \"Satan would like us to believe that we are not responsible in this life. That is the result he tried toachieve by his contest in the pre-existence. A personwho insists that he is not responsible for the exerciseof his free agency because he was 'born that way' istrying to ignore the outcome of the War in Heaven.We areresponsible, and if we argue otherwise, our efforts become part of the propaganda effort of theAdversary. \"Individual responsibility is a law of life. It applies in the law of man and the law of God. Society holds people responsible to control their impulses so we can live in acivilized society. God holds hischildren responsible to control theirimpulses in order that they can keephis commandments and realize theireternal destiny. The law does notexcuse the short-tempered man whosurrenders to his impulse to pull atrigger on his tormentor, or the greedyman who surrenders to his impulse to steal, or the pedophile who surrenders to his impulse to satisfy his sexual urges with children. . . . \"There is much we do not know about the extent of freedom we have in view of the various thorns inthe flesh that afflict us in mortality. But this muchwe do know; we all have our free agency and God holds us accountable for the way we use it inthought and deed. That is fundamental.\" 7 The Insights of Science In contrast to our doctrinal approach, many personsapproach the problems of same-sex attraction solelyfrom the standpoint of current science. While I amnot qualified as a scientist, with the aid of scientificliterature and with the advice of qualified scientistsand practitioners, I will attempt to refute the claimof some that scientific discoveries demonstrate thatavowed homosexuals and lesbians were \"born that way.\" We live in a time of accelerating scientific discoveries about the human body. We know thatour inheritance explains many of our physicalcharacteristics. At the same time, we also know thatour behavior is profoundly influenced by psychosocial ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 297 We need to learn how to live so that a weakness that is mortal will not prevent us from achieving the goal that is eternal.factors such as parental and sibling relationships (especially during the formative years) and theculture in which we live. The debate over whether, orthe extent to which, specific behavior is attributableto \"nature\" or to \"nurture\" is centuries old. Itsapplication to the subject of same-sex feelings andbehaviors is only one manifestation of a highlycomplex subject on which scientific knowledge isstill in its infancy. Some scientists deny that behavior is genetically influenced. 8Others are advocates of evidence or theories suggesting that \"there is substantial evidencefor genetic influence on sexual orientation.\" 9 We are, of course, aware of evidence that inheritanceexplains susceptibilities to certain diseases like somecancers and some other illnesses like diabetesmellitus. There are also theories and some evidencethat inheritance is a factor in susceptibilities tovarious behavior-related disorders like aggression,alcoholism, and obesity. It is easy to hypothesizethat inheritance plays a role in sexual orientation.However, it is important to remember, as concededby two advocates of this approach, that \"the conceptof substantial heritability should not be involve interactions betweenconstitutional predispositions environmentalevents.\" 10 Wherever they fall along the spectrum betweenoutright rejection and total acceptance of biologicaldeterminism of sexual orientation, most scientistsconcede that the current evidence is insufficient andthat firm conclusions must await many additionalscientific studies. A study of fifty-six pairs of identical male twins in which one twin classified himself as \"gay\" reportedthat 52 percent of the co-twins also classifiedthemselves as gay. 11A similar study of female identical twins yielded approximately the sameproportion of co-twins who classified themselves asgay (thirty-four of seventy-one pairs, 48 percent). 12 If these studies show some inherited influence onwhatever causes a man or woman to classify himselfor herself as homosexual or lesbian, it is clear thatthis influence is not determinative. As a prominentscientist observed, \"Even the identical twin of a gayman has a 50 percent or more chance of beingheterosexual\u2014even though he has the exact samegenes and is reared by the same parents.\" 13We should also note that the results of these studies(and others described below) are based on thesubjects' self-classifications, a shaky foundation forscientific conclusions when \"there is still nouniversally accepted definition of homosexualityamong clinicians and behavioral scientists\u2014letalone a consensus regarding its origins.\" 14 In any emerging area of knowledge, a new source ofevidence is most welcome. In July 1993, Dr. DeanHamer made worldwide headlines when heannounced that he had found \"a statisticallysignificant correlation between the inheritance ofgenetic markers [an identifiable strip of DNA] onchromosomal region Xq28 sexual orientationin a selected group of . . . homosexual men andtheir relatives over age 18.\" In other words, \"itappears that Xq28 contains a gene that contributesto homosexual orientation in males.\" 15Putting the most positive interpretation on his discovery, Dr.Hamer's subsequent book concludes: \"We can make only educated guesses about the importance of Xq28 in the population at large. Onthe high side, the region couldn't possibly influencemore than 67 percent of gay men, the proportion'linked' to this region in our highly selected groupof gay siblings. On the low side, if much ofhomosexuality is caused by environmental factors,or by a large number of interacting genes, Xq28could account for as little as a few percent of thevariation in male sexual orientation. The medianrange, taken from our linkage data and from theavailable twin and family studies, suggests thatXq28 plays some role in about 5 to 30 percent of gay men. The broad range of these estimates isproof that much more work remains to be done.\" 16 \"Some role in about 5 to 30 percent\" of self-classified\"gay\" men surely falls far short of justifying theclaim that science has shown that \"homosexuality\"is \"caused by\" genetic inheritance. One eminentscientist identified two of the uncertainties: \"What evidence exists thus far of innate biological traits underlying homosexuality is flawed. . . .Confirmation of genetic research purporting toshow that homosexuality is heritable makes clearneither what is inherited nor how it influencessexual orientation.\" 17 In their impressive reappraisal of biologic theoriesof human sexual orientation, Drs. Byne and Parsonsof Columbia University's Department of Psychiatryoffer these important cautions and suggestions: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 298\"It is imperative that clinicians and behavioral scien- tists begin to appreciate the complexities of sexualorientation and resist the urge to search for simplisticexplanations, either psychosocial or biologic. \"Conspicuously absent from most theorizing on the origins of sexual orientation is an active role of theindividual in constructing his or her identity. . . .We propose an interactional model in which genesor hormones do not specify sexual orientationper se, but instead bias particular personality traitsand ther eby influence the manner in which an individual and his or her environment interact as sexual orientation and other personalitycharacteristics unfold developmentally.\" 18 This observation, but one of many suggestions fromscientists, is particularly persuasive because it takesaccount of the vital element of individual choice thatwe know to be a true principle of our mortalcondition. The Responsibilities of Church Officers and Members In their 14 November 1991 letter concerning the importance of the law of chastity, the First Presidencydeclared: \"Sexual relations are proper only betweenhusband and wife appropriately expressed withinthe bonds of marriage. Any othersexual contact, including fornication,adultery, and homosexual and lesbianbehavior, is sinful.\" Consistent with that direction, Church officers are responsible to calltransgressors to repentance and toremind them of the principle theprophet Samuel taught the wickedNephites: \"Ye have sought all the daysof your lives for that which ye couldnot obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, whichthing is contrary to the nature of that righteousnesswhich is in our great and Eternal Head\" (Hel. 13:38). Persons cannot continue to engage in serious sin and remain members of the Church. And disciplinecan be given for encouraging sin by others. There isno Church discipline for improper thoughts orfeelings (though there is encouragement to improvethem), but there are consequences for behavior. Inthe same sermon in which he taught that men shouldnot be \"cast out,\" the Savior commanded his servantsthat \"ye shall not suffer any one knowingly topartake of my flesh and blood unworthily . . . ;therefore if ye . . . yeshall forbid him\" (3 Ne. 18:28-29). The Savior alsocommanded, \"But if he repent not he shall not benumbered among my people, that he may notdestroy my people\" (v. 31; see also Mosiah 26:36;Alma 5:56-61). Consequently, if transgressors donot respond to calls to repentance, the shepherds ofthe Church flock must take disciplinary action infulfillment of their God-given responsibilities. At the same time, we should always distinguish between sinful acts and inappropriate feelings or potentially dangerous susceptibilities. We should reach out lovingly to those who are struggling to resisttemptation. The First Presidency did this in their14 November 1991 letter. After reaffirming the sinfulnature of \"fornication, adultery, and homosexualand lesbian behavior,\" the Presidency added: \"Individuals and their families desiring help with these matters should seek counsel from their bishop,branch president, stake or district president. Weencourage Church leaders and members to reachout with love and understanding to those strugglingwith these issues. Many will respond to Christlikelove and inspired counsel as they receive aninvitation to come back and apply the atoning and healing power of the Savior. (See Isaiah53:4-5; Mosiah 4:2-3.)\" Similarly, in a conference address on this same subject, President Gordon B.Hinckley said: \"I desire now to saywith emphasis that our concern forthe bitter fruit of sin is coupled with Christlike sympathy for its victims,innocent or culpable. We advocate theexample of the Lord, who condemnedthe sin, yet loved the sinner. Weshould reach out with kindness and comfort to the afflicted, ministering to their needsand assisting them with their problems.\" 19 Despite such invitations and assurances, the Churchand its members continue to experience misunder-standings about our positions on these matters. Lastfall in an interview with a television reporter, oneof our Church officials was asked, \"What is beingdone in the Church to try to stop the atmosphereof hate towards homosexuals?\" Nine years ago,during a television interview on this subject, I wasquestioned about reports that the Church taught or ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 299 Sexual relations are proper only between husband and wife appropriately expressed within the bonds of marriage.implied \"that these people are somehow pariahs . . . and these people hate themselves and that this isan attitude brought forth by the Church.\" More significantly, we also receive such questions from faithful members. A recent letter is illustrative: \"Another concern we have is the way in which our sons and daughters are classified as people whopractice deviant and lascivious behavior. Perhapssome do, but most do not. These young men andwomen want only to survive, have a spiritual life,and stay close to their families and the Church. It isespecially damaging when these negative referencesare spoken from the pulpit. We believe such talksonly create more depression and a tremendousamount of guilt, shame, and lack of self-worth, whichthey have endured throughout their entire lives.There is sometimes a real lack of the pure love ofChrist expressed to help them through their ordeals.We will all appreciate anything you can do to helpwith the plight of these much misunderstoodchildren of our Father in Heaven. If some of theGeneral Authorities could express more sensitivityto this problem, it would surely help to avoid suicidesand schisms that are caused within families. Manysimply cannot tolerate the fact that Church membersjudge them as 'evil people,' and they, therefore, findsolace in gay-oriented lifestyles.\" 20 These communications surely show the need forimprovement in our communications with brothersand sisters who are struggling with problems\u2014alltypes of problems. Each member of Christ's churchhas a clear-cut doctrinal responsibility to show forthlove and to extend help and understanding.Sinners, as well as those who are struggling to resistinappropriate feelings, are not people to be cast outbut people to be loved and helped (see 3 Ne.18:22-23, 30, 32). At the same time, Church leadersand members cannot avoid their responsibility toteach correct principles and righteous behavior (onall subjects), even if this causes discomfort to some. Church leaders are sometimes asked whether there is any place in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for persons with homosexual or lesbiansusceptibilities or feelings. Of course there is. Thedegree of difficulty and the pattern necessary to forgobehavior and to control thoughts will be differentwith different individuals, but the message of hopeand the hand of fellowship offered by the Church isthe same for all who strive.I tried to describe the crucial distinctions in myanswer to the television reporter who implied thatthe Church taught that \"these people are somehowpariahs.\" I said: \"The person that's working [to resist] those tendencies ought not to feel himself to be a pariah. Now, quitea different thing is sexual relations outside ofmarriage. A person engaging in that kind of behaviorshould well feel guilt. They should well feelthemselves estranged from God, who has givencommandments against that kind of behavior. It'snot surprising to me that they would feel estrangedfrom their church. What surprises me is that theywould feel that the Church can revoke God'scommandments. . . . To the woman taken in adultery(which is a pretty good precedent for us), . . [theSavior] was merciful but he said, 'Gothy way and sin no more.' He loved the sinner; hecondemned the sin. I think the Church does the samething, imperfectly perhaps, but that's what we teachour members: love the sinner, condemn the sin.\" 21 The struggles of those who are troubled by same-sexattraction are not unique. There are many kinds oftemptations, sexual and otherwise. The duty to resistsin applies to all of them. The most important help the Church can offer to persons who have surrendered to sin or to thosewho are struggling to resist it is to fulfill its divinemission to teach true doctrine and administer thedivine ordinances of the restored gospel. The gospelapplies on the same basis to everyone. Its central truthis our Savior's atonement and resurrection, that wemight have immortality and eternal life. To achievethat destiny, an eternal marriage is the divine andprescribed goal for every child of God, in this life orin the life to come. Nevertheless, this sacred goalmust come about in the Lord's way. For example,President Gordon B. Hinckley has declared that\"marriage should not be viewed as a therapeutic stepto solve problems such as homosexual inclinationsor practices.\" 22 Through Christ and his church, those who strugglecan obtain help. This help comes through fastingand prayer, through the truths of the gospel, throughchurch attendance and service, through the counselof inspired leaders, and, where necessary, throughprofessional assistance with problems that requiresuch help. Another important source of help is thestrengthening influence of loving brothers andsisters. All should understand that persons (and ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSAME -GENDER ATTRACTION 300their family members) struggling with the burden of same-sex attraction are in special need of thelove and encouragement that is a clear responsibilityof Church members, who have signified by covenanttheir willingness \"to bear one another's burdens\"(Mosiah 18:8) \"and so fulfil the law of Christ\" (Gal. 6:2). The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who gives us the light and the strengthto overcome the obstacles of mortality and to useour God-given agency to choose the behavior thatwill lead us to our divine destiny. We are promised:\"There hath no temptation taken you but such as iscommon to man: but God is faithful, who will notsuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; butwill with the temptation also make a way to escape,that ye may be able to bear it\" (1 Cor. 10:13). Conclusion The differing perspectives of scientific evidence andreligious doctrine can be likened to the differencebetween studying about an automobile by observingits operation and disassembling and analyzing itsvarious parts or by reading the operator's manualwritten by the manufacturer. Much can be learnedby observation and analysis, but that method willyield only partial knowledge of the function andpotential of a machine. The best and most completeknowledge about the operation and potential of a machine will be revealed by studying the manualwritten by its manufacturer. The operator's manualfor our bodies and souls is the scriptures, written bythe God who created us and interpreted by hisprophets. These are the best sources of knowledgeabout the purpose of life and the behavior andthoughts we should cultivate in order to live inhappiness and to achieve our divine destiny. All who struggle with the challenges of mortality can identify with the lament in the psalm of Nephi:\"O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorrowethbecause of my flesh; my soul grieveth because ofmine iniquities. \"I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me\" (2 Ne.4:17-18). To have the will and strength to resist sin, we must trust in God and pray for his help. Nephi rejoicedin the Lord, who had supported him and led himthrough his afflictions (see v. 20). \"Why should Iyield to sin, because of my flesh?\" Nephi asked (v. 27), adding a prayer that the Lord would redeemhis soul and \"make me that I may shake at theappearance of sin\" (v. 31). Nephi concludes with words that apply directly to those who seek to find their way through thedifficulties discussed in this article: \"O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm offlesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth histrust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he thatputteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm. \"Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh\" (vs. 34-35). He who has commanded us to be perfect has shed his blood to provide us the opportunity to achieveour divine destiny. His confidence in our ability toachieve eternal life is manifest in his incredibleinvitation: \"What manner of men ought ye to be?Verily I say unto you, even as I am\" (3 Ne. 27:27).

If you find yourself struggling with same-gender attraction, seekcounsel from your parents and bishop. They willhelp you\" ( For the Strength of Youth: Fulfilling Our Duty to God, 28). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I have time to discuss one other question: 'Why does the Church become involved in issues that comebefore the legislature and the electorate?' \"I hasten to add that we deal only with those legislative matters which are of a strictly moral natureor which directly affect the welfare of the Church. Wehave opposed gambling and liquor and will continueto do so. We regard it as not only our right but ourduty to oppose those forces which we feel underminethe moral fiber of society. Much of our effort, a verygreat deal of it, is in association with others whoseinterests are similar. We have worked with Jewishgroups, Catholics, Muslims, Protestants, and those ofno particular religious affiliation, in coalitions formedto advocate positions on vital moral issues. Such iscurrently the case in California, where Latter-daySaints are working as part of a coalition to safeguardtraditional marriage from forces in our society whichare attempting to redefine that sacred institution.God-sanctioned marriage between a man and a woman has been the basis of civilization forthousands of years. There is no justification toredefine what marriage is. Such is not our right, andthose who try will find themselves answerable to God. \"Some portray legalization of so-called same-sex marriage as a civil right. This is not a matter of civilrights; it is a matter of morality. Others question ourconstitutional right as a church to raise our voice onan issue that is of critical importance to the futureof the family. We believe that defending this sacredinstitution by working to preserve traditional marriagelies clearly within our religious and constitutionalprerogatives. Indeed, we are compelled by ourdoctrine to speak out. \"Nevertheless, and I emphasize this, I wish to say that our opposition to attempts to legalize same-sexmarriage should never be interpreted as justificationfor hatred, intolerance, or abuse of those who professhomosexual tendencies, either individually or as agroup. As I said from this pulpit one year ago, ourhearts reach out to those who refer to themselves asgays and lesbians. We love and honor them as sonsand daughters of God. They are welcome in theChurch. It is expected, however, that they follow thesame God-given rules of conduct that apply to every-one else, whether single or married\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1999, 70; or Ensign, Nov. 1999, 53-54). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"The only legitimate employment of the powers of procreation is between husband and wife who havebeen legally and lawfully married. Anything otherthan this violates the commandments of God himself.And as Alma said, 'I say unto you, if ye speak againstit, it matters not, for the word of God must befulfilled' (Alma 5:58). . . . \"Already I have warned that the awesome powers of the adversary will be employed to entice all mankindto sinfully use the sacred power of procreation. Donot yield, for every debt of transgression must bepaid\" (Things of the Soul, 113-14). \"World leaders and court judges agree that the familymust endure if we are to survive. At the same time,they use the words freedom and choice as tools to pry apart the safeguards of the past and loosen up thelaws on marriage, abortion, and gender. In so doing,they promote the very things which threaten thefamily\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1994, 24; orEnsign, May 1994, 19). Elder Dallin H. Oaks \"We live in a day when there are many political, legal, and social pressures for changes that confuse genderand homogenize the differences between men andwomen. Our eternal perspective sets us againstchanges that alter those separate duties and privilegesof men and women that are essential to accomplishthe great plan of happiness\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1993, 99; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 73). The only legitimate employment of the powers of procreation is between husband and wife who have been legally and lawfully married. \u2014Elder Boyd K. Packer ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL303SELFISHNESS SELECTED TEACHINGS President David O. McKay \"I know of no better way to bring about harmony in the home, in the neighborhood, in organizations,peace in our country, and in the world than forevery man and woman first to eliminate from his orher heart the enemies of harmony and peace suchas hatred, selfishness, greed, animosity, and envy\"(Gospel Ideals, 292). President Spencer W. Kimball \"It all comes back to one word, doesn't it: Selfishness\" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, 313). \"Every divorce is the result of selfishness on thepart of one or the other or both parties to amarriage contract. Someone isthinking of self\u2014comforts,conveniences, freedoms, luxuries, orease. Sometimes the ceaselesspinpricking of an unhappy,discontented, and selfish spouse canfinally add up to serious physicalviolence. Sometimes people are goadedto the point where they erringly feeljustified in doing the things which areso wrong. Nothing, of course, justifies sin. . . . \"The marriage that is based upon selfishness is almost certain to fail. The one who marries forwealth or the one who marries for prestige or socialplane is certain to be disappointed. The one whomarries to satisfy vanity and pride or who marriesto spite or to show up another person is foolingonly himself. But the one who marries to givehappiness as well as receive it, to give service as wellas to receive it, and who looks after the interests ofthe two and then the family as it comes will have agood chance that the marriage will be a happy one\"(\"Marriage and Divorce,\" 148-49). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"Selfishness so often is the basis of money problems, which are a very serious and real factor affectingthe stability of family life. Selfishness is at the rootof adultery, the breaking of solemn and sacredcovenants to satisfy selfish lust. Selfishness is theantithesis of love. It is a cankering expression ofgreed. It destroys self-discipline. It obliterates loyalty.It tears up sacred covenants. It afflicts both menand women\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1991, 96;or Ensign, May 1991, 73). Elder Neal A. Maxwell \"In our failures, there is usually disguised selfishness, the overreaching for 'a bridge too far.' Whether in financial or civic ruin or in infidelity and divorce, pr oud selfishness is usually there. Lack of intellectualhumility is there among those whohave deliberately cultivated their doubts in order, they think, to releasethemselves from their covenants.Some nurture their grievancesassiduously. Were their grievances,instead, Alma's seed of faith, they would have long ago nourished a mighty tree of testimony\" ( Meek and Lowly, 6-7). Selfishness is the antithesis of love. \u2014President Gordon B.

I have become ver y anxious over the amount of counseling that we seem to need in the Church, and the network of counseling services that we keep building up without once emphasizing the principle of self-reliance as it is understood in the welfare program. There are too many in the Church whoseem to be tot ally dependent, emotionally and spiritually, upon others. They subsist on some kind of emotional welfare. They are unwilling to sustainthemselves. They become so dependent that theyendlessly need to be shor ed up, lifted up, endlessly need encouragement, and they contribute little oftheir own. I have been concerned that we may be on the verge of doing to ourselves emotionally (and thereforespiritually) what we have been working so hard for generations to avoid materially. If we lose ouremotional and spiritual self-reliance, we can beweakened quite as much, perhaps even more, thanwhen we become dependent materially. On one hand,we counsel bishops to avoid abuses in the Churchwelfare program. On the other hand, we seem to doleout counsel and advice without the slightest thoughtthat the member should solve the problem himselfor turn to his family. Only when those resources areinadequate should he turn to the Church.We recognize at once that it would be folly to developwelfare production projects to totally sustain all ofthe members of the Church in every material need.We ought likewise to be very thoughtful before wedevelop a vast network of counseling programs withall of the bishops and branch presidents and everyoneelse, doling out counsel in an effort to totally sustainour members in every emotional need. If we are not careful, we can lose the power of individual revelation. The Lord said to OliverCowdery, and it has meaning for all of us: \"Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when youtook no thought save it was to ask me. \"But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right,and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shallburn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it isright. \"But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shallcause you to forget the thing which is wrong.\"(D&C 9:7-9) . . . Guidelines for Emotional and Spiritual Independence Now, if you are willing to agree that the basic principles underlying the Church welfare programhave application in your emotional and spirituallife\u2014specifically, that independence, industry, thrift,self-reliance, and self-respect should be developed;that work be enthroned as a ruling principle in yourlife; that the evils of an emotional or spiritual doleshould be avoided; and that the aim of the Churchis to help the members to help themselves\u2014then Ihave some principles and some suggestions for you. We mentioned earlier that there should not be the slightest embarrassment for any member of theChurch to receive welfare assistance, provided hehas exhausted his own personal resources first andthose available in his family. Likewise, there shouldnot be the slightest embarrassment on the part ofany member of the Church who needs counsel toreceive that counsel. At times it may be crucial thatyou seek and that you accept counsel. When you are discouraged and feel that you cannot solve a problem on your own, you may be right, butat least you are obligated to try. Every personalresource available to you should be committed before The principle of self-reliance is spiritual as well as temporal. \u2014Elder L. Tom Perry ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL305you take another step, and you have powerful resources. The Book of Mormon declares this one,which is often overlooked: \"For the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall ofman, and salvation is free. \"And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil.\" (2 Nephi 2:4-5; emphasis added) It is critically important that you understand thatyou already know right from wrong, that you'reinnately, inherently, and intuitively good. Whenyou say, \"I can't! I can't solve my problems!\" I wantto thunder out, \"Don't you realize who you are?Haven't you learned yet that you are a son or adaughter of Almighty God? Do you not know thatthere are powerful resources inherited from Himthat you can call upon to give you steadiness andcourage and great power?\" Most of you have been taught the gospel all your lives. All of you know the difference between goodand evil, between right and wrong. Isn't it time thenthat you decide that you're going to do right? In sodoing you're making a choice. Not just achoice, but you're making the choice. Once you've decided that, with no fingers crossed, no counterfeiting, no reser-vations or hesitancy, the rest will all fall into place. Most people who come for counsel to the stake presidents, branch presidents, bishops, and others,and to us as General Authorities, don't come becausethey are confused and they are not able to see thedifference between right and wrong. They comebecause they're tempted to do something that deepdown they know is wrong, and they want thatdecision ratified. When you have a problem, work it out in your own mind first. Ponder on it and analyze it and meditateon it. Pray about it. I've come to learn that majordecisions can't be forced. You must look ahead andhave vision. What was it the prophet said in theOld Testament? \"Where there is no vision, thepeople perish\" (Proverbs 29:18). Ponder on things a little each day and don't always be in the crisis of making major decisions on thespur of the moment. If you're looking ahead in life,you can see major problems coming down the roadtoward you from some considerable distance. Bythe time you meet one another, you are able at thevery beginning to take charge of the conversation.Once in a while a major decision will jump out atyou from the side of the road and startle the witsout of you, but not very often. If you've alreadydecided that you're going to do what is right andlet all of the consequences follow, even thoseencounters won't hurt you. I have learned that the best time to wrestle with major problems is early in the morning. Your mindis then fresh and alert. The blackboard of yourmind has been erased by a good night's rest. Theaccumulated distractions of the day are not in yourway. Your body has been rested also. That's the timeto think something through very carefully and toreceive personal revelation. I've heard President Harold B. Lee begin many a statement about matters involving revelation withan expression something like this: \"In the earlyhours of the morning, while I was pondering uponthat subject,\" and so on. He made it a practice towork on the problems that required revelation inthe fresh, alert hours of the early morning. The Lord knew something when He directed in the Doctrine and Covenants, \"Cease to sleep longerthan is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye maynot be weary; arise early, that your bodies be invigorated\" (D&C 88:124). . . . I counsel our children to do their critical studying in the early hours of the morning when they're freshand alert, rather than to fight physical wearinessand mental exhaustion at night. I've learned thatthe dictum \"Early to bed, early to rise\" is powerful.When under pressure\u2014for instance, when I waspreparing this talk\u2014you wouldn't find me burningthe midnight oil. Much rather I'd be early to bedand getting up in the wee hours of the morning,when I could be close to Him who guides this work. Now, about revelation. We have all been taught that revelation is available to each of us individually.The question I'm most often asked about revelationis, \"How do I know when I have received it? I'veprayed about it and fasted over this problem andprayed about it and prayed about it, and I still don'tquite know what to do. How can I really tell whetherI'm being inspired so I won't make a mistake?\" First, do you go to the Lord with a problem and ask Him to make your decision for you? Or do you workand meditate and pray and then make a decisionyourself? Measure the problem against what youknow to be right and wrong, and then make thedecision. Then, ask Him if the decision is right or if ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSELF-RELIANCE 306it is wrong. Remember what He said to Oliver Cowdery about working it out in your mind. Listen to this sentence if you don't hear anything else: If we foolishly ask our bishop or branch president orthe Lord to make a decision for us, there's preciouslittle self-reliance in that. Think what it costs everytime you have somebody else make a decision for you. I think I should mention one other thing, and I hope this won't be misunderstood. We often find youngpeople who will pray with great exertion over mattersthat they are free to decide for themselves. Suppose,if you will, that a couple had money available to builda house. Suppose they had prayed endlessly overwhether they should build an Early American style,a ranch style, modern-style architecture, or perhapsa Mediterranean style. Has it ever occurred to youthat perhaps the Lord just plain doesn't care? Letthem build what they want to build. It's their choice.In many things we can do just what we want. Now, there aresome things he cares about very much. If you're going to build that house, then be honest and pay for the material that goes into it and do adecent job of building it. When you move into it, liverighteously in it. Those are the things that count. On occasions I've had to counsel people that the Lord would probably quite willingly approve thething they intend to do even when they want to.It's strange when they come and almost feel guiltyabout doing something because they want to, evenwhen it's righteous. The Lord is very generous withthe freedom He gives us. The more we learn to followthe right, the more we are spiritually self-reliant, themore our freedom and our independence are affirmed.\"If ye continue in my word,\" He said, \"then are yemy disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, andthe truth shall make you free\" (John 8:31-32). . . . \"How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because ofthe hardness of your hearts? Do ye not rememberthe things which the Lord hath said?\u2014If ye will notharden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believingthat ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping mycommandments, surely these things shall be madeknown unto you\" (see 1 Nephi 15:7-11). In conclusion, if we lose the spirit and power of individual revelation, we have lost much in thisChurch. You have great and powerful resources. You,through prayer, can solve your problems without endlessly going to those who are trying so hard tohelp others. Now, if you start receiving revelations for anyone else's jurisdiction, you know immediately that you'reout of order, that they come from the wrong source. If you become so dependent and insecure that prayer and the answer to prayer are such that youare hesitant to rely on them, then you are weak. If we follow a course where, on one hand, we would carefully scrutinize an order for welfare productsand yet, on the other hand, dole out counsel andadvice without sending you to your own storehouseof knowledge and inspiration, then we have doneyou a disservice. This Church relies on individual testimony. Each must earn his own testimony. It is then that you canstand and say, as I can say, that I know that Godlives, that He is our Father, that we have a child-parent relationship with Him. I know that He isclose, that we can go to Him and appeal, and then,if we will be obedient and listen and use everyresource, we will have an answer to our prayers. This is His church. God lives. Jesus is the Christ. We have a prophet presiding over this Church. Everyone of us and every other soul on this earth canknow that. I bear witness of that. I know that Helives and affirm this witness to you in the name ofJesus Christ. Amen. BECOMING SELF-RELIANT Elder L. Tom Perry Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 87-90; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 64-66 Nephi's Self-Reliance Lehi and his family, after wandering in the wildernessfor eight years, came to a land they called Bountifulbecause it was a place of much fruit and wild honey.They came to a great sea, and they rejoiced untothe Lord because He had preserved them. After theyhad been in the land Bountiful for a space of manydays, the Lord spoke to Nephi and said, \"Arise, andget thee into the mountain\" (1 17:7). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSELF-RELIANCE 307Nephi obeyed the Lord; he went into the mountain and prayed. And the Lord commanded Nephi,\"Thou shalt construct a ship, after the mannerwhich I shall show thee, that I may carry thy peopleacross these waters\" (1 Nephi 17:8). Then Nephi asked the Lord, \"Whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools toconstruct the ship after the manner which thou hastshown unto me?\" (1 Nephi 17:9). The Lord instructed Nephi where he could find ore, but then Nephi was on his own. In 1 Nephi,chapter 17, we read: \"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins ofbeasts; and after I had made a bellows, that I mighthave wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite twostones together that I might make fire. . . . \"And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock\" (17:11, 16). This is one of the more interesting stories we have in the scriptures because it tells of an instance inwhich the Lord provided help but then steppedaside to allow one of His sons to exercise his owninitiative. I have sometimes wondered what wouldhave happened if Nephi had asked the Lord fortools instead of a place to find the ore to make thetools. I doubt the Lord would have honored Nephi'srequest. You see, the Lord knew that Nephi couldmake the tools, and it is seldom the Lord will dosomething for us that we can do for ourselves. Importance of Self-Reliance The Lord does help when we go to Him in times ofneed, especially when we are committed to His workand respond to His will. But the Lord only helps thosewho are willing to help themselves. He expects Hischildren to be self-reliant to the degree they can be. Brigham Young instructed the Saints, \"Instead of searching after what the Lord is going to do for us,let us inquire what we can do for ourselves\"(Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co.,1941], p. 293). Independence and self-reliance are critical to our spiritual and temporalgrowth. Whenever we get intosituations which threaten our self-reliance, we will find our freedomsthreatened as well. If we increase our dependenceon anything or anyone except the Lord, we willfind an immediate decrease in our freedom to act.As President Heber J. Grant declared, \"Nothingdestroys the individuality of a man, a woman, or a child as much as the failure to be self-reliant\"(\"Address,\" Relief Society Magazine, Oct. 1937, p. 627). Never before in my life has the doctrine of self- reliance been more needed to be preached andencouraged for the benefit of the Saints. We live ina time of rapid change. Governments are rising andfalling. Industries are blooming and then all toosoon becoming obsolete. New discoveries in scienceare soon overshadowed by new findings. Unless weare continuously expanding our understanding andvision, we too will become out-of-date. Researchtells us that individuals entering the labor markettoday will be forced to find three to five differentcareer paths during their productive years. What must we do to become more self-reliant? A Family Tradition My parents established a family tradition in our home which was fun for me in my early years andhas become even more meaningful as I reflect backon it as the years have passed. On the first birthdayof each child, the family would gather in the livingroom. In the center of the living room floor, ourparents would place articles for the one-year-old childto select. The selection to be made might indicatean interest the child would pursue in life. The articleswere the Bible, a child's bottle filled with milk, atoy, and a savings bank filled with coins. The childwas placed on one side of the room and the familyon the other side. Family members would encouragethe child to crawl toward the objects and make a selection. This was all in fun, of course. I was told that I selected the bank and went into finance as my profession. I watched my brother Tedselect the scriptures, and he pursued law as his chosenprofession. Over the years he has relied on the scriptures as a basis for his judgments.My youngest brother, Bob, was thewell-rounded member of the family.He crawled over, sat down on theBible, put the bottle of milk in hismouth, and then held the toy in onehand and the bank in the other. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSELF-RELIANCE 308 Independence and self-reliance are critical to our spiritual and temporal growth.Spiritual Nourishment Now I propose to you that in this entertaining family activity we can find the most fundamentalprinciples of self-reliance. First, the scripturesrepresent our need for spiritual nourishment. In thescriptures, the Lord reveals His will to His children.From the very beginning of time, He has instructedHis prophets to record His communications withthem for the benefit of His children. The holyscriptures declare eternal values; they are the firmfoundation on which we can build a successfulmortal experience. We become more self-reliantwhen we study the holy scriptures, which teach theprinciples that provide a divine center to our liveshere in mortality. We should be comforted by the fact that we have the best text which has ever been written or ever will bewritten as our guide. We can turn to 2 Kings, the fifthchapter, and learn about obedience. We can studythe life of Job and learn integrity. King Benjamin'saddress in Mosiah teaches industry. The life of Joseph,as told in Genesis 39, tells us what we should dowhen our standard of morality is being tested. These are just a few examples of the lessons we could learn from the holy scriptures. They are lessons whichhave stood the test of time. Our challenge is to makethem come alive in the hearts and minds of ourfamilies as we assume the responsibility to teach them. Temporal Self-Reliance Second, the bottle filled with milk symbolizes thephysical body's need for nourishment. Our welfareservices program has taught us by using the spokesof a wheel to define the essential elements oftemporal self-reliance. The elements contained inthe wheel are education; physical health;employment; home storage; resource management;and social, emotional, and spiritual strength. This summer my wife and I had the opportunity to visit an eighty-year-old man who certainlydemonstrated each of these elements in his life. Hewas born in a small Idaho town and worked longhours on the farm to finance his education. He spenthis professional life teaching English and Spanish in asmall high school. To set aside funds for missions andthe education of his large family, he grew strawberryand raspberry crops to be picked and sold to thelocal markets. This labor occupied his summers.Because these fruits were so labor-intensive, fewpeople had the ambition to grow them. They weremuch-wanted crops. The demand was always therefor as many berries as he could produce. He was neversatisfied with the productivity of his crops, so hestudied new varieties in an attempt to find the bestproducers. His backyard was literally an experimentalfarm for testing the variety of bushes that producedthe sweetest and most abundant fruit in hisparticular climate. His studies yielded increasedproductivity. The labor kept him in good physicalhealth. The fields of berries furnished automaticemployment for his children each summer. Theberries delivered to the market could be exchangednot only for cash but also for commodities to beused in their home storage. He managed his resourcesto build a beautiful home and supply the needs ofhis family. This man loved to watch the Lord's system of multiplying and replenishing the earth, which gavehim social, emotional, and spiritual strength. Nowretired from active teaching, he continues to growhis berries, not for profit but for satisfaction. Sixmornings each week during the berry harvest season,you will see him leading a parade of ten to twelvecars out of the city toward his berry patch. Familiescome to add to their home storage by picking theberries. I asked him the price per case if we suppliedour own labor. He answered: \"I don't know. My payis seeing the look on people's faces as they leave thefield holding the fruits of their labors in their arms.\" I am convinced there are thousands of ways for families to build self-reliance by working togetherin productive pursuits. Perhaps a good family homeevening discussion could produce some ideas to helpmake your family unit more temporally self-reliant. Proper Use of Resources Third, the toy I mentioned earlier represents theacquisition of things of the world. We are bombardedtoday with powerful media to acquire now and paylater in what are purported to be painless monthlyinstallments. We live in an impatient world whereeveryone wants everything now. The acquisition ofworldly goods seems to foster an appetite for morerather than any kind of lasting satisfaction. Using our resources and worldly goods wisely and extending their life will help us become more self-reliant. I watched a young family move this summer, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSELF-RELIANCE 309and I was intrigued by the labels on the boxes coming out of the storage room. They read, \"Clothing\u2014Girls\u20142 years old,\" \"Clothing\u2014Girls\u20143 years old,\"and so on up. Clearly, this family had a well-conceived plan to maximize the usage of purchaseditems of clothing. We live in a world blessed with so much abundance. Let us be certain that the resources with which weare blessed are never wasted. Financial Well-Being Finally, the fourth item\u2014the bank. It is a symbol ofour financial well-being. I learned a great lesson earlyin my business career. My boss called me into hisoffice. I could tell he had something on his mind.He said, \"Give me a definition of interest.\" Ofcourse, I reached back in my training and gave hima definition I had learned from a textbook. He said,\"No, no, no, that's not the one I want. You listenand remember this one: Thems that understands it,earns it; and thems that don't, pays it.\" Now it doesn't take a genius to understand that before you can collect interest, you must first havesome savings. Having savings while continuing to increase one's standard of living requiresunderstanding of one simple practice and thenreligiously applying it. After paying your tithing of 10 percent to the Lord, you pay yourself apredetermined amount directly into savings. Thatleaves you a balance of your income to budget fortaxes, food, clothing, shelter, transportation, etc. Itis amazing to me that so many people work all oftheir lives for the grocer, the landlord, the powercompany, the automobile salesman, and the bankand yet think so little of their own efforts that theypay themselves nothing. Be prudent, wise, and conservative in your investment programs. It is by consistently andregularly adding to your investments that you willbuild your emergency and retirement savings. Thiswill add to your progress in becoming self-reliant. The principle of self-reliance is spiritual as well as temporal. It is not a doomsday program; it issomething to be practiced each and every day ofour lives. May we continue to hold fast to theeternal truths of self-reliance is my prayer in thename of Jesus Christ, amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSELF-RELIANCE 310SINGLE PARENTS SELECTED TEACHINGS President Gordon B. Hinckley \"To you single mothers and fathers, may I say a special word of appreciation for you. Your burdensare heavy. We know this. Your concerns are deep.There is never enough money. There is never enoughtime. Do the very best you can and plead with theLord for His help that your children may grow ingrace and understanding and achievement and,most importantly, in faith. If you do so, the daywill come when you will get on your knees and,with tears in your eyes, thank the Lord for Hisblessings upon you\" (\"A Conversation with SingleAdults,\" Ensign, Mar. 1997, 63). \"Now to you single mothers, whatever the cause of your present situation, our hearts reach out toyou. We know that many of you live in loneliness,insecurity, worry, and fear. For most of you there isnever enough money. Your constant, brooding worryis anxiety for your children and their futures. Manyof you find yourselves in circumstances where youhave to work and leave your children largely totheir own devices. But if when they are very smallthere is much of affection, there is shown much oflove, there is prayer together, then there will morelikely be peace in the hearts and strength in thecharacter of your children. Teach them the ways ofthe Lord. Declared Isaiah, 'All thy children shall betaught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace ofthy children' (Isa. 54:13). \"The more surely you rear your children in the ways of the gospel of Jesus Christ, with love and highexpectation, the more likely that there will be peacein their lives. \"Set an example for them. That will mean more than all the teaching you can give them. Do notoverindulge them. Let them grow up with respectfor and understanding of the meaning of labor, of working and contributing to the home and itssurroundings, with some way of earning some oftheir own expense money. Let your sons save formissions, and encourage them to prepare themselves,not only financially, but spiritually and in an attitudeto go out to serve the Lord without selfishness ofany kind. I do not hesitate to promise that if youwill do so, you will have reason to count yourblessings\" (\"Stand Strong against the Wiles of theWorld,\" Ensign, Nov. 1995, 99-100). \"The burdens that fall upon a young woman whoalone must rear her child are unbelievably heavyand consuming. . . . The answer is straightforward.It lies in adherence to the principles of the gospeland the teaching of the Church. It lies in self-discipline\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 73; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 53). \"I have spoken on three or four occasions to thewomen of the Church during the past ten years. I have received in response to these various talks a substantial number of letters. I have kept some of them in a file marked 'Unhappy Women.' \". . . I wish to read you a portion of one of them that was received only last week. . . . \"'Then came the crash. About a year ago he decided that he never loved me and that our marriage was amistake from the beginning. He was convinced thatthere was nothing in our relationship for him. He filed for divorce and moved out. \"Wait,\" I keptsaying. \"Oh, no. Stop! Don't do this. Why are youleaving? What is wrong? Please, talk to me. Look atour children. What of all our dreams? Rememberour covenants. No, no! Divorce is not the answer.\"He would not hear me. I thought I would die. \"'Now I am a single parent. What an enormous load of heartache, pain, and loneliness is behindthat statement. It explains so much trauma and somuch anger from my teenage sons. It explains somany tears from my little girls. It explains so manysleepless nights, so many family demands andneeds. Why am I in this mess? What did I choosewrong? How will I ever get through school? Howwill I get through this week? Where is my husband?Where is the father of my children? I join the ranksof tired women whose husbands leave them. I haveno money, no job. I have children to care for, billsto pay, and not much hope.'\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1991, 69-70; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 50). Even in single-parent families, the family continues on, for families are forever. \u2014Elder Ben B. Banks ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL311\"To you who are divorced, please know that we do not look down upon you as failures because amarriage failed. In many, perhaps in most cases, youwere not responsible for that failure. Furthermore,ours is the obligation not to condemn, but to forgiveand to forget, to lift and to help. In your hours ofdesolation turn to the Lord, who said: 'Come untome, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. . . . \"'For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light' (Matt. 11:28, 30.) \"The Lord will not deny you nor turn you away. The answers to your prayers may not be dramatic; theymay not be readily understood or even appreciated.But the time will come when you will know thatyou have been blessed. For those of you who havechildren and struggle to rear them in righteousness,be assured that they will become a blessing and acomfort and a strength to you throughout all theyears to come. \"Now to those of you who have lost a companion in death, our hearts go out to you with love andunderstanding. As a man once observed, 'There existsno cure for a heart wounded with the (Hitopadesa, Elbert Hubbard's Scrapbook, New York City: Wm. H. Wise and Co., 1923, p. 21.) \"With many of you, there is the gnawing pain of bereavement and fear. To you the Lord has said,'Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall becomforted.' (Matt. 5:4.) \"We know that for many of you, there are days of loneliness and nights of longing. But there is alsothat which comes from Him who said, 'I, even I,am he that comforteth you.' (Isa. 51:12.) \"The Lord is your strength. He is available to you, and, when invited, by His Spirit He will come to you. \"You, too, have great talents to enrich the lives of others. You will find comfort and strength as youlose yourself in their service. Your own troubles willbe forgotten as you help others with theirs. Yourburdens will become lighter as you lift the burdensof the downtrodden and the oppressed\" (\"To SingleAdults,\" Ensign, June 1989, 74). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"Some mothers seem to have the capacity and energy to make their children's clothes, bake, givepiano lessons, go to Relief Society, teach SundaySchool, attend parent-teacher association meetings,and so on. Other mothers look upon such womenas models and feel inadequate, depressed, and thinkthey are failures when they make comparisons. \"We should not allow ourselves to be trapped into such damaging inferiority feelings. This is anothertool of Satan. Many seem to put too much pressureon themselves to be a 'supermom' or 'superwoman.' \"Sisters, do not allow yourselves to be made to feel inadequate or frustrated because you cannot doeverything others seem to be accomplishing. Rather,each should assess her own situation, her own energy,and her own talents, and then choose the best wayto mold her family into a team, a unit that workstogether and supports each other. Only you andyour Father in Heaven know your needs, strengths,and desires. Around this knowledge your personalcourse must be charted and your choices made\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1984, 11; or Ensign, May 1984, 9-10). Elder Richard G. Scott \"President Benson has taught that a mother with children should be in the home. He also said, 'We realize . . . that some of our choice sisters arewidowed and divorced and that others findthemselves in unusual circumstances where, out of necessity, they are required to work for a periodof time. But these instances are the exception, notthe rule' (Ezra Taft Benson, To the Mothers in Zion [pamphlet, 1987], pp. 5-6). You in these unusualcircumstances qualify for additional inspiration andstrength from the Lord. Those who leave the homefor lesser reasons will not\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1993, 42-43; or Ensign, May 1993, 34). Elder Ben B. Banks \"We cannot overemphasize the importance of parenthood and the family. Some Latter-day Saintfamilies are what we refer to as the 'traditionalfamily,' consisting of parents and children all togetherin a permanent relationship, with both mother andfather sharing in the responsibility of caring forchildren. Others have witnessed the loss of one ofthe parents and become one of the many single-parent families. I am one who grew up in a single-parent home. My father lost his life as a result of a construction accident when I was two years old,leaving my mother with seven children to raise.Even in single-parent families, the family continues ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSINGLE PARENTS 312on, for families are forever\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 39; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 29). Elder J. Richard Clarke \"Now, I realize there are numerous single-parent families in the Church. . . . They are reluctant toimpose on others and are frequently offended byinsensitive remarks regarding their family status.This is also true of single adults who have yet tomarry. They often feel cut off from the mainstreamof Mormon family life. They especially need to bepart of a gospel kindred family, where blessings canbe obtained from worthy priesthood bearers androle models can be found in quorum brotherhoodand Relief Society sisterhood.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALSINGLE PARENTS 313TEMPLE PREPARATION SELECTED TEACHINGS Temple Worthiness President Howard W. Hunter \"I also invite the Latter-day Saints to look to the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of yourmembership. It is the deepest desire of my heart tohave every member of the Church worthy to enterthe temple. It would please the Lord if every adultmember would be worthy of\u2014and carry\u2014a currenttemple recommend. The things that we must doand not do to be worthy of a temple recommendare the very things that ensure we will be happy asindividuals and as families\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1994, 8; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 8). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"These unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered therein, represent theultimate in our worship. These ordinances becomethe most profound expressions of our theology. I urge our people everywhere, with all of thepersuasiveness of which I am capable, to live worthyto hold a temple recommend, to secure one andregard it as a precious asset, and to make a greatereffort to go to the house of the Lord and partake ofthe spirit and the blessings to be had therein. I amsatisfied that every man or woman who goes to thetemple in a spirit of sincerity and faith leaves thehouse of the Lord a better man or woman. There isneed for constant improvement in all of our lives.There is need occasionally to leave the noise andthe tumult of the world and step within the wallsof a sacred house of God, there to feel His spirit inan environment of holiness and peace\" (inConference Report, Sept.-Oct. 1995, 72; or Ensign,Nov. 1995, 53). Covenants and Obligations President Joseph Fielding Smith \"If a person violates a covenant, whether it be of baptism, ordination, marriage or anything else, theSpirit withdraws the stamp of approval, and theblessings will not be received\" ( Doctrines of Salvation, 1:45). Elder James E. Talmage \"The ordinances of the endowment embody certain obligations on the part of the individual, such ascovenant and promise to observe the law of strictvirtue and chastity, to be charitable, benevolent,tolerant and pure; to devote both talent and materialmeans to the spread of truth and the uplifting ofthe race; to maintain devotion to the cause of truth;and to seek in every way to contribute to the greatpreparation that the earth may be made ready toreceive her King,\u2014the Lord Jesus Christ. With thetaking of each covenant and the assuming of eachobligation a promised blessing is pronounced,contingent upon the faithful observance of theconditions\" (House of the Lord, 84). Symbolism of the Temple President Hugh B. Brown \"Here we will not only lay aside the clothing of the street, but the thoughts of the street, and will try notonly to clothe our bodies in clean white linen but ourminds in purity of thought\" (Continuing the Quest, 38). Elder John A. Widtsoe \"We live in a world of symbols. No man or woman can come out of the temple endowed as he shouldbe, unless he has seen, beyond the symbol, themighty realities for which the symbols stand\"(\"Temple Worship,\" 62).Those keys\u2014the keys to seal and bind on earth, and have it bound in heaven\u2014 represent the consummate gift from our God. \u2014President Boyd K. Packer ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL314Purpose of the Endowment The Prophet Joseph Smith \"You need an endowment, brethren, in order that you may be prepared and able to overcome allthings\" (History of the Church, 2:309). President Brigham Young \"Let me give you a definition in brief. Your endowment is, to receive all those ordinances in thehouse of the Lord, which are necessary for you,after you have departed this life, to enable you towalk back to the presence of the Father, passing theangels who stand as sentinels, . . . and gain youreternal exaltation\" (Discourses of Brigham Young, 416). President Joseph Fielding Smith \"It is a wonderful thing to come into the Church, but you cannot receive an exaltation until you have madecovenants in the house of the Lord and received thekeys and authorities that are there bestowed andwhich cannot be given in any other place on theearth today\" (Doctrines of Salvation, 2:253). Elder John A. Widtsoe \"The temple endowment relates the story of man's eternal journey; sets forth the conditions upon whichprogress in the eternal journey depends; requirescovenants or agreements of those participating, toaccept and use the laws of progress; gives tests bywhich our willingness and fitness for righteousnessmay be known, and finally points out the ultimatedestiny of those who love truth and live by it\" ( Program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 178). Understanding the Endowment Elder John A. Widtsoe \"The endowment which was given by revelation can best be understood by revelation; and to thosewho seek most vigorously, with pure hearts, will therevelation be greatest\" (\"Temple Worship,\" 63). Elder Harold B. Lee \"When you enter a holy temple, you are by that course gaining fellowship with the Saints in God'seternal kingdom, where time is no more. In thetemples of your God you are endowed not with a rich legacy of worldly treasure, but with a wealthof eternal riches that are above price. \"The temple ceremonies are designed by a wise Heavenly Father who has revealed them to us inthese last days as a guide and a protectionthroughout our lives, that you and I might not failto merit exaltation in the celestial kingdom whereGod and Christ dwell\" (\"Enter a Holy Temple,\"Improvement Era, June 1967, 144). Elder Carlos E. Asay \"A few years ago, in a seminar for new temple presidents and matrons, Elder James E. Faust, thenof the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, told abouthis being called to serve as a General Authority. Hewas asked only one question by President Harold B.Lee: 'Do you wear the garments properly?' to whichhe answered in the affirmative. He then asked ifPresident Lee wasn't going to ask him about hisworthiness. President Lee replied that he didn'tneed to, for he had learned from experience that howone wears the garment is the expression of how theindividual feels about the Church and everythingthat relates to it. It is a measure of one's worthinessand devotion to the gospel. \"There are some who would welcome a detailed dress code answering every conceivable questionabout the wearing of the temple garment. Theywould have priesthood leaders legislate lengths,specify conditions of when and how it should andshould not be worn, and impose penalties uponthose who missed the mark by a fraction of an inch.Such individuals would have Church membersstrain at a thread and omit the weightier matters of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see Matt. 23:23-26). \"Most Latter-day Saints, however, rejoice over the moral agency extended them by a loving Father inHeaven. They prize highly the trust placed in themby the Lord and Church leaders\u2014a trust implied inthis statement made by the Prophet Joseph Smith:'I teach them correct principles, and they governthemselves.'

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL315 TEMPLE PREPARATIONCivil Ceremony Preceding Temple Sealing Temple marriages in some countries are recognized by the law of the land. Laws inmany other countries, however, require personsdesiring to be sealed in these temples to bemarried civilly first. Church Procedures Witnesses Two male members of the Church who have current temple recommends will serve aswitnesses to your marriage. You may select yourown witnesses, who will sign your marriagepapers at the temple, or the temple will providewitnesses. Temple Marriage Recommend When going to the temple to receive your endowment or to be sealed in marriage, youmust have two recommends: the templerecommend and the recommend for livingordinances. The first part you will use to returnto the temple to do work for the dead. The latterpart is the recommend for your endowment,marriage, or sealing. It includes informationfrom your membership record, such as yourparents' names, your baptismal date, and yourendowment date if you have been endowedpreviously. It must also indicate that you havecome to the temple to be married. Announcements and Invitations Do notmail announcements or invitations until your temple marriage recommend is obtained to avoid possible embarrassment if the recommend isdenied for any reason. Be aware that follow-upinterviews may be scheduled as you near the dateof your marriage. Less than a Year A person may not receive a temple recommend until one full year has passed following baptismand confirmation. If a couple is civilly marriedand then decides that they wish to be sealed inthe temple, they must wait one year from thedate of their civil marriage to be sealed. Thisrestriction applies only to those people whocould have been married in the temple initiallybut chose not to do so.ARRANGEMENTS FOR A TEMPLE MARRIAGE Latter-day Saints are taught the importance ofbeing married in the temple. There, the marriageof a bride and groom is sealed for eternity. There are several details that must be attended to before you can be married in the temple. Somehave to do with the laws of the Church and somewith civil laws of the land. Since temples arelocated in many different countries, legalrequirements differ. If you are considering marriage in a certain temple, you should contact that temple andrequest the necessary information. For templeaddresses, please ask your bishop. He shouldhave a copy of the \"All Temple Schedule\" for thecurrent year. Listed below are some of the arrangements you should consider. Laws of the Land Serological Tests Some areas require you to get blood tests to obtain a marriage license. Marriage License If civil law recognizes a temple marriage, you will need a marriage license valid in the civiljurisdiction in which the temple is located. In the United States and Canada you must take to the temple a legal license that permits you tomarry. This license can be obtained in the countryor state/province in which the temple is located.In some locations you might have to establishresidency before a license can be granted. Consent Depending on your age, you may need to have your parents with you to give written consent inorder to obtain a marriage license. Waiting Period Some governmental entities require a waiting period between the date you apply for yourlicense and the date that you may receive it.

Only persons who havereceived their own endowment and have currenttemple recommends may attend the sealing. Mosttemples are not able to accommodate largegroups. Therefore, invitations should be limitedto family members and close friends. Inform Guests of Time and Clothing Requirements If you are receiving your endowment on your wedding day, you may want some guests toparticipate in an endowment session with you.Other guests may have time only to attend yoursealing. In either case, you must inform theseguests when they should arrive at the temple.Double-check this information with the temple. Guests should be counseled to dress as they would to attend a sacrament meeting. Tuxedosor other formal wear is not appropriate. Allguests must have current temple recommends. Officiator The temple presidency and other temple sealers are officially set apart to perform templemarriages. Because the General Authorities haveheavy schedules, the Church members have beenasked not to request them to perform marriages. Language Most temples have sessions in multiple languages. Check with the temple president toverify that your endowment and marriage willbe in the language of your choice. Taking Pictures on Temple Grounds Cameras are not permitted inside the temple. After the sealing, pictures of the bride andgroom can be taken on the temple grounds.Therefore, your photographer is not requiredto have a temple recommend. Other Information Each temple will supply you or your bishop with all the necessary information to plan yourtemple marriage. You can always telephone thetemple (ask for the marriage clerk) or write tothe temple president if you have questions.Time and Date Couples should coordinate their wedding plans with the temple to make certain it will be openon the day and at the time they have chosen.Your bishop will have a schedule. Endowment and Sealing Couples who plan to be sealed must first receive their endowments. You can receive yourendowment on the day of the sealing or before. You should plan to spend three to four hours for your own endowment. The sealing, including thecounsel given by the person who officiates, willtake another forty-five minutes. When you arebeing endowed or sealed, you should be at thetemple one hour before the session or sealing isscheduled. Temple Clothing Special white clothing is worn in the temple. You may rent it at the temple or take your ownwith you. Wedding Dresses Brides may wear their wedding dresses in the temple to be sealed. Dresses must be white,without heavy ornamentation, have long sleevesand a modest neckline, have all sheer materiallined, and the train must be removable or be ableto be pinned or hooked up out of the way. If thereis any question about appropriateness, take thedress or fabric and pattern to the temple forapproval. Brides may wear their wedding dressesduring the endowment session but must removethe trains for the session. They may not weargowns with long dress pants in the temple. Manytemples have beautiful white dresses for thosewho might need one for their special occasion.Check with individual temples for availability. Storage of Wedding Dress Wedding gowns may be delivered to most temples before the sealing. The gowns will betaken to a bride's dressing room and held for you.

Packer Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Ensign, Feb. 1995, 32-36 There are many reasons one should want to come to the temple. Even its external appearance seemsto hint of its deeply spiritual purposes. This is muchmore evident within its walls. Over the door to thetemple appears the tribute. \"Holiness to the Lord.\"When you enter any dedicated temple, you are inthe house of the Lord. In the temples, members of the Church who make themselves eligible can participate in the mostexalted of the redeeming ordinances that have beenrevealed to mankind. There, in a sacred ceremony,an individual may be washed and anointed andinstructed and endowed and sealed. And when wehave received these blessings for ourselves, we mayofficiate for those who have died without havinghad the same opportunity. In the temples sacredordinances are performed for the living and for thedead alike. These Things Are Sacred A careful reading of the scriptures reveals that theLord did not tell all things to all people. There weresome qualifications set that were prerequisite toreceiving sacred information. Temple ceremoniesfall within this category. We do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples. It was never intended that knowledge ofthese temple ceremonies would be limited to a selectfew who would be obliged to ensure that othersnever learn of them. It is quite the opposite, in fact.With great effort we urge every soul to qualify andprepare for the temple experience. Those who havebeen to the temple have been taught an ideal:Someday every living soul and every soul who hasever lived shall have the opportunity to hear thegospel and to accept or reject what the templeoffers. If this opportunity is rejected, the rejectionmust be on the part of the individual himself. The ordinances and ceremonies of the temple are simple. They are beautiful. They are sacred.

Curiosity is not a preparation.Deep interest itself is not a preparation. Preparationfor the ordinances includes preliminary steps: faith,repentance, baptism, confirmation, worthiness, amaturity and dignity worthy of one who comesinvited as a guest into the house of the Lord. All who are worthy and qualify in every way may enter the temple, there to be introduced to thesacred rites and ordinances. Worthy to Enter Once you have some feeling for the value of templeblessings and for the sacredness of the ordinancesperformed in the temple, you would be hesitant toquestion the high standards set by the Lord forentrance into the holy temple. You must possess a current recommend to be admitted to the temple. Thisrecommend must be signed by theproper officers of the Church. Onlythose who are worthy should go to thetemple. Your local bishop or branchpresident has the responsibility ofmaking inquiries into your personal worthiness.This interview is of great importance, for it is anoccasion to explore with an ordained servant of theLord the pattern of your life. If anything is amiss inyour life, the bishop will be able to help you resolve it. Through this procedure, as you counsel with thecommon judge in Israel, you can declare or can behelped to establish your worthiness to enter thetemple with the Lord's approval. The interview for a temple recommend is conducted privately between the bishop and the Church memberconcerned. Here the member is asked searchingquestions about his personal conduct and worthinessand about his loyalty to the Church and its officers.The person must certify that he is morally clean andis keeping the Word of Wisdom, paying a full tithe,living in harmony with the teachings of the Church,and not maintaining any affiliation or sympathywith apostate groups. The bishop is instructed thatconfidentiality in handling these matters with eachinterviewee is of the utmost importance. Acceptable answers to the bishop's questions will ordinarily establish the worthiness of an individualto receive a temple recommend. If an applicant is notkeeping the commandments or there is somethingunsettled about his life that needs putting in order,it will be necessary for him to demonstrate truerepentance before a temple recommend is issued. After the bishop has conducted such an interview, a member of the stake presidency likewise interviewseach of us before we go to the temple. Taught from on High Before going to the temple for the first time, or evenafter many times, it may help you to realize thatthe teaching in the temples is done in symbolicfashion. The Lord, the Master Teacher, gave muchof His instruction in this way. The temple is a great school. It is a house of learning. In the temples the atmosphere is maintained so thatit is ideal for instruction on matters that are deeplyspiritual. The late Elder John A. Widtsoe of the Quorum of the Twelve was a distinguished university president and aworld renowned scholar. He had greatreverence for temple work and said onone occasion: \"The temple ordinances encompass the whole plan of salvation, as taught from time to time by the leaders of the Church, and elucidate matters difficult of understanding. There is no warping or twisting in fitting the templeteachings into the great scheme of salvation. The philosophical completeness of the endowment isone of the great arguments for the veracity of thetemple ordinances. Moreover, this completeness of survey and expounding of the Gospel plan, makestemple worship one of the most effective methods in refreshing the memory concerning the wholestructure of the Gospel\" (Utah Genealogical andHistorical Magazine, Apr. 1921, p. 58). If you will go to the temple and remember that theteaching is symbolic, you will never go in the properspirit without coming away with your visionextended, feeling a little more exalted, with yourknowledge increased as to things that are spiritual.The teaching plan is superb. It is inspired. The LordHimself, the Master Teacher, taught His disciplesconstantly in parables\u2014a verbal way to representsymbolically things that might otherwise bedifficult to understand. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 319 The temple is a great school. It is a house of learning.The temple itself becomes a symbol. If you have seen one of the temples at night, fully lighted, youknow what an impressive sight that can be. Thehouse of the Lord, bathed in light, standing out inthe darkness, becomes symbolic of the power andthe inspiration of the gospel of Jesus Christstanding as a beacon in a world that sinks everfurther into spiritual darkness. Upon entering the temple you exchange your street clothing for the white clothing of the temple. Thischange of clothing takes place in the locker room,where each individual is provided with a locker anddressing space that is completely private. In thetemple the ideal of modesty is carefully maintained.As you put your clothing in the locker you leaveyour cares and concerns and distractions there withthem. You step out of this private little dressing areadressed in white and you feel a oneness and a senseof equality, for all around you are similarly dressed. The Power to Seal For those of you who look forward to a templemarriage, you may want to know what will occur.We do not quote the words of the sealing (marriage)ordinance outside of the temple, but we maydescribe the sealing room as being beautiful in itsappointment, quiet and serene in spirit, andhallowed by the sacred work that is performed there. Before the couple comes to the altar for the sealing ordinance it is the privilege of the officiator toextend, and of the young couple to receive, somecounsel. These are among the thoughts that a young couple might hear on this occasion. \"Today is your wedding day. You are caught up in the emotion of your marriage. Temples were built asa sanctuary for such ordinances as this. We are notin the world. The things of the world do not applyhere and should have no influence upon what wedo here. We have come out of the world into thetemple of the Lord. This becomes the most importantday of your lives. \"You were born, invited to earth, by parents who prepared a mortal tabernacle for your spirit toinhabit. Each of you has been baptized. Baptism, a sacred ordinance, is symbolic of a cleansing,symbolic of death and resurrection, symbolic ofcoming forward in a newness of life. It contemplatesrepentance and a remission of sins. The sacramentof the Lord's Supper is a renewal of the covenant of baptism, and we can, if we live for it, retain aremission of our sins. \"You, the groom, were ordained to the priesthood. You had first conferred upon you the AaronicPriesthood and probably have progressed throughall the offices thereof\u2014deacon, teacher, and priest.Then the day came when you were found worthy toreceive the Melchizedek Priesthood. That priesthood,the higher priesthood, is defined as the priesthoodafter the holiest order of God, or the Holy Priesthoodafter the Order of the Son of God (see Alma 13:18;Hel. 8:18; D&C 107:2-4). You were given an officein the priesthood. You are now an elder. \"Each of you has received your endowment. In that endowment you received an investment of eternalpotential. But all of these things, in one sense, werepreliminary and preparatory to your coming to thealtar to be sealed as husband and wife for time andfor all eternity. You now become a family, free toact in the creation of life, to have the opportunitythrough devotion and sacrifice to bring childreninto the world and to raise them and foster themsafely through their mortal existence; to see themcome one day, as you have come, to participate inthese sacred temple ordinances. \"You come willingly and have been judged to be worthy. To accept one another in the marriagecovenant is a great responsibility, one that carrieswith it blessings without measure.\" If we would understand both the history and the doctrine of temple work, we must understand whatthe sealing power is. We must envision, at least to a degree, why the keysof authority to employ the sealing power are crucial\u2014crucial not just to theordinance work of the temples but to all ordinancework in all the Church throughout the world. The sealing power represents the transcendent delegation of spiritual authority from God to man.The keeper of that sealing power is the Lord's chiefrepresentative here upon the earth, the President ofthe Church. That is the position of consummatetrust and authority. As has been said, much of the teaching relating to the deeper spiritual things in the Church, particularlyin the temple, is symbolic. We use the word keys in a symbolic way. Here the keys of priesthoodauthority represent the limits of the power extended ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 320from beyond the veil to mortal man to act in the name of God upon the earth. The words sealand keysand priesthood are closely linked together. The keys of the sealing power are synonymous withthe keys of the everlasting priesthood. \"When Jesuscame into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he askedhis disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I theSon of man am? . . . \"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. \"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath notrevealed it unto thee, but my Father which is inheaven. \"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gatesof hell shall not prevail against it. \"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earthshall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thoushalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\"(Matt. 16:13-19). Peter was to hold the keys. Peter was to hold the sealing power, that authority which carried thepower to bind or seal on earth or to loose on earthand it would be so in the heavens. Those keys belongto the President of the Church\u2014to the prophet, seer,and revelator. That sacred sealing power is with theChurch now. Nothing is regarded with more sacredcontemplation by those who know the significanceof this authority. Nothing is more closely held. Thereare relatively few men who have been delegatedthis sealing power upon the earth at any giventime\u2014in each temple are brethren who have beengiven the sealing power. No one can get it exceptfrom the prophet, seer, and revelator and Presidentof The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A clear statement follows regarding the sealing power as binding on all that we do for the living and thedead. \"Whenever the fulness of the gospel is on earth, the Lord has agents to whom he gives power to bind onearth and seal eternally in the heavens D&C 132:46-49.) . . . \"All things that are not sealed by this power have an end when men are dead. Unless a baptism hasthis enduring seal, it will not admit a person to thecelestial kingdom; unless an eternal marriagecovenant is sealed by this authority, it will not takethe participating parties to an exaltation in thehighest heaven within the celestial world. \"All things gain enduring force and validity because of the sealing power. So comprehensive is this powerthat it embraces ordinances performed for the livingand the dead, seals the children on earth up to theirfathers who went before, and forms the enduringpatriarchal chain that will exist eternally amongexalted beings\" (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 2d ed., Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966, p. 683). In the Church we hold sufficient authority to perform all of the ordinances necessary to redeem and toexalt the whole human family. And, because wehave the keys to the sealing power, what we bind inproper order here will be bound in heaven. Thosekeys\u2014the keys to seal and bind on earth, and haveit bound in heaven\u2014represent the consummate giftfrom our God. With that authority we can baptizeand bless, we can endow and seal, and the Lord willhonor our commitments. The Prophet Joseph Smith said he was frequently asked the question, \"'Can we not be saved withoutgoing through with all those ordinances, etc?' I wouldanswer, No, not the fullness of salvation. Jesus said,'There are many mansions in my Father's house,and I will go and prepare a place for you.' House here named should have been translated kingdom; andany person who is exalted to the highest mansionhas to abide a celestial law, and the whole law too\"(History of the Church, 6:184). Not without Opposition Temples are the very center of the spiritual strengthof the Church. We should expect that the adversarywill try to interfere with us as a church and with usindividually as we seek to participate in this sacredand inspired work. Temple work brings so muchresistance because it is the source of so muchspiritual power to the Latter-day Saints and to theentire Church. At the Logan Temple cornerstone dedication, President George Q. Cannon made this statement: \"Every foundation stone that is laid for a Temple, and every Temple completed according to the orderthe Lord has revealed for his holy Priesthood, lessensthe power of Satan on the earth, and increases the ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 321power of God and Godliness, moves the heavens in mighty power in our behalf, invokes and calls downupon us the blessings of the Eternal Gods, and thosewho reside in their presence\" ( Millennial Star, 12 Nov. 1877, p. 743). When members of the Church are troubled or when crucial decisions weigh heavily upon their minds, itis a common thing for them to go to the temple. It isa good place to take our cares. In the temple we canreceive spiritual perspective. There, during the timeof the temple service, we are \"out of the world.\" Sometimes our minds are so beset with problems, and there are so many things clamoring for attentionat once that we just cannot think clearly and seeclearly. At the temple the dust of distraction seemsto settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, andwe can \"see\" things that we were not able to seebefore and find a way through our troubles that wehad not previously known. The Lord will bless us as we attend to the sacred ordinance work of thetemples. Blessings there will not belimited to our temple service. We willbe blessed in all of our affairs. Come to the Temple No work is more of a protection to this church thantemple work and the genealogical research thatsupports it. No work is more spiritually refining. No work we do gives us more power. No workrequires a higher standard of righteousness. Our labors in the temple cover us with a shield and a protection, both individually and as a people. So come to the temple\u2014come and claim your blessings. It is a sacred work.THE TEMPLE GARMENT: \"AN OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF AN INWARD COMMITMENT\" Elder Carlos E. Asay Emeritus Member of the First Quorum of the Seventy Ensign, Aug. 1997, 18-23 A few years ago, in a seminar for new temple presidents and matrons, Elder James E. Faust, thenof the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, told abouthis being called to serve as a General Authority. Hewas asked only one question by President Harold B. Lee: \"Do you wear the garments properly?\" to which he answered in the affirmative. He then asked ifPresident Lee wasn't going to ask himabout his worthines s. President Lee replied that he didn't need to, for hehad learned from experience that howone wears the garment is theexpression of how the individual feels about the Church and everything that relates to it. It is a measure of one's worthiness anddevotion to the gospel. There are some who would welcome a detailed dress code answering every conceivable question aboutthe wearing of the temple garment. They wouldhave priesthood leaders legislate lengths, specifyconditions of when and how it should and shouldnot be worn, and impose penalties upon those whomissed the mark by a fraction of an inch. Suchindividuals would have Church members strain at athread and omit the weightier matters of the gospelof Jesus Christ (see Matt. 23:23-26). Most Latter-day Saints, however, rejoice over the moral agency extended them by a loving Father inHeaven. They prize highly the trust placed in themby the Lord and Church leaders\u2014a trust implied inthis statement made by the Prophet Joseph Smith:\"I teach them correct principles, and they governthemselves.\" 1 Samuel the Lamanite declared: ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 322 The Lord will bless us as we attend to the sacred ordinance work of the temples.\"And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act foryourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you aknowledge and he hath made you free. \"He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye mightchoose life or death; and ye can do good and berestored unto that which is good, or have that whichis good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and havethat which is evil restored unto you\" (Hel. 14:30-31). I believe there is a critical body of knowledge relating to the temple garment. When that knowledge isobtained, Latter-day Saints filled with faith wear thegarment and wear it properly, not because someoneis policing their actions but because they understandthe virtues of the sacred clothing and want to \"dogood and be restored unto that which is good.\" Onthe other hand, when one does not understand thesacred nature of the temple garment, the tendencyis to treat it casually and regard it as just anotherpiece of cloth. The critical body of knowledge associated with the garment of the holy priesthood may be categorizedunder three headings: Armor of God, HistoricalBackground, and Teachings of Modern Prophets. I shall present some information pertaining to eachof these headings, hoping that the thoughts sharedwill provoke a greater appreciation of the garmentand stir a greater resolve in the minds of Saints towear it willfully and properly. Armor of God We are at war! Our enemy is not an invading armyfrom a bordering nation or a navy of some overseaspower. Bullets are not whizzing above our heads,nor are bombs exploding in and around our homes.Nevertheless, we are engaged in a life-and-deathstruggle with forces capable of thrashing us insideout and sending us down into the depths of spiritualdefeat if we are not vigilant. I refer, of course, to the \"wrestle\" against principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, andspiritual wickedness in high places spoken of by theApostle Paul (see Eph. 6:12). I refer to the onslaughtof immorality, crime, substance abuse, and otherinsidious influences threatening our society. Suchthreatening influences, along with other imminentdangers, constitute \"the wiles of the devil\" (Eph.6:11) against which we must in these\"perilous times\" (2 Tim. 3:1). Paul counseled: \"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand inthe evil day, and having done all, to stand\" (Eph.6:13). With his prophetic powers, Paul could foreseethe wicked conditions that would exist on the earthin our modern day. Therefore, he urged all Saints tohave their \"loins girt about with truth\" righteousness\" (v. have feet shod \"with the preparation of thegospel of peace\" (v. 15), to grasp \"the shield of faith\"(v. 16), to place on their heads \"the helmet ofsalvation\" (v. 17), to take \"the sword of the Spirit,which is the word of God\" (v. 17), and to prayalways (see v. 18) so that they might be preserved.He knew that armor made of truth, righteousness,faith, spirit, and prayer would protect people fromthe \"fiery darts\" (v. 16) crafted and thrown by Satanand his henchmen. There is, however, another piece of armor worthy of our consideration. It is the special underclothingknown as the temple garment, or garment of theholy priesthood, worn by members of The Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have receivedtheir temple endowment. This garment, worn dayand night, serves three important purposes: it is a reminder of the sacred covenants made with theLord in His holy house, a protective covering forthe body, and a symbol of the modesty of dress andliving that should characterize the lives of all thehumble followers of Christ. It is written that \"the white garment symbolizes purity and helps assure modesty, respect for theattributes of God, and, to the degree it is honored, a token of what Paul regarded as taking upon one thewhole armor of God (Eph. 6:13; cf. D&C 27:15). . . . Garments bear several simple marks of orientationtoward the gospel principles of obedience, truth,life, and discipleship in Christ.\" 2 Much, much more could be said about the war forthe souls of men and the whole armor of God. The war on the earth began in the days of Adam,continued down through the years with Moses andthe children of Israel, and still rages in a dispensationknown as the fulness of times\u2014a dispensationushered in by the revelations received through theProphet Joseph Smith. Hence, the issue of protectivecoverings enabling us to withstand the fiery darts ofSatan will continue to be of great significance. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 323We must put on the armor of God spoken of by the Apostle Paul and reiterated in a modern revelation(see D&C 27:15-18). We must also \"put on the armorof righteousness\" (2 Ne. 1:23) symbolized by thetemple garment. Otherwise, we may lose the warand perish. The heavy armor worn by soldiers of a former day, including helmets, shields, and breastplates,determined the outcome of some battles. However,the real battles of life in our modern day will bewon by those who are clad in a spiritual armor\u2014anarmor consisting of faith in God, faith in self, faithin one's cause, and faith in one's leaders. The piece ofarmor called the temple garment not only providesthe comfort and warmth of a cloth covering, it alsostrengthens the wearer to resist temptation, fend offevil influences, and stand firmly for the right. Historical Background It should be understood that \"the things of the Lord\" (2 Ne. 4:16) have included sacred clothingfrom the very beginning of this world. The scripturescontain many references to the wearing of specialgarments by the ancients. Prior to their expulsionfrom the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were cladin sacred clothing. We read: \"Unto Adam also andto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins,and clothed them\" (Gen. 3:21). They received this clothing in a context of instruction on the Atonement, sacrifice, repentance,and forgiveness (see Moses 5:5-8). The templegarment given to Latter-day Saints is provided in asimilar context. It is given to remind wearers of thecontinuing need for repentance, the need to honorbinding covenants made in the house of the Lord,and the need to cherish and share virtue in our dailyliving so that promised blessings may be claimed. Moses was commanded to place holy garments and priestly vestments upon Aaron and others, thuspreparing them to officiate in the tabernacle. Saidthe Lord to Moses, \"And take thou unto thee Aaronthy brother, and his sons with him, from amongthe children of Israel . . . and thou shalt make holygarments for glory and forbeauty . . . that he may minister unto me in thepriest's office\" (Ex. 28:1-3). References to Aaron's clothing and the vestments of the priesthood worn by selected leaders in OldTestament times are accompanied expressionssuch expressions may apply more particularly to the raiment worn by those whoofficiated in tabernacle or temple rites; nevertheless,these descriptive words also apply to the sacredclothing worn on a daily basis by those \"who callthemselves [God's] name The honor, glory,and precious nature of sacred garments, whetherworn only in the temple or in everyday life understreet clothes, transcends the material of which theyare made. Their full worth and beauty is appreciatedand regarded as precious or glorious when viewedthrough the \"eye of faith\" (Alma 5:15). \"The garment is inadequate without the thing that it signifies. . . . It won't protect you unless you'retrue and faithful to your covenant, and only to thedegree to which you don't dishonor your garmenthas it any significance at all. Only on that conditionthat you don't dishonor it, that you're pure, thatyou are true and faithful to your covenant\u2014doesthe garment have any benefit,\" wrote Hugh Nibley,an emeritus professor of ancient scripture atBrigham Young University. 4 Yes, garments have been worn by prophets andother righteous Saints throughout the ages, wheneverthe ordinances of the priesthood and the templehave been available to the children of men. Whenthe Church was restored to the earth in our day, thesacred priesthood ordinances associated with theholy temple were revealed anew to the ProphetJoseph Smith. The revelations he received includedinstructions about the garment. Many references are found in the scriptures relating to garments and clothing. Enoch declared: \"I beheldthe heavens open, and I was clothed with glory\"(Moses 7:3). Jacob spoke of a day of judgment when\"we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt,and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and therighteous shall have a perfect knowledge of theirenjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothedwith purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness\"(2 Isaiah rejoiced, saying, \"God . . . hathclothed me with the garments of salvation, he hathcovered me with the robe of righteousness\" (Isa.61:10). Alma referred to \"all the holy prophets, whosegarments are cleansed and are spotless, pure andwhite\" (Alma 5:24). These and other propheticstatements suggest not only a cleanliness and puritywithin one's soul, but also a spotless covering over ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 324one's soul, signifying a life of goodness and devotion to God. Teachings of Modern Prophets I fear that too many Church members take forgranted the promise of protection and blessingsassociated with the temple garment. Some wear itimproperly, and others remove it to suit whims ofcircumstance. In such cases, the instructions ofmodern prophets, seers, and revelators are ignoredand spiritual protection placed in jeopardy. In a letter from the First Presidency dated 3 July 1974, Church members were reminded of the sacrednature of the garment: \"The sacredness of thegarment mind; . . . the blessings which flowfrom the observance of our covenants are sufficientlygreat to recompense for any mere inconvenience.To break our covenants is to forfeit the protectionand blessings promised for obedience to them.\" 5 And in a letter to priesthood leaders dated10 October 1988, the First Presidency made thefollowing important statements regarding how thegarment should be worn: \"Church members whohave been clothed with the garment in the templehave made a covenant to wear it throughout theirlives. This has been interpreted to mean that it isworn as underclothing both day and night. Thissacred covenant is between the member and theLord. Members should seek the guidance of theHoly Spirit to answer for themselves any personalquestions about the wearing of the garment. . . .The promise of protection and blessings isconditioned upon worthiness and faithfulness inkeeping the covenant. \"The fundamental principle ought to be to wear the garment and not to find occasions to remove it.Thus, members should not remove either all or partof the garment to work in the yard or to loungearound the home in swimwear or immodest clothing.Nor should they remove it to participate in recre-ational activities that can reasonably be done withthe garment worn properly beneath regular clothing.When the garment must be removed, such as forswimming, it should be restored as soon as possible. \"The principles of modesty and keeping the body appropriately covered are implicit in the covenantand should govern the nature of all clothing worn.Endowed members of the Church wear the garmentas a reminder of the sacred covenants they havemade with the Lord and also as a protection againsttemptation and evil. How it is worn is an outward expression of an inward commitment to follow the Savior.\" 6 President Joseph F. Smith had strong feelings aboutthe proper wearing of the garment. Said he: \"The Lordhas given unto us garments of the holy priesthood,and you know what that means. And yet there arethose of us who mutilate them, in order that we mayfollow the foolish, vain and (permit me to say)indecent practices of the world. In order that suchpersons may imitate the fashions, they will nothesitate to mutilate that which should be held bythem the most sacred of all things in the world, nextto their own virtue, next to their own purity of life.They should hold these things that God has givenunto them sacred, unchanged and unaltered from thevery pattern in which God gave them. Let us havethe moral courage to stand against the opinions offashion, and especially where fashion compels us tobreak a covenant and so commit a grievous sin.\" 7 In his book, The Holy Temple, Elder Boyd K. Packer of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explainedsuccinctly why it is so important to wear thegarment properly. \"The garment represents sacred covenants. It fosters modesty and becomes a shield and protection tothe wearer. \"The wearing of such a garment does not prevent members from dressing in the fashionable clothinggenerally worn in nations of the world. Onlyclothing that is immodest or extreme in style wouldbe incompatible with wearing the garment.\" 8 What more needs to be said about the garment andthe way it is to be worn and treated? The principlesare stated clearly, and it is left to the wearers andtheir consciences to live accordingly. People of faithneed not be commanded in all things for they donot endeavor to excuse themselves in the least pointor over the absence of a Mosaic code of conduct.But rather, they govern their dress and behavior asGod and his prophets have decreed, allowing thejustice, mercy, and long-suffering of God to havefull sway in their hearts (see Alma 42:29-31). A Reminder We Carry I like to think of the garment as the Lord's way ofletting us take part of the temple with us when we ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 325leave. It is true that we carry from the Lord's house inspired teachings and sacred covenants written inour minds and hearts. However, the one tangibleremembrance we carry with us back into the worldis the garment. And though we cannot always be inthe temple, a part of it can always be with us tobless our lives. Don't forget that the word garment is used symboli- cally in the scriptures and gives expanded meaning to other words such as white, clean, pure, righteous,modesty, covering, ceremonial, holy, priesthood, beautiful, perfection, salvation, undefiled, worthy, white raiment,shield, protection, spotless, blameless, armor, covenants,promises, blessings, respect, eternal life, and so forth. All of these words occupy special places in the vocabu-laries of people sincerely essaying to become Saints. Of one choice group of believers, it is written, \"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which havenot defiled their garments; and they shall walk withme in white: for they are worthy. \"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name outof the book of life, but I will confess his name beforemy Father, and before his angels\" (Rev. 3:4-5). How wonderful it would be if all Church members walked with God in white and were numbered withthe Saints in Sardis! Remember always that our very salvation depends, symbolically, upon the condition of our garments.The prophet Alma told the members of the Churchin his day that they could not be saved unless theirgarments were symbolically washed, cleansed, andmade white through the blood of Jesus Christ. Hetaught: \"No man [can] be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purifieduntil they are cleansed from all stain, through theblood of him of whom it has been spoken by ourfathers, who should come to redeem his peoplefrom their sins. . . . \"Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die atthis time, within yourselves, that ye have beensufficiently humble? That your garments have beencleansed and made white through the blood ofChrist, who will come to redeem his people fromtheir sins?\" (Alma 5:21, 27). It is my prayer that our garments will be cleansed through the blood of Christ and that we willreaffirm in our minds and hearts the declaration\"Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness, . . .and put on her beautiful garments\" (D&C 82:14).

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPLE PREPARATION 326TEMPORAL PREPAREDNESS SELECTED TEACHINGS President Spencer W. Kimball \"I like the way the Relief Society teaches personal and family preparedness as 'provident living.' Thisimplies the husbanding of our resources, the wiseplanning of financial matters, full provision forpersonal health, and adequate preparation foreducation and career development, giving appropriateattention to home production and storage as well as the development of emotional resiliency\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1977, 125; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, 78). Elder L. Tom Perry \"On a daily basis we witness widely fluctuating inflation; wars; interpersonal conflicts; nationaldisasters; variances in weather conditions;innumerable forces of immorality, crime, andviolence; attacks and pressures on the family andindividuals; technological advances that makeoccupations obsolete; and so on. The need forpreparation is abundantly clear. The great blessingof being prepared gives us freedom from fear, asguaranteed to us by the Lord in the Doctrine andCovenants: 'If ye are prepared ye shall not fear'(D&C 38:30). \"Just as it is important to prepare ourselves spiritually, we must also prepare ourselves for our temporalneeds. Each of us needs to take the time to askourselves, What preparation should I make to carefor my needs and the needs of my family? \"We have been instructed for years to follow at least four requirements in preparing for that which isto come.\"First, gain an adequate education. . . . \"Second, live strictly within your income and save something for a rainy day. . . . \"Third, avoid excessive debt. . . .\"Fourth, acquire and store a reserve of food and supplies that will sustain life\" (in ConferenceReport, Sept.-Oct. 1995, 46-47; or Ensign, Nov. 1995, 35-36). Health President Spencer W. Kimball \"We teach our people to live the laws of health. It is paying important dividends in longer and morehealthy lives\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1975, 6;or Ensign, May 1975, 6). \"The principle of self-reliance stands theChurch's emphasis on personal and familypreparedness. . . . We hope that you are consciousof proper diet and health habits, that you may befit physically and able to respond to the manychallenges of life\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1978,120-21; or Ensign, May 1978, 79-80). \"We refrain from taking harmful substances intoour body. Through wisdom and moderation in allthings, we seek good health and a sense of physicalwell-being\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1978, 7; orEnsign, Nov. 1978, 6). Employment and Finances President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I urge you, brethren, to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in yourexpenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchasesto avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt asquickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage. \"This is a part of the temporal gospel in which we believe. May the Lord bless you, my beloved brethren,to set your houses in order. If you have paid yourdebts, if you have a reserve, even though it besmall, then should storms howl about your head,you will have shelter for your wives and childrenand peace in your hearts\" (in Conference Report,Oct. 1998, 69-72; or Ensign, Nov. 1998, 52-54).The principle of self-reliance stands behind the Church's emphasis on personal and family preparedness. \u2014President Spencer W. Kimball ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL327Elder Howard W. Hunter \"May we refer specifically to vocational work or employment. The employment we choose should behonorable and challenging. Ideally, we need to seekthat work to which we are suited by interest, by apti-tude, and by training. A man's work should do more than provide adequate income; it should providehim with a sense of self-worth and be a pleasure\u2014something he looks forward to each day .... \"There are impelling reasons for our sisters to plantoward employment also. We want them to obtainall the education and vocational training possiblebefore marriage. If they become widowed or divorcedand need to work, we want them to have dignifiedand rewarding employment. If a sister does notmarry, she has every right to engage in a professionthat allows her to magnify her talents and gifts\"(\"Prepare for Honorable Employment,\" Ensign, Nov. 1975, 122, 124). Elder Boyd K. Packer \"Do not ever belittle anyone, including yourself, nor count them, or you, a failure, if your livelihood hasbeen modest. Do not ever look down on those wholabor in occupations of lower income. There is greatdignity and worth in any honest occupation. Do notuse the word menial for any labor that improves the world or the people who live in it\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1982, 121; or Ensign, May 1982, 84). Elder M. Russell Ballard \"Brothers and sisters, what can we do to improve our family finances? May I suggest three importantkeys that will help us. They are attitude, planning,and self-discipline. \"The first key is to have a positive attitude towardourselves. \"Attitude is an important part of the foundation upon which we build a productive life. In appraising ourpresent attitude, we might ask: 'Am I working tobecome my best self? Do I set worthy and attainablegoals? Do I look toward the positive in life? Am I alertto ways that I can render more and better service?Am I doing more than is required of me?' . . . \"Some people who lived through the Great Depression and the period following, when the governmentbestowed gratuities upon the people, developed afeeling that the world owed them a living. In thatclimate, the First Presidency said in 1936: 'The aim ofthe Church is to help the people to help themselves.Work is to be re-enthroned as the ruling principleof the lives of our Church membership.' (InConference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 3.) . . . \"The love for work needs to be reenthroned in our lives. Every family should have a plan for work thattouches the lives of each family member so that thiseternal principle will be ingrained in their lives. . . . \"Brothers and sisters, let us discuss the second key, planning, which means to think out beforehand how we intend to reach our goals in life. Do we allhave a plan to increase our value where we areemployed? Have we taken the time to write downspecific goals, and have we designed a plan of actionto become more effective and productive? . . . \"The third key is to practice self-discipline both at our work and as we attempt to reduce our expenses in our homes. Regarding the latter, Church leadersshould set the example by seeing that stake andward financial requests are kept to a minimum.Members should\u2014 \"1. Avoid debt-pooling where exorbitant fees are charged. We may want to consolidate debts using a bank or credit union loan that can be repaid ata sensible interest rate over a reasonable length oftime. We may need to stop using our credit cards. \"2. Exercise self-discipline by telling ourselves 'We can't afford it' and refusing to take on furthercredit obligations. \"An argument was overheard one day. One spouse said, while scolding the other forextravagant spending, 'How many times do Ihave to tell you that spending money beforeyou get it is economically unsound?' \"'Oh,' said the other spouse, 'I don't know about that. This way, if you don't get the money, atleast you have something to show for it.' \"Please be patient and carefully control your purchases so that you will not become enslavedto your creditors. \"3. Make a budget and stick to it. \"4. Cut expenses by distinguishing between wants and needs. Economize by controlling the use of goods, services, and energy. \"5. Increase homemaking skills and have family members complete home and car repairs, whenfeasible. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPORAL PREPAREDNESS 328\"6. Invest wisely. Avoid speculations and get-rich- quick schemes. \"Brothers and sisters, every one of us has the potential to improve and increase his earningcapacity. We are far better off if we can improve andbecome more valuable on our full-time jobs than ifwe attempt to hold two jobs or to have mothersleave home to join the work force. \"When we learn to expect more success than failure in life, we soon will develop an attitude of success. \"'Nothing succeeds like success.'\"Remember\u2014a positive attitude, a well-thought-out plan, and consistent self-discipline can help usimprove our circumstances. Applying these keys inour daily work will help produce more income, andpracticing them in our homes will help reduceexpenses. When we combine these principles withkeeping the commandments of God, we can learnto become better managers of our time and resourcesand become financially secure\" (in Conference Report,Apr. 1981, 115-18; or Ensign, May 1981, 85-87). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"The foundation of self-reliance is hard work. Parents should teach their children that work is theprerequisite to achievement and success in everyworthwhile endeavor. Children of legal age shouldsecure productive employment and begin to moveaway from dependence on parents. None of usshould expect others to provide for us that whichwe can provide for ourselves\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1991, 20; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 16). Home Storage and Production President Spencer W. Kimball \"Recognizing that the family is the basic unit of both the Church and society generally, we call uponLatter-day Saints everywhere to strengthen andbeautify the home with renewed effort in thesespecific areas: food production, preservation, storage;the production and storage of nonfood items\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1976, 170; or Ensign, May 1976, 124). President Ezra Taft Benson \"I ask you earnestly, have you provided for your family a year's supply of food, clothing, and, wherepossible, fuel? The revelation to produce and storefood may be as essential to our temporal welfaretoday as boarding the ark was to the people in thedays of Noah\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987, 61;or Ensign, Nov. 1987, 49; To the Fathers in Israel, 4). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPORAL PREPAREDNESS 329TEMPTATIONS OF SATAN AND THE NATURAL MAN SELECTED TEACHINGS President Brigham Young \"Many think that the Devil has rule and power over both body and spirit. Now, I want to tell you thathe does not hold any power over man, only so faras the body overcomes the spirit that is in a man,through yielding to the spirit of evil. The spirit thatthe Lord puts into a tabernacle of flesh, is under thedictation of the Lord Almighty; but the spirit andbody are united in order that the spirit may have atabernacle, and be exalted; and the spirit is influencedby the body, and the body by the spirit. \"In the first place the spirit is pure, and under the special control and influence of the Lord, but thebody is of the earth, and is subject to the power ofthe Devil, and is under the mighty influence of thatfallen nature that is of the earth. If the spirit yieldsto the body, the Devil then has power to overcomethe body and spirit of that man, and he loses both\"(in Discourses of Brigham Young, 69-70). \"We are the natural sons and daughters of ournatural parents, and spiritually we are the naturalchildren of the Father of light and natural heirs tohis kingdom; and when we do an evil, we do it inopposition to the promptings of the Spirit of Truththat is within us. Man, the noblest work of God,was in his creation designed for an endless duration,for which the love of all good was incorporated in hisnature. It was never designed that he should naturallydo and love evil\" (in Journal of Discourses, 9:305).Elder Spencer W. Kimball \"Satan is very much a personal, individual spirit being, but without a mortal body. His desires to sealeach of us his are no less ardent in wickedness thanour Father's are in righteousness to attract us to hisown eternal kingdom\" ( Miracle of Forgiveness, 21). Elder Jeffrey R. Holland \"Many things happened in the process of the Fall, including changes that came to the physical bodiesof Adam and Eve. For one thing, they fell into'nature.' . . . \"Part of the natural world Adam and Eve entered included the addition to their bodies of blood\u2014acorruptible ingredient\u2014in what had been to thatpoint an uncorrupted body of bloodless flesh andbone. But even more important than such physicalchanges were the temptations of and threats to thespirit. Spiritual as well as physical separation fromGod came with the Fall. Humankind was cut offfrom the immediate personal companionship withGod that Adam and Eve had enjoyed in the gardenof Eden. As a result, they were distanced from theHoly Spirit and became less responsive to many ofthe things of righteousness. . . . \"Because this doctrine [of the natural man] is so basic to the plan of salvation and also because it isso susceptible to misunderstanding, we must notethat these references to 'natural' evil emphaticallydo notmean that men and women are 'inherently' evil. There is a crucial difference. As spiritual sonsand daughters of God, all mortal men and womenare divine in origin and divine in their potentialdestiny. As Doctrine and Covenants 93:38-39 teaches,the spirit of every man, woman, and child 'wasinnocent in the beginning.' But it is also true thatas a result of the Fall they are now in a 'natural'(fallen) world where the devil 'taketh away light'and where some elements of nature\u2014includingtemporal human nature\u2014need discipline, restraint,and refinement. It is as if men and women aregiven, as part of their next step in developmentalong the path to godhood, raw physical andspiritual ingredients\u2014'natural' resources, if you will.Those resources are not to run rampant but are tobe harnessed and focused so that their power andpotential (as is sometimes done with a 'natural'river or a 'natural' waterfall) can be channeled andthereby made even more productive and beneficial. We cannot \"come off conqueror,\" except we first \"put off\" the selfish, natural man! \u2014Elder Neal A. Maxwell ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL330\"Natural man, with all of his new and wonderful but as yet unbridled and unregenerated potential,must be made 'submissive' to the Holy Spirit, aspirit that still entices and lifts us upward. . . . Ourdeepest desires, our premortal yearnings, are stilldivine in their origins, and they are still deep in oursouls. The echoes of our earlier innocence stillreverberate, and the light that forsakes the evil onestill shines. Our hearts can\u2014and in their purity,do\u2014desire that which is spiritual and holy ratherthan that which is 'carnal, sensual, and devilish.' Ifthat were not so, we would be in a hopeless conditionindeed, and the idea of real choice would bejeopardized forever. We praise God our Father thatour true heritage is of him and that by yielding andsubmitting to his eternal influence we can overcomethe enmity which separated us from him and turnthose gifts from nature to our blessing rather thanour cursing\" (Christ and the New Covenant, 205-7). Elder Merrill J. Bateman \"The scriptures state that men and women are created in the image of God (see Genesis 1:26-27, Abraham4:27-28). Both women and men have within themthe attributes of divinity, and both are blessed asthey fulfill their divine callings. The apostle Peterand King Benjamin indicate that we partake of thedivine nature through Christ's atonement aided bythe Holy Ghost (see 2 Peter 1:3-8, Mosiah 3:19). Itis interesting to observe the similarity of the fruitsof the Spirit to the divine seeds inherited fromHeavenly Parents (see Galatians 5:21-22, 2 Peter1:3-8). Since 'light cleaveth unto light' and Spirit to spirit, the Holy Ghost is able to quicken us by aportion of light that causes the divine seeds withinto bud and to flower (D&C 88:29, 40). The degreeof light and the extent to which the attributesflourish is a function of how well women and menbridle their passions and are obedient to divineprinciples\" (\"The Eternal Family,\" 112-13). Elder J. Richard Clarke \"Throughout the ages, evil forces have attacked the family. Why do you suppose Satan is so obsessedwith its dissolution? Because it stands for everythinghe wants and cannot have. He cannot be a husband,a father, or a grandfather. He cannot have posteritynow or ever. Satan cannot even keep those he hasled away from God. He has no eternal kingdom orinheritance\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1989, 74;or Ensign, May 1989, 60).OUR FADING CIVILITY President Gordon B. Hinckley President of the ChurchBrigham Young University commencement andinauguration ceremony, 25 Apr. 1996 Your secular education is designed to give you animproved opportunity in the great marketplace ofthe world. You, in most cases, will be compensatedaccording to the value society places upon your skills. But, as you have been told before, there should be, there must be, another side to the coin you carrywith you from BYU. President David O. McKay,who for many years served as chairman of theBoard of Trustees, once said: \"True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literatureor art, but in the development of character. Trueeducation awakens a desire to conserve health bykeeping the body clean and undefiled. True educationtrains in self denial and self mastery. True educationregulates the temper, subdues passion and makesobedience to social laws and moral order a guidingprinciple of life. It develops reason and inculcatesfaith in the living God as the Eternal Father of all\"(Conference Report, April 1928, 102). . . .

Asone writer has said, \"People mightthink of a civilized community as onein which there is a refined culture. Notnecessarily; first and foremost it is onein which the mass of people subduetheir selfish instincts in favor of the common wellbeing\" (Royal Bank Letter, May-June 1995). He continues: \"In recent years the media have raised boorishness to an art form. The hip heroes ofmovies today deliver gratuitous put downs to ridiculeand belittle anyone who gets in their way. Badmanners, apparently, make a saleable commodity.Television situation comedies wallow in vulgarity,stand up comedians base their acts on insults totheir audiences, and talk show hosts become richand famous by snarling at callers and hecklingguests\" (Ibid). All of this speaks of anything but refinement. It speaks of anything but courtesy. It speaks of anythingbut civility. Rather, it speaks of crudeness andrudeness, and an utter insensitivity to the feelingsand rights of others. It is so with much of the language of the day. In schools and in the workplace there is so much ofsleazy, evil, filthy language. I hope that every one ofyou will rise above it. You are now graduates of thisgreat institution. You cannot afford the image ofthose whose vocabularies are so impoverished thatthey must reach into the gutter for words with whichto express themselves. Along with such uncouthtalk is so much of profanity. It too marks a lack ofcivility. The finger of the Lord wrote on the tabletsof stone, \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lordthy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold himguiltless that taketh his name in vain\" (Ex. 20:7). Sloppy language and sloppy ways go together. I hope that you have learned more than the sciences,the humanities, law, engineering and the arts, whileyou have been here. I hope that you will carry withyou from this hallowed place a certain polish thatwill mark you as one in love with the better qualitiesof life, the culture which adds luster to the mundaneworld of which we are a part, a patina which puts aquiet glow on what otherwise might be base metal.Said the Savior to the multitude: \"Yeare the salt of the earth: but if the salthave lost his savour, wherewith shallit be salted? it is thenceforth goodfor nothing, but to be cast out, andto be trodden under foot of men\"(Matt. 5:13). Civility is what gives savor to our lives. It is the salt that speaks of goodtaste, good manners, good breeding. It becomes an expression of the Golden Rule:\"Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would thatmen should do to you, do ye even so to them\"(Matthew 7:12). DISCIPLINE A VIOLENT TEMPER President Gordon B. Hinckley First Counselor in the First Presidency In Conference Report, Oct. 1991, 70-71, 73; or Ensign, Nov. 1991, 50-52 Permit me to read from another letter. Said the writer:\"My husband is a good man with many outstandingqualities and character traits, but underneath it allthere is a strong streak of authoritarianism. . . . Hisvolatile temper flares up often enough to remind meof all the potential ugliness of which he is capable. \"President Hinckley, . . . please remind the brethren that the physical and verbal abuse of women isinexcusable, never acceptable, and a cowardly wayof dealing with differences, especially and particularlydespicable if the abuser is a priesthood holder.\" Now, I believe that most marriages in the Church are happy, that both husbands and wives in thosemarriages experience a sense of security and love, ofmutual dependence, and an equal sharing of burdens.I am confident that the children in those homes, atleast in the vast majority of them, are growing upwith a sense of peace and security, knowing thatthey are appreciated and loved by both of theirparents, who, they feel, love one another. But I amconfident, my brethren, that there is enough of theopposite to justify what I am saying. Who can calculate the wounds inflicted, their depth and pain, by harsh and mean words spoken in anger? ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPTATIONS OF SATAN AND THE NATURAL MAN 332 Civility is what gives savor to our lives. It is the salt that speaks of good taste, good manners, good breeding.How pitiful a sight is a man who is strong in many ways but who loses all control of himself when some little thing, usually of no significantconsequence, disturbs his equanimity.In every marriage there are, of course, occasional differences. But I find nojustification for tempers that explodeon the slightest provocation. Said the writer of Proverbs, \"Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous\"(Proverbs 27:4). A violent temper is such a terrible, corrosive thing. And the tragedy is that it accom-plishes no good; it only feeds evil with resentmentand rebellion and pain. To any man or boy withinthe sound of my voice who has trouble controllinghis tongue, may I suggest that you plead with theLord for the strength to overcome your weakness, that you apologize to those you have offended, andthat you marshal within yourselves the power to discipline your tongue. To the boys who are here, may I suggest that you watch your temper now, in these formative years ofyour life. As Brother [David B.] Haight has remindedyou, this is the season to develop the power andcapacity to discipline yourselves. You may think it isthe macho thing to flare up in anger and swear andprofane the name of the Lord. It is not the machothing. It is an indication of weakness. Anger is not anexpression of strength. It is an indication of one'sinability to control his thoughts, words, his emotions. Of course it is easy to get angry. When the weakness of anger takes over, the strength of reason leaves.Cultivate within yourselves the mighty power ofself-discipline. . . . Beauty of Happy Marriage How beautiful is the marriage of a young man and a young woman who begin their lives togetherkneeling at the altar in the house of the Lord,pledging their love and loyalty one to another fortime and all eternity. When children come into thathome, they are nurtured and cared for, loved andblessed with the feeling that their father loves theirmother. In that environment they find peace andstrength and security. Watching their father, theydevelop respect for women. They are taught self-control and self-discipline, which bring the strengthto avoid later tragedy.The years pass. The children eventually leave thehome, one by one. And the father and the mother are again alone. But they have eachother to talk with, to depend on, to nurture, to encourage, and to bless.There comes the autumn of life and alooking back with satisfaction andgladness. Through all of the yearsthere has been loyalty, one to the other.There has been deference and courtesy.Now there is a certain mellowness, asoftening, an effect that partakes of a hallowed relationship. They realize that death may come anytime, usually to one first witha separation of a season brief or lengthy. But theyknow also that because their companionship wassealed under the authority of the eternal priesthoodand they have lived worthy of the blessings, therewill be a reunion sweet and certain. Brethren, this is the way our Father in Heaven would have it. This is the Lord's way. He has so indicated.His prophets have spoken of it. It takes effort. It takes self-control. It takes unselfishness. It requires the true essence of love,which is an anxious concern for the well-being andhappiness of one's companion. I could wishnothing better for all of you than this, and I praythat this may be your individual blessing, in thename of Jesus Christ, amen. PUT OFF THE NATURAL MAN, AND COME OFF CONQUEROR Elder Neal A. Maxwell Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1990, 15-19; or Ensign, Nov. 1990, 14-16 The Dangers of Selfishness So many times prophets warn about the dangers ofselfishness\u2014the inordinate and excessive concernwith self. The distance between constant self-pleasingand self-worship is shorter than we think. Stubbornselfishness is actually rebellion against God, because,warned Samuel, \"stubbornness is as . . . idolatry\"(1 Samuel 15:23). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPTATIONS OF SATAN AND THE NATURAL MAN 333 Who can calculate the wounds inflicted, their depth and pain, by harsh and mean words spoken in anger?Selfishness is much more than an ordinary problem because it activates all the cardinal sins! It is thedetonator in the breaking of the Ten Commandments. By focusing on oneself, it is naturally easier to bear false witness if it serves one's purpose. It is easier toignore one's parents instead of honoring them. It iseasier to steal, because what one wants prevails. It iseasier to covet, since the selfish conclude that nothingshould be denied them. It is easier to commit sexual sins, because to please oneself is the name of that deadly game in whichothers are often cruelly used. The Sabbath day iseasily neglected, since one day soon becomes justlike another. If selfish, it is easier to lie, because thetruth is conveniently subordinated. The selfish individual thus seeks to please not God, but himself. He will even break a covenant in orderto fix an appetite. Selfishness has little time to regard the sufferings of others seriously; hence the love of many waxes cold(see Matthew 24:12; D&C 45:27; Moses 6:27). The last days will be rampant with the cardinal sins, just \"as in the days of Noah.\" Society in the days ofNoah, scriptures advise, \"was corrupt before God\"and 6:11; Moses 8:28).Corruption and violence\u2014sound familiar? Both of these awful conditions crest because of surgingindividual selfishness. When thus engulfed, nowonder men's hearts in our day will fail them becauseof fear (see Luke 21:26; D&C 45:26). Even the faithfulcan expect a few fibrillations. Some selfishness exists even in good people. Jane Austen's character Elizabeth mused, \"I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not inprinciple\" (Pride and Prejudice [New York: Airmont Books, 1962], p. 58). The selfish individual has apassion for the vertical pronoun I.Significantly, the vertical pronoun Ihas no knees to bend, while the first letter in the pronoun wedoes. Selfishness, in its preoccupation with self, withholdsfrom others deserved, needed praise, causing a deprivation instead of giving a commendation. We see in ourselves other familiar forms of selfishness: accepting or claiming undeserved credit;puffing deserved credit; being glad when others gowrong; resenting the genuine successes of others;preferring public vindication to private reconciliation;and taking \"advantage of one because of his words\"(2 Nephi 28:8). All things are thus viewed selfishly\u2014what are their implications for \"me,\" much like the mattress on the highway which delayed traffic.When frustrated motorists finally got around themattress, none stopped to remove it because nowthere was nothing in it for him. The Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \"Mankind [is] naturally selfish, ambitious, and striving to excel oneabove another\" ( The Words of Joseph Smith, comp. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook [Provo:Brigham Young University Religious Studies Center,1980], p. 201). Saul, swollen with selfishness, was reminded about an earlier time \"when thou wast little in thine ownsight\" (1 Samuel 15:17). Jesus' Example of Meekness Selfishness is often expressed in stubbornness ofmind. Having a \"mind hardened in pride\" oftenafflicts the brightest who could also be the best(Daniel 5:20). \"One thing\" the brightest often lack:meekness! Instead willing mind\" whichseeks to emulate the \"mind of Christ,\" a \"mindhardened in pride\" is impervious to ascendancy (1 Chronicles 28:9; 1 Corinthians2:16; D&C 64:34). Jesus, who was and is \"moreintelligent than they all,\" is also more meek thanthey all (Abraham 3:19). Jesus put everything on the altar without fanfare or bargaining. Both before and after His astonishingatonement, He declared, \"Glory be to the Father\"(D&C 19:19; see also Moses 4:2). Jesus, stunninglybrilliant, nevertheless allowed His will to be\"swallowed up in the will of the Father\" (Mosiah15:7; see also John 6:38). Those with pride-hardenedminds are simply unable to do this. Put off the Natural Man Stubborn selfishness leads otherwise good people tofight over herds, patches of sand, and strippings ofmilk. All this results from what the Lord calls drop,\" while neglecting \"the more weightymatters\" (D&C 117:8). Myopic selfishness magnifiesa mess of pottage and makes thirty pieces of silver look like a treasure trove. In our intenseacquisitiveness, we forget Him who once said,\"What is property unto me?\" (D&C 117:4). Such is the scope of putting off the burdensome natural man, who is naturally selfish (see Mosiah3:19). So much of our fatigue, brothers and sisters,in fact, comes from carrying that needless load. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPTATIONS OF SATAN AND THE NATURAL MAN 334This heaviness of the natural man prevents us from doing our Christian calisthenics; so we end up tooswollen with selfishness to pass through the narrowneedle's eye. Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote of the need to \"shed my Martha-like anxiety about many things, . . .shedding pride, . . . shedding hypocrisy in humanrelationships. What a rest that will be! The mostexhausting thing in life, I have discovered,\" she said,\"is being insincere. That is why so much of sociallife is exhausting\" (Gift from the Sea [New York: Vintage Books, 1978], p. 32). Unchecked selfishness thus stubbornly blocks the way for developing all of the divine qualities: love,mercy, patience, long-suffering, kindness, graciousness,goodness, and gentleness. Any tender sprouts fromthese virtues are sheared off by sharp selfishness.Contrariwise, brothers and sisters, I cannot think ofa single gospel covenant the keepingof which does not shear off selfishnessfrom us! But what a battle for some of us! We are all afflicted in different degrees. Thequestion is, How goes the battle? Is ourselfishness being put off\u2014even if onlygradually? Or is the natural man like\"the man who came to dinner\"? Divine tutoring isgiven largely in order to help us shed ourselfishness, \"for what son [or daughter] is [there]whom the father chasteneth not?\" (Hebrews 12:7). Important Spiritual Perspectives Restoration scriptures tell us much more about howwe can really be forgiven through the atonement of Christ by means of which, finally, \"mercy . . .overpowereth justice\" (Alma 34:15). justified hope for the future\u2014enough hopeto develop the faith necessary both to put off thenatural man and to strive to become more saintly. Furthermore, because the centerpiece of the Atonement is already in place, we know thateverything else in God's plan will likewise finallysucceed. God is surely able to do His own work! (See2 Nephi 27:20-21.) In His plans for the humanfamily, long ago God made ample provision for allmortal mistakes. His purposes will all triumph andwithout abrogating man's moral agency. Moreover,all His purposes will come to pass in their time (seeD&C 64:32).However, without these later and other spiritualperspectives, see how differently we behave. Takeaway an acknowledgment of divine design, and thenwatch the selfish scurrying to redesign political and economic systems to make life pain-free andpleasure-filled. Misguided governments mean tolive, even if they live beyond their means, therebymortgaging future generations. Take away regard for the divinity in one's neighbor, and watch the decline in our regard for his property. Take away basic moral standards, and observe how quickly tolerance changes into permissiveness. Take away the sacred sense of belonging to a family or community, and observe how quickly citizenscease to care for big cities. Take away regard for the seventh commandment, and behold the current celebration of sex, the secular religion with its ownliturgy of lust and supportingmusic. Its theology focuses on\"self.\" Its hereafter is \"now.\" Itschief ritual is selfishness isreally self-destruction in slow motion! Each spasm of selfishness narrows the universe that much more by shutting down our awareness ofothers and by making us more and more alone.Sensations are then desperately sought precisely inorder to verify that one really exists. A variationoccurs when one is full of self-pity over affectionaldeprivation. He ends up in transgression. Surging selfishness presents us with a sobering scene as the natural man acts out his wants. Manyassert their needs\u2014but where have we lodged thecorresponding obligations? So many have becomedemanders, but where are all the providers? Thereare many more people with things to say than thereare listeners. There are more neglected and agingparents than there are attentive sons and daughters\u2014though, numerically, clearly it should not be so! Come off Conqueror Just as Jesus warned that some evil spirits would come outonly with \"prayer and fasting\" (Matthew 17:21), ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTEMPTATIONS OF SATAN AND THE NATURAL MAN 335 Divine tutoring is given largely in order to help us shed our selfishness.the \"natural man\" does not come off without difficulty either. Of this personal battle, the Lord has urged us to so live that we would \"come off conqueror\" (D&C off\" the selfish, natural man! The natural man is truly God's enemy, because the natural man will keep God's precious children fromtrue and everlasting happiness. Our full happinessrequires our becoming the men and women of Christ. Men and Women of Christ The meek men and women of Christ are quick topraise, but are also able to restrain themselves. Theyunderstand that on occasion the biting of the tonguecan be as important as the gift of tongues. The man and woman of Christ are easily entreated, but the selfish person is not. Christ never brushedaside those in need because He had bigger things todo! Furthermore, the men and women of Christ areconstant, being the same in private as in public. Wecannot keep two sets of books while heaven has but one. The men and women of Christ magnify their callings without magnifying themselves. Whereas the naturalman says \"Worship me\" and \"Give me thine power,\"the men and women of Christ seek to exercise long-suffering and unfeigned love (see Moses1:12; 4:3; D&C 121:41). Whereas the natural man vents his anger, the men and women of Christ are \"not easily provoked\"(1 Corinthians 13:5). Whereas the natural man isfilled with greed, the men and women of Christ\"seeketh not [their] own\" (1 Corinthians 13:5).Whereas the natural man seldom denies himselfworldly pleasures, the men and women of Christseek to bridle all their passions (see Alma 38:12). Whereas the natural man covets praise and riches, the men and women of Christ know such thingsare but the \"drop\" (D&C 117:8). Human history'shappiest irony will be that the will finally receive \"all that[the] Father hath\"! (D&C 84:38). We Do Not Own Ourselves One of the last, subtle strongholds of selfishness isthe natural feeling that we \"own\" ourselves. Of coursewe are free to choose and are personally accountable.Yes, we have individuality. But those who havechosen to \"come unto Christ\" soon realize that theydo not \"own\" themselves. Instead, they belong toHim. We are to become consecrated along with ourgifts, our appointed days, and our very selves. Hence,there is a stark difference between stubbornly\"owning\" oneself and submissively belonging toGod. Clinging to the old self is not a mark ofindependence, but of indulgence! Blessings of Shedding Selfishness The Prophet Joseph promised that when selfishnessis annihilated, we \"may comprehend all things,present, past, and future\" (The Personal Writings ofJoseph Smith, comp. Dean C. Jessee [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1984], p. 485). Even now, however,in gospel glimpses we can see \"things as they reallyare\" (Jacob 4:13). Indeed, the gospel brings glorious illumination as to our possibilities. Scales fall from our eyes with theshedding of selfishness. Then we see our luminousand true identity: On a clear day, rise and look around you, And you'll see who you are.On a clear day, how it will astound you\u2014That the glow of your being outshines every star . . .And on a clear day . . .You can see forever and ever more.[Alan Jay Lerner, \"On a Clear Day\" (Chappell and Co., 1965)] In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS 338THE TRADITION OF THEIR FATHERS Elder Marion D. Hanks Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1968, 115-18 The Tradition of Their Fathers It is to the phrase \"because of the tradition of theirfathers\" that I would give special attention in thesefew moments, and to the injunction to \"set in orderyour own house.\" Previously over this pulpit I have expressed my respect for children who have improved upon theways of negligent parents, and my compassion forchoice parents who have earnestly tried to bring uptheir children in the way they should go, only tohave those children use their agency and individualityto follow other ways. The Lord has taught us that inhis sight the son shall not bear the iniquity of thefather; neither shall the father bear the iniquity ofthe son. Each who is accountable must ultimatelyaccount for his own decisions. But multitudes of us still have our children at home, or have grandchildren, or are influential in thehomes or with the children of others. Great numbersof young couples are just starting their families, orsoon will be. All of us should be brought to solemnthoughtfulness by the sobering word that althoughchildren are \"innocent before God,\" the \"wickedone\" is able to take away \"light and truth\" \"throughdisobedience\" and \"because of the tradition of theirfathers.\" The first definition of \"tradition\" in a modern dictionary is: \"The knowledge, doctrines, customs,practices, etc., transmitted from generation togeneration. . . .\" Our Traditions What is the tradition in your individual home and mine? What \"knowledge, doctrines, customs,practices,\" and so forth are being or will betransmitted from our generation to our childrenand their children?God teaches us that children are to honor theirparents. What in us, our lives, our character, ourbehavior, is worthy of their honor? What in us is noble, responsible, faithful, gracious, considerate?What is worthy of their respect and their emulation? Do we teach honesty by being honest? I love to remember the story of the man who, while his littleson was with him, stopped at an isolated cornfield ona remote country road, and after looking before andbehind him, to the left and to the right, started toclimb the fence to appropriate a few ears of thefarmer's corn. Said his son: \"Dad, you forgot to look up.\" Integrity in the Home What happens to the boy whose father boasts ofthe slick deal he has made in which others wereoutwitted? Years ago the late Joseph Welch said, onthe occasion of his being named Father of the Year: \"If it were in my power to bestow on the youth of the land one single quality, I would not choose, I think,wit or wisdom or even that great boon, education.If I could choose but one, I would choose integrity.If one day my children and grandchildren say toone another, 'He taught us to value integrity,' I shallbe content. \"How is the quality of integrity passed on to the children in the home? It is passed on by living a lifeof integrity, of sober honesty, of responsible citizenship. How can one surely fail to pass this priceless quality on to children in the home? Bybeing a little lawless; by being a fixer; by being acheat and a chiseler. Not so long ago one of my twoboys spoke these sobering words to me. He said,'When the two of us were young, there were timeswhen you and Mom would obviously set out to tell us how to live the good life. We could alwaysrecognize those moments and we would close ourears and our minds. Your most influential momentswere your most inadvertent ones. We were apt toimitate what you really were\u2014not what you said youwere or even what you may have believed you were.' \"If your children are to have integrity, they must find it in the home and in you. If they live in anatmosphere of complete integrity, they will accept itas an attitude and never waver thereafter. Andhaving integrity, they will themselves find freedom;and having found it, gladly grant it to all others.\" ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS 339Ideals and Values Every parent should ask, What ideals and values is my child learning? What is his image of himself?What is the view of others that he is developing inour home? Is his experience with his parentsbringing him a growing consciousness that the\"bright light of God\" is over everything, and a growing confidence in the presence of hisHeavenly Father? In New Zealand we learned an old Maori proverb: \"A bird must have feathers to fly.\" Parents have theprimary responsibility for feathering our childrenfor flight. A child who lives in an atmosphere ofdisrespect, criticism, or shame will not be inclinedto respect or accept himself; and of shame it hasbeen impellingly written: \"Holocausts are causednot only by atomic explosions. Holocausts arecaused wherever a person is put to shame.\"(Abraham J. Heschel, The Insecurities of Freedom.) Our Treatment of Others Our treatment of others will certainly condition a child's attitude toward others. Children who seeand sense in parents a genuine concern for others,expressed in acts of kindness and compassion andunselfishness, will themselves be inclined to thinkwell of mankind and to do as the scriptures bid: to\"succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down,and strengthen the feeble knees.\" (D&C 81:5.) Young people so blessed may also be less susceptible to the bewilderment that confronts some in ourgeneration's paradoxical stress on man's rights andprivileges while at the same time belittling him as a creature of his environment, conditioned bysociological and psychological factors, not possessingthe powers and capacities of free agency, of thinkingand believing, of choosing and determining, not theunique personality that God has taught us we are.The \"conditioned-reflex\" version of the behavioristcannot inspire the mystery and awe and wonderwhich are the glory of man. To know, instead, thatevery individual is an eternal person, a potential godor goddess, capable of deep love and graciousness andmercy, more than human, is to prepare us to live withcourage and a sense of responsibility, to inspire self-reliance, self-respect, and genuine respect for others. Tradition of Discipline What is the tradition of discipline in our homes? Isour child pampered, indulged, permitted in a momentof crisis to transfer his guilt to others\u2014his parents,peers, family, the age he lives in, society? How willhe handle disappointment and failure if he is nottaught to face up to his mistakes honestly? We arenot talking of imposing senseless punishment. Weare talking of realities, of facts to be faced, of fair ruleswhich are understood and enforced, with sanctionsconsistently imposed when they are broken. \"Self-respect,\" someone has said, \"is the fruit of discipline;the sense of dignity grows with the ability to sayNO to one's self.\" (Heschel, op. cit.) Other Traditions to Pass On What shall we give to the children? Pray for a sense of humor. \"Laughter leavens life\" and bringsa sunny spirit. Pray also to be able to pass on the will to work, and the urge for excellence; the capacity for moralindignation, and the courage to stand alone; disdainfor evil, and love of justice; the ability to love withoutcondition or question. Do you know the story of theeight-year-old girl in an orphanage, unattractive,with annoying mannerisms, disliked by the teachersand administrators? One afternoon it was reportedthat she had broken a rule that would justify herexpulsion from the institution. Against regulationsshe had been seen depositing a note in a branch ofa tree overreaching the fence. The note was retrieved.It read: \"To whoever finds this: I love you.\" How in Your Home and Mine Is the Tradition of Patriotism? On the Saturday evening just before Christmas last year, two clean, handsome young men\u2014boys,really\u2014their battle gear stacked nearby, stood beforea large group of their comrades at China Beach nearDaNang, South Vietnam, and sang \"Silent Night.\"They had no accompaniment, and the sweet, clearring of their voices will always be remembered, andthe emotion we all felt. The next morning, beforedawn, one of those young men came to my sleepingquarters to say good-bye and shake hands oncemore as he joined his outfit to head out into thebush on a search-and-destroy mission. It was notthe Sabbath activity he would have chosen\u2014he wasdisappointed not to be able to worship with fellowservicemen in our scheduled meeting\u2014but he wenthis way to do his job. There is no question as to thetradition transmitted in this boy's home. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS 340Self-Control in Homes Fathers, mothers, what tradition are we planting in another generation, in our homes, as to self-control\u2014control of our tongues and tempers andappetites? In 1884 Henry Drummond made astatement on this theme that could be read regularlywith profit by each of us: \"We are inclined to look upon bad temper as a very harmless weakness. We speak of it as a mere infirmityof nature, a family failing, a matter of temperament,not a thing to take into very serious account inestimating a man's character. And yet . . . the Bibleagain and again returns to condemn it as one of themost destructive elements in human nature. \"The peculiarity of ill-temper is that it is the vice of the virtuous. It is often the one blot on an otherwisenoble character. . . . This compatibility of ill-temperwith the high moral character is one of the strangestand saddest problems of ethics. The truth is, thereare two great classes of sins\u2014sins of the Body andsins of the Disposition. . . . No form of vice, notworldliness, not greed of gold, not drunkenness itself,does more to unChristianize society than evil temper.For embittering life, for breaking up communities,for destroying the most sacred relationships, fordevastating homes, for withering up men andwomen, for taking the bloom off childhood; inshort, for sheer gratuitous misery-producing power,this influence stands alone.\" (Henry Drummond:The Greatest Thing in the World, pp. 43-46.) Traditions for Future Homes What traditions are we passing on for other homesin future times that are worthy of the memories we ourselves have? On occasion through the years I have enjoyed the blessing of asking large groups of adult leaders to meditate for a moment on theirconclusion to an unfinished sentence, and then sharetheir thoughts. The sentence reads: \"The thing Iremember best about my childhood at home withmy parents and family is _____.\" I suspect your answers would be about the same as those that I have heard. Never once has anyonementioned a high standard of living, or materialpossessions. Always they have spoken, as I wouldspeak, of attention from mom or dad; of familyassociations, traditions, sacrifices, adventures together;of books read aloud, songs sung, work accomplished;of family prayers and family councils; of smallpresents lovingly and unselfishly prepared; of homeyand wholesome and happy memories. My singlequestion to them has always been, and I ask it today,\"What are we giving our own children that theywill remember with equal joy and appreciation?\" Tradition of Children's Song Since our last conference my wife and I wereprivileged to visit Samoa and other islands in thefar seas. One afternoon in the mountain tops ofUpolu, in American Samoa, in the village of Sauniatu,we had a remarkable experience pertinent to thismoment. The village was deserted except for a fewvery young children and one or two who hadstayed home with them. The rest were working inthe fields or at other tasks. As we walked the singlelane of Sauniatu, between the rows of fal\u00e9s, from the monument toward the new chapel and school,we heard children singing. There were perhaps halfa dozen of them, none more than four years old, andthey were singing with the sweetness of childhooda song we instantly recognized, and stood entranced,in tears, to hear: \"I Am a Child of God.\" In that high mountain fastness, at the end of a long, tortuous road, on an island of the sea, we foundtiny dark-skinned children, none of them havingseen more of the world than their small village,singing what they had learned through the traditionof their fathers, the greatest truth in existence, saveone: I am a child of God. That other truth? That there is a God who hears the voices of his children. God bless us so to live and to teach that we may bring about a restoration of the home, the resurrection ofparenthood, that the \"wicked one\" can never takeaway \"light and truth\" from our children \"becauseof the tradition of their fathers.\" In the name ofJesus Christ. Amen. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTRADITIONS OF THE FATHERS 341TRUST IN MARRIAGE SELECTED TEACHINGS Trust President Howard W. Hunter \"Be faithful in your marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. Pornography, flirtations, andunwholesome fantasies erode one's character andstrike at the foundation of a happy marriage. Unityand trust within a marriage are thereby destroyed.One who does not control his thoughts and thuscommits adultery in his heart, if he does not repent,shall not have the Spirit but shall deny the faith andshall fear (see D&C 42:23; 63:16)\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 67; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 50). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"The Lord has proclaimed that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and is intendedto be an eternal relationship bonded by trust andfidelity. Latter-day Saints, of all people, should marrywith this sacred objective in mind\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1987, 58; or Ensign, May 1987, 47). Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"A willingness to maintain confidences. Be worthy of trust even in trivial questions and observations. Weighty questions and observations will only followif we have been trustworthy with the trivial. Treatinnermost trusts and concerns with respect. Build ondeserved trust. Individuals who are blessed to havea relationship with someone to whom they canconfidently talk and trust are fortunate indeed.Who is to say a family trust is not greater than a community trust?\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1976, 81-82; or Ensign, May 1976, 54).Greater Respect, Loyalty, and Unity Elder Ezra Taft Benson \"Marriage itself must be regarded as a sacred covenant before God. A married couple have anobligation not only to each other, but to God. He has promised blessings to those who honor that covenant. \"Fidelity to one's marriage vows is absolutely essential for love, trust, and peace. Adultery is unequivocallycondemned by the Lord. \"Husbands and wives who love each other will find that love and loyalty are reciprocated. This love willprovide a nurturing atmosphere for the emotionalgrowth of children. Family life should be a time ofhappiness and joy that children can look back onwith fond memories and associations\" (\"Salvation\u2014AFamily Affair,\" Ensign, July 1992, 2; or Conference Report, Oct. 1982, 85; Ensign, Nov. 1982, 59). Elder Gordon B. Hinckley \"No nation, no civilization can long endure without strength in the homes of its people. Thatstrength derives from the integrity of those whoestablish those homes. \"No family can have peace, no home can be free from storms of adversity unless that family and thathome are built on foundations of morality, fidelity,and mutual respect. There cannot be peace wherethere is not trust; there cannot be freedom wherethere is not loyalty. The warm sunlight of love willnot rise out of a swamp of immorality\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1970, 66). \"Was there ever adultery without dishonesty? In the vernacular, the evil is described as 'cheating.' Andcheating it is, for it robs virtue, it robs loyalty, it robssacred promises, it robs self-respect, it robs truth. Itinvolves deception. It is personal dishonesty of theworst kind, for it becomes a betrayal of the mostsacred of human relationships, and a denial ofcovenants and promises entered into before Godand man. It is the sordid violation of a trust. It is a selfish casting aside of the law of God, and likeother forms of dishonesty its fruits are sorrow,bitterness, heartbroken companions, and betrayedchildren\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1976, 92; orEnsign, May 1976, 61).There cannot be peace where there is not trust; there cannot be freedom where there is not loyalty. \u2014Elder Gordon B. Hinckley ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL342Elder James E. Faust \"Complete trust in each other is one of the greatest enriching factors in marriage. Nothing devastates thecore of mutual trust necessary to maintain a fulfillingrelationship like infidelity. There is never a justifica-tion for adultery. Despite this destructive experience,occasionally marriages are saved and familiespreserved. To do so requires the aggrieved party tobe capable of giving unreserved love great enoughto forgive and forget. It requires the errant party towant desperately to repent and actually forsake evil. \"Our loyalty to our eternal companion should not be merely physical, but mental and spiritual as well.Since there are no harmless flirtations and no placefor jealousy after marriage, it is best to avoid the veryappearance of evil by shunning any questionablecontact with another to whom we are not married\"(in Conference Report, Oct. 1977, 13-14; or Ensign,Nov. 1977, 10). Sister Barbara B. Smith \"The scriptural passages in Proverbs 31 are well known for their listing of the admirable qualities ofthe virtuous woman, whose 'price is far above rubies'(verse 10), but in verse 11 we discover a remarkabledescription of marriage. It reads: 'The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her.' This memorable line discloses, first, that the husband has entrusted hisheart to his wife, and second, that she safeguards it.They seem to understand an important truth, thatevery man and woman who covenant to establish a family must create a safe place for their love. \"The longing of the human heart is often for someone who will treat tenderly the devotion onehas to give. We hear it in the words of a poem byWilliam Butler Yeats: the man has just laid thewishes of his heart at the feet of his beloved, andthen he pleads, 'Tread softly, because you tread onmy dreams.' ('He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,'The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 3d ed., New York: Oxford University Press, p. 585.) . . . \"Trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living. It is the beginning place, the foundationupon which more can be built. Where trust is, lovecan flourish\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1981, 117;or Ensign, Nov. 1981, 84). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALTRUST IN MARRIAGE 343UNITY SELECTED TEACHINGS Importance of Unity in Marriage Elder Ezra Taft Benson \"A husband and wife must attain righteous unity and oneness in their goals, desires, and actions\"(\"Salvation\u2014A Family Affair,\" Ensign, July 1992, 2; or Conference Report, Oct. 1982, 85; Ensign, Nov. 1982, 59). Sister Barbara Winder \"I couldn't help thinking of the words of Paul as he admonished the Church to serve in unity andpurpose, and as he taught that all parts must functionfor the good of the whole. So it is in a marriage andin a family that we must function together\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1984, 79; or Ensign, May 1984, 59). Achieving Unity through Seeking the Lord and His Righteousness President Marion G. Romney \"There is but one way that we can be united, and that way is to seek the Lord and his righteousness.(See 3 Nephi 13:33.) Unity comes by following thelight from above. It does not come out of theconfusions below. While men depend upon theirown wisdom and walk in their own way, withoutthe guidance of the Lord they cannot live in unity.Neither can they come to unity by followinguninspired men. \"The way to unity is for us to learn the will of the Lord and then to do it. Until this basic principle isunderstood and observed, there will be no unityand peace on the earth\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1983, 21-22; or Ensign, May 1983, 17).Elder L. Tom Perry \"We see the unity that comes from a faith in God and a desire to build His kingdom. And we see thedissension that results when the hearts of thepeople turn to selfish wants and desires, to thepleasures of the flesh, to riches and worldlypossessions\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1987, 39;or Ensign, May 1987, 33). Elder James E. Faust \"Our unity comes from full agreement with righteous principles and general response to theoperation of the Spirit of God\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1993, 53; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 38). Achieving Unity through Charity Elder James E. Faust \"It is far more difficult to be of one heart and mind than to be physically one. This unity of heartand mind is manifest in sincere expressions of 'I appreciate you' and 'I am proud of you.' Suchdomestic harmony results from forgiving andforgetting, essential elements of a maturing marriagerelationship. Someone has said that we should keepour eyes wide open before marriage and half shutafterward (Magdeleine de Scud\u00e9ry, in John P. Bradley,et al., comp., The International Dictionary of Thoughts [Chicago: J. G. Ferguson Publishing Co., 1969],p. 472). True charity ought to begin in marriage, forit is a relationship that must be rebuilt every day\"(in Conference Report, Apr. 1993, 46; or Ensign,May 1993, 36). Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin \"I believe we must constantly nourish the seeds of love, harmony, and unity in our homes and families.Fathers are to preside over their families in kindness,remembering that 'no power or influence can orought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood,only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentlenessand meekness, and by love unfeigned' (D&C 121:41).Husbands and wives are to love each other with apure love that transcends selfishness\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1989, 8; or Ensign, May 1989, 8). Elder William R. Bradford \"Within each of us there is an intense need to feel that we belong. This feeling of unity and togethernesscomes through the warmth of a smile, a handshake,There is little we cannot accomplish if we will go forward with united hearts to do so. \u2014President Gordon B. Hinckley ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUAL344or a hug, through laughter and unspoken demon- strations of love. It comes in the quiet, reverentmoments of soft conversation, and in listening. Itcomes from a still, small voice reminding us that weare brothers and sisters, the children of a HeavenlyFather\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987, 91-92; or Ensign, Nov. 1987, 75-76). Achieving Unity through Loyalty President J. Reuben Clark Jr. \"An essential part of unity is loyalty. There can be no union where loyalty does not exist. Loyalty is a pretty difficult quality to possess. It requires theability to put away selfishness, greed, ambition andall of the baser qualities of the human mind. Youcannot be loyal unless you are willing to surrender.There is no growth, mental, physical or spiritual,unless there be some curtailment, some sacrificemay I say, on the part of him who would be loyal.His own preferences and desires must be put away,and he must see only the great purpose which liesout ahead\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1950, 180). Achieving Unity through Effective Communication Elder Marvin J. Ashton \"May our gracious and kind Heavenly Father help us in our needs and desires for more effective familycommunication. Communication can help buildfamily unity if we will work at it and sacrifice for it.For this goal, I pray in the name of the Lord JesusChrist. Amen\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1976, 82;or Ensign, May 1976, 54). Elder LeGrand R. Curtis \"To have a time when the family meets at the kitchen table may take considerable adjustment and careful planning, but what could be of moreimportance to the unity of the family, the spiritualgrowth of the family, the bridges built betweenmembers of a family as they talk, listen, and respond,surrounded by love? Our major success is simplytrying\u2014over and over\" (in Conference Report, Apr.1995, 110; or Ensign, May 1995, 83).Blessings of Unity President David O. McKay \"A child has a right to feel that in his home he has a place of refuge, a place of protection from thedangers and evils of the outside world. Family unityand integrity are necessary to supply this need\" (inConference Report, Apr. 1965, 7). President Gordon B. Hinckley \"I sense the great strength that can come of our unity. There is little we cannot accomplish if wewill go forward with united hearts to do so\" (inConference Report, Oct. 1988, 59; or Ensign, Nov. 1988, 48). Elder Richard G. Scott \"Marriage allows these different characteristics to come together in oneness\u2014in unity\u2014to bless ahusband and wife, their children and grandchildren.For the greatest happiness and productivity in life,both husband and wife are needed. Their effortsinterlock and are complementary. Each hasindividual traits that best fit the role the Lord hasdefined for happiness as a man or woman. Whenused as the Lord intends, those capacities allow amarried couple to think, act, and rejoice as one\u2014toface challenges together and overcome them as one,to grow in love and understanding, and throughtemple ordinances to be bound together as onewhole, eternally. That is the plan\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1996, 101; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 74). Elder Henry B. Eyring \"The Savior of the world, Jesus Christ, said of those who would be part of His Church: 'Be one; and if yeare not one ye are not mine' (D&C 38:27). And atthe creation of man and woman, unity for them inmarriage was not given as hope; it was a command!'Therefore shall a man leave his father and hismother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shallbe one flesh' (Genesis 2:24). Our Heavenly Fatherwants our hearts to be knit together. That union inlove is not simply an ideal. It is a necessity .... \"The Savior of the world spoke of that unity andhow we will have our natures changed to make itpossible. He taught it clearly in the prayer He gavein His last meeting with His Apostles before Hisdeath. That supernally beautiful prayer is recordedin the book of John. He was about to face the terrible ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALUNITY 345sacrifice for all of us that would make eternal life possible. He was about to leave the Apostles whomHe had ordained, whom He loved, and with whomHe would leave the keys to lead His Church. And soHe prayed to His Father, the perfect Son to the perfectParent. We see in His words the way families will bemade one, as will all the children of our HeavenlyFather who follow the Savior and His servants: \"'As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. \"'And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. \"'Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; \"'That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us:that the world may believe that thou hast sent me'(John 17:18-21). \"In those few words He made clear how the gospel of Jesus Christ can allow hearts to be made one.Those who would believe the truth He taught couldaccept the ordinances and the covenants offered byHis authorized servants. Then, through obedienceto those ordinances and covenants, their natureswould be changed. The Savior's Atonement in thatway makes it possible for us to be sanctified. Wecan then live in unity, as we must to have peace inthis life and to dwell with the Father and His Son ineternity\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1998, 85-86;or Ensign, May 1998, 66). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALUNITY 346WOMEN'S DIVINE ROLES ANDRESPONSIBILITIES SELECTED TEACHINGS See also \"Mothers' Employment Outside the Home\" on pages 237-40. The Divine Work of Women The Prophet Joseph Smith \"Let this Society teach women how to behave towards their husbands, to treat them with mildness andaffection. When a man is borne down with trouble,when he is perplexed with care and difficulty, if hecan meet a smile instead of an argument or amurmur\u2014if he can meet with mildness, it will calmdown his soul and soothe his feelings; when the mindis going to despair, it needs a solace of affection andkindness\" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 228). President Heber J. Grant \"There seems to be a power which the mother possesses in shaping the life of the child that is farsuperior, in my judgment, to the power of thefather, and this almost without exception. . . . Afterall it is by love, real genuine love of our fellows,that we accomplish the most. A mother's love seemsto be the most perfect and the most sincere, thestrongest of any love we know anything about. I, for one, rejoice in it because of its wonderfulexample to me\" ( Gospel Standards, 152). President George Albert Smith \"Woman has filled a wonderful part in the march of progress, but most important of all the dutiesthat have been laid upon the gentler sex, is the dutyof bringing into the world and rearing, the childrenof our Heavenly Father\" ( Sharing the Gospel with Others, 139). President David O. McKay \"Motherhood consists of three principal attributes or qualities: namely, (1) the power to bear, (2) theability to rear, (3) the gift to love. . . . \"This ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing to expressit in soul development, make motherhood the noblestoffice or calling in the world\" ( Gospel Ideals, 453). President Spencer W. Kimball \"Marriage is a partnership. Each is given a part of the work of life to do. The fact that some womenand men disregard their work and their opportunitiesdoes not change the program. \"When we speak of marriage as a partnership, let us speak of marriage as a fullpartnership. We do not want our LDS women to be silent partners or limited partners in that eternal assignment! Please be a contributing and fullpartner\" (\"Privileges and Responsibilities of Sisters,\" Ensign, Nov. 1978, 106). \"The Lord organized the whole program in thebeginning with a father who procreates, provides,and loves and directs, and a mother who conceivesand bears and nurtures and feeds and trains. The Lordcould have organized it otherwise but chose to havea unit with responsibility and purposeful associationswhere children train and discipline each other andcome to love, honor, and appreciate each other. Thefamily is the great plan of life as conceived andorganized by our Father in heaven\" (in ConferenceReport, Apr. 1973, 151; or Ensign, July 1973, 15). President Ezra Taft Benson \"It is divinely ordained what a woman should do. . . . The divine work of women involves companionship,homemaking, motherhood\" (\"In His Steps,\" 64). \"Brethren of the priesthood, I continue to emphasize the importance of mothers staying home to nurture,care for, and train their children in the principles ofrighteousness\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987, 60;or Ensign, Nov. 1987, 49; see also To the Fathers in Israel, 3-4).

The divine workof women involves companionship, homemaking,and motherhood. It is well if skills in these threeareas can first be learned in the parents' home andthen be supplemented at school if the need or desirepresents itself\" (\"In His Steps,\" 64). \"There are voices in our midst which would attempt to convince you that these home-centered truths arenot applicable to our present-day conditions. If youlisten and heed, you will be lured away from yourprincipal obligations. \"Beguiling voices in the world cry out for 'alternative life-styles' for women. They maintain that somewomen are better suited for careers than for marriageand motherhood. \"These individuals spread their discontent by the propaganda that there are more exciting and self-fulfilling roles for women than homemaking. Someeven have been bold to suggest that the Churchmove away from the 'Mormon woman stereotype'of homemaking and rearing children. They also sayit is wise to limit your family so you can have moretime for personal goals and self-fulfillment\" (\"TheHonored Place of Woman,\" Ensign, Nov. 1981, 105). President Howard W. Hunter \"Mothers are given a sacred privilege to 'bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of [the] Fathercontinued, that he may glorified' (D&C 132:63). \"The First Presidency has said: 'Motherhood is near to divinity.

Mothers perform a labor the priesthood cannot do. For this gift oflife, the priesthood should have love unboundedfor the mothers of their children. . . . \". . . The Lord has commanded that women and children have claim on their husbands and fathersfor their maintenance (see D&C 83; 1 Timothy 5:8).President Ezra Taft Benson has stated that when a husband encourages or insists that his wife workout of the home for their convenience, 'not onlywill the family suffer in such instances, . . . but [his] own spiritual growth and progression will behampered' (in Conference Report, Oct. 1987, pp.60-61; or Ensign, Nov. 1987, p. 49)\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 67, 69; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 50-51).

Inthese sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothersare obligated to help one another as equal partners.Disability, death, or other circumstances maynecessitate individual adaptation. Extended familiesshould lend support when needed\" (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102). Elder Ezra Taft Benson \"One apparent impact of the women's movement has been the feelings of discontent it has createdamong young women who have chosen the role ofwife and mother. They are often made to feel thatthere are more exciting and self-fulfilling roles forwomen than housework, diaper changing, andchildren calling for mother. This view loses sight ofthe eternal perspective that God elected women tothe noble role of mother and that exaltation is eternalfatherhood and eternal motherhood ('To the ElectWomen of the Kingdom God,' Nauvoo IllinoisRelief Society Dedication, 30 June 1978)\" (Teachingsof Ezra Taft Benson, 548). Elder Richard G. Scott \"Beware of the subtle ways Satan employs to take you from the plan of God [2 Nephi 9:13] and truehappiness. One of Satan's most effective approachesis to demean the role of wife and mother in the home.This is an attack at the very heart of God's plan to ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 348foster love between husband and wife and to nurture children in an atmosphere of understanding, peace,appreciation, and support. Much of the violencethat is rampant in the world today is the harvest ofweakened homes. Government and social plans willnot effectively correct that, nor can the best effortsof schools and churches fully compensate for theabsence of the tender care of a compassionatemother and wife in the home. \"This morning President Hinckley spoke of the importance of a mother in the home. Study hismessage. As a mother guided by the Lord, youweave a fabric of character in your children fromthreads of truth through careful instruction andworthy example. You imbue the traits of honesty,faith in God, duty, respect for others, kindness, self-confidence, and the desire to contribute, to learn,and to give in your trusting children's minds andhearts. No day-care center can do that. It is yoursacred right and privilege. \"Of course, as a woman you can do exceptionally well in the workplace, but is that the best use ofyour divinely appointed talents and feminine traits?As a husband, don't encourage your wife to go towork to help in your divinely appointed responsibilityof providing resources for the family, if you canpossibly avoid it. As the prophets have counseled,to the extent possible with the help of the Lord, asparents, work together to keep Mother in thehome. 22Your presence there will strengthen the self-confidence of your children and decrease thechance of emotional challenges. Moreover, as youteach truth by word and example, those childrenwill come to understand who they are and whatthey can obtain as divine children of Father inHeaven\" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 102; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 74-75). Sister Patricia T. Holland \"Eve was given the identity of 'the mother of all living' . . . before she ever bore a child. It wouldappear that her motherhood preceded her maternity, just as surely as the perfection of the Garden precededthe struggles of mortality. I believe mother is one of those very carefully chosen words, one of those richwords\u2014with meaning after meaning after meaning.We must not, at all costs, let that word divide us. I believe with all of my heart that it is first andforemost a statement about nature, not a headcount of our children.\". . . Some women give birth and raise children butnever 'mother' them. Others, whom I love with allmy heart, 'mother' all their lives but have nevergiven birth. And all of us are Eve's daughters, whetherwe are married or single, maternal or barren. We arecreated in the image of the Gods to become gods andgoddesses\" (\"'One Thing Needful': Becoming Womenof Greater Faith in Christ,\" Ensign, Oct. 1987, 33). What Is a Help Meet? President Howard W. Hunter \"A man who holds the priesthood accepts his wife as a partner in the leadership of the home and familywith full knowledge of and full participation in alldecisions relating thereto. Of necessity there mustbe in the Church and in the home a presiding officer(see D&C 107:21). By divine appointment, theresponsibility to preside in the home rests upon thepriesthood holder (see Moses 4:22). The Lord intendedthat the wife be a helpmeet for man ( meet means equal)\u2014that is, a companion equal and necessary infull partnership. Presiding in righteousness necessi-tates a shared responsibility between husband andwife; together you act with knowledge and partici-pation in all family matters. For a man to operateindependently of or without regard to the feelingsand counsel of his wife in governing the family isto exercise unrighteous dominion\" (in ConferenceReport, Oct. 1994, 68; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 50-51).

Kimball President of the Church Read by his wife, Sister Camilla Kimball Ensign, Nov. 1979, 102-4 My beloved sisters: I have been looking forward for months to the pleasure of meeting with you dearsisters once again in a worldwide conference of thewomen of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints. Unfortunately for me, I am in the hospitalhere in Salt Lake City and will not be present withyou in person, but I will be with you in spirit. Infact, I will be watching and listening here in myroom at the LDS Hospital. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 349The counsel given at our meeting last year is still appropriate. Whenever I reflect and ponder uponthe glorious truths of the gospel, and that is often, I wonder if we even begin to appreciate theimplications of these glorious truths. Let us beginwith a few examples. The scriptures and the prophets have taught us clearly that God, who is perfect in his attribute ofjustice, \"is no respecter of persons\" (Acts 10:34). Weknow also that God is perfect in his love for eachand all of us as his spirit children. When we knowthese truths, my sisters and associates in this divinecause, it should help us greatly as we all experiencemuch less than perfect love and perfect justice inthe world. If, in the short term, we are sometimesdealt with insensitively and thoughtlessly by others,by imperfect men and women, it may still cause uspain, but such pain and disappointment are not thewhole of life. The ways of the world will not prevail,for the ways of God will triumph. We had full equality as his spirit children. We have equality as recipients of God's perfected love foreach of us. The late Elder John A. Widtsoe wrote: \"The place of woman in the Church is to walk beside the man, not in front of him nor behind him. Inthe Church there is full equality between man andwoman. The gospel, which is the only concern ofthe Church, was devised by the Lord for men andwomen alike\" (Improvement Era, Mar. 1942, p. 161). Within those great assurances, however, our roles andassignments differ. These are eternal differences\u2014with women being given many tremendousresponsibilities of motherhood and sisterhood andmen being given the tremendous responsibilities offatherhood and the priesthood\u2014but the man is notwithout the woman nor the woman without theman in the Lord (see 1 Cor. 11:11). Both a righteousman and a righteous woman are a blessing to allthose their lives touch. Remember, in the world before we came here, faithful women were given certain assignmentswhile faithful men were foreordained to certainpriesthood tasks. While we do not now rememberthe particulars, this does not alter the glorious realityof what we once agreed to. You are accountable forthose things which long ago were expected of youjust as are those we sustain as prophets and apostles! Even though the eternal roles of men and women differ, as we indicated to you a year ago, this leavesmuch to be done by way of parallel personaldevelopment\u2014for both men and women. In thisconnection, I stress again the deep need each womanhas to study the scriptures. We want our homes tobe blessed with sister scriptorians\u2014whether you aresingle or married, young or old, widowed or livingin a family. Regardless of your particular circumstances, as you become more and more familiar with the truths ofthe scriptures, you will be more and more effectivein keeping the second great commandment, to loveyour neighbor as yourself. Become scholars of thescriptures\u2014not to put others down, but to lift themup! After all, who has any greater need to \"treasureup\" the truths of the gospel (on which they maycall in their moments of need) than do women andmothers who do so much nurturing and teaching? Seek excellence in all your righteous endeavors, and in all aspects of your lives. Bear in mind, dear sisters, that the eternal blessings which are yours through membership in The Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are far, far greaterthan any other blessings you could possibly receive.No greater recognition can come to you in thisworld than to be known as a woman of God. Nogreater status can be conferred upon you than beinga daughter of God who experiences true sisterhood,wifehood, and motherhood, or other tasks whichinfluence lives for good. True, there are some temporary differences and some constraining circumstances. Some of you havelost your husbands through death, others throughdivorce. Some of you have not yet had the greatprivilege of marriage. But, on the scale of eternity,the missing of these blessings \"shall be but a smallmoment\" (see D&C 121:7). Others of the sisters are experiencing the anguish that often goes with aging. Still others of you nowknow the uncertainty of being young as you ponderyour place in the eternal scheme of things. But realas these challenges are, all of you need to drink indeeply the gospel truths about the eternal nature ofyour individual identity and the uniqueness of yourpersonality. You need, more and more, to feel theperfect love which our Father in Heaven has for youand to sense the value he places upon you as anindividual. Ponder upon these great truths, especiallyin those moments when (in the stillness of suchanxiety as you may experience as an individual)you might otherwise wonder and be perplexed. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 350Remember, too, as we focus on the glories and importance of family lifehere, that all of us belong to theeternal family of our Father in Heaven. Be assured, too, that all faithful sisters, who, through no fault of their own, donot have the privilege during theirsecond estate of being sealed to aworthy man, will have that blessing ineternity. On occasions when you achefor that acceptance and af fection which belong to family life on earth,please know that our Father in Heaven is aware of your anguish, and that one day he will bless youbeyond your capacity to express. Sometimes to be tested and proved requires that we be temporarily deprived\u2014but righteous women andmen will one day receive all\u2014think of it, sisters\u2014all that our Father has! It is not only worth waiting for;it is worth living for! Meanwhile, one does not need to be married or a mother in order to keep the first and second greatcommandments\u2014those of loving God and ourfellowmen\u2014on which Jesus said hang all the lawand all the prophets. Some women, because of circumstances beyond their control, must work. We understand that. Weunderstand further that as families are raised, thetalents God has given you and blessed you with canoften be put to effective use in additional service tomankind. Do not, however, make the mistake ofbeing drawn off into secondary tasks which willcause the neglect of your eternal assignments suchas giving birth to and rearing the spirit children ofour Father in Heaven. Pray carefully over all yourdecisions. We wish you to pursue and to achieve that education, therefore, which will fit you for eternity as well as for full service in mortality. In addition to thosebasic and vital skills which go with homemaking,there are other skills which can be appropriatelycultivated and which will increase your effectivenessin the home, in the Church, and in the community. Again, you must be wise in the choices that you make, but we do not desire the women of the Church tobe uninformed or ineffective. You will be bettermothers and wives, both in this life and in eternity,if you sharpen the skills you have been given anduse the talents with which God has blessed you.There is no greater and more gloriousset of promises given to women than those which come through the gospeland the Church of Jesus Christ. Whereelse can you learn who you really are?Where else can you be given thenecessary explanations and assurances about the nature of life? From whatother source can you learn about your own uniqueness and identity? Fromwhom else could you learn of ourFather in Heaven's glorious plan of happiness? The gospel answers are the only true answers to thequestions which women and men, over the centuries,have raised about themselves, about life, and aboutthe universe. How good God has been to us all inblessing us with these answers and assurances\u2014eventhough these truths place upon us serious andeverlasting obligations. How special it is for Latter-day Saint women to be given the lofty assignments they have been givenby our Father in Heaven, especially those of youwho have been privileged to be born in this part ofthis last dispensation. Let other women pursueheedlessly what they perceive as their selfish interests.You can be a much needed force for love and truthand righteousness on this planet. Let others selfishlypursue false values, but God has given to you thetremendous tasks of nurturing families, friends, and neighbors, just as men are to provide. But both husband and wife are to be parents! Finally, my dear sisters, may I suggest to you something that has not been said before or at leastin quite this way. Much of the major growth that iscoming to the Church in the last days will comebecause many of the good women of the world (inwhom there is often such an inner sense ofspirituality) will be drawn to the Church in largenumbers. This will happen to the degree that thewomen of the Church reflect righteousness andarticulateness in their lives and to the degree thatthe women of the Church are seen as distinct anddifferent\u2014in happy ways\u2014from the women of the world. Among the real heroines in the world who will come into the Church are women who are more concernedwith being righteous than with being selfish. Thesereal heroines have true humility, which places a higher value on integrity than on visibility. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 351 There is no greater and more glorious set of promises given to women than those which come through the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ.Remember, it is as wrong to do things just to be seen of women as it is to do things to be seen ofmen. Great women and men are always moreanxious to serve than to have dominion. Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical andthe spiritual growth of the Church in the last days. No wonder the adversary strives, even now, to prevent this from happening! Regardless of who is getting theadversary's special attention at any given time, heseeks to make all people \"miserable like unto himself\"(2 Ne. 2:27). Indeed, he seeks \"the misery of allmankind\" (2 Ne. 2:18). He is undeviating in hispurposes and is clever and relentless in his pursuitof them. As we approach the general conference with its priesthood session, we will be no less loving or directwith the brethren, for our counsel will be similar. We love you sisters. We have confidence in you. We rejoice in your devotion. We are greatly heartenedby your presence not only tonight but in this portionof this dispensation wherein your talents and spiritualstrength are so desperately needed. May God bless you so that all the previous blessings promised to you will become a reality in this lifeand in the world to come. I know that God lives, that Jesus is his Only Begotten Son, the Redeemer of the world, and that this is theChurch of Jesus Christ, with him as its head. I leavethis testimony with you with my love and myblessings. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. TO THE MOTHERS IN ZION President Ezra Taft Benson President of the ChurchFireside address, 22 Feb. 1987 There is no theme I would rather speak to thanhome and family, for they are at the very heart ofthe gospel of Jesus Christ. The Church, in large part,exists for the salvation and exaltation of the family. At a recent general priesthood meeting, I spoke directly to the young men of the AaronicPriesthood regarding their duties andresponsibilities. Shortly thereafter, at a generalwomen's conference, I spoke to the young womenof the Church, discussing their opportunities andtheir sacred callings. Tonight, at this fireside for parents, seeking the sweet inspiration of heaven, I would like to speak directlyto the mothers assembled here and throughout theChurch, for you are, or should be, the very heartand soul of the family. No More Noble Work No more sacred word exists in secular or holy writthan that of mother. There is no more noble work than that of a good and God-fearing mother. This evening I pay tribute to the mothers in Zion and pray with all my heart that what I have to say to youwill be understood by the Spirit and will lift andbless your lives in your sacred callings as mothers. President David O. McKay declared: \"Motherhood is the greatest potential influence either for good or illin human life. The mother's image is the first thatstamps itself on the unwritten page of the youngchild's mind. It is her caress that first awakens a sense of security; her kiss, the first realization ofaffection; her sympathy and tenderness, the firstassurance that there is love in the world.\" President McKay continues: \"Motherhood consists of three principal attributes or qualities: namely,(1) the power to bear, (2) the ability to rear, (3) thegift to love. . . . \"This ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing to expressit in soul development, make motherhood the noblestoffice or calling in the world. She who can paint amasterpiece or write a book that will influencemillions deserves the admiration and the plaudits ofmankind; but she who rears successfully a family ofhealthy, beautiful sons and daughters, whoseinfluence will be felt through generations to come, . . .deserves the highest honor that man can give, andthe choicest blessings of God\" (Gospel Ideals, 452-54). With all my heart I endorse the words of PresidentMcKay. A Mother's Role Is God-Ordained In the eternal family, God established that fathersare to preside in the home. Fathers are to provide,to love, to teach, and to direct. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 352But a mother's role is also God-ordained. Mothers are to conceive, to bear, to nourish, to love, and totrain. So declare the revelations. In section 132 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord states that the opportunity and responsibilityof wives is \"to multiply and replenish the earth,according to my commandment, and to fulfil thepromise which was given by my Father before thefoundation of the world, and for their exaltation inthe eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls ofmen; for herein is the work of my Father continued,that he may be glorified\" (D&C 132:63). Husbands and Wives Are Co-Creators With this divine injunction, husbands and wives, as co-creators, should eagerly and prayerfully invitechildren into their homes. Then, as each child joinstheir family circle, they can gratefullyexclaim, as did Hannah, \"For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord: as long as he liveth he shall belent to the Lord\" (1 Samuel 1:27-28). Isn't that beautiful? A mother praying to bear a child and then giving him to the Lord. I have always loved the words of Solomon: \"Children are an heritage of the full ofthem\" (Psalm 127:3-5). I know the special blessings of a large and happy family, for my dear parents had a quiver full ofchildren. Being the oldest of eleven children, I sawthe principles of unselfishness, mutual consideration,loyalty to each other, and a host of other virtuesdeveloped in a large and wonderful family with mynoble mother as the queen of that home. Young mothers and fathers, with all my heart I counsel you not to postpone having your children,being co-creators with our Father in Heaven. Do not use the reasoning of the world, such as, \"We'll wait until we can better afford having children,until we are more secure, until John has completedhis education, until he has a better-paying job, untilwe have a larger home, until we've obtained a fewof the material conveniences,\" and on and on. This is the reasoning of the world, and is not pleasing in the sight of God. Mothers who enjoy good health,have your children and have them early. And,husbands, always be considerate of your wives inthe bearing of children. Do not curtail the number of your children for personal or selfish reasons. Material possessions,social convenience, and so-called professionaladvantages are nothing compared to a righteousposterity. In the eternal perspective, children\u2014notpossessions, not position, not prestige\u2014are ourgreatest jewels. Brigham Young emphasized: \"There are multitudes of pure and holy spirits waiting to take tabernacles,now what is our duty?\u2014To prepare tabernacles forthem; to take a course that will not tend to drivethose spirits into the families of the wicked, wherethey will be trained in wickedness, debauchery, andevery species of crime. It is the duty of every righteous man and woman to prepare tabernacles for all the spirits they can\"(Discourses of Brigham Young, sel. John A. Widtsoe [Salt Lake City:Deseret Book Co., 1954], p. 197). Yes, blessed is the husband and wife who have a family of children. Thedeepest joys and blessings in life areassociated with family, parenthood,and sacrifice. To have those sweet spirits come into the home is worth practically anysacrifice. Special Promises of God We realize that some women, through no fault oftheir own, are not able to bear children. To theselovely sisters, every prophet of God has promisedthat they will be blessed with children in theeternities and that posterity will not be denied them. Through pure faith, pleading prayers, fasting, and special priesthood blessings, many of these samelovely sisters, with their noble companions at theirsides, have had miracles take place in their lives andhave been blessed with children. Others haveprayerfully chosen to adopt children, and to thesewonderful couples we salute you for the sacrificesand love you have given to those children you havechosen to be your own. Rearing Children the Lord's Way Now, my dear mothers, knowing of your divine roleto bear and rear children and bring them back to ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 353 The deepest joys and blessings in life are associated with family, parenthood, and sacrifice.Him, how will you accomplish this in the Lord's way? I say the \"Lord's way,\" because it is differentfrom the world's way. The Lord clearly defined the roles of mothers and fathers in providing for and rearing a righteousposterity. In the beginning, Adam\u2014not Eve\u2014wasinstructed to earn the bread by the sweat of hisbrow. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a mother'scalling is in the home, not in the marketplace. Again, in the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: \"Women have claim on their husbands for theirmaintenance, until their husbands are taken\" (D&C83:2). This is the divine right of a wife and mother.She cares for and nourishes her children at home.Her husband earns the living for the family, whichmakes this nourishing possible. With that claim ontheir husbands for their financial support, the counselof the Church has always been for mothers to spendtheir full time in the home in rearing and caring fortheir children. We realize also that some of our choice sisters are widowed and divorced and that others findthemselves in unusual circumstances where, out ofnecessity, they are required to work for a periodof time. But these instances are the exception, notthe rule. In a home where there is an able-bodied husband, he is expected to be the breadwinner. Sometimes we hear of husbands who, because of economicconditions, have lost their jobs and expect theirwives to go out of the home and work even thoughthe husband is still capable of providing for hisfamily. In these cases, we urge the husband to do all in his power to allow his wife to remain in thehome caring for the children while he continues toprovide for his family the best he can, even thoughthe job he is able to secure may not be ideal andfamily budgeting will have to be tighter. Counsel of President Kimball Our beloved prophet Spencer W. Kimball had muchto say about the role of mothers in the home andtheir callings and responsibilities. I amimpressed tonight to share with yousome of his inspired pr onouncements. I fear that much of his counsel hasgone unheeded, and families havesuffered because of it. But I stand thisevening as a second witness to thetruthfulness of what President Spencer W. Kimballsaid. He spoke as a true prophet of God. President Kimball declared: \"Women are to take care of the family\u2014the Lord has so stated\u2014to be anassistant to the husband, to work with him, but notto earn the living, except in unusual circumstances.Men ought to be men indeed and earn the livingunder normal circumstances\" ( The Teachings of Spencer 318). President Kimball continues: motherswork away from home to furnish sweaters andmusic lessons and trips and fun for their children.Too many women spend their time in socializing,in politicking, in public services when they shouldbe home to teach and train and receive and lovetheir children into security\" ( The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 319). Remember the counsel of President Kimball to Johnand Mary: \"Mary, you are to become a career womanin the greatest career on earth\u2014that of homemaker,wife, and mother. It was never intended by the Lordthat married women should compete with men inemployment. They have a far greater and moreimportant service to render\" ( Faith Precedes the Miracle [Salt Lake City: Deseret Co., 1975], p. 128). Again President Kimball speaks: \"The husband is expected to support his family and only in anemergency should a wife secure outside employment.Her place is in the home, to build the home into a heaven of delight. \"Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out intothe world into employment. Two incomes raise thestandard of living beyond its norm. Two spousesworking prevent the complete and proper home life,break into the family prayers, create an independencewhich is not cooperative, causes distortion, limitsthe family, and frustrates the children already born\"(fireside address, San Antonio, Texas, 3 Dec. 1977). Finally, President Kimball counsels: \"I beg of you, you who could and should be bearing and rearing a family: wives, come home from the typewriter, the laundry, the nursing,come home from the factory, the caf\u00e9. No career approaches in importancethat of wife, homemaker , mother\u2014 cooking meals, washing dishes,making beds for one's precioushusband and children. Come home, ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 354 No career approaches in importance that of wife, homemaker, mother.wives, to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home, wives, to your children, bornand unborn. Wrap the motherly cloak about youand, unembarrassed, help in a major role to create the bodies for the immortal souls who anxiouslyawait. \"When you have fully complemented your husband in home life and borne the children, growing up fullof faith, integrity, responsibility, and goodness, thenyou have achieved your accomplishment supreme,without peer, and you will be the envy [of all]through time and eternity\" (fireside address,San Antonio, Texas). President Kimball spoke the truth. His words are prophetic. Ten Ways to Spend Time with Children Mothers in Zion, your God-given roles are so vitalto your own exaltation and to the salvation andexaltation of your family. A child needs a mothermore than all the things money can buy. Spendingtime with your children is the greatest gift of all. With love in my heart for the mothers in Zion, I would now like to suggest ten specific ways ourmothers may spend effective time with their children. Be at the Crossroads. First, take time to always be at the crossroads when your children are either coming or going\u2014when they leave and return from school,when they leave and return from dates, when theybring friends home. Be there at the crossroadswhether your children are six or sixteen. In Proverbswe read, \"A child left to himself bringeth his motherto shame\" (Proverbs 29:15). Among the greatestconcerns in our society are the millions of latchkeychildren who come home daily to empty houses,unsupervised by working parents. Be a Real Friend. Second, mothers, take time to be a real friend to your children. Listen to your children, really listen. Talk with them, laugh and joke withthem, sing with them, play with them, cry withthem, hug them, honestly praise them. Yes, regularlyspend unrushed one-on-one time with each child.Be a real friend to your children. Read to Your Children. Third, mothers, take time to read to your children. Starting from the cradle, read to your sons and daughters. Remember what the poet said: You may have tangible wealth untold; Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold.Richer than I you can never be\u2014I had a mother who read to me.(Strickland Gillilan, \"The Reading Mother.\") You will plant a love for good literature and a real love for the scriptures if you will read to yourchildren regularly. Pray with Your Children. Fourth, take time to pray with your children. Family prayers, under the direction of the father, should be held morning andnight. Have your children feel of your faith as youcall down the blessings of heaven upon them.Paraphrasing the words of James, \"The Have your children participate infamily and personal prayers, and rejoice in theirsweet utterances to their Father in Heaven. Have Weekly Home Evenings. Fifth, take time to have a meaningful weekly home evening. With your husband presiding, participate in a spiritual and an uplifting home evening each week. Have yourchildren actively involved. Teach them correctprinciples. Make this one of your great familytraditions. Remember the marvelous promise madeby President Joseph F. Smith when home eveningswere first introduced to the Church: \"If the Saintsobey this counsel, we promise that great blessingswill result. Love at home and obedience to parentswill increase. Faith will be developed in the heartsof the youth of Israel, and they will gain power tocombat the evil influence and temptations whichbeset them\" (James R. Clark, comp., Messages of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1965-75], 4:339). This wonderful promise is still in effect today. Be Together at Mealtimes. Sixth, take time to be together at mealtimes as often as possible. This is a challenge as the children get older and lives getbusier. But happy conversation, sharing of the day'splans and activities, and special teaching momentsoccur at mealtime because mothers and fathers andchildren work at it. Read Scriptures Daily. Seventh, take time daily to read the scriptures together as a family. Individual scripture reading is important, but family scripturereading is vital. Reading the Book of Mormontogether as a family will especially bring increasedspirituality into your home and will give bothparents and children the power to resist temptationand to have the Holy Ghost as their constantcompanion. I promise you that the Book of Mormonwill change the lives of your family. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 355Do Things as a Family. Eighth, take time to do things together as a family. Make family outings and picnics and birthday celebrations and trips special timesand memory builders. Whenever possible, attend,as a family, events where one of the family membersis involved, such as a school play, a ball game, atalk, a recital. Attend church meetings together andsit together as a family when you can. Mothers whohelp families pray and play together will stay togetherand will bless children's lives forever. Teach Your Children. Ninth, mothers, take time to teach your children. Catch the teaching moments. This can be done anytime during the day\u2014atmealtime, in casual settings, or at special sit-downtimes together, at the foot of the bed at the end ofthe day, or during an early morning walk together.Mothers, you are your children's best teacher. Don'tshift this precious responsibility to day-care centersor baby-sitters. A mother's love and prayerful concernfor the children are her most important ingredientsin teaching her own. Teach children gospel principles. Teach them it pays to be good. Teach them there is no safety in sin.Teach them a love for the gospel of Jesus Christ anda testimony of its divinity. Teach your sons and daughters modesty, and teach them to respect manhood and womanhood. Teachyour children sexual purity, proper dating standards,temple marriage, missionary service, and the impor-tance of accepting and magnifying Church callings. Teach them a love for work and the value of a good education. Teach them the importance of the right kind of entertainment, including appropriate movies andvideos and music and books and magazines. Discussthe evils of pornography and drugs, and teach themthe value of living the clean life. Yes, mothers, teach your children the gospel in your own home, at your own fireside. This is the mosteffective teaching that your children will ever receive.This is the Lord's way of teaching. The Churchcannot teach like you can. The school cannot. Theday-care center cannot. But you can, and the Lordwill sustain you. Your children will remember yourteachings forever, and when they are old, they willnot depart from them. They will call you blessed\u2014their truly angel mother. Mothers, this kind of heavenly, motherly teaching takes time\u2014lots of time. It cannot be done effectivelypart-time. It must be done all the time in order to saveand exalt your children. This is your divine calling. Truly Love Your Children. Tenth and finally, mothers, take the time to truly love your children. A mother's unqualified love approaches Christlike love. Here is a beautiful tribute by a son to his mother: \"I don't remember much about her views of votingnor her social prestige; and what her ideas on childtraining, diet, and eugenics were, I cannot recall.The main thing that sifts back to me now throughthe thick undergrowth of years is that she lovedme. She liked to lie on the grass with me and tellstories, or to run and hide with us children. She wasalways hugging me. And I liked it. She had a sunnyface. To me it was like God, and all the beatitudessaints tell of Him. And Sing! Of all the sensationspleasurable to my life nothing can compare withthe rapture of crawling up into her lap and going tosleep while she swung to and fro in her rocking chairand sang. Thinking of this, I wonder if the womanof today, with all her tremendous notions and plans,realizes what an almighty factor she is in shaping ofher child for weal or woe. I wonder if she realizeshow much sheer love and attention count for in a child's life.\" Mothers, your teenage children also need that same kind of love and attention. It seems easier for manymothers and fathers to express and show their loveto their children when they are young, but moredifficult when they are older. Work at this prayerfully.There need be no generation gap. And the key is love.Our young people need love and attention, notindulgence. They need empathy and understanding,not indifference from mothers and fathers. Theyneed the parents' time. A mother's kindly teachingsand her love for and confidence in a teenage son ordaughter can literally save them from a wicked world. Blessings of the Lord upon Parents In closing, I would be remiss this evening if I didnot express my love and eternal gratitude for mysweetheart and companion and the mother of oursix children. Her devotion to motherhood has blessedme and our family beyond words of expression. She has been a marvelous mother, completely andhappily devoting her life and her mission to herfamily. How grateful I am for Flora! May I also express my gratitude to you fathers and husbands assembled this evening. We look to you ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 356to give righteous leadership in your home and families and, with your companions and the mothersof your children, to lead your families back to ourEternal Father. Now God bless our wonderful mothers. We pray for you. We sustain you. We honor you as you bear,nourish, train, teach, and love for eternity. I promiseyou the blessings of heaven and \"all that [the]Father hath\" (see D&C 84:38) as you magnify thenoblest calling of all\u2014a mother in Zion. In thename of Jesus Christ, amen. WOMEN OF THE CHURCH President Gordon B. Hinckley President of the ChurchIn Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 90-95; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 67-70 Women Are Essential to God's Plan Half, possibly more than half, of the adult membersof the Church are women. It is to them that I wishparticularly to speak this morning. I do so with thehope that the men will also hear. First let me say to you sisters that you do not hold a second place in our Father's plan for the eternalhappiness and well-being of His children. You are an absolutely essential part of that plan. Without you the plan could not function. Withoutyou the entire program would be frustrated. As I havesaid before from this pulpit, when the process ofcreation occurred, Jehovah, the Creator, under instruc-tion from His Father, first divided the light from the darkness and then separated the land from the waters.There followed the creation of plant life, followed bythe creation of animal life. Then came the creationof man, and culminating that act of divinity camethe crowning act, the creation of woman. Each of you is a daughter of God, endowed with a divine birthright. You need no defense of thatposition. Great Strength in Women of the Church As I go about from place to place, I am interviewedby representatives of the media. Invariably they askabout the place of women in the Church. They do soin an almost accusatory tone, as if we denigrate anddemean women. I invariably reply that I know ofno other organization in all the world which affordswomen so many opportunities for development, forsociality, for the accomplishment of great good, forholding positions of leadership and responsibility. I wish all of these reporters could have been in the Tabernacle a week ago Saturday when the generalRelief Society meeting was held. It was an inspirationto look into the faces of that vast gathering of thedaughters of God, women of faith and ability,women who know what life is about and havesomething of a sense of the divinity of their creation.I wish they could have heard that great chorus ofyoung women from Brigham Young University, whotouched our hearts with the beauty of their singing.I wish they could have heard the stirring messagesof the Relief Society general presidency, each ofwhom spoke on a phase of the subject faith, hope,and charity. What able people these women are. They express themselves with power and conviction and greatpersuasiveness. President Faust concluded thatservice with a wonderful talk. If those reporters who are prone to raise this question could have sat in that vast congregation, they wouldhave known, even without further inquiry, thatthere is strength and great capacity in the womenof this Church. There is leadership and direction, a certain spirit of independence, and yet greatsatisfaction in being a part of this, the Lord'skingdom, and of working hand in hand with thepriesthood to move it forward. The Real Builders of the Nation Many of you are here today who were in thatmeeting. Today you are seated with your husbands,men whom you love and honor and respect, andwho in turn love and honor and respect you. Youknow how fortunate you are to be married to agood man who is your companion in life and whowill be your companion throughout eternity.Together, as you have served in many capacities andreared your families and provided for them, youhave faced a variety of storms and come throughthem all with your heads held high. Most of you aremothers, and very many of you are grandmothersand even great-grandmothers. You have walked the sometimes painful, sometimes joyous path of ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 357parenthood. You have walked hand in hand with God in the great process of bringing children intothe world that they might experience this estatealong the road of immortality and eternal life. It hasnot been easy rearing a family. Most of you havehad to sacrifice and skimp and labor night and day.As I think of you and your circumstances, I think ofthe words of Anne Campbell, who wrote as shelooked upon her children: You are the trip I did not take; You are the pearls I cannot buy;You are my blue Italian lake;You are my piece of foreign sky.[\"To My Child,\" quoted in Charles L. Wallis, ed.,The Treasure Chest (1965), 54] You sisters are the real builders of the nationwherever you live, for you have created homes ofstrength and peace and security. These become thevery sinew of any nation. Rebuke to Abusers Unfortunately a few of you may be married to menwho are abusive. Some of them put on a fine facebefore the world during the day and come home inthe evening, set aside their self-discipline, and onthe slightest provocation fly into outbursts of anger. No man who engages in such evil and unbecoming behavior is worthy of the priesthood of God. No manwho so conducts himself is worthy of the privilegesof the house of the Lord. I regret that there are somemen undeserving of the love of their wives andchildren. There are children who fear their fathers,and wives who fear their husbands. If there be anysuch men within the hearing of my voice, as a servantof the Lord I rebuke you and call you to repentance.Discipline yourselves. Master your temper. Most of thethings that make you angry are of very small conse-quence. And what a terrible price you are paying foryour anger. Ask the Lord to forgive you. Ask yourwife to forgive you. Apologize to your children. Advice to Single Women There are many women among us who are single.Generally this is not of their own choice. Somehave never had the opportunity to marry one withwhom they would wish to spend eternity. To you single women who wish to be married, I repeat what I recently said in a meeting for singlesin this Tabernacle:\"Do not give up hope. And do not give up trying.But do give up being obsessed with it. The chancesare that if you forget about it and become anxiouslyengaged in other activities, the prospects willb r i g h t e n i m m e a s u r a b l y .... \"I believe that for most of us the best medicine for loneliness is work, service in behalf of others. I donot minimize your problems, but I do not hesitateto say that there are many others whose problemsare more serious than are yours. Reach out to servethem, to help them, to encourage them. There are somany boys and girls who fail in school for want ofa little personal attention and encouragement. Thereare so many elderly people who live in misery andloneliness and fear for whom a simple conversationwould bring a measure of hope and happiness\" (SaltLake Valley single adult fireside, 22 Sept. 1996). Assist Women Who Have Lost Husbands Included among the women of the Church are thosewho have lost their husbands through abandonment,divorce, and death. Great is our obligation to you.As the scriptures declare, \"Pure religion and undefiledbefore God and the Father is this, To visit thefatherless and widows in their affliction, and tokeep himself unspotted from the world\" (James 1:27). I received a letter from one who counts herself fortunate, and indeed fortunate she is. She writes: \"Although I have been raising our four boys as a single parent, . . . I am not alone. I have a wonderful'ward family' that has rallied around us. . . . \"My Relief Society president has been there for me through my greatest hardships, encouraging myspiritual growth, personal prayer, and templeattendance. \"Our bishop has been generous in providing needed food and clothing and has helped send two of theboys to camp. He has had interviews with all of usand given each of us blessings and neededencouragement. He has helped me to budget anddo what I can to help my family. \"Our home teachers have come regularly and even gave the boys blessings as they started the newschool year. \"Our stake president and his counselors have checked in on us on a regular basis by taking time to visitwith us at church, on the phone, or in our home. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 358\"This Church is true, and my boys and I are living proof that God loves us and that a 'ward family'can make all the difference. \"Our priesthood leaders have been instrumental in keeping the boys active in church and in the Scoutingprogram. [One] is an Eagle Scout and is receivinghis fourth palm this week. [Another] is an Eaglewith three palms. And [a third] has just turned inhis Eagle papers this week. The youngest is a Webelosand loves Cub Scouts. \"We are always met with loving hearts and warm handshakes. The Christlike attitude of the stake andour ward has helped us through trials we neverimagined possible. \"Life has been hard, . . . but we put on the whole armor of God as we kneel in family prayer . . . ,asking for help and guidance and sharing thanks forthe blessings we have received. I pray daily for theconstant companionship of the Holy Ghost toguide me as I raise these boys to be missionariesand encourage them to be true to the gospel andthe priesthood they hold. \"I am proud to say I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I know thisChurch is true. I sustain my Church leaders. We aredoing well, and I thank everyone for their love andprayers and acceptance.\" What a great letter that is! How much it says about the way this Church functions and should functionthroughout the world. I hope that every womanwho finds herself in the kind of circumstances inwhich this woman lives is similarly blessed with an understanding and helpful bishop, with a ReliefSociety president who knows how to assist her, withhome teachers who know where their duty lies andhow to fulfill it, and with a host of ward memberswho are helpful without being intrusive. I have never met the woman whose letter I have read. Notwithstanding the cheerful attitude sheconveys, I am sure there has been much of struggleand loneliness and, at times, fear. I notice that sheworks to provide for her needs and the needs of herboys, who are in their teens. I assume her income isinadequate, because she indicates that the bishophas helped them with food and clothing. Advice on Employment outside the Home Some years ago President Benson delivered a messageto the women of the Church. He encouraged themto leave their employment and give their individualtime to their children. I sustain the position whichhe took. Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has become very many,in fact) who have to work to provide for the needsof their families. To you I say, do the very best youcan. I hope that if you are employed full-time youare doing it to ensure that basic needs are met andnot simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home,fancy cars, and other luxuries. The greatest job that any mother will ever do will be in nurturing,teaching, lifting, encouraging, and rearing herchildren in righteousness and truth. None other canadequately take her place. It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. I know how some of youstruggle with decisions concerning this matter. Irepeat, do the very best you can. You know yourcircumstances, and I know that you are deeplyconcerned for the welfare of your children. Each ofyou has a bishop who will counsel with you andassist you. If you feel you need to speak with anunderstanding woman, do not hesitate to get intouch with your Relief Society president. To the mothers of this Church, every mother who is here today, I want to say that as the years pass, youwill become increasingly grateful for that whichyou did in molding the lives of your children in thedirection of righteousness and goodness, integrityand faith. That is most likely to happen if you canspend adequate time with them. Advice to Single Parents For you who are single parents, I say that manyhands stand ready to help you. The Lord is notunmindful of you. Neither is His Church. May He bless you, my beloved sisters who find yourselves in the situation of single parenthood.May you have health, strength, vitality to carry theheavy burden that is yours. May you have lovingfriends and associates to bear you up in your timesof trial. You know the power of prayer as perhapsfew others do. Many of you spend much time onyour knees speaking with your Father in Heaven,with tears running down your cheeks. Please knowthat we also pray for you. With all that you have to do, you are also asked to serve in the Church. Your bishop will not ask you ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 359to do anything that is beyond your capacity. And as you so serve, a new dimension will be added to yourlife. You will find new and stimulating associations.You will find friendship and sociality. You will growin knowledge and understanding and wisdom andin your capacity to do. You will become a bettermother because of the service you give in the workof the Lord. To Older Women Now in conclusion I wish to say a word to you olderwomen, many of whom are widows. You are a greattreasure. You have passed through the storms of life.You have weathered the challenges now facing youryounger sisters. You are mature in wisdom, inunderstanding, in compassion, in love and service. There is a certain beauty that shines through your countenances. It is the beauty that comes of peace.There may still be struggle, but there is maturewisdom to meet it. There are health problems, butthere is a certain composure concerning them. Thebad memories of the past have largely been forgotten,while the good memories return and bring sweetand satisfying enrichment to life. You have learned to love the scriptures, and you read them. Your prayers for the most part are prayers ofthanksgiving. Your greetings are words of kindness.Your friendship is a sturdy staff on which othersmay lean. What a resource are the women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You love this Church;you accept its doctrine; you honor your place in itsorganization; you bring luster and strength and beautyto its congregations. How thankful we are to you.How much you are loved, respected, and honored. I salute my own beloved companion. It will soon be 60 years ago that we walked from the Salt LakeTemple as husband and wife, with love for oneanother. That love has strengthened through all ofthese years. We have faced many problems duringour years of marriage. Somehow, with the blessingof the Lord, we have survived them all. It is becoming physically harder to stand tall and straight as we did in our younger years. No matter\u2014we still have one another and we still stand together,even though we lean a little. And when the time forseparation comes, there will be much of sorrow, butthere will also be the comfort that will come fromthe assurance that she is mine and I am hers for theeternity that lies ahead.Appreciation for Sisters And so, my beloved sisters, please know how muchwe appreciate you. You bring a measure of wholenessto us. You have great strength. With dignity andtremendous ability, you carry forward the remarkableprograms of the Relief Society, the Young Women,and the Primary. You teach Sunday School. We walkat your side as your companions and your brethrenwith respect and love, with honor and greatadmiration. It was the Lord who designated thatmen in His Church should hold the priesthood. Itwas He who has given you your capabilities to roundout this great and marvelous organization, which isthe Church and kingdom of God. I bear testimonybefore the entire world of your worth, of your graceand goodness, of your remarkable abilities andtremendous contributions, and I invoke the blessingsof heaven upon you, in the name of the Lord JesusChrist, amen. THE JOY OF LIVING THE GREAT PLAN OF HAPPINESS Elder Richard G. Scott Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles In Conference Report, Oct. 1996, 100-104; or Ensign, Nov. 1996, 73-75 God's Great Plan of Happiness The scriptures record, \"And I, God, created man. . . ; male and female created I them.\" 1This was done spiritually in your premortal existence whenyou lived in the presence of your Father in Heaven.Your gender existed before you came to earth. You elected to have this earth experience as part of His plan for you. The prophets call it \"the plan ofmercy,\" 2the \"eternal plan of deliverance,\"3\"the plan of salvation,\"4and, yes, \"the great plan of happiness.\"5You were taught this plan before you came to earth and there rejoiced in the privilege ofparticipating in it. Obedience to the plan is a requisite for full happiness in this life and a continuation of eternal joy beyondthe veil. Essential to His plan of happiness is agency\u2014the right of personal choice. Also fundamental isthe holy privilege of procreation to be exercised ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 360within the commitment of legal marriage. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternalplan. The family is ordained of God. 6As husband and wife, you have the responsibility to bear childrenand to nurture and train them spiritually, emotionally,and physically. 7 Satan also has a plan. It is a cunning, evil, subtle planof destruction. 8It is his objective to take captive the children of Father in Heaven and with every possiblemeans frustrate the great plan of happiness. Importance of Marriage in God's Plan Our Heavenly Father endowed His sons and daughterswith unique traits especially fitted for their individualresponsibilities as they fulfill His plan. To follow Hisplan requires that you do those thingsHe expects of you as a son or daughter,husband or wife. Those roles aredifferent but entirely compatible. Inthe Lord's plan, it takes two\u2014a manand a woman\u2014to form a whole.Indeed, a husband and wife are nottwo identical halves, but a wondrous,divinely determined combination of complementary capacities and characteristics. Marriage allows these different characteristics to cometogether in oneness\u2014in unity\u2014to bless a husbandand wife, their children and grandchildren. For thegreatest happiness and productivity in life, bothhusband and wife are needed. Their efforts interlockand are complementary. Each has individual traitsthat best fit the role the Lord has defined forhappiness as a man or woman. When used as theLord intends, those capacities allow a marriedcouple to think, act, and rejoice as one\u2014to facechallenges together and overcome them as one, togrow in love and understanding, and throughtemple ordinances to be bound together as onewhole, eternally. That is the plan. Learn from the Lives of Adam and Eve You can learn how to be more effective parents bystudying the lives of Adam and Eve. Adam wasMichael who helped create the earth\u2014a glorious,superb individual. Eve was his equal\u2014a full,powerfully contributing partner. After they hadpartaken of the fruit, the Lord spoke with them.Their comments reveal some different characteristicsof a man and woman. To Adam He said, \"Hast thoueaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee thatthou shouldst not eat?\" 9Now, Adam's response was characteristic of a man who wants to be perceived asbeing as close to right as possible. Adam responded,\"The woman thou gavest me, and commandest thatshe should remain with me, she gave me of the fruitof the tree and I did eat.\" 10And the Lord said unto Eve, \"What is this thing which thou hast done?\"11 Eve's response was characteristic of a woman. Heranswer was very simple and straightforward: \"Theserpent beguiled me, and I did eat.\" 12 Later, blessed God . . . and began to prophesyconcerning all the families of the earth, saying:Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression myeyes are opened, and in this life Ishall have joy, and again in the flesh Ishall see God.\" 13Adam was thinking about his responsibilities. He was trying to alignhis performance with the desires ofthe Lord. Eve said, \"Were it not for our transgression wenever should have had seed, and never should haveknown good and evil, and the joy ofourredemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.\" 14Eve's response was characteristic of a woman. She embraced all, wanted to make surethat everyone was considered. One response wasnot more correct than the other. The two perspectives resulted from the traits inherent in menand women. The Lord intends that we use thosedifferences to fulfill His plan for happiness, personalgrowth, and development. By counseling togetherthey arrived at a broader, more correctunderstanding of truth. They worked together. 15They obeyed the commandment to have children.16They knew the plan of happiness and followed it, even though at times it resulted in hardship and difficulty for them. They were commanded, \"Thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.\"17 And they did. Further, they taught their childrenthe plan of happiness. 18They worked together to overcome challenges,19and they \"ceased not to call upon God.\"20 Because Adam and Eve were obedient, the HolyGhost led them. As husband and wife, you canreceive direction in your lives by qualifying for thegift of the Holy Ghost through obedience to theteachings of the Savior. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 361 In the Lord's plan, it takes two\u2014a man and a woman\u2014to form a whole.Roles of Wife and Mother Beware of the subtle ways Satan employs to take you from the plan of God21and true happiness. One of Satan's most effective approaches is todemean the role of wife and mother in the home.This is an attack at the very heart of God's plan tofoster love between husband and wife and to nurturechildren in an atmosphere of understanding, peace,appreciation, and support. Much of the violencethat is rampant in the world today is the harvest ofweakened homes. Government and social plans willnot effectively correct that, nor can the best effortsof schools and churches fully compensate for theabsence of the tender care of a compassionate motherand wife in the home. This morning President Hinckley spoke of the importance of a mother in the home. Study hismessage. As a mother guided by the Lord, you weavea fabric of character in your children from threads oftruth through careful instruction and worthy example.You imbue the traits of honesty, faith in God, duty,respect for others, kindness, self-confidence, and thedesire to contribute, to learn, and to give in yourtrusting children's minds and hearts. No day-carecenter can do that. It is your sacred right and privilege. Of course, as a woman you can do exceptionally well in the workplace, but is that the best use of yourdivinely appointed talents and feminine traits? As a husband, don't encourage your wife to go to workto help in your divinely appointed responsibility ofproviding resources for the family, if you can possiblyavoid it. As the prophets have counseled, to theextent possible with the help of the Lord, as parents,work together to keep Mother in the home. 22Your presence there will strengthen the self-confidence ofyour children and decrease the chance of emotionalchallenges. Moreover, as you teach truth by word andexample, those children will come to understandwho they are and what they can obtain as divinechildren of Father in Heaven. Blessings to Be Given in the Lord's Time I know I have been speaking of the ideal, and youmay be disturbed because your life may not now fitthat mold. I promise you that through your obedienceand continuing faith in Jesus Christ and yourunderstanding of the whole plan of happiness, evenif important parts of it aren't fulfilled in your life now,they will be yours in the Lord's due time. I alsopromise you that you can have significant growthand happiness now in your present circumstances.As a daughter or son of God, live whatever portionof the plan you can to the best of your ability. Your desire to be a wife and mother may not have its total fulfillment here, but it will in His time as youlive in faith and obedience to merit it. 23Don't be lured away from the plan of our God 24to the ways of the world, where motherhood is belittled, femininityis decried, and the divinely established role of wifeand mother is mocked. Let the world go its way. Youfollow the plan of the Lord for the greatest measureof true, eternal achievement and the fullest happiness.The lack of promised blessings for which you qualifywill be fully rectified in this life or in the next. 25 Gratitude for What Women Are and Do I often interview strong priesthood leaders. Whenthese men speak of their wives, it is with deeptenderness and obvious appreciation. Often, tearsflow. Their comments include, \"She is more spiritual,purer, and more committed than I,\" \"She motivatesme to be a better ofmy life,\" and \"I couldn't do it without her.\" As awoman, please don't judge how worthwhile, needed,and loved you are by our inept ability to expressour true feelings. Your divinely conferred trait ofgiving of self without counting the cost leads youto underestimate your own worth. I humbly thank our Father in Heaven for His daughters, you who were willing to come to earthto live under such uncertain circumstances. Mostmen could not handle the uncertainties you areasked to live with. Social customs require that youwait to be asked for marriage. You are expected togo with your husband wherever his employment orcall takes him. Your environment and neighborhoodare determined by his ability to provide, meager ornot. You place your life in the Lord's hands eachtime you bear a child. Men make no such sacrifice.The blessing of nurturing children and caring for a husband often is intermingled with many routinetasks. But you do all of these things willingly becauseyou are a woman. Generally you have no idea ofhow truly wonderful and capable you are, how verymuch appreciated and loved, or how desperatelyneeded, for most men don't tell you as completelyand as often as needed. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 362How to Attain Happiness How can you receive the greatest happiness and blessings from this earth experience? Learn the doctrinal foundation of the great plan of happiness by studying the scriptures, pondering their content, and praying to understand them.Carefully study and use the proclamation of theFirst Presidency and the Twelve on the family. 26 It was inspired of the Lord. Listen to the voice of current and past prophets. Their declarations are inspired. You may verifythat counsel in your own mind and heart bypraying about it as it applies to your specialcircumstances. Ask the Lord to confirm yourchoices, and accept accountability for them. Obey the inner feelings that come as promptings from the Holy Ghost. Those feelings areengendered by your righteous thoughts and actsand your determination to seek the will of theLord and to live it. When needed, seek counsel and guidance from parents and your priesthood leaders. A choice mother wrote: \"How did the pioneerwomen . . . respond to the challenges of their day?They listened to their prophet's voice and followed him because they knew he spoke the will of the Lord. They met the challenges and reaped great blessingsbecause of their faith and obedience. Their firstpriorities were not security, nice homes, or an easylife. . . . No sacrifice was too great for them to makefor their precious husbands and children.\" 27 I obviously don't know what it feels like to be awoman, but I do know what it is to love one withall of my heart and soul. I constantly express to theLord overflowing gratitude for the unending blessingsthat flow to our children and so abundantly to mefrom the life of one of His precious daughters. I wantthe happiness we have found together to be yours.The more closely you personally adhere to His planfor you on earth, the greater will be your happiness,fulfillment, and progress; the more qualified youwill be to receive the rewards He has promised forobedience. I so testify, for the Savior lives and Heloves you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.Notes 1. Moses 2:27. See also Moses 2:28; 3:5; James R.

Scott, BYU Women's Conference, 6 Apr. 1989, 1. ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 363WE ARE WOMEN OF GOD Sister Sheri L. Dew Second Counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency Ensign, Nov. 1999, 97-99 Recently a professional assignment required me to travel out of the country. But I felt such a forebodingabout the trip that prior to leaving I sought apriesthood blessing. I was warned that the adversarywould attempt to thwart my missionand that physical and spiritual dangerlay ahead. I was also counseled thatthis was not to be a sight-seeing or ashopping trip and that if I would focus on my assignments and seek thedirection of the Spirit, I would returnsafely home. Well, the warning was sobering. But as I proceeded, pleading for direction andprotection each step of the way, Irealized that my experience wasn't allthat unique. Might not our Father have said to you and to me as we leftHis presence: \"The adversary will attempt to thwartyour mission, and you will face spiritual and physical danger. But if you will focus on your assignments, if you will heed my voice, and if youwill refuse to reduce mortality to a sight-seeing or ashopping trip, you will return safely home\"? The adversary is delighted when we act like sightseers, meaning those who are hearers rather than doers of the word (see James 1:22), or shoppers, meaningthose preoccupied with the vain things of this worldthat suffocate our spirits. Satan baits us withperishable pleasures and preoccupations\u2014our bankaccounts, our wardrobes, even our waistlines\u2014forhe knows that where our treasure is, there will ourhearts be also (see Matt. 6:21). Unfortunately, it iseasy to let the blinding glare of the adversary'senticements distract us from the light of Christ.\"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain thewhole world, and lose his own soul?\" (Matt. 16:26). Prophets have admonished us to forsake the world and turn our hearts to Jesus Christ, who promisedus, \"In this world your joy is notfull, but in me your joy is full\" (D&C 101:36; emphasis added). SaidPresident Spencer W. Kimball, \"If we insist onspending all our time and resources building up . . .a worldly kingdom, that is exactly what we willinherit\" (\"The False Gods We Worship,\" Ensign, June 1976, 6). How often are we so focused onpursuing the so-called good life that we lose sight ofeternal life? It is the fatal spiritual equivalent ofselling our birthright for a mess of pottage. The Lord revealed the remedy for such spiritual disaster when He counseled Emma Smith to \"layaside the things of this world, and seek for the thingsof a better\" (D&C 25:10). And Christ provided thepattern, declaring prior to Gethsemane, \"I have overcome the world\" (John 16:33; emphasis added). The only way thatwemay overcome the world is by coming unto Christ. And coming untoChrist means walking away from the world. It means placing Christ andChrist only at the center of our livesso that the vanities and philosophiesof men lose their addictive appeal.Satan isthe god of Babylon, or this world. Christ is the God of Israel, andHis Atonement gives us power toovercome the world. \"If you expect glory, intelligence and endless lives,\" said PresidentJoseph F. Smith, \"let the world go\" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph F. Smith [1998], 243; emphasis added). As sisters in Zion we can be obstacles to the adversary's conspiracy against families and virtue.No wonder he tempts us to settle for earthlypleasures rather than to seek for eternal glory. A45-year-old mother of six told me recently thatwhen she stopped poring over magazines thatplagued her with images of how her home andwardrobe should look, she began to feel more atpeace. She said, \"I may be chubby, gray, andwrinkled, but I am a chubby, gray, wrinkled daughter of God, who knows me and loves me.\" Relief Society can help us turn away from the world,for its express purpose is to help sisters and theirfamilies come unto Christ. In that spirit, I joinSister Smoot and Sister Jensen in declaring who weare and in rejoicing in the announced refinementsin Relief Society's focus. We no longer have theluxury of spending our energy on anything that ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 364 Coming unto Christ means . . . placing Christ and Christ only at the center of our lives so that the vanities and philosophies of men lose their addictive appeal.does not lead us and our families to Christ. That is the litmus test for Relief Society, as well as for ourlives. In the days ahead, a casual commitment toChrist will not carry us through. As a young girl I saw commitment in my grandmother, who helped Grandpa homestead ourfarm on the Kansas prairie. Somehow they outlastedthe Dust Bowl, the Depression, and the tornadoesthat terrorize the Great Plains. I've often wonderedhow Grandma put up with years of meager incomeand hard work and how she went on when heroldest son died in a tragic accident. Grandma's lifewasn't easy. But do you know what I remember mostabout her? Her total joy in the gospel. She was neverhappier than when she was working on familyhistory or teaching with her scripturesin hand. Grandma hadlaid aside the things of this world to seek for thethings of a better. To the world, my grandma was ordinary. But to me, she represents theunsung heroines of this century who lived up to their premortal promisesand left a foundation of faith uponwhich we may build. Grandma wasn'tperfect, but she was a woman of God.Now it is for you and for me to carryforward the banner into the nextcentury. We are not women of the world. We are women of God. And women of God will be among the greatest heroines of the 21st century. AsPresident Joseph F. Smith proclaimed, it is not for us\"to be led by the women of the world; it is for [us] to lead . . . the women of the world, in everythingthat is praise-worthy\" ( Teachings, 184). This is not to diminish the lives of countless goodwomen throughout the world. But we are unique. We are unique because of our covenants, our spiritualprivileges, and the responsibilities attached to both.We are endowed with power and gifted with theHoly Ghost. We have a living prophet to guide us, ordinances that bind us to the Lord and to eachother, and the power of the priesthood in our midst.We understand where we stand in the great plan ofhappiness. And we know that God is our Father andthat His Son is our unfailing Advocate. With these privileges comes great responsibility, for \"unto whom much is given much is required\"(D&C 82:3), and at times the demands of discipleshipare heavy. But shouldn't we expect the journeytowards eternal glory to stretch us? We sometimesrationalize our preoccupation with this world andour casual attempts to grow spiritually by trying toconsole each other with the notion that living thegospel really shouldn't require all that much of us.The Lord's standard of behavior will always be moredemanding than the world's, but then the Lord'srewards are infinitely more glorious\u2014including truejoy, peace, and salvation. How then do we, as women of God, fill the full measure of our creation? The Lord rewards \"themthat diligently seek him\" (Heb. 11:6). We seek Himnot only by studying and searching, by pleadingand praying and watching always lest we enter intotemptation, but by giving up worldly indulgences that straddle the line between Godand mammon. Otherwise we riskbeing called but not chosen becauseour \"hearts are set so much upon thethings of this world\" (D&C 121:35). Consider the principle taught in the sequence of this scriptural injunction:\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy Godwith all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and str ength\" (D&C 59:5; emphasis added). What the Lordrequires first is our hearts. Imaginehow our choices would be affected if we loved the Savior above all else. How we would spend our time and money, or dresson a hot summer day, or respond to the call to visit teach and take care of one another, or r eact to media that offend the Spirit. It is by letting the world go and coming unto Christ that we increasingly live as women of God. We wereborn for eternal glory. Just as faithful men wereforeordained to hold the priesthood, we wereforeordained to be women of God. We arewomen of faith, virtue, vision, and charity who rejoice inmotherhood and in womanhood and in the family.We are not panicked about perfection, but we are working to become more pure. And we know thatin the strength of the Lord we can do all righteousthings because we have immersed ourselves in Hisgospel (see Alma 26:12). I repeat, we cannot be womenof the world, for we are latter-day women of God. As President Kimball taught, \"No greater recognitioncan come to [us] in this world than to be known as[women] of God\" (\"The Role of Righteous Women,\"Ensign, Nov. 1979, 102). ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 365 The Lord's standard of behavior will always be more demanding than the world's, but then the Lord's rewards are infinitely more glorious.This summer I had an unforgettable experience in the Holy Land. As I sat on the Mount of Beatitudesoverlooking the Sea of Galilee, I saw in the distancea city built on a hill. The visual image of a city thatcannot be hid was stunning, and as I pondered thesymbolism I had an overwhelming impression thatwe as women of God are like that city, that if wewill leave behind the things of the world and comeunto Christ so that the Spirit radiates through ourlives and from our eyes, our uniqueness will be alight unto the world. As sisters of Relief Society, webelong to the most significant community of womenon this side of the veil. We are a spectacular city on a hill. And the less we look and act like the womenof the world, the more they will look to us as a wellspring of hope, peace, virtue, and joy. Twenty years ago at this very meeting President Kimball made a statement we have quoted eversince: \"Much of the major growth that is coming tothe Church in the last days . . . will happen to thedegree that the women of the Church reflect right-eousness and articulateness in their lives and to thedegree that [they] are seen as distinct and different\u2014 in happy ways\u2014from the women of the world\"(Ensign, Nov. 1979, 103-4; emphasis added). We can no longer be content to just quote President Kimball.We are the sisters who must and will make hisprophecy a reality. But we can do it. I know we can. President Gordon B. Hinckley said recently that \"the eternal salvation of the world . . . rests upon theshoulders of this Church. . . . No other people inthe history Is Really Doing Well,'\" Church News, 3 July 1999, 3). Women of God, that includes us. Tonight I invite each of us to identify at least one thing we can do to comeout of the world and come closer to Christ. And thennext month, another. And then another. Sisters, thisis a call to arms, it's a call to action, a call to arise. A call to arm ourselves with power and withrighteousness. A call to rely on the arm of the Lordrather than the arm of flesh. A call to \"arise and shineforth, that [our] light may be a standard for thenations\" (D&C 115:5). A call to live as women of God so that we and our families may return safely home. We have such cause to rejoice, for the gospel of Jesus Christ isthe voice of gladness! It is because the Savior overcame the world that we may overcome. It isbecause He rose on the third day that we may arise aswomen of God. May we lay aside the things of thisworld and seek for the things of a better. May wecommit this very hour to come out of the world andto never look back. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. \"ONE THING NEEDFUL\": BECOMING WOMEN OF GREATER FAITH IN CHRIST Sister Patricia T. Holland Former First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency Ensign, Oct. 1987, 26-33 Just after my release from the Young Women generalpresidency in April 1986, I had the opportunity tospend a week in Israel. It had been a very difficultand demanding two years for me. Being a goodmother with ample time to succeed at that task hasalways been my first priority, so I had tried to be afull-time mother to a grade-schooler, a high-schooler,and a son preparing for his mission. I had also triedto be a full-time wife to a staggeringly busy universitypresident. And I had to be as much of a full-timecounselor in that general presidency as one livingfifty miles from the office could be. But in animportant period of forming principles and startingprograms, I worried that I wasn't doing enough\u2014and I tried to run a little faster. Toward the end of my two-year term, my health was going downhill. I was losing weight steadily,and I wasn't sleeping well. My husband and childrenwere trying to bandage me together even as I wastrying to do the same for them. We were exhausted.And yet, I kept wondering what I might have done to manage it all better. The Brethren, alwayscompassionate, were watching, and extended aloving release. As grateful as my family was for theconclusion of my term of service, I nevertheless felta loss of association\u2014and, I confess, some loss ofidentity\u2014with those women that I had come tolove so much. Who was I, and where was I in thiswelter of demands? Should life be as hard as allthis? How successful had I been in my several andcompeting assignments? Or had I muffed them all?The days after my release were about as difficult asthe weeks before it. I didn't have any reserve to call ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 366on. My tank was on empty, and I wasn't sure there was a filling station anywhere in sight. It was just a few weeks later that my husband had the assignment in Jerusalem to which I have referred,and the Brethren traveling on the assignmentrequested that I accompany him. \"Come on,\" hesaid. \"You can recuperate in the Savior's land of livingwater and bread of life.\" As weary as I was, I packedmy bags, believing\u2014or, at the very least, hoping\u2014that the time there would be a healing respite. On a pristinely clear and beautifully bright day, I sat overlooking the Sea of Galilee and reread the tenthchapter of Luke. But instead of the words on thepage, I thought I saw with my mind and heard withmy heart these words: \"[Pat, Pat, Pat], thou art carefuland troubled about many things.\" Then the powerof pure and personal revelation seized me as I read,\"But one thing [only one thing] is [truly] needful.\"(Vs. 40-41.) The May sun in Israel is so bright you feel as if you are sitting on top of the world. I had just visited thespot in Bethoron where the sun stood still for Joshua(see Josh. 10:12), and indeed, on that day, it seemedso for me as well. As I sat pondering my problems I felt that same sun's healing rays like warm liquidpouring into my heart\u2014relaxing, calming, andcomforting my troubled soul. Our loving Father in Heaven seemed to be whispering to me, \"You don't have to worry over so many things.The one thing that is needful\u2014the only thing that is truly needful\u2014is to keep your eyes toward thesun\u2014my Son.\" Suddenly I had true peace. I knewthat my life had always been in his hands\u2014fromthe very beginning! The sea lying peacefully beforemy eyes had been tempest-tossed and dangerous\u2014many, many times. All I needed to do was to renewmy faith, and get a firm grasp on his hand\u2014andtogether we could walk on the water. I would like to pose a question for each of us toponder. How do we as women make that quantumleap from being troubled and worried to beingwomen of even greater faith? One frame of mindsurely seems to negate the other. Faith and fearcannot long coexist. Consider some of the thingsthat trouble us. I have served as a Relief Society president in four different wards. Two of these wards were for singlewomen, and two were wards with many youngmothers. As I sat in counsel with my single sisters,my heart often ached as they described to me theirfeelings of loneliness and disappointment. They feltthat their lives had no meaning or purpose in achurch that rightly puts so much emphasis onmarriage and family life. Most painful of all was theoccasional suggestion that their singleness was theirown fault\u2014or worse yet, a selfish desire. They wereanxiously seeking for peace and purpose\u2014somethingof real value to which they could dedicate their lives. Yet it seemed to me that the young mothers had easily as many concerns. They described to me thestruggles of trying to raise children in an increasinglydifficult world, of never having enough time ormeans or freedom to feel like a person of valuebecause they were always stretched to the ragged edgeof survival. And there were so few tangible evidencesthat what they were doing was really going to besuccessful. There was no one to give them a raise inpay; and beyond their husbands (who may or maynot remember to do it), no one to compliment themon a job well done. And they were always tired! Theone thing I remember so vividly with these youngmothers was that they were always so tired. Then there were those women who, through no faultof their own, found themselves the sole provider fortheir homes financially, spiritually, emotionally, andin every other way. I could not even comprehendthe challenges they faced. Obviously, in some ways,theirs was the most demanding circumstance of all.The perspective I have gained over these many yearsof listening to the worries of women is that no onewoman or group of women\u2014single, married,divorced, widowed, homemakers, or professionals\u2014have cornered the market on concerns. There seemto be plenty of challenges to go around. But, Ihasten to add, there are marvelous blessings as well. Every one of us has privileges and blessings, and every one of us has fears and trials. It seems bold tosay, but common sense suggests that never beforein the history of the world have women, includingLDS women, been faced with greater complexity intheir concerns. I am very appreciative of the added awareness that the women's movement has given to a gospelprinciple we have had since Mother Eve andbefore\u2014that of agency, the right to choose. But one of the most unfortunate side effects we have faced in this matter of agency is that, becauseof the increasing diversity of life-styles for women ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 367of today, we seem even more uncertain and less secure with each other. We are not getting closer,but further away from that sense of community andsisterhood that has sustained us and given us strengthfor generations. There seems to be an increase inour competitiveness and a decrease in our generositywith one another. Those who have the time and energy to can their fruit and vegetables develop a skill that will servethem well in time of need\u2014and in our uncertaineconomy, that could be almost any time. But theyshouldn't look down their noses at those who buytheir peaches or who don't like zucchini in any ofthe thirty-five ways there are to disguise it, or whohave simply made a conscious choice to use theirtime and energy in some other purposeful way. And where am I in all of this? For three-fourths of my life I felt threatened to the core because I hatedto sew. Now, I cansew; if it is absolutely necessary, I willsew\u2014but I hate it. Can you imagine my burden over the last twenty-five or thirty years, \"faking it\"in Relief Society sessions and trying to smile whensix little girls walk into church all pinafored andlaced and ribboned and petticoated\u2014in identical,hand-sewn dresses, all trooping ahead of theirmother, who has a similar outfit? I don't necessarilyconsider my attitude virtuous, lovely, of good reportor praiseworthy, but I'm honest in my antipathytoward sewing. I have grown up a little since those days in at least two ways: I now genuinely admire a mother who cando that for her children, and I have ceased feelingguilty that sewing is not particularly rewarding tome. The point is, we simply cannot call ourselvesChristian and continue to judge one another\u2014orourselves\u2014so harshly. No mason jar of bing cherriesis worth a confrontation that robs us of ourcompassion and our sisterhood. Obviously the Lord has created us with different personalities, as well as differing degrees of energy,interest, health, talent, and opportunity. So long aswe are committed to righteousness and living a lifeof faithful devotion, we should celebrate these divinedifferences, knowing they are a gift from God. We must not feel so frightened, so threatened andinsecure; we must not need to find exact replicas of ourselves in order to feel validated as women ofworth. There are many things over which we can bedivided, but one thing is needful for our unity\u2014the empathy and compassion of the living Son of God.I was married in 1963, the very year Betty Friedanpublished her society-shaking book, The Feminine Mystique, so as an adult woman I can only look back with childhood memories of the gentler 1940s and50s. But it must have been much more comfortableto have a life-style already prepared for you, andneighbors on either side whose lives gave you rolemodels for your own. However, it must have beeneven that much more painful for those who, throughno fault of their own, were single then, or had towork, or struggled with a broken family. Now, inour increasingly complex world, that earlier modelis fragmented, and we seem to be even less sure ofwho we are and where we are going. Surely there has not been another time in history when women have questioned their self-worth asharshly and critically as in the second half of thetwentieth century. Many women are searching,almost frantically, as never before, for a sense ofpersonal purpose and meaning; and many LDSwomen are searching, too, for eternal insight andmeaning in their femaleness. If I were Satan and wanted to destroy a society, I think I would stage a full-blown blitz on women. I would keep them so distraught and distracted thatthey would never find the calming strength andserenity for which their sex has always been known. Satan has effectively done that, catching us in the crunch of trying to be superhuman instead of strivingto reach our unique, God-given potential withinsuch diversity. He tauntingly teases us that if wedon't have it all\u2014fame, fortune, families, and fun,and have it all the time\u2014we have been short-changedand are second-class citizens in the race of life. As a sex we are struggling, our families are struggling,and our society is struggling. Drugs, teenagepregnancies, divorce, family violence, and suicideare some of the ever-increasing side effects of ourcollective life in the express lane. Too many of us are struggling and suffering, too many are running faster than they have strength,expecting toomuch of themselves. As a result, we are experiencing new and undiagnosed stress-relatedillnesses. The Epstein-Barr virus, for one, has comeinto our medical jargon as the malady ofthe 1980s. \"[The victims] are plagued by low-gradefevers, aching joints, and sometimes a sore throat\u2014but they don't have the flu. They're overwhelminglyexhausted, weak, and debilitated\u2014but they don'thave AIDS. They're often confused and forgetful\u2014 ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 368but it isn't Alzheimer's. Many patients feel suicidal, but it isn't clinical depression. . . . Female victimsoutnumber males about 3 to 1, and a great manyare intelligent high achievers with stressful lives.\"(Newsweek, Oct. 27, 1986, p. 105.) We must have the courage to be imperfect while striving for perfection. We must not allow our own guilt, the feminist books, the talk-show hosts, or thewhole media culture to sell us a bill of goods\u2014orrather a bill of no goods. We can become so sidetracked in our compulsive search for identityand self-esteem that we really believe it canbe found in having perfect figures or academic degreesor professional status or even absolute motherlysuccess. Yet, in so searching externally, we can betorn from our true internal, eternal selves. We oftenworry so much about pleasing and performing forothers that we lose our uniqueness\u2014that full andrelaxed acceptance of one's self as a person of worthand individuality. We become so frightened andinsecure that we cannot be generous toward thediversity and individuality, and yes, problems, ofour neighbors. Too many women with these anxietieswatch helplessly as their lives unravel from the verycore that centers and sustains them. Too many arelike a ship at sea without sail or rudder, \"tossed toand fro,\" as the Apostle Paul said (see Eph. 4:14),until more and more of us are genuinely, rail-grabbingly seasick. Where is the sureness that allows us to sail our ship, whatever winds may blow, with the master seaman'striumphant cry, \"Steady as she goes\"? Where is theinner stillness we so cherish and for which our sextraditionally has been known? I believe we can find our steady footing and stilling of the soul by turning away from physicalpreoccupations, superwoman accomplishments, andendless popularity contests, and returning insteadto the wholeness of our soul, that unity in our verybeing that balances the demanding and inevitablediversity of life. One woman, not of our faith, whose writings I love, is Anne Morrow Lindbergh. She comments on thefemale despair and general torment of our times: \"The Feminists did not look . . . far [enough] ahead; they laid down no rules of conduct. For them it wasenough to demand the privileges. . . . And [so]woman today is still searching. We are aware of ourhunger and needs, but still ignorant of what willsatisfy them. With our garnered free time, we aremore apt to drain our creative springs than to refillthem. With our pitchers [in hand] we attempt . . .to water a field, [instead of] a garden. We throwourselves indiscriminately into the committees andcauses. Not knowing how to feed the spirit, we tryto muffle its demands in distractions. Instead ofstilling the center, the axis of the wheel, we addmore centrifugal activities to our lives\u2014which tendto throw us [yet more] off balance. \"Mechanically we have gained, in the last generation, but spiritually we have . . . lost.\" Regardless of the time period, she adds, \"[for women] the problem is [still] how to feed the soul.\" (Gift fromthe Sea, New York: Pantheon Books, 1975, pp. 51-52.) I have pondered long and hard about the feeding ofour inner self amidst too many troublesome things.It is no coincidence that we speak of feeding thespirit, just as we would speak of feeding the body.We need constant nourishment for both. The rootword hale(as in \"hale and hearty\") is the common root to words like whole, health, heal, and holy. President Benson recently said, \"There is no questionthat the health of the body affects the spirit, or theLord would never have revealed the Word of Wisdom.God has never given any temporal commandments\u2014 and that which affects our stature affects our soul.\"We need so much for body, mind, and spirit to unitein one healthy, stable soul. Surely God is well balanced, so perhaps we are just that much closer to Him when we are. In any case, I like the link between hale, whole, health, heal, and holy. Our unity of soul within diversity of circumstance\u2014our \"stilling of the center\"\u2014is worthany effort. Often we fail to consider the glorious possibility within our own souls. We need to remember thatdivine promise, \"The Kingdom of God is within you.\"(Luke 17:21.) Perhaps we forget that the kingdom of God is within us because too much attention isgiven to this outer shell, this human body of ours,and the frail, too-flimsy world in which it moves. Permit me to share with you an analogy that I created from something I read years ago. It helpedme then\u2014and helps me still\u2014in my examination ofinner strength and spiritual growth. The analogy is of a soul\u2014a human soul, with all of its splendor\u2014being placed in a beautifully carvedbut very tightly locked box. Reigning in majesty ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 369and illuminating our soul in this innermost box is our Lord and our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the livingSon of the living God. This box is then placed\u2014andlocked\u2014inside another, larger one, and so on untilfive beautifully carved but very securely lockedboxes await the woman who is skillful and wiseenough to open them. In order for her to have freecommunication with the Lord, she must find the keyto and unlock the contents of these boxes. Success willthen reveal to her the beauty and divinity of her ownsoul and her gifts and her grace as a daughter of God. For me, prayer is the key to the first box. We kneel to ask help for our tasks and then arise to find that the first lock is now open. But this ought not toseem just a convenient and contrived miracle, for ifwe are to search for real light and eternal certainties,we have to pray as the ancients prayed. We arewomen now, not children, and we are expected topray with maturity. The words most often used todescribe urgent, prayerful labor are wrestle, plead, cry,and hunger. In some sense, prayer may be the hardest work we ever will engage in, and perhaps itshould be. It is pivotal protection against becomingso involved with worldly possessions and honorsand status that we no longer desire to undertake thesearch for our soul. For those who, like Enos, pray in faith and gain entrance to a new dimension of their potentialdivinity, they are led to box number two. Here ourprayers alone do not seem to be sufficient. We mustturn to the scriptures for God's long-recorded teachings about our souls. Wemust learn. Surely every woman in thischurch is under divine obligation tolearn and grow and develop. We areGod's diverse array of unburnishedtalents, and we must not bury thesegifts or hide our light. If the glory ofGod is intelligence, then learning,especially learning from the scriptures,stretches us toward him. He uses many metaphors for divine influence, such as \"living water\" and \"the bread of life.\" I havediscovered that if my own progress stalls, it stallsfrom malnutrition born of not eating and drinkingdaily from his holy writ. There have been challengesin my life that would have completely destroyedme had I not had the scriptures both on my bedstandand in my purse so that I could partake of them dayand night at a moment's notice. Meeting God inscripture has been like a divine intravenous feedingfor me\u2014a celestial IV that my son once described as an angelical cord. So box two is opened through learning from the scriptures. I have discovered that by studying them I can have, again and again, anexhilarating encounter with God. However, at the beginning of such success in emancipating the soul, Lucifer becomes more anxious,especially as we approach box number three. Heknows that we are about to learn one very importantand fundamental principle\u2014that to truly findourselves we must lose ourselves\u2014so he begins toblock our increased efforts to love God, our neighbor,and ourselves. Through the last decade, Satan hasenticed all humanity to engage almost all of theirenergies in the pursuit of romantic love or thing-loveor excessive self-love. In so doing, we forget thatappropriate self-love and self-esteem are the promisedreward for putting others first. \"Whosoever shallseek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoevershall lose his life shall preserve it.\" (Luke 17:33.)Box three opens only to the key of charity. With charity, real growth and genuine insight begin. But the lid to box four seems nearly impossible topenetrate. Unfortunately, the faint-hearted and fearfuloften turn back here. The going seems too difficult,the lock too secure. This is a time for self-evaluation.To see ourselves as we really are often brings pain,but it is only through true humility, repentance,and renewal that we will come to know God. \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly inheart,\" he said. (Matt. 11:29.) We mustbe patient with ourselves as weovercome weaknesses, and we mustremember to r ejoice over all that is good in us. This will strengthen ourinner selves and leave us lessdependent on outward acclaim. Whenour souls pay less attention to publicpraise, they then also care very littleabout public disapproval. Competition and jealousy and envy now begin to have nomeaning. Just imagine the powerful spirit thatwould exist in our female society if we finallyarrived at the point where, like our Savior, our realdesire was to be counted as the least among our sisters. The rewards here are of such profound strength and quiet triumph of faith that we arecarried into an even brighter sphere. So the fourthbox, unlike the others, is broken open, just as a ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 370 We must be patient with ourselves as we overcome weaknesses, and we must remember to rejoice over all that is good in us.contrite heart is broken. We are reborn\u2014like a flower growing and blooming out of the broken crust of the earth. To share with you my feelings of opening the fifth box, I must compare the beauty of our souls withthe holiness of our temples. There, in a setting notof this world, where fashions and position andprofessions go unrecognized, we have our chance tofind peace and serenity and stillness that will anchorour soul forever, for there we may find God. Forthose of us who, like the brother of Jared, have thecourage and faith to break through the veil intothat sacred center of existence (see Ether 3:6-19), wewill find the brightness of the final box brighter thanthe noonday sun. There we find wholeness\u2014holiness.That is what it says over the entrance to the fifthbox: Holiness to the Lord. \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?\" (1 Cor. 3:16.) I testify that youare holy\u2014that divinity is abiding within you waitingto be uncovered\u2014to be unleashed and magnifiedand demonstrated. I have heard it said by some that the reason women in the Church struggle to know themselves is becausethey don't have a divine female role model. But wedo. We believe we have a mother in heaven. May Iquote from President Spencer W. Kimball in a generalconference address: we . . . 'O My Father,' we get a sense of the ultimate in maternalmodesty, of the restrained, queenly elegance of ourHeavenly Mother, and knowing how profoundlyour mortal mothers have shaped us here, do wesuppose her influence on us as individuals to beless?\" (Ensign, May 1978, p. 6.) I have never questioned why our mother in heavenseems veiled to us, for I believe the Lord has hisreasons for revealing as little as he has on that subject.Furthermore, I believe we know much more aboutour eternal nature than we think we do; and it isour sacred obligation to express our knowledge, toteach it to our young sisters and daughters, and inso doing to strengthen their faith and help themthrough the counterfeit confusions of these difficultlatter days. Let me point out some examples. The Lord has not placed us in this lone and dreary world without a blueprint for living. In Doctrineand Covenants 52, we read the Lord's words: \"I willgive unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived.\" (V. 14; italics added.) He certainlyincludes us women in that promise. He has given uspatterns in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, theDoctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price;and he has given us patterns in the temple ceremony.As we study these patterns, we must continually ask,\"Why does the Lord choose to say these particularwords and present it in just this way?\" We know he uses metaphors and symbols and parables andallegories to teach us of his eternal ways. We haveall recognized the relationship between Abrahamand Isaac that so parallels God's anguish over thesacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. But, as women, dowe stretch ourselves and also ask about Sarah's travailin this experience as well? We need to search in thismanner, and we need always to look for deepermeaning. We should look for parallels and symbols.We should look for themes and motifs such as thosewe would find in a Bach or a Mozart composition,and we should look for repeated patterns. One obvious pattern is that both the Bible and the Book of Mormon begin with a family theme,including family conflict. I have always believedthis symbolized something eternal about family far more than just the story of those particular parentsor those particular children. Surely all of us\u2014married or single, with children and without\u2014seesomething of Adam and Eve and something of Cainand Abel every day of our lives. With or withoutmarriage, or with or without children, we all havesome of the feelings of Lehi, Sariah, Laman, Nephi,Ruth, Naomi, Esther, the sons of Helaman, and thedaughters of Ishmael. Those are types and shadows for us, prefigurations of our own mortal joys and sorrows, just as Josephand Mary are, in a sense, types and shadows ofparental devotion as they nurtured the Son of God.These all seem to me to be symbols of higherprinciples and truths, symbols carefully chosen toshow us the way, whether we are married or single,young or old, with family or without. And, obviously, the temple is highly symbolic. May I share an experience I had there a few months agoconcerning the careful choice of words and symbols?I have chosen my words carefully so that nothingwill be improperly shared outside the temple. Myquotations are taken from published scripture. Maybe it was coincidence (someone has said, \"Coincidence is a small miracle in which Godchooses to remain anonymous\"), but in any case, as I waited in the temple chapel, I sat next to an ETERNAL MARRIAGE STUDENT MANUALWOMEN 'SDIVINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 371elderly man who unexpectedly but sweetly turned to me and said, \"If you want a clear picture of theCreation, read Abraham 4.\" As I started to turn toAbraham, I just happened to brush past Moses 3:5:\"For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which Ihave spoken, spiritually, before they were naturallyupon the face of the earth.\" Another message ofprefiguration\u2014a spiritual pattern giving meaning tomortal creations. I then read Abraham 4 carefullyand took the opportunity of going to an initiatorysession. I left there with greater revelatory light onsomething I had always known in my heart to beso\u2014that men and women are joint heirs of the blessings of the priesthood, and even though menbear the greater burden of administering it, womenare not without their priesthood-relatedresponsibilities. Then, as I attended the endowment session, I asked myself if I were the Lord and could give my childrenon earth only a simplified but powerfully symbolicexample of their roles and missions, how muchwould I give and where would I start? I listened toevery word. I watched for patterns and prototypes. I quote to you from Abraham 4:27: \"So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, inthe image of the Gods to form they him, male and female, to form they them.\" (Italics added.) They formed male and they formed female\u2014in the image of the Gods, in their own image. Then, in a poignant exchange with God, Adam states that he will call thewoman Eve. And why does he call herEve? \"Because she [is] the mother of allliving.\" (Gen. 3:20; Moses 4:26.) As I tenderly acknowledge the very real pain that many single women, ormarried women who have not bornechildren, feel about any discussion of motherhood,could we consider this one possibility about oureternal female identity\u2014our unity in our diversity?Eve was given the identity of \"the mother of allliving\"\u2014years, decades, perhaps centuries beforeshe ever bore a child. It would appear that hermotherhood preceded her maternity, just as surely as the perfection of the Garden preceded the struggles ofmortality. I believe mother is one of those very carefully chosen words, one of those rich words\u2014with meaning after meaning after meaning. Wemust not, at all costs, let that word divide us. Ibelieve with all my heart that it is first and foremosta statement about our nature, not a head count ofour children. I have only three children and have wept that I could not have more. And I know that some of youwithout any have wept, too. And sometimes toomany have simply been angry over the very subjectitself. For the sake of our eternal motherhood, I pleadthat this not be so. Some women give birth and raisechildren but never \"mother\" them. Others, whom I love with all my heart, \"mother\" all their lives buthave never given birth. And all of us are Eve'sdaughters, whether we are married or single, maternalor barren. We are created in the image of the Godsto become gods and goddesses. And we can providesomething of that divine pattern, that maternalprototype, for each other and for those who comeafter us. Whatever our circumstance, we can reachout, touch, hold, lift, and nurture\u2014but we cannotdo it in isolation. We need a community of sistersstilling the soul and binding the wounds offragmentation. I know that God loves us individually and collectively as women, and that he has a mission for every one of us. As I learned on my Galilean hillside, I testify that if our desires are righteous, Godoverrules for our good and thatheavenly parents will tenderly attend to our needs. In our diversity andindividuality, my prayer is that we will be united\u2014united in seeking ourspecific, foreordained mission, unitedin asking not, \"What can the kingdom do for me?\" but \"What can I do forthe kingdom? How can I fulfill themeasure of mycreation? In my circumstances and with my challenges and my faith, where is my full realization of the godly image in which I was created?\" With faith in God, his prophets, his church, and ourselves\u2014with faith in our own divine creation\u2014may we be peaceful and let go of our cares andtroubles over so many things. May we believe\u2014nothing doubting\u2014in the light that shines, even ina dark place.
