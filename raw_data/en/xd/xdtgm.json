As HCPs have direct contact with the population, and HCPs significantly influence the population, this study aimed to compare the acceptance rate, advocacy rate, and beliefs about the COVID-19 vaccine among HCPs in two time periods. In this repeated cross-sectional study, different HCPs were assessed in two periods ten months apart, i.e., November to December 2020 and September to October 2021, which were before and after COVID-19 vaccine approval by authorities. The study was conducted in Qatif Central Hospital, Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. There were 609 respondents: 236 participants in the first period and 373 participants in the second period. Only 13 participants did not get the COVID-19 vaccine. There was around a 40% difference in the acceptance rate between the two study periods; the latter period was higher at 94.7%. Furthermore, 24.1% was the difference between the willingness to advocate the COVID-19 vaccine for others; the first period had a lower percentage (60.1%). Overall, results of the study showed that vaccine hesitancy, as well as the willingness to advocate for the vaccine, were improved between the pre-vaccine approval period and post-vaccine approval period, showing that the efforts made by the government improved COVID-19 acceptance and advocacy among HCPs. However, vaccine hesitancy is not a new issue, and for a better understanding of HCPs' beliefs, a qualitative study is needed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-02-20", "cleaned_text": "Acceptance, Advocacy, and Perception of Health Care Providers on COVID-19 Vaccine: Comparing Early Stage of COVID-19 Vaccination with Latter Stage in the Eastern Region of Saudi then, this novel virus's infection cases have rapidly and significantly increased. Eventually, it was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00488)]. The speed of disease transmission hindered rigorous research evidence regarding COVID-19 disease prognosis [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00488), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00488), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00488)]. This unexpectedly resulted in increasing COVID-19 infection disease mortality [ [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00488), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00488), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00488)]. Although several extensive efforts were made to explore treatment options, there has been no proven effective treatment, except preventive measures like vaccines [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00488), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00488), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00488)]. However, some available drugs were repurposed to be used for COVID-19, and they showed positive results in mortality. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00488), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00488)]. Vaccinations as a preventive measure are considered one of the most successful public health interventions. Hence, the developed COVID-19 vaccines represent an effective weapon in facing and defeating the pandemic [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00488), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00488)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00488)]. Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to implement a COVID-19 vaccination program. The Saudi Ministry of Health provided both Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines for both citizens and residents [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00488)]. The vaccination campaign in KSA was started on 17 December 2020 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and later the AstraZeneca vaccine in February 2021 [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00488)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00488)]. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were different among the 19 countries, ranging from almost 90% in China to around 55% in Russia [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00488)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00488)]. It is one of the major growing public health concerns, and it is an emerging public health challenge issue. It is reinforced by false information related to vaccine effectiveness and safety [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00488), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00488), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00488)]. Vaccine hesitancy was ranked in the top ten threats to global health [ [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00488)]. Understanding factors that influence vaccination helps immunization programmers to monitor, change, check, and assess strategies to improve and support vaccination acceptance. Other influential factors such as media monitoring and collaboration with partners and stakeholders can help in vaccine acceptance. In addition, community- and school-based programs are inspired approaches to reduce vaccine hesitancy, increase acceptance rates, and thus result in a good response to vaccination crises and recovery. The community should be well informed about new insights regarding demand during and after outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic [ [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00488)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00488)]. In addition, to increase the willingness for vaccination to meet the requirements of community immunity, HCPs play a vital role in building trust among the population, can see [Supplementary Materials](#app1-vaccines-11-00488). Therefore, a clear and transparent policy with accurate communication with all relevant stakeholders is deemed necessary [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00488)]. Advocacy is another effort applied to influence and impact policy- and decision-makers; to change public perceptions and beliefs; to amend behaviors; and to fight for changes within society. In the efforts to improve immunization and health, advocacy encompasses these definitions in one form or another. Advocacy for immunization includes primary healthcare providers, government officials, and researchers [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00488)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Design 2.2. Sample Size 2.3. Data Collection Tool and Validation 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00488-t001)). [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00488-t002)). [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00488-f001)). 4. Discussion [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00488)]. The result of the previous study is aligned with our study results of the first period, as the acceptance rate was only 55%, indicating some hesitancy [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00488)]. In addition, high trust in health authorities was expressed by the previous study participants, but there was also a strong mistrust of pharmaceutical companies among healthcare providers due to perceived financial interests and lack of information concerning vaccine side effects [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00488)]. Compared to our study, trust in manufacturing countries had an average of 60% in the two-period assessments. In addition, around 55% of the study participants in both periods stated that they trusted the manufacturing companies of the vaccines. Around 15% and 30% in the first and second periods, respectively, believed that the vaccine industries are driven by financial motives rather than health interests. [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00488)]. Students with Asian backgrounds tended to express more negative views about medications compared to people from European cultural backgrounds [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00488)]. Additionally, Asian cultures were significantly more likely to perceive medicines as harmful [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00488)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00488)]. [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00488)]. HCPs may have a higher concern with the rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccines, as they are aware of the drug development phases as well as the time needed to test the safety and efficacy of a new investigational product as compared to non-HCPs, who are not aware of the drug or vaccine development process. Trust in the vaccines is vital, and it is critically dependent on the ability of HCPs to first build trust among themselves and then among the community regarding vaccine effectiveness and safety. [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00488)]. This resistance can challenge the success of the vaccination campaign, even if there is only a small number of hesitant people. Although HCPs were cited as the most reliable vaccine information source, many HCPs were hesitant to receive vaccines. Studies interviewing a group of professional nurses demonstrated a greater willingness to vaccinate in specific nurses' categories [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00488)]. These categories include the youngest, the most confident in institutions, and nurses with increased responsibility and higher work stress concerning the management of patients [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00488)]. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00488)]. Additionally, senior health policymakers and leaders who received vaccines in a public display have encouraged more people to accept vaccinations [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00488)]. However, as HCPs are the direct contact between patients and scientific information, 44% and 52.9% of the participating HCPs in the first and second periods, respectively, believed that honest scientific facts about vaccines can provoke acceptance. [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00488)]. The study showed that only 34.6% of the participating HCPs were willing to receive the vaccine, and only 44% were willing to recommend the vaccine to their patients [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00488)]. However, compared to the second period in our study (which was one more month after the data collection of this study), 55.5% of the participating HCPs were willing to accept the new vaccine, and 60.1% were willing to advocate for the vaccine; both results are higher in percentage compared to the above-mentioned study. However, the sample size for that study was only 159 participants, while it was 236 participants in the first period of our study. Additionally, that study was conducted in three hospitals in Riyadh, which is in the central region of Saudi Arabia, while our study was conducted in Qatif, which is located in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Conducting a study in two different regions of Saudi Arabia can give different results due to cultural and belief differences. 5.
