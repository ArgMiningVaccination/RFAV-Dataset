Toronto Public Health, which has had copyright of the Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers since 2005, began the process of updating and revising the document (2007) in 2010 in order to ensure that the protocols reflect current evidence and practice. Whenever possible, evidence was sought from systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, controlled clinical studies, case controlled studies, current professional lactation texts, and speakers at breastfeeding educational initiatives. Priority was given to the most recent evidence and a small number of older, landmark studies that continue to be referenced in the literature. Input and comments were gathered from current users of the protocols, within both the City of Toronto and beyond. The revisions were developed by a workgroup of Public Health Nurses working within Toronto Public Health. Some of these Public Health Nurses were also Lactation Consultants whose work focused on the development and provision of breastfeeding support programs and services to breastfeeding mothers and families. The revision of the protocols was guided by the Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI), a global campaign of the W orld Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, whose goal is to increase breastfeeding initiation and duration rates by protecting, promoting, and supporting breastfeeding. One of the requirements for BFI designation is to train all health care providers involved in the care of mothers and babies in the skills necessary to implement the (breastfeeding) policy. The Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers can be viewed as a foundational document for the training of health care providers who provide breastfeeding support services to the community . PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 3Informed decision-making about infant feeding is a key guiding principle of BFI. Therefore, the revised protocols include a newly developed section entitled Informed Decision-Making about Infant Feeding . This section provides guidance on the development of policies and procedures that support informed decision- making. Additionally, a new Prenatal section has been added, which includes information that further supports informed decision-making, along with important points about prenatal assessments by health care providers and the support of a mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy. Also, information related to the challenges of breastfeeding late preterm infants is included throughout the protocols. The reader will also notice an additional protocol that addresses Breastfeeding the Older Child . These protocols were developed for use by health care professionals when working with clients experiencing breastfeeding challenges. As such, each protocol is written as a stand-alone document. Therefore, the reader will notice that there is significant repetition between protocols and even between sections within one protocol. A number of individuals contributed to the revisions of the Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers. They include: Martha Hackney, RN, BA, BScN, IBCLC, Public Health Nurse, Toronto Public Health, was the lead PHN assigned with the revision work. Her commitment to the provision of high-quality breastfeeding support services has been appreciated. Susan Gallagher, RN, BScN, Public Health Nurse, Toronto Public Health, took on the challenging work of keeping the workgroup organized and once again oversaw the task of making sure all edits were incorporated into the protocols. Kathy J. Jacyniak, RN, BScN, IBCLC, Public Health Nurse, Toronto Public Health, contributed her professional expertise to the development of the revisions, and her attention to detail moved us forward. Kathleen Hume, RN, BScN, Public Health Nurse, Toronto Public Health, provided her front-line experience and expertise to guide us through the revisions. Kimberley Ogutu, RN, IBCLC, Public Health Nurse, Toronto Public Health, contributed her knowledge and expertise to the development of the revisions. Bev Gibson, Communications facilitated the production of the document.Denise Oliver, RN, BScN, MA.Ed, Associate Director, Maternal Infant Health, Toronto Public Health, gave support to the workgroup as the work progressed and has been a valued supporter of the journey towards BFI designation. It is our continuing hope that the Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers, 2013 will guide and enrich the practice of those who support families who have made an informed decision to breastfeed their infants and toddlers.

Support pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to: Make an informed decision about how each mother will feed her infant. An optimal time to explore herinfant feeding decision is during the prenatal period(see Prenatal section). Seek information that is needed in order to make aninformed decision about infant feeding, including: Importance of exclusive breastfeeding for 6months and continued breastfeeding for up to 2years and beyond; Benefits of breastfeeding for baby, mother,family and community; Health consequences for baby and mother ofnot breastfeeding; Risks and costs of feeding artificial baby milk(ABM); Contraception compatible with breastfeeding,including management, including: -position and latching -hand expression of breast milk - expected normal feeding behaviours(frequency of feeds, output) -benefits of skin-to-skin contact, especiallyfor the premature infant -infant feeding cues -no separation of mother and infant, including24-hour rooming-in (Protocol #1: Effective Br eastfeeding; and Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk); Integrated Ten Steps & World HealthOrganization (WHO) Code Practice OutcomeIndicators for Hospitals and Community HealthServices: Summary (BCC, 2011b); (Appendix C) Importance of hospitals and community healthservices having policies and practices that are Baby-Friendly; Importance of breastfeeding support programs; The right of women to be accommodated in theworkplace during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2011) ; Medical indications for supplementation orcessation of breastfeeding; Supplementing with mother's own breast milkor human donor milk (where available) whenpossible; Use of pacifiers and artificial nipples; and Difficulty of reversing the decision oncebreastfeeding is stopped. Seek further support if infant feeding decisions are based on inaccurate or incomplete information inorder to: Clarify inaccurate or incomplete information; Reinforce messages related to informeddecision-making. Seek further support if the mother lacks confidencein her ability to breastfeed or has a prior history ofbreastfeeding difficulties: Reinforce key messages about the initiation ofbreastfeeding to promote breastfeeding success; Provide specific information related to any pastbreastfeeding difficulties; Provide information about communitybreastfeeding supports. General Principles One of the guiding principles of BFI is informed decision-making. All mothers and their families have the right to make a fully informed decision about how to feed and care for their babies ( BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011b ).PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 5Health care providers have the responsibility to provide mothers and their families with accurate and unbiased information required to make a fully informed decision about infant feeding. Sufficient opportunities to discuss the benefits and risks of various infant feeding options are important in empowering mothers and their families to engage in informed decision-making. With knowledge, skills and support, the level of satisfaction with their decision, as well as their ability to provide safe and informed care for their child, will be optimized ( Ontario Public Health Association, 2007 ). Unnecessary supplementation with ABM may also be avoided, with its potential impact on the initiation and duration rates of breastfeeding. A mother brings her own thoughts and expectations to her decision about infant feeding, based on her knowledge and past experience, as well as family and cultural norms. It is important for health care providers to explore these with the mother and support her in understanding how these may impact her breastfeeding experience and success, and to offer accurate information and clarification so that she can make a fully informed decision. Information required to make an informed decision about infant feeding includes ( BCC, 2011b ): Benefits of breastfeeding and health consequencesof not breastfeeding: decreased risk of InfantDeath Syndrome (SIDS), otitis media,gastroenteritis, childhood Type 1 Diabetes,childhood leukemia, obesity in adolescence andadulthood, as well as a reduced risk of lowerrespiratory infections in exclusively breastfedfull-term infants ( TPH, 2010b ); Maternal: decreased risk of Type 2 Diabetes inwomen with no history of gestational diabetes,decreased risk of breast cancer and ovariancancer ( TPH, 2010 ). Feeding ABM and associated risks and costs: Increased expenses and equipment forpreparation and storage; A reduction in the supply of breast milk, adecreased confidence in a mother's ability toexclusively breastfeed and a decrease in theduration of breastfeeding; Potential contamination of ABM with bacteriafrom the manufacturing process, unsafehandling, storage or preparation ( WHO, 2007 ); Illness due to improper dilution of ABM ( WHO, 2007);An increased risk of various infections (e.g.,ear, gastrointestinal, respiratory, diarrhea),chronic diseases and certain cancers amonginfants and children who are fed ABM ( Guise et al., 2005; Ip et al., 2007 ); An increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes andcertain cancers ( Ip et al., 2007 ), as well as an increased risk of osteoporosis and a slowerreturn to pre-pregnancy weight among womenwho fed their infants ABM ( American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005 ). Contraception compatible with breastfeeding,including the LAM ( TPH, 2007 ).

Use of pacifiers and artificial nipples. Difficulty of reversing the decision oncebreastfeeding is stopped. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 6Once an informed decision has been reached, mothers and their families need to be supported in their infant feeding decision and receive appropriateinformation and guidance to promote the health and well-being of the infant. Information is discussed with individual clients who have made a decision to feed their infantABM; this includes: Safe and hygienic preparation, storage andfeeding of ABM; Health hazards of inappropriate preparation,storage and use of ABM; Cue-based feeding with a bottle and theimportance of holding the baby to promotedevelopment and attachment. Information on ABM will not be discussed in a group situation. It is important to offer the mother individual support to explore her infant feeding decision, her knowledge of the safe use of ABM, pacifiers and artificial nipples, and her understanding of the difficulty of reversing the decision not to breastfeed.Learning to make a fully informed decision is an important life skill that will support the motherthroughout her parenting experience. Throughouther child's lifetime, she will have many more opportunities to make informed decisions asshe parents her child, such as those related toimmunization, car seats, sunscreen, day care, schools, camps, discipline, etc.; Supporting a mother in exploring her culturalbeliefs and practices in the context of accuratebreastfeeding information will help her to identifyhow these might support or potentially interferewith breastfeeding success, and enhance her abilityto make an informed decision about feeding herbaby .

Develop an evidence-based plan to initiatebreastfeeding. Initiation of breastfeeding immediately after birth. Place the infant skin-to-skin on the mother'schest, uninterrupted, for at least an hour or untilcompletion of the first feeding, or for as long as the mother wishes. The infant might only lick and smell the breast and may not necessarily actively suck in the early stages of breastfeeding. Most procedures can and should be delayed until after the first feeding is completed ( BFI Step 4, BCC, 2011 ); Early feeding cues and cue-based feeding(Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding); Baby-led latching ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching).

If the mother is experiencing perceived or actualbarriers to breastfeeding: Offer support to explore the perceived or actualbarriers to breastfeeding;Suggest consultation with a primary health careprovider and/or lactation consultant about thepotential impact on breastfeeding. General Principles In order to improve breastfeeding outcomes for mothers and infants, it is important to discuss infant feeding in the prenatal period. Early pregnancy is an ideal time for pregnant women and their partners to explore their attitudes towards breastfeeding. Expectant parents need to verbalize and address the feelings involved in the decision to breastfeed. Myths and false information need to be explored and clarified ( RNAO, 2003 ); During pregnancy, women need to be encouragedto share their goals and perceived barriers aboutbreastfeeding. Providing information, reassuranceand assistance to resolve perceived difficulties willhelp build confidence ( RNAO, 2003 ). Health care providers should explore with thepregnant woman her decision about infant feeding. The health care provider will providecomprehensive information to support thedevelopment of a plan for the initiation ofbreastfeeding. \u00b0 Benefits of breastfeeding and health consequences of not breastfeeding include: -Infant: decreased risk of Sudden InfantDeath Syndrome (SIDS), media,gastroenteritis, childhood Type 1 Diabetes,childhood leukemia, obesity in adolescenceand adulthood, as well as a reduced riskof lower respiratory tract infections inexclusively breastfed full-term infants ( TPH, 2010) -Maternal: decreased risk of Type 2 Diabetesin women with no history of gestationaldiabetes, decreased risk of breast cancerand ovarian cancer ( TPH, 2010 ) \u00b0 Feeding ABM and associated risks and costs include: -Increased expense and equipment forpreparation and storage; -A reduction in the supply of breast milk,decreased confidence in a mother's abilityto exclusively breastfeed and a decrease inthe duration of breastfeeding;Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 9- Potential contamination of ABM with bacteria from the manufacturing process,and unsafe handling, storage or preparation( WHO, 2007 ); -Illness due to improper dilution of ABM (WHO, 2007); - An increased risk of various infections (e.g.,ear , gastrointestinal, respiratory, diarrhea), chronic diseases and certain cancers amonginfants and children who are fed ABM( Guise et al., 2005; Ip et al., 2007 ); - An increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes andcertain cancers (Ip et al., 2007), as well as an increased risk of osteoporosis and aslower return to pre-pregnancy weightamong women who fed their infants ABM( American Academy of Pediatrics, 2005 ). The prenatal period is an important time for a mother to learn about contraception compatible with breastfeeding, including the LAM, and its relationship to supplementation and exclusive breastfeeding. The health care provider can support the mother in understanding that possible supplementation in hospital can interfere with the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding, and potentially put the mother at risk of an unplanned pregnancy. Prenatal assessment by a health care provider should include: Inquiry about breast changes and breast anatomy. Inquiry about plans for infant feeding, i.e., \"Have you thought about how you want to feed your baby?\" Inquiry about confidence related to breastfeedingability, support for breastfeeding from significantothers and awareness of community breastfeedingsupports. Assessment of any perceived or actual barriers tobreastfeeding, including: Past history of breastfeeding difficulties Flat or inverted nipples Unusual breast lump Previous surgery or trauma to the breast Thyroid, pituitary or endocrine issues, includingfertility issues Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivestatusMedication(s) contraindicated duringbreastfeeding Disclosure of partner abuse or past history ofphysical or sexual abuse. Provide information about normal breast changes and breast anatomy during pregnancy: Breasts enlarge and may be tender. Areola and nipples darken in pigmentation. Blood vessels of the breast enlarge, and may shine blue through a seemingly transparent, moretranslucent than usual chest wall ( Jarvis, 2004 ). Montgomery's tubercles, located within the areola, contain openings of lactiferous and sebaceous glandsthat enlarge during pregnancy and lactation in order to lubricate and protect the areola and nipple ( Lawrence, 2011; Jarvis, 2004 ). The secretions also provide olfactory stimuli for infants, playing a key role in establishing behavioural and physiological processes related to breast milk transfer and production ( Doucet et al., 2009 ). The hormones estrogen and progesterone areresponsible for the increased size and sensitivityof the breasts or mammary glands during pregnancy(see How the Breast Works). Breastfeeding self-efficacy is the confidencethat a mother has in her ability to breastfeed herinfant ( Dennis, 1999 ). The mother must believe that she is capable of implementing any techniqueor strategies that might be suggested ( Bowles, 2011). Prenatal breastfeeding education increases breastfeeding self-efficacy ( Noel-Weiss et al., 2006 ). Health care providers can enhance a mother'sbreastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivebreastfeeding by helping her to: Identify barriers and offer strategies toovercome them. Identify and maximize strengths and sources ofsupport. Envision success and persevere throughdifficulties ( Bowles, 2011 ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 10References American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP].

Structure of the Breast Alveoli These are clusters of glandular tissue in the breast where breast milk is produced and stored until it is released in response to the infant's sucking. The alveoli are secretory acini cells surrounded by a contractile unit of myoepithelial cells ( Riordan, 2010 ). Gaps between the alveolar cells close 2-3 days after birth, reducing permeability. These alveolar cells contract to eject the breast milk into the ducts during the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex. There is mammary glandular tissue throughout the breast extending into the axilla; much of the glandular tissue is located within a 30 mm radius of the base of the nipple ( Ramsay et al., 2005 ). Ducts There are tubular structures where breast milk flows from the alveoli. Ducts and ductules begin branching under the areola and intertwine throughout the breast, surrounded by adipose and glandular tissue, and reaching to the alveoli ( Ramsay et al., 2005 ). Breast milk is ejected into the upper ducts when letdown occurs. There are usually about 9 ducts, ranging from 4 to 14, opening at the surface of the nipple ( Ramsay et al., 2005 ). These ducts are for the transport of breast milk, rather than for breast milk storage (Geddes, 2007) . Previously it was thought that breast milk was stored in widened areas of the ducts, known as milk or lactiferous sinuses, until it was removed through breastfeeding or breast milk expression. However, the work of the Hartmann et al. (1996), using real-time ultrasound imagery, has shown that these sinuses do not exist. The resting diameter of the duct near the areola is the same as the diameter farther up the lobe. The ducts increase in diameter when letdown or breast milk ejection reflex occurs during breastfeeding or expression. Dilation of the breast milk duct is caused by a combination of shortening and widening of the duct, together with increased pressure within the duct, due to expulsion of breast milk from the alveoli and a change in the infant's sucking pattern ( Ramsay et al., 2004 ). When breast milk is no longer being removed, duct size returns to the resting diameter within 2 minutes due to the backward flow of breast milk (Ramsay et al., 2004) . The breast milk ducts at the base of the alveoli are superficial, very small (1.9 \u00b1 0.6 mm), and easily compressed. They are easily occluded with gentle pressure ( Ramsay et al., 2005 ). Nipple The mammary papillae form a conical elevation at the centre of the areola. This tissue is very flexible, able to stretch and mould to conform to the infant's mouth. There are usually about 9, ranging from 4 to 18, duct openings or pores where the breast milk ducts merge and from which breast milk exits the breast ( Ramsay et al., 2005 ). The nerve endings are highly sensitive to stimulation, controlling the release of breast milk from the ductal openings. Areola The dark area around the nipple comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. It increases in size and colour in response to hormones during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Both the nipple and areola are erectile tissue that responds to tactile, sensory and autonomic nervous stimuli ( Lawrence, 2010 ). Montgomery's tubercles contain openings of the ducts and sebaceous glands that lubricate the areola. The secretions provide olfactory stimuli for infants, playing a key role in establishing behavioural and physiological processes related to breast milk transfer and production ( Doucet et al., 2009 ). PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 12Breast Changes During Pregnancy The hormones estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the increased size and sensitivity of the breast or mammary gland during pregnancy. Mammogenesis is the rapid growth and cell development of the alveolar and ductal tissue of the breast that occurs during early pregnancy.These changes are signs that the breasts are preparing to make breast milk. Beginning from mid-pregnancy to late pregnancy, the breast has the capacity to produce the components of breast milk (Lactogenesis I). Lactation is normally inhibited during pregnancy because high levels of estrogen and progesterone inhibit the effect of prolactin. Lactogenesis II, the initial copious secretion of breast milk 2-4 days after childbirth, is triggered by the fall in progesterone and estrogen levels after expulsion of the placenta. This also triggers the closure of the tight junctions between the alveolar cells. At that time, the levels of sodium, chloride and protein drop in breast milk, together with an increase in lactose and breast milk lipid levels. Until then, large molecule immunoglobulins and medications pass easily into breast milk ( Hale et al., 2007 ). The events of the first few days may either promote or delay Lactogenesis II (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding). Although the initial copious secretion of breast milk is driven by hormones rather than by breast milk removal, sustained lactation depends on regular breast milk removal ( Cregan et al., 2002 ). In most cases, breasts of different shapes and sizes will produce more than enough breast milk. Larger breasts have more fatty tissue but not necessarily more of the breast milk producing alveoli tissue. Storage capacity, the amount of breast milk stored between breastfeedings, does appear to be related to breast size but not to the potential for breast milk production. Mothers with smaller storage capacities may need to breastfeed more often and may have less flexibility in the frequency of breastfeeding ( Hartmann et al., 1996 ). Lactating Breast at Rest How Breast Milk is Produced The amount of breast milk produced depends on how often and how effectively the infant removes breast milk from the breast. More breast milk will be produced when the infant breastfeeds more frequently and has an effective latch and suck. The interaction between storage capacity, the degree of breast fullness or emptiness, and frequency of breast milk removal plays a significant role in breast milk synthesis ( Cregan, 1999 ). When the nipple and areola are stimulated by infant hand movements and suckling, a cascade of hormones are triggered. Hormones are released into the mother's bloodstream, sending messages to the brain via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or HPA axis. These trigger breast milk production and the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex, as well as other maternal and infant behaviours. Multiple letdowns occur during a single breastfeeding. Most mothers report sensing the initial letdown but not subsequent ones ( Ramsay et al., 2004 ). Mothers may also not feel letdown but still have a normal letdown response.alveoli ducts nipple areola{ PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 13Lactating Breast after Letdown Prolactin is the hormone synthesized, stored and released from the anterior pituitary to stimulate the alveoli to produce and secrete breast milk. The greater the stimulation to the nipple and areola, the more prolactin that is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, leading to more breast milk being produced. Prolactin levels have diurnal variations following a circadian rhythm, with higher levels occurring at night ( Riordan, 2010; Hale et al., 2007 ). Levels of prolactin are highest in early lactation and decline as lactation progresses ( Cox et al., 1996, Hale et al., 2007 ). Prolactin levels may be regulated by a feedback mechanism known as the Prolactin - Inhibiting Factor (PIF) or Feedback Inhibitor ofLactation (FIL), a dopamine-related substance thatinhibits the uptake of by the prolactinreceptors ( Lawrence, 2010 ). Frequent breastfeeding in the early days may stimulate development ofprolactin receptors, resulting in greater breast milkoutput ( De Carvalho et al., 1983 ). Oxytocin is the hormone that sends messages to the alveoli to eject breast milk into the ducts. In response to suckling and infant hand massage ( Matthiesen et al., 2001), the posterior pituitary gland secretes oxytocin, causing breast milk ejection reflex or letdown to contract the myoepithelial cells of the alveoli and eject breast milk into the ducts. The breast milk is drawn down the dilated ducts toward the areola to be removed during breastfeeding or breast milk expression. Oxytocin dilates the ducts during breast milk ejection reflex and also sends messages to the uterus to contract. This helps to prevent maternal haemorrhaging and to promote uterine involution after birth. Mothers may experience this as cramps or \"after pains\". These cramps may continue for up to 20 minutes after a breastfeeding ( Riordan, 2010 ). Oxytocin is also understood to be a neuropeptide that plays a role in influencing emotional and physiological responses. These include cardiovascular, digestion, appetite and metabolism, pain threshold, kidney function, thermoregulation and stress response behaviours ( Uvnus-Moberg, 1998 ), as well as attachment behaviours. These early maternal attachment behaviours promote infant brain development and plasticity ( Schore, 2001 ). A feeling of calm often reported by women during breastfeeding is partly mediated by oxytocin ( Riordan, 2010 ). It has been termed an agent of the calm and connection response ( Uvnus-Moberg et al., 2005 ). Prolactin and oxytocin play a role in maternal adaptation to stress, whereby the responses of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system to emotional and physical stressors are attenuated or blunted ( Slattery et al., 2008 ), facilitating right-brain and intuitive behaviours. Other hormones also have significant roles in lactation. These include but are not limited to: Glucosteroids, which contribute to alveolar development, the regulation of fat, protein andlactose synthesis, and water transport across cellmembranes. Cortisol, important to stress mediation and normallylactogenic; the high levels produced during stressmay be antagonistic to lactation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, which facilitatesmammary growth and lactation. Breast milk is a dynamic, living substance ( Walker, 2010). It has many, many bioactive components, and transitions continually to meet the changing needs of the infant. These transitions occur on a continuum, with the composition of breast milk varying according to the stage of lactation, the time of day, the sampling time during a given feeding, maternal nutrition and individual variation ( Lawrence, 2010 ). Traditional nomenclature suggests distinct differences between \"colostrum\", \"transitional milk\" or \"mature milk\", and between \"foremilk\" and \"hindmilk\", which can imply limited value and use ( Lawrence, 2010 ). Some cultures discard the first milk. However, it is important to acknowledge that all breast milk is \"milk\" and is valuable for infants. The first breast milk (sometimes known as PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 14colostrum) is produced during late pregnancy and in the early postpartum period, and provides the infant with nutrition and protection against infectious disease ( Lawrence, 2010) . Typically, it is a clear yellow, viscous fluid rich in proteins (reflecting the presence of a large number of immunoglobulins), fat soluble vitamins, and some minerals, but has less fat and sugar than mature breast milk ( Riordan, 2010 ). It is produced in tiny volumes; in the first 3 days postpartum the volume per feeding ranges from 2 to 30 ml ( Lawrence, 2010 ). The higher concentrations of proteins and minerals gradually change over the first few weeks to reflect the infant's needs as breastfeeding becomes well established and more mature breast milk is produced ( Riordan, 2010 ). Changes continue in later lactation when increases in sodium and protein, including lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory IgA ( Dewey, 1984; Goldman, 1984 ) increase to enhance protection from infection for the older infant and toddler. Breast milk also changes throughout each breastfeeding, particularly related to fat content. At the initiation of a breastfeeding, the breast milk has a small amount of fat, but the fat content rises throughout the breastfeeding in relation to the degree of breast emptiness, not the duration of time at the breast, or the time interval between breastfeedings. The breast milk secreted at the early part of a breastfeeding, sometimes referred to as \"foremilk\", has high water and carbohydrate content to help hydrate and energize the infant. It is also a source of water-soluble vitamins ( Riordan, 2010 ). The breast milk produced towards the latter part of a breastfeeding, sometimes referred to as \"hindmilk\", has progressively higher fat content, although the fat content of both \"fore\" and \"hind\" breast milk increases as the breast is emptied ( Daly et al., 1993 ). There is no clear distinction between foremilk and hindmilk. The composition also varies with the time of day and between breasts ( Lawrence, 2010 ). References Cox, D.B., Owens, R.A., Hartmann, P.E.

PROTOCOL REVISEDProtocol #1 The Initiation of BreastfeedingBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 16\"Place babies in uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with their mothers immediately following birth for at least an hour or until completion of the first feeding or for as long as the mother wishes: encourage mothers to r ecognize when their babies are ready to feed, offering help as needed.\" (BFI Step 4, BCC, 2011) Suggestions Encourage the mother to: Initiate breastfeeding immediately after birth. Place the baby skin-to-skin on her chest, uninterrupted,for at least an hour or until completion of the firstbreastfeeding, or for as long as the mother wishes.Most babies will breastfeed well immediately after birth, while some may only lick and smell the breast and may not necessarily actively suck in the early stages of breastfeeding, and some may lick and snifflater on. Most routine procedures can and should be delayed until after the first breastfeeding is completed. Remain together with the baby 24 hours a day at thehospital unless separation is medically indicated. Seek assistance to initiate breastfeeding andmaintain lactation, particularly if the mother andbaby are separated after birth. The mother shouldbe encouraged to express her breasts frequently - atleast 8 or more times in 24 hours beginning within6 hours after birth (BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011) (Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk). Recognize when the baby is ready to breastfeed. Breastfeed when the baby is showing early feedingcues before the baby gets too hungry, is too eager tobreastfeed, or is crying. Early feeding cues include: Rapid eye movements under the eyelids. Soft cooing or sighing sounds. Sucking or licking movements. Sucking sounds. Restlessness. Hand-to-mouth movements. (Adapted from ILCA, 2005) Breastfeed according to the baby's feeding readiness cues. Breastfeedings should be frequentand unrestricted, with no time schedule. In the firstmonth a baby should be awakened to breastfeed if there are signs of insufficient breastfeeding (i.e., less than 8 effective breastfeedings in 24 hours, or more than one 4-5 hour sleep period in 24 hours, and/or showing signs of inadequate urine/stool output or weight gain) ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding) . Breastfeed when the mother is calm andcomfortable. Clothe the baby only in a diaper when breastfeedingto promote skin-to-skin contact. Allow the baby to lead the breastfeeding process,including when to breastfeed, latch, and when tofinish the breastfeeding. The baby is supported andhis trunk is stabilized so that he is able to follow hisown reflexes and cues. The baby sets the timing andthe pace; the process should not be rushed. Allow the baby to breastfeed on the first breastuntil the baby is no longer sucking and swallowingeffectively (i.e., deep and slow sucks) ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding) . The second breast should be of fered if the baby is interested. This may happen several times duringa breastfeeding, when the baby is learning tobreastfeed. Once breastfeeding and breast milksupply are established, the baby should be allowedto breastfeed fully from the first breast beforechanging breasts. Understand that during the first few days,breastfeedings may be short and frequent until thebreast milk volume increases with the onset ofLactogenesis II. Babies should effectively suck andswallow until they are satisfied. Seek assistance to initiate breastfeeding andmaintain lactation should the mother facechallenges such as 'separation from her baby' (Step 5, BFHI ). Support the mother to hand express if the baby is not removing breast milk from the breastProtocol #1: The Initiation of BreastfeedingBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 17(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk) . Offer both breasts at each breastfeeding, as determined by the baby's interest. Avoid supplementation with other fluids or foods inthe first 6 months of life, unless medically indicated(Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation orCessation of Breastfeeding) . Discuss with her health care provider the HealthCanada recommendation to give all breastfedhealthy term babies a daily vitamin D supplement(10 \u00b5g or 400 IU), starting from birth andcontinuing until the breastfed baby reaches 1 yearof age (Health Canada, 2011). Avoid using a soother or bottle. Support the motherin making an informed decision about the use ofartificial nipples or pacifiers, and document herdecision. If the mother decides to use these, sheshould be encouraged to wait until breastfeedingand sucking patterns are well established, usually at4-6 weeks. Learn alternative ways to soothe and calm her baby. Use proper positioning and latching techniques(Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching) . Watch for signs of breastfeeding ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding) General Principles Initiation of breastfeeding immediately after birth isrecommended. Place babies in uninterrupted skin-to-skin contactwith their mothers immediately following birthfor at least an hour or until completion of thefirst feeding or for as long as the mother wishes:encourage mothers to recognize when their babiesare ready to breastfeed, offering help as needed. Routine procedures, monitoring and measurementsare delayed until after the first breastfeeding iscompleted. (BFI Step 4, BCC, 2011) . Most mothers will produce enough breast milkto exclusively breastfeed their baby for the first 6months of life and continue to breastfeed for 2 yearsand beyond with the introduction of nutrient richsolid foods at 6 months paying particuar attention toiron. Babies should be breastfed according to their earlyfeeding cues. In the first month most babies needto breastfeed well at least 8 times in 24 hours. This will ensure that the baby is getting enough breast milk while breastfeeding is being established and help the mother to build a healthy breast milk supply. Babies show feeding cues to signal their readiness to feed, as well as the timing and duration of feedings. Mothers are encouraged to recognize the signs thattheir babies are ready to feed (BFI Step 4, BCC, 2011) . Babies breastfeed best when they are calm, beforethey are overly hungry, and before they reach a stateof crying. Early feeding cues may be less obviousif the baby has challenges such as jaundice, illness,difficult delivery, etc. Early Feeding Cues include: Rapid eye movements, under the eyelids Sucking/licking movements Hand-to-mouth movements Sucking sounds Restlessness Soft cooing or sighing sounds (Adapted from ILCA, 2005) Late Feeding Cues include:Crying Fussiness Exhaustion Falling asleep (Adapted from Riordan, 2010) (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching and Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Skin-to-Skin Mother-newborn contact is optimized by skin-to- skin practices or \"kangaroo care\" for premature babies. Placing the baby directly on the mother's abdomen and chest, skin-to-skin, boosts the baby's cardio-respiratory and thermoregulatory response and provides the mother with the optimum opportunity to become attuned to her baby's behaviour and cues. Skin-to-skin contact promotes colonization of the baby with maternal microbes, for which the baby is familiar and has compatible antibodies (Odent, 2002) . Skin-to-skin contact has been demonstrated to result in a significant increase in breast milk volume (Hurst Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 18et al., 1997) . The most recent Cochrane Review (Moore et al., 2007) found statistically significant positive effects of early skin-to-skin contact on the success of first breastfeeding, breastfeeding status day 3 post-birth, breastfeeding 1-4 months post-birth, breastfeeding duration, maternal breast engorgement pain, anxiety state, and babies' recognition of their own mother's breast milk, as well as maintenance of infant thermoregulation, crying, blood glucose levels, and other physiological parameters. In addition, it found significant differences in summary scores of affection and touch and contact behaviour with skin-to-skin practice. There were no significant differences in weight gain, heart or breathing rates, hospital stay, or number of breastfeeding problems (Moore et al., 2007) . As discussed by Louise Dumas (Dumas, 2011) , the temperature reciprocity between mother and baby means that mothers do not overheat (Bergstrom et al., 2007) , the baby's temperature is always within normal limits (Mori et al., 2009; Bystrova et al., 2008) , cold babies rewarm better than in an incubator (Christensson et al., 1998) , time until placental expulsion is decreased (Marin Gabriel et al., 2010), there is reduced pain reaction (Chermont et al., 2009; Weissman et al., 2009) , energy is conserved, and babies are better able to self-regulate, showing less signs of stress after birth (Ferber et al., 2004) . Avoid restricting babies' use of their hands byswaddling, holding the arms, or trapping thembetween the mother's breasts. It is instinctive forbabies to deliberately use their hands to locate,move and shape the nipple area (Genna, 2010) . Swaddling or bundling may restrict instinctiveinfant behaviours such as hand movements, as wellas seeking and attaching behaviours. Swaddledbabies sleep longer and arouse less (Franco et al., 2005) , which may decrease breastfeeding frequency. This is particularly significant in the first few hoursand days after birth. Assist mothers to be comfortable and stress-free topromote breast milk letdown (see How the Breast Works). Babies should be allowed to breastfeed on the first breast until they are no longer sucking and swallowing effectively (i.e., deep and slow sucks) (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Finish the first breast first (Renfrew et al., 2004) . This will increase the amount of fat the baby receives since breast milk increases in fat content as the breast empties while feeding progresses (Cregan & Hartmann, 1999) . It is no longer recommended to routinely switch breasts after 5-10 minutes as this may decrease the baby's fat intake and result in more frequent breastfeeding (see How the Breast Works). The second breast should be offered when the baby shows interest. Let the baby's cues, not the clock, determine how much and how long to breastfeed. It is not necessary to breastfeed equally from both breasts. The work of the Western Australia/Hartmann group has shown that storage capacity varies between breasts, and although this does not impact the 24-hour volume produced, it can impact the amount of breast milk available between breasts during a single feeding (Daly et al., 1993; Ramsay et al., 2005; Geddes, 2007) . The baby's interest is a better indicator in determining how long and how much to breastfeed. It may be difficult for mothers to recognize swallowing during the first few days until breast milk volume increases with the onset of Lactogenesis II (see How the Breast Works). It may also be difficult for mothers to accept that this small volume of breast milk is the correct amount for the size of their newborn's stomach. Fetal gastric volume near term is tiny (10 ml); it is important to reinforce the message that stomach capacity is small and gastric emptying frequent in newborns. The cycle is about 40 minutes at 32-35 weeks gestation and lengthens to about 80 minutes at term (Sase et al., 2005) . Santoro found that newborns ingested only 15 \u00b1 11 g of breast milk in the first 24 hours (Santoro et al., 2010) . Mothers should be supported in understanding the significance of frequent breastfeedings and breast milk removal during the first few days after birth, and their relationship to the establishment of breastfeeding. Babies need frequent small breastfeedings because of their small stomach size and rapid gastric emptying and feeding cycles. The breasts need frequent removal of small amounts of breast milk to promote Lactogenesis II (see How the Breast Works). Lack of breast stimulation by sucking or expression leads to a drop in the level of lactogenic hormones. If breast milk is not removed frequently, breast milk stasis will trigger changes at the cellular level that lead to breakdown of the lactocytes, changes in protein and breast milk composition and involution of the breast, thereby reversing Lactogenesis II or the production of breast milk (Hale et al., 2007) . Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 19Lactogenesis II may be delayed by a variety of factors that may lead to poor breast milk removal, such as mother-baby separation, traumatic birth, caesarean section, metabolic conditions in the mother or baby, eg., uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease, or psychological situations including stress or other mental health concerns. When Lactogenesis II is delayed, there may be delays in the appearance of the initial copious secretion of breast milk, mothers reporting feeling breast fullness, and changes in the baby's stooling frequency and colour until later in the first week, after 4 or 5 days (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). Although there may be normal variations between women, it is important to assess further whenever there seem to be signs of delay. After Lactogenesis II, there is an ongoing feedback mechanism to inhibit breast milk release when there is poor breast milk removal at any stage of lactation. The Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL) is an autocrine control mechanism by a whey protein that regulates the secretion of breast milk if there is alerady breast milk accumulated in the alveoli (Lawrence, 2010) . This may work together with other factors, including insufficient stimulation and/or insufficient breast milk removal, to trigger the Prolactin-Inhibiting Factor (PIF), as discussed in How the Breast Works. Assist mothers to breastfeed and maintain lactation should they face challenges including separation from their babies (BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011) . If the baby does not remove breast milk during the first breastfeeding, encourage the mother to use hand expression to remove the breast milk. Hand expression may be more successful in the first few days after birth due to the viscous nature and small volume of the first breast milk (colostrum). It can be discouraging for a new mother to use an electric pump if the breast milk does not accumulate in the pump's reservoir. It can be more affirming for her to be able to remove her own breast milk by hand into a small container and offer it to the baby by cup or spoon. Some clinicians suggest that the mother offer a teaspoon or \"paint\" drops of expressed breast milk onto their baby's lips, where it will be absorbed and begin to trigger physiological responses in the newborn, as well as provide nourishment. It is important that pregnant women be taught the skill of hand expression. (Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ).No extra fluids or foods are needed for a healthy breastfed baby in the first 6 months of life unless medically indicated ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Giving extra fluids or foods during this time will decrease the mother's breast milk supply as well as the baby's intake of breast milk. Health Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommend that all breastfed healthy term babies receive a daily vitamin D supplement of 10 \u00b5g (400 IU) starting from birth and continuing until the breastfed baby reaches 1 year of age (Health Canada, 2010) . There is increasing interest in the importanceof adequate intake of vitamin D. The amountof vitamin D in breast milk is dependent onmaternal stores during pregnancy and lactation (Wagner et al., 2010) . Based on the U.S. Institute of Medicine [IOM] report of the review of the DietaryReference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamin D andcalcium, Health Canada now recommends a dailyintake of 600 IU (15mg) for pregnant and lactatingwomen (Health Canada, 2010) , ideally met through dietary intake. Step 9 of the Integrated Ten Steps of the Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI) recommends that mothers be supported to feed and care for their babies without teats or pacifiers (dummies or soothers) (BFI Step 9, BCC, 2011) . Babies need to learn the normal mechanics of sucking at the breast. This includes learning to manage the flow of breast milk from the breast. Feeding only at the breast helps to prevent the baby learning to suck improperly on the breast tissue, which may in turn lead to breast refusal or painful nipples. This \"nipple confusion\" has not been established in the medical literature (Lawrence, 2010) but there is strong evidence in the psychosomatic literature to support the \"imprinting\" of sucking behaviours. Imprinting - The concept of imprinting or \"stamping\" is sometimes used to explain the incidence of nipple preference. Imprinting is drawn from other sciences such as biology and psychology, where it has been applied to explain attachment behaviours and brain pathway development. In humans, imprinting is oral/tactile (Lawrence, 2010, p. 202)and Gale Mobbs (1989) has identified the mouth as the most significant factor for imprinting inBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 20humans. When babies are exposed to artificial nipples or fingers early they can become accustomed to the feeling of that particular object, e.g., bottle nipple, pacifier, finger, in their mouths and have difficulty accepting another object, such as the mother's nipple, in its place (Righard, 1997, p. 119) . Pacifie r Use - In recent years, there have been controversial and contradictory reports about the effects of pacifier use. The evidence had previously shown a strong association between the use of pacifiers and a shortened duration of breastfeeding (Kramer et al., 2001) . However, a recent systematic review found that the highest level of evidence does not support an adverse relationship between pacifier use and breastfeeding exclusivity or duration (O'Connor et al., 2009) . The Cochrane review concluded that for mothers who are \"motivated\" to breastfeed their babies, pacifier use before or after breastfeeding was established did not significantly affect the prevalence or duration of exclusive andpartial breastfeeding up to 4 months of age (Jaafar et al., 2011) ; the report does not, however, define 'motivated'. As suggested by Howard et al. (2003) , pacifier use may be a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or reduced intention to breastfeed. A mother may miss or override early feeding cues if a pacifier is used to delay or shorten breastfeedings. Pacifiers are also associated with an increased risk of otitis media (CPS, 2011; Duffy, 1997) . If the mother decides to use artificial nipples and pacifiers, she should be encouraged to wait until breastfeeding and sucking patterns are well established, usually after a few (4-6) weeks (Righard, 1998) . The Canadian Paediatric Society advises parents not to start using a pacifier until breastfeeding is fully established, and to talk to their doctor or lactation consultant if they feel their baby needs one at that early stage. CPS also advises an exception for premature or sick babies who may use a pacifier for comfort (CPS, 2007a) . References Bergstrom, A., Okong Ransjo-Arvidson, A-B. (2007).

Protocol #2 Positioning and Latching PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 23Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching Babies of all ages have the ability to find the breast all by themselves, and to latch on by themselves, just as puppies and kittens do. We don't make our babies learn to latch; we allow them to learn by supporting their innate capacities to self-attach (adapted from Christina Smillie, 2005). Suggestions Encourage the mother to: Understand that positioning and latching are interactive and reciprocal; both mother and babyrespond to each other, sometimes called thebreastfeeding conversation (Genna, 2008). Understand it is not prescriptive; there are manyways to breastfeed. Understand that positioning and latching are uniquefor each breastfeeding dyad. Understand that both the mother and baby bringmany competencies, instincts and behaviours to thepositioning and latching process. Understand that for a mother breastfeeding may bea learned behaviour, but for her baby, breastfeedingis instinctive (Genna, 2008) . Understand that positional or core stabilitypromotes oral stability. Understand that it is a dynamic process, continuallychanging as the baby grows and develops physically and emotionally. When in doubt, try cuddling the baby skin-to-skin. Positioning There are many possible positions for mothers and babies to try. These may vary depending on many factors that include baby size and capacity, maternal body size and shape, breast size and shape and preference. Encourage the mother to understand the principles or checkpoints for effective positioning and latching so that she can try a variety of breastfeeding positions. Checkpoints for Positioning For any position encourage the mother to check that:She is relaxed and comfortable with good posture and correct body alignment. Her back and arms are well supported. Baby's shoulders and trunk are supported. Baby's head is at the level of the breast. Baby's ear, shoulder, and hip are in a straight line. Baby's chest is facing the mother's chest (not forfootball hold). Baby's body is in full contact with the mother's. Baby's nose approaches the mother's nipple, andthe baby's chin touches the breast. The positions that are typically described should not preclude other possibilities. Biological Nurturing (Semi-Reclined Positions) Laid-back Nursing, an approach described by Suzanne Colson, suggests that the mother: Lean back in a semi-reclined position, finding an angle that feels right for her. Feels completely relaxed and supported. Place baby tummy down and in full contact withmother 's semi-reclined body . Cuddle or 'nest' her baby, rather than restrain him. Let gravity support the baby. Trigger the baby's innate reflexes and feeding behaviours. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 24Cross-Cradle Position This position may work well: When learning to breastfeed. If baby has difficulty maintaining a latch. If baby is premature or small. If baby has low muscle tone. If baby has a weak rooting reflex or weak suck. If the baby is late preterm (Walker, 2011). Important points for effective positioning when using the cross-cradle position: Mother sits with a straight back, with her shoulders relaxed and arms at her side. A pillow may behelpful during the early days to support themother's back and arms or if the baby is small. Mother's feet are usually flat on the floor so that herlegs are relaxed. A footstool or large book under herfeet may help. Her lap is flat or her knees slightlyhigher than her hips. Mother places baby in front, turned completely onit's side so that the baby's face, chest, and kneesare all facing the mother. The baby's chest is in fullfrontal contact with the mother's torso/abdomen.A pillow may be helpful during the early days tosupport the mother's arm when raising a small babyto breast level. Mother supports the baby's neck and shoulders withher hand on the opposite side of the breast where the baby is breastfeeding so the head is able to tilt back slightly; her forearm supporting the baby's back and buttocks (i.e., right hand/forearm when breastfeeding on the left breast). Mother may support the breast where the baby is breastfeeding in a relaxed \"C\" or \"U\" hold using the same hand (i.e., left hand supports the left breast) (see diagram of \"C\" or \"U\" hold in Latching). Baby's nose approaches the nipple. Baby's chintouches the breast first. When baby's mouth openswide mother brings the baby close to her breast bypulling the baby's shoulders and buttocks closer,instead of leaning over or pushing the nipple into the baby's mouth. Once the baby is latched, the mother may wishto shift to find a more comfortable hold. She maymove her hands to support her baby on her wrist or forearm on the same side as the breast where the baby is breastfeeding. Cross-cradle is also known as a transitional hold. Cradle Position This position may work well: When the mother is comfortable with breastfeeding and the baby is latching well. Mothers may transition the baby into this positionafter latching in the cross-cradle position. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 25Important points for effective positioning when using the cradle position: Mother sits with her back extended and supported, preferably in a chair, with her shoulders relaxedand arms at her side. Pillows may help to supporta small baby, or support mother's back and arms,particularly in the early days. Mother's feet are usually flat on the floor so that herlegs are relaxed. A footstool or large book under herfeet may help. Her lap is flat or her knees slightly higher than her hips. Mother places baby in front, turned completely onit's side so that baby's face, chest, and knees are all facing the mother. The baby's chest is in full frontal contact with the mother's torso/abdomen. A pillow may be helpful during the early days to support the mother's arm when raising a small baby to breast level. Mother supports the baby's body and head along herarm so that the baby's head is tilted back slightly.She uses the arm on the same side as the breast to be breastfed on; her forearm supports the baby's back and her hand supports the buttocks (i.e., left arm and hand when breastfeeding on the left breast). Mother may support the breast where the baby isbreastfeeding in a relaxed \"C\" or \"U\" hold usingthe opposite hand (i.e., right hand supports the leftbreast) (see diagram of \"C\" or \"U\" hold in Latching). Baby's nose approaches the nipple. Baby's chintouches the breast first. When baby's mouth openswide mother brings the baby close to her breast bypushing the baby's buttocks, instead of leaning overor pushing her nipple into the baby's mouth. Mothers should avoid using the cradle hold with late pre term infants. These babies often have low muscletone. In addition, positions that place the baby's neckand body in excessive flexion can cause late pre term infants to be prone to positional apnea due to airway obstruction, increasing the risk of bradycardia and oxygen desaturation (Walker, 2010) . Football Position This position may work well:When learning to breastfeed. If baby has difficulty maintaining a latch. If baby is premature or small. If baby has low muscle tone.If baby has a weak rooting reflex or a weak suck. If mother has long or heavy breasts. If mother has flat or sore nipples. If mother had a caesarean birth. Important points for effective positioning when using the football position: Mother sits relaxed with a straight back, with her shoulders relaxed and arms at her side. Pillows may help to support her back and arms. A firm pillowmay be placed at her side to support the arm holdingthe baby. Mother's feet are usually flat on the floor so that her legs are relaxed. A footstool or large book under her feet may help. Her lap is flat or knees slightly higher than her hips. Mother places baby at her side. Baby is lying either completely on its back or turned slightly towards the breast. Baby is tucked close to mother's side and is directly under the breast. Baby's buttocks rest near mother's elbow with its hips against the back of thechair or bed frame, if sitting up in bed. Mother supports the baby's neck and upper back with her hand on the same side as the breast to be breastfedon; her forearm supports the baby's upper back (i.e., left hand/forearm when breastfeeding on the left PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 26side). Baby's head is able to tilt back slightly in the instinctive position. Mother may support the breast where the baby is breastfeeding in a relaxed C or \"U\" hold using the opposite hand (i.e., right hand supports the left breast) (see diagram of \"C\" or \"U\" hold in Latching). Baby's nose approaches the nipple. Baby's chinpresses into the breast. When baby's mouth openswide the mother brings the baby close to her breast by pulling the baby's buttocks closer, instead of leaningover or pushing her nipple into the baby's mouth. Side-Lying Position This position may work well if: Mother finds it too painful to sit. Mother wants to rest when breastfeeding (e.g., night feedings). Mother had a caesarean birth. Mother has long or heavy breasts. Important points for effective positioning when using the side-lying position: Mother lies on her side with a pillow under her head and pillows behind her back so that she can lean back for support. A pillow may be placed between her legs for comfort, especially after a caesarean birth. Mother positions baby on the bed parallel to andfacing her body. Baby is turned completely onto itsside so that its face, chest, and knees are all facingand touching the mother . Baby is oriented slightly below the level of the breast so that the head is ableto tilt slightly upward to latch. The baby can besupported in this position by the mother's arm, a rolled towel, or a baby blanket can be placed behind the baby's shoulders. Mother supports the baby's head, back, andbuttocks with her arm on the same side as thebreast to be breastfed on (i.e., right arm whenbreastfeeding on the right side). The baby's head can either rest directly on the bed, or on themother's upper arm. Once breastfeeding is wellestablished and the baby is able to maintain a latch,the mother may remove her arm from under thebaby and place it under her own head for morecomfort. Baby' s nose approaches the nipple. Baby's chin presses into the breast. When baby's mouth openswide, mother pulls the baby close to her breast bypushing baby's buttocks, instead of leaning over orpushing her nipple into the baby's mouth. Mother usually rolls over to breastfeed from theother breast. However , she may try to breastfeed from both breasts while lying on one side bybreastfeeding from the lower breast first, thenpushing it under her torso to breastfeed from theupper breast. Mother may wish to support her breast on a smallpillow or blanket if she is having difficulty seeingthe baby latch. Another approach is for mother toelevate herself on her elbow to see the baby latch.Once the baby is latched, she can readjust to a morecomfortable position for breastfeeding. Mothers may use more than one position during a single breastfeeding (e.g., a mother who prefers to use her right hand can use the football hold for the right breast and then breastfeed from the left breast using cross-cradle hold) (Lauwers et al., 2011). (For a discussion of several further suggestions see Genna (2008) , Walker (2011)) . Latching 1. Checkpoints for Latching - Encourage the motherto check that: Both baby and mother are calm. Baby is either in a quiet, alert state, or sleeping lightly. Baby is supported with head higher than tummy. Baby's nose approaches the nipple. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 27 Baby is able to touch the breast with its chin, tongue, and cheek. Baby is supported with shoulders and pelvicgirdle stable to facilitate the cascade of behavioursthat will support the baby's inherent capacity toself-attach. See Baby-Led Latching in General Principles. Baby can \"search and peck\" for the nipple until itlatches. Mother can settle into a more comfortable positionfor breastfeeding after a successful latch is achieved. 2. Baby-Led Latching Baby-led latching is a natural and simple way for the baby to get to the breast. It may be helpful when the baby is learning to breastfeed, when baby is not breastfeeding well, when the mother's nipples are sore, or any time. Begin when the baby is calm. Mother finds a comfortable position, feelingrelaxed, supported and leaning back a little. Hold the baby skin-to-skin on mother's upper chest,between her breasts, so that the baby's shouldersand hips are stable and head can tilt back slightly. Wait, watch, and wonder.Baby will start moving his head up and downlooking for mother's breast. This may look likebobbing or pecking. Baby will seek the breast, first with his hands andmouth, licking, smelling, nuzzling and nestling;then trying to move towards the breast, sometimescrawling and stepping. Mother may help the baby tomove to the nipple. Mother supports the baby' s shoulders, neck and buttocks, assisting him while he moves towards her breast. Baby will find mother's nipple. Baby will push his chin into mother's breast, reachup with an open mouth and latch onto her breast. It may help to bring baby's buttocks close tomother's body and give support to the baby's backand shoulders. Once baby is attached, mother and baby can shiftto settle into a more comfortable position. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 283. Techniques to support latching Mother may wish to shape her breast to make it easier for the baby's lower jaw to take in more of the breast tissue. She may shape or \"sandwich\" the breast in a relaxed \"C\" or \"U\" hold, oriented to match the direction of the baby's mouth (Genna, 2008). (see following diagram) Once breastfeeding is well established and the baby is able to maintain a latch, she may wish to release the breast. Mother may support her breast in a relaxed \"C\"or \"U\" hold. Her thumb is on top and 4 fingersare below the breast, well away from the areola,shaping the breast in the same direction as thebaby's mouth. She should avoid holding her breasttoo tightly. With the baby's head tilted slightly back and nose facing the nipple, mother may brush baby's lower lipwith the nipple, and support the baby until the chin touches the breast and the baby's mouth opens wide (like a yawn).Mother then quickly brings the baby to the breast by pulling the baby in close to her body. Once the baby is latched, mother and baby can reposition themselves to find a more comfortable position for breastfeeding. Mother may also tilt or \"flip\" the nipple up towards the roof of the baby's mouth. This technique is sometimes called \"the Flipple\" , originally described by Kathleen Glover. Mother rolls the underside of the breast with a twist of the wrist to present more of the underside of the breast to the baby. As the baby opens its mouth wide, the mother presses on the breast just above the nipple with a finger running parallel to the baby's upper lip. This will tilt or lift the nipple up and help roll more of the breast into the baby's mouth, supporting a deeper latch (Mohrbacher, 2010; Glover & Weissinger in Genna, 2008) . 4. Signs of a good latch: Baby's mouth is opened wide. Baby's lips are curled out and cover more of the area below the nipple (may be less for a small orpremature baby). Baby's lower lip covers more of the areola than theupper lip. Baby's chin is pressed into the breast. Tip of baby's nose approaches the breast. Baby's head is tilted back slightly in the instinctivefeeding position. Baby's cheeks appear to be full and rounded (notdimpling in). Baby's mouth does not slip off the breast. Baby is supported in the chest-to-chest position PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 29(except for football hold) and baby's neck is not turned. Mother feels a strong tugging sensation, with nopain. Breastfeeding is pain-free. Baby shows signs of sucking and swallowing breastmilk, e.g., movement of ear or temple. Swallowing is audible. Baby is comfortable managing the flow of breastmilk. 5. Interrupting the Latch If the mother decides to take her baby off the breast before the baby is finished, suggest that she break the suction first by trying one of these methods: Press down on her breast near the baby's mouth. Gently insert a finger into the corner of the baby's mouth. Gently pull down on the baby's chin. Bring the baby in closer to the breast so that thenose is covered briefly with breast tissue; this maybe more effective for an older baby. General Principles Health care providers can support positioning and latching by encouraging mothers and babies to be left together to relax and connect, facilitating \"right-brain\" intuitive behaviours. Wherever possible, support is offered \"hands off\" (BFI Appendix 5.1, BCC, 2011) . Support is offered to encourage and provide anticipatory guidance. Prescriptive teaching and labelling may limit possibilities and trigger left-brain behaviours. Teaching specific positioning and attachment skills may inadvertently decrease breastfeeding satisfaction and duration (Henderson, 2003 in Mohrbacher, 2010) . \"If it's not broken, don't fix it\". It is important for the health care provider to affirm what works for the mother and baby, and offer suggestions for alternatives when something is not working. Baby-led Latching is an intuitive approach to how babies can learn to latch. It draws on concepts from neurobehavioural literature. There is reciprocity in the mother-baby interaction, with each responding to the other's cues and the mother following the baby's lead. The baby picks up cues from the mother, such as odours, touch, and eye contact, as well as feeling their own internal cues of hunger and thirst. These elicit the baby's cascade of searching behaviours. As the baby searches for the nipple, the mother supports the baby in a calm state and in a flexed and relaxed position until the baby attaches and begins to suck. The mother supports the baby in a vertical, upright, chest-to-chest position in firm frontal contact withher body. This provides the positional or corestability needed to facilitate the baby's normalneonatal neurobehavioural and neuroendocrineresponses (Smillie, Genna, 2008) . Babies feel most secure supported in the ventral (chest-to-chest)position. The baby's reflexes support the cascadeof behaviours that facilitate his inherent capacity toself-attach to the breast: Getting to the breast - Stepping and crawlingmotions Finding the breast - Searching and rooting Attaching - Rooting and opening the mouth Sucking - Stimulated by the presence of thenipple on the palate. A calm, attentive state promotes and optimizes babyfeeding behaviours. Baby-led latching is not prescriptive, but rather issupportive of the baby's inherent capacity to self-attach, with the mother and baby adjusting to eachother until they find a comfortable position (Smillie, 2005) . Optimal positioning and latching will help the baby to suck effectively. These are essential for successfulbreastfeeding. It is recommended that positioningand latching be assessed before discharge fromhospital and when any breastfeeding problems occur. Both mother and baby need to be in a comfortable and well supported position. Newborns until 3-4 months of age are reliant on positional stability for smooth, calm execution of the complex sequence required for attachment and the suck-swallow-breathe cycle (Smillie in Genna, 2008) . Biological Nurturing, based on the work ofSuzanne Colson, promotes maternal postures thatfacilitate instinctive behaviours and primitiveneonatal reflexes that support positive breastfeedingbehaviours. The mother leans back in a semi- PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 30reclined position so that she is completely comfortable, feels supported and relaxed, and \"nests\" the baby on her chest in close apposition with the maternal contour. Colson calls this \"body brushing\". This appears to release primitive neonatal reflex-like movements that facilitate breastfeeding; this may even occur when the baby is lightly dressed. In addition, the mother's posture facilitates release of oxytocin, promoting milk release and stress modulation (Colson, 2010) (see also How the Breast Works regarding oxytocin and Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding). Effective positioning and latching will help preventmany breastfeeding problems such as sore nipples,mastitis, low breast milk supply, and poor weightgain of the baby. Some babies are able to latch and suck well immediately after birth, while others need more help and practice. It is important for mothers and babies to learn effective positioning and latching in the first few weeks after birth, when breastfeeding is beingestablished, for ongoing breastfeeding success. It is important that the baby' s head be tilted slightly back so that the chin touches the breast first. If the chin tilts forward towards the breast, the baby will approach the nipple at a narrow angle, which willresult in a shallower, less comfortable, and lesseffective latch (Wiessinger, 1998) . Instinctive Feeding Position - Baby is stable, head lifted and tilted back, and approaches the breast with the chin and mouth leading. Baby is able to attach in a deep latch, creating a seal that facilitates sucking and transfer of breast milk. Asymmetric Latch - Describes a \"deep latch\" where the baby is in the instinctive feeding position, taking in more of the tissue of the lower aspect of the breast. This can help the baby manage the flow of breast milk. Colson has observed that babies fed in the Biological Nurturing laid-back position may latch more centred on the breast, but are able to self-adjust and manage the flow of breast milk (Colson, 2008) . Terminology - The terms \"latching\" and \"attachment\" both appear in reference and resource materials and may be used interchangeably. The term \"attachment\" tends to be used in Australian and European materials. The mother's hand should not be on the back of the baby' s head, as this often causes the baby to arch away from the breast (Lauwers & Swisher, 2011) . Some mothers seek specific directions. The four mostcommon positions or holds are described in Genna. Breastfeeding is an ever-changing landscape. As thebaby grows, the position that the baby and mother find most comfortable for breastfeeding will often changeor may need to be reassessed if difficulties arise. Some mothers and babies may establish positionsthat successfully support breast milk transfer butmay not reflect any of the positions described hereor in any other text. There is no need to intervene orchange something that is working for that mother andbaby. Remember, \"If it' s not broken, don't fix it.\" The Baby-Friendly Initiative recommends that mostteaching and breastfeeding support should be donein a hands-off manner. Since the goal is for mothers to be able to latch their babies independently, it isimportant for staff to request permission beforetouching the mother or baby and to take a hands-of f approach as much as possible. A hands-on approach isonly used after asking permission and when additional help is deemed necessary (BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011) . References Breastfeeding Committee for Canada [BCC]. (2011).

PROTOCOL REVISEDProtocol #3 Signs of Effective Breastfeeding PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 32Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding Effective latching, positioning and sucking are keys for successful breastfeeding. Observation and Assessment 1.Assess and teach the mother how to recognize that her baby is ready for breastfeeding. Early Feeding Cues:Rapid eye movements under the eyelids. Soft cooing or sighing sounds. Sucking or licking movements. Sucking sounds. Restlessness. Hand-to-mouth movements. (Adapted from ILCA, 2005)2.Assess and teach the mother how to recognize that her baby is sucking effectively. Mother is able to observe for signs of breast milk transfer. See alsoPoint 5. Deep and Slow Sucks: At the beginning of the breastfeeding the infant may have shallow and quick sucks that help to stimulatethe letdown or breast milk ejection reflex. Whenletdown occurs, the breast milk flows and the suckpattern changes, becoming deep and slow. Thereis a pause during the suck when the infant' s mouth opens the widest. Once the breast milk flows thereshould be deep and slow sucks (open-pause-close), with swallows occurring on every suck to every other suck throughout most of the breastfeeding. See the Suck Cycle and diagrams. While Sucking: Mother and baby maintain an effective latch and a comfortable position ( Pr otocol #2: Positioning and Latching). Mother feels her breast being pulled, with no pain. Baby has wide-open mouth. Baby sucks, swallows, and breathes in a rhythmic and co-ordinated pattern. Baby makes swallowing sounds (e.g., a quietlyexhaled \"kaa, kaa, kaa\", not clicking or smackingsounds).

Breastfed babies: May lose an average of 7% of their birth weight in the 3 days after birth. Should regain their birth weight by 10 days of age. Should show a pattern of weight gain by Day 5onward. Should gain 20 - 35 g ( - 1\u00bc oz) per day for thefirst 3 - 4 months of age. Tend to grow more quickly than non-breastfedbabies in the first 6 months and grow more slowlyin the second 6 months of life.

When the healthy term baby is effectively breastfeeding, the initial post-birth weight loss will stabilize quickly, and then reflect a steady weight gain. The presence of any of the above weight loss indicators should be a sign that further assessment and support are needed to optimize breastfeeding. Advise the mother that weight gain is only one of many indicators that will help her know how well her baby is breastfeeding. Her baby's behaviour will give her many signs that she can see every day (see notes in General Principles ). 5.Assess and teach the mother about other signs of effective breastfeeding or breast milk transfer: Baby's mouth is moist and pink. Baby is alert and moves actively. Baby has a vigorous cry. Baby has good skin turgor. Baby's fontanels are flat and soft. Baby has no fever. Baby comes off the mother's breast looking relaxed and sleepy - the baby is satisfied. Mother's breasts feel softer and less full afterbreastfeeding. Mother's breasts experience the letdown or breastmilk ejection nipple is elongated after breastfeeding butnot pinched, blanched, or damaged. Support the mother in understanding that the volume of breast milk transferred is related to the infant's stomach size (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). 6.Assess and teach the mother about the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex. Signs of the Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Reflex Tingling sensation or feeling of tightening in the mother's breasts. This may be noticeable with onlythe first letdown, or they may feel nothing. Breast milk leaking or flowing when hearing thebaby cry , or leaking from the opposite breast during breastfeeding. Filling of the ducts near the areola that can be feltwith the fingers. Changes in the sucking pattern: sucking slows,pauses, and baby begins to swallow. Swallowing is heard. Uterine contractions or increased lochia, during orafter breastfeeding, for the first few days. Mother may feel relaxed or drowsy. Ideas to Help Initiate the Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Reflex When breastfeeding is initiated early, the baby's rooting, sucking and hand movements on the mother's breast are the natural stimuli for letdown. Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Mother feels relaxed, comfortable, and supported. Heat may be applied to her back or shoulders. Initiate breastfeeding before the baby is stresseda nd crying (early feeding cues). Clothe the baby only in a diaper to promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby in a vertical chest-to-chest position to facilitate the baby's normal reflexes and self-attachment behaviours. Mother may massage her breasts. Mother may apply moist or dry heat to her breasts for a fewminutes before or during massage until letdownoccurs. Heat may be applied with a warm, wettowel or wet disposable diaper, a warm bath orshower, a bowl of warm water, a heating pad on lowor a hot water bottle wrapped in a cloth. PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 35 Hand express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Mother may stimulate her nipples by gently rolling them between the thumb and index finger forseveral minutes, or until the letdown reflex occursand breast milk leaks out. Express some breast milk(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). General Principles Letdown or the breast milk ejection reflex is essential to ensure that breast milk moves from the alveoli into the dilated ducts and is available to the baby (How the Breast Works). When breastfeeding is initiated early, the baby is calm and before the baby becomes overly hungry and begins crying, the baby's rooting and sucking are the natural stimuli for letdown (early feeding cues). Letdown or the breast milk ejection reflex is facilitated when the mother is relaxed and stress-free (How the Breast Works). Effective latching, positioning, and sucking are key for successful breastfeeding. A healthy full-term infant sucks, swallows, andbreathes in a rhythmic and co-ordinated manner (Walker, 2011) . The ratio of suck to swallow to breathe becomes1:1:1 as the breastfeeding progresses, when letdownor breast milk ejection occurs and breast milk flows (Genna, 2008) . The sucking rhythm corresponds inversely to theamount of breast milk available (Lauwers et al., 2011) . Infant weight loss and return to birth weight issues are complex. The traditional approach that weight loss must be prevented and controlled is founded on divergent understandings/misunderstandings that may lead to unnecessary supplementation and potentially put breastfeeding at risk ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). A 2008 systematic review found insufficient evidence to determine the normal physiological weight loss for full-term breastfed infants in the first 2 weeks after birth. In fact, it advises against the use of a single absolute number for the maximum weight an infant can lose, as an absolute number does not take ranges or standard deviations from the mean into account. It also cautions that an absolute number may cause health care professionals to miss warning signs (Noel- Weiss et al., 2008) . A recent study further challenges the traditional determination of newborn birth weight and weight loss (Noel-Weiss et al., 2011) . This observational study found that neonates appear to experience diuresis and correct their fluid status in the first 24 hours, and recommends that the initial infant weight be measured at 24 hours, instead of at birth, for a baseline when assessing weight change. The study found evidence that maternal IV fluids during parturition are related to neonatal output and newborn weight loss, but this is not something requiring intervention. They found that further weight loss after 72 hours is not likely connected to maternal fluids. Although many practitioners may have been educated to consider 10% to be an acceptable initial post-birth weight loss, there has been a shift to consider a 7% loss to be the indicator for further and earlier assessment and support for breastfeeding. The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario RNAO Best Practice Guidelines (RNAO, 2002) , the International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA) Evidence-Based Guidelines for Breastfeeding Management during the First Fourteen Days (ILCA, 1999) , and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2005) indicate that families should seek help if weight loss is greater than 7% and/or continues after Day 3. This is consistent with the recommendations found in the Shrago (2006) and Livingstone (2001) studies. There is a range of recommendations for what may be considered an acceptable time in which to recover birth weight. Whereas the RNAO recommends that birth weight should be achieved by 2-3 weeks, the 1999 ILCA guidelines advise that there should be a return to birth weight by 14 days. Recently, ILCA has further revised the above recommendations, such that the baby should lose less than 7% by Day 3, be gaining 20-35 gm ( - 1 oz) a day by Day 5, and regain birth weight by 10 days (ILCA, 2010) . This reflects the understanding that when the healthy term baby is effectively breastfeeding, the initial post-birth weight loss will stabilize quickly, and thereafter reflect a steady weight gain. It is also important to regard the presence of these weight loss indicators as a need for further support to optimize breastfeeding (Macdonald et al., 2003) . Weight gain beyond the first 2 weeks - World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standard Charts (2006) Dietitians of Canada, Canadian Paediatric Society, PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 36the College of Family Physicians of Canada, and Community Health Nurses of Canada recommend the adoption of the Child Growth Standards WHO growth charts in Canada, replacing previous recommendations to use the growth charts from the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards for birth to5 years are recommended because they are based onchildren raised according to current Canadian andinternational health and nutrition recommendations.Breastfed infants were used as the normative modelfor growth and development. These charts illustratethe way all healthy children should grow and areconsidered to be the \"gold standard\" for assessingthe growth of young children. Breastfed infantstend to grow more quickly than non-breastfedinfants in the first 6 months and more slowly inthe second 6 months of life. Since the WHO ChildGrowth Standards charts have been constructedbased on the growth of infants who have beenprimarily breastfed, breastfed infants will no longerappear to be growing too rapidly during the first 6months, nor will they appear to be failing to growsufficiently from 6 - 12 months, (Dietitians of Canada, 2010). G rowth charts can be useful tools to understand how one baby's growth compares to the growthof other babies of the same age, but they can alsoconfuse parents. Growth charts plot a baby's growthon a series of percentile lines. An average childwill be at the 50th percentile for weight and length.A weight that falls at a higher percentile is notnecessarily \"good\" and a weight that falls at a lowerpercentile is not necessarily \"bad\". This is becauseby definition there will be healthy children at everypercentile. The most important point to rememberis that a baby's growth chart should never beconsidered in isolation. One needs to look at howthis one point, i.e., weight compares to the otheron the chart, i.e., length. The baby's growth patternover days, weeks, and months is what provides anaccurate picture of how breastfeeding is going, andif over time the baby's percentile drops, this is asignal to take a closer look (Mohrbacher, 2010) . (See Appendix D and E - WHO Child Growth Standardscharts for girls and boys.) Note regarding infant weight gain: The standard for weight gain for the healthy term infant used in this protocol is adapted from information in the foundational DARLING study Dewey et al. (1992) , as well as from Powers (2001 & 1999) , as cited in many breastfeeding studies and texts. Infant Output as an Indicator of Effective Breastfeeding - An increased number of daily bowel movements during the first 5 days is associated with positive infant outcomes, including less initial weight loss, earlier regaining of birth weight and heavier weight by Day 14. In addition, earlier transition to yellow, seedy stools (normal human breast milk stools) is also associated with the same positive infant outcomes (Shrago et al. 2006) . This is reflected in an expectation that there will be more stools earlier, 3 or more, and up to 6 stools by Day 3. As above, if there are fewer stools or they do not change to soft yellow, seedy stools in the first week, this indicates a need for further early support to optimize breastfeeding. The frequency and colour of urinary output also plays a role in assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding as well as infant hydration status. The output chart indicates that the breastfed baby is getting enough breast milk if he produces at least 1 heavy wet diaper on Day 1, increasing by a diaper per day until Day 6, when there should be at least 6 heavy wet diapers with pale yellow or clear urine. A heavy wet diaper feels like at least 2 tablespoons or 30 ml of water poured on a dry diaper (Wilson-Clay, 2008) . Urine becomes progressively darker in colour as a baby becomes dehydrated. In addition, the presence of urate or uric acid crystals in the diaper is a signal for further assessment. Uric acid crystals appear as pink, orange or brick-red dust staining the diaper, and may be mistaken for pseudo menses. This may be within normal expectations or it may reflect concentrated urine. Within the first 1-3 days, the presence of crystals is generally not significant (Lauwers, 2011) , due to the high load of urate excreted by neonates. However, Passmore suggested that the large load excreted is facilitated by the concentration of urine (Passmore et al., 1974) . High basal excretion of uric acid may increase risk of nephropathy (Stapleton, 1983) . Further assessment and support are indicated to optimize breastfeeding and breast milk intake. The Suck Cycle: With a wide-open mouth and tongue down, the infant takes the elastic tissue of the nipple, theareola and the surrounding breast tissue deep into PROTOCOL REVISEDBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 37its mouth, taking in more of the lower areola. This forms a \"teat\" that fills the infant's mouth. The pharynx is open for respiration. The infant's lips are flanged out and together withthe cheeks form a seal. The tip of the infant's tongue stays over the gumbehind the lower lip. The rest of the anterior tonguecups the areola of the mother's breast. The jaw initially stabilizes the tongue in an upwardposition. As the jaw drops, the mid to posterior portion of thetongue is lowered. Decreasing negative pressure (increase in vacuum)is applied to the nipple and soft palate without anaccentuated peristaltic motion (Geddes et al., 2008). The nipple elongates and is drawn back towards thejunction of the infant's hard and soft palate. The vacuum draws a bolus of breast milk to fill theoral space between the nipple and soft palate. The tongue then rises towards the palate, thevacuum decreases as negative pressure increasesand a bolus of breast milk is moved into thepharynx, stimulating the swallow reflex. Theremay be a pause in sucks and breaths as the infantswallows the breast milk. The infant lowers its jaw and a new cycle begins ofsuck, pause, and swallow. When the flow of breast milk decreases there willbe increased bursts of sucking. This may occurmore frequently in the early days because thevolume of colostrum is so small (Riordan et 1986) . Nutritive vs. Non-nutritive Sucking: Nutritive sucking promotes the transfer of breast milk. Non-nutritive sucking promotes little or no breastmilk transfer but is significant as it: Stimulates the nipple and areola, triggeringthe release of prolactin and oxytocin, initiatingletdown and flow of breast milk. Increases gastrointestinal peristalsis. Increases the secretion of digestive fluids. Decreases crying; increases calm and comfortfor the infant (Riordan et al., 2010).

Sore nipples may have one or more underlying causes that may be mother and/or baby related. The most common cause of sore nipples is the way the baby is positioned and latched. Observation and Assessment Assess the pain and appearance of the mother's nipples: Nipples feel sore, painful, burning and/or itchy. Nipples that appear to be abnormally pink or red, bruised, blistered, cracked, shiny, flaky and/orbleeding. Discharge from cracks or sores on the mother'snipple. A white blister or \"bleb\" at the opening of one ofthe ducts on the mother's nipples (Protocol #6:Plugged Ducts ). Timing of the pain. Nipple pain may decreaseafter the initial latch or may persist throughout thebreastfeeding and between breastfeedings. Nipples that appear blanched and are painful afterbreastfeeding. Location of the nipple pain. Possible Causes or Contributing Factors Assess the mother for possible causes: Ineffective positioning and latching techniques (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Poor latching or tongue thrusting may result insoreness on the top or tip of the nipple. A shallow latch places the baby's tongue forward inthe mouth, leading to friction as the nipple tip rubsthe hard palate. Poor timing, i.e., not following the infant's cues, may delay breastfeedings so that the mother hurrieslatching before the infant is ready. Ineffective hand positioning may also result insoreness on the underside of the nipple. The position of the mother' s hands on her breastmay tip her nipple so that the infant \"strokes\" the underside of the mother's breast with its tongue. Ineffective positioning of the baby. Baby is not facing the mother's breast and has to turn his head to swallow. Baby's nose is not approaching the mother' s nipple and the baby is unable to tilt his head back to latchinstinctively. Engorged breast ( Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples ). Taking the baby off her breast before the baby isready . Incorrect or excessive use of breast pumps, e.g., notcentering the pump flange over her nipple or usinga high suction setting on engorged breasts (Protocol#19: Expressing and Storing Br east Milk ). Wet breast pads or pads with a plastic lining. Use of poorly ventilated breast shells. Detergent residue on bra or clothing. Menstruation or pregnancy (nipples may becomesensitive). Extremely sensitive nipples. Sensitivity to and/or eczema, impetigo, the mother that theseneed to be assessed and treated medically. Candidiasis, mastitis, or other infections. Advise themother that these need to be assessed and treatedmedically. A white blister or bleb at the opening of her nipple (Pr otocol #6: Plugged Ducts ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 40 Nipple vasospasm (i.e., when the baby comes off her breast, the mother's nipple is blanched andthere is a burning pain). After several minutes thenipple returns to its normal colour and the burningsensation changes to a throbbing pain. Furtherassessment is needed to determine if the cause ispossibly thrush or Raynaud' s phenomenon. Assess the baby for possible causes: Ineffective suck (Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck) . A very aggressive, strong suck that may feel like biting. This may be associated with hypertonicity. Short frenulum, i.e., tongue-tie (Pr otocol #9: Breast DifficultyAchieving Maintaining aLatch and Pr otocol #10: Ineffective Suck) . May result in soreness on top of mother's nipple. High, arched palate or cleft palate. Candidiasis (Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush)). Receding chin. artificial devices, e.g.,bottle nipples, soothers, improperly sized nippleshields. Teething and biting down on the mother's breast byan older baby. Suggestions 1.Explore the possible cause(s) of nipple soreness (see previous section on Possible Causes or Contributing Factors). Begin with positioning and latching, refer to Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching . For dysfunctional sucking or a short frenulum, referto Pr otocol #10: Ineffective Suck otocol engorged breasts, refer to Pr otocol #5: Engorgement. For a white blister or bleb at the opening of themother 's nipple, refer to Protocol #6: Plugged Ducts . For flat or inverted nipples, refer to Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples . 2.Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with sore nipples.Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Ensure that the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex is initiated. The mother can try the followingmethods to initiate letdown: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Mother feels relaxed, comfortable and supported. Heat may be applied to her back orshoulders. I nitiate breastfeeding early, before the baby isstressed and crying (see early feeding cues in Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). Clothe the baby only in a diaper to promoteskin-to-skin contact. Support the baby in a vertical chest-to-chest position to facilitate the baby's normal reflexesand self-attachment behaviours. The mother can gently massage her breasts. Mother may apply moist or dry heat to herbreasts for a few minutes before or duringmassage until letdown occurs. Heat may beapplied with a warm, wet towel or disposablediaper, a warm bath or shower , a bowl of warm water, a heating pad on low or a hot waterbottle wrapped in a cloth. Hand express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). The mother may stimulate her nipples, gently rolling them between the thumb and indexfinger for several minutes or until the letdownreflex occurs and breast milk leaks out. Expresssome breast milk ( Pr otocol# 19: Expressing and Storing Br east Milk ). Breastfeed on the pain-free side first until letdownoccurs, then switch to the sore side. Numb the nipple just before latching by applyingice wrapped in a cloth on the sore nipple for a fewseconds. Avoid prolonged exposure to the ice as thiscan inhibit the letdown reflex or damage the nipple. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Support the baby in a chest-to-chest position to facilitate normal infant reflexes and self-attachmentbehaviours. Try a different position for each breastfeeding to avoid placing pressure on the same area ofthe breast all of the time. The football or cross-Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 41cradle position may be more comfortable, as these positions allow for maximum control of a baby who is learning or has difficulty latching (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching). Assess that the baby is effectively sucking andswallowing throughout the breastfeeding (seeProtocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Use breast compressions if the infant is noteffectively sucking and swallowing (see Protocol #5: Engorgement, for a description of breast compressions). Allow the baby to continue breastfeeding untilfinished. Do not limit breastfeedings to preventnipple soreness. A void pulling the baby off her breast. If the mother wants to end the breastfeeding before the baby isfinished, she can break the suction by trying one ofthe following methods: Press down on her breast near the infant'smouth. Gently insert a finger into the corner of theinfant's mouth. Gently pull down on the infant's chin. Bring the baby in closer to her breast so that thenose is covered briefly with breast tissue; thismay be more effective for an older baby . After breastfeeding, suggest the mother: Express some breast milk onto her nipples and areolae after each breastfeeding if there are no signsof tissue trauma. Let the breast milk dry beforeputting on a bra; this is not recommended in thecase of nipple trauma or candidiasis, as the yeastCandida albicans thrives in breast milk. Apply saline compresses to her nipple and areola.As above, allow the area to dry before putting on abra. W ear a breast shell with good ventilation and a wide base under the bra if contact from the bra orclothing on her nipple is too painful (see General Principles below). Wear a well-fitted bra that is not too tight. Avoidbras with underwire. Use nursing pads that have no plastic lining. If the pad is stuck on her nipple, moisten the pad withwater before removing it. Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of nipple creams, gels, or ointments, ifshe inquires about using them for sore nipples. Offerfurther assessment and refer for further support asneeded (see notes in General Principles). Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of nipple shields if she inquires about using a them for sore nipples. Offer furtherassessment and refer for further support as needed(see notes in General Principles). W ash her nipples once a day during her usual bath or shower, but not before or after each breastfeeding. If there are skin breaks, cracks or fissures, wash her nipples once a day with warm, soapy water and rinse well. 3.If breastfeeding is painful and the mother decides to partially supplement, encourage her to: Alternate breastfeeding with feeding expressed breast milk using an alternative feeding method,e.g., cup, spoon, syringe, or finger feeding (Pr otocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). When the baby is not feeding at her breast, themother should be encouraged to express somebreast milk from her breasts frequently - at least8 or more times in 24 hours - in order to maintainher breast milk supply ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). The expressed breast milk can be used to feed the baby . If expressed breast milk is not available an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). 4.Refer the mother to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic for further support if: The mother needs further assessment to determine the cause of pain. Nipple trauma is so severe that the mother cannotcontinue breastfeeding and temporarily stops toallow her nipple time to heal. It will usually healvery quickly. The problem is not resolving and the mother isconsidering stopping breastfeeding. General Principles In the first week mothers may feel some nipple tenderness, particularly at the start of breastfeeding. The discomfort may be related to the initial grasping Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 42of her nipple and stretching of the ducts as they fill with breast milk ( Lawrence, 2011 ). This tenderness may startle a new mother, but should improve daily. Sore nipples are one of the leading causes for women to cease breastfeeding. Therefore it is imperative to identify the cause of soreness. Ineffective positioning and latching are the two most common causes of sore nipples, and should always be assessed first ( Tait, 2000 ). Direct observation is important for assessment. Nipple pain is not related to the length and/or frequency of breastfeeding, or to hair and/or skin colour. Nipple pain is also not prevented by prenatal nipple preparation, nipple exercises or use of breast shells ( Lawrence, 2011, Enkin, 2000 ), although there is evidence to support the value of prenatal preparation, including education and breast examination. Limiting the length of breastfeedings will not prevent nipple soreness. It will only delay soreness. Shortened breastfeedings can prevent the infant from receiving sufficient breast milk, particularly hindmilk. In order to shorten a breastfeeding the mother would likely remove the infant from her breast, possibly causing further nipple trauma ( Riordan et al., 2010 ). It is neither recommended nor necessary to discontinue breastfeeding to promote healing of a cracked or bleeding nipple unless the pain is intolerable or the trauma is worsening ( Riordan et al., 2010). Rapid healing usually occurs once the problem is corrected. Any temporary discontinuation must be accompanied by ongoing assessment and plans for re-establishment of feeding at the mother's breast. It is important that the mother continue to remove breast milk by expression ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). If the infant is unable to feed at the mother's breast, breast milk may be fed by spoon, cup, or dropper (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Swallowed blood from damaged nipples will notharm the baby but the cause of the cracked nipplesneeds to be investigated. A bleb or milk blister, a white dot or bump on thenipple, is an accumulation of milk solids that blocksthe breast milk from flowing. It may be painfulwhen the baby latches onto the mother's breast(Protocol #6: Plugged Ducts ). A blister on the mother's nipple may be caused byfriction when her nipple rubs against the baby's hard palate, as a result of ineffective positioning, latching, and sucking. It may contain breast milk products. Stages of Nipple Trauma - Mohrbacher has developed a four-stage system for rating nipple trauma to standardize the reporting and management of nipple trauma ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). It is included in several of the current texts ( Lauwers & Swisher, 2011; Wilson-Clay et al., 2008 and Walker, 2011 ). Stage I - Superficial Intact: Pain or irritation with no skin breakdown. May include redness, bruising, red spots, swelling. Stage II - Superficial with Tissue Breakdown: May include pain with possible abrasion, shallow crack or fissure, compression stripe, hematoma, and shallow ulceration. Stage III - Partial Thickness Erosion: Skin breakdown with destruction of epidermis to lower layers of dermis. May include deep fissure, blister, and deep ulceration with more advanced ulceration. Stage IV - Full Thickness Erosion: Deeper damage through the dermis. May include full erosion of some parts of the dermis. Management - The best management of nipple trauma is prevention, education and anticipatory guidance to promote effective positioning and latching (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching). To date, systematic reviews of evidence have yet to determine definitive management of sore nipples, after comparing application of expressed breast milk, lanolin, petroleum jelly, peppermint oil, glycerine gel, ointments, tea bags, antibiotics, antifungals, warm water compresses, hydrogel dressings, polyethylene film, nipple shields, or breast shells. A protocol has been developed by a joint Canadian-British group, but results have yet to be published ( Dennis et al., 2009). Removing the cause and facilitating healing is the appropriate treatment for sore nipples ( Lawrence, 2011). An individual risk/benefit assessment should be conducted before initiating therapy. Moist Wound Healing - A moisture barrier covers the wound to promote healing by preventingevaporation and drying. Moist wound healing is ashift in practice from dry wound healing. Cracksor fissures in the nipple result from insufficientmoisture in the corpus stratum of the dermis,together with friction. Rapid drying, as in dryBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 43wound healing, causes the stratum to shrink in an irregular manner, increasing tension on any new tissue, causing further cracking and drying. The moisture barrier may be an emollient, occlusive or semi-occlusive dressing, but does not include oil or petroleum products, warm compresses or wet or soiled breast pads. For further information see Walker ( 2011) and Lawrence ( 2011). Expressed breast milk (EBM), sometimes recommended for Stage I nipple trauma as an alternative to nipple creams or ointments, is readily available, free and has antibacterial properties, but is not appropriate if there is broken skin, as EBM dries quickly and does not provide moist wound healing ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Breast milk has bacteriostatic properties. These include secretory antibodies such as SIgA, IgE, and IgM, against specific pathogens, fatty acids and lactoferrin that provide broad spectrum protection, and glyco-conjugates and oligosaccarides that protect against one or more specific pathogens ( Newburg et al., 1998 ; Riordan, 2010 ). Saline compresses applied to the nipple and areola are recommended by some practitioners. Although noevidence has been identified to support this practice specifically for breastfeeding, saline is widely used in wound management, is readily available and unlikely to harm mother or infant. Some mothers may prefer to soak their breasts in a warm saline solution (5 ml salt in 250 cc water). As above, allow the area to dry before putting on a bra. Warm water compresses to prevent sore nipples were recommended in an earlier systematic review ( Page et al., 2003 ). Allow the area to dry before putting on a bra. Nipple Creams, Gels, and Ointments (Emollients) - There are a variety of nipple creams and ointmentson the market. Some women may find comfort byapplying these products. Artificial lubricants areusually unnecessary as lubrication from the glands inthe areolar skin keeps a nipple soft and pliable unlessthe natural lubrication has been disturbed. Someproducts may be used to promote moist healing byproviding a moisture barrier to cover the mother'snipple and areola, preventing evaporation and drying.However, there is little scientific evidence to supportuse of these products over prevention to relieve sorenipples ( Morland-Schultz et al. 2005 ). Mothers need to be cautious in deciding whether to use nipple creamsor ointments. There is limited scientific evidence to establish standardized dosages and application or determine the efficacy and possible side effects for both the mother and baby. Specific allergies such as an allergy to wool would preclude the use of lanolin ointment for some women. Creams, gels, and ointments may interfere with normal lubrication or cause contact dermatitis. Local anaesthetics may cause allergies, and interfere with letdown. The initiation and management of the following products should only be by a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. Purified anhydrous lanolin is purported to promote moist healing. Suggested as an option for Stage I and II nippletrauma ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Low-strength antibiotics may be applied to breaksin the skin to prevent mastitis. The evidence doesnot support the use of antibiotic ointments withoutsigns of a portal of entry for infection (crack,trauma). Local application to the nipples is unlikelyto be a risk to the infant as little is transferred tobreast milk from topical application ( Kristensen in Hale et al., 2007 ). \u00b0 An option for Stage I, II and III. Low-strength topical steroids may be used forinflammation. \u00b0 An option for Stage I, II and III. Hydrogels, either glycerin-based or water-based,may be applied in a dressing to sore nipples. An option for any stage of nipple trauma. A compounded ointment developed by Canadianpaediatrician Dr. Jack Newman, known as all-purpose nipple ointment (APNO), contains anantibiotic, steroid, and antifungal agent ( Newman, 2009). It is commonly recommended but not yet researched ( Mohrbacher, 2010; Lauwers & Swisher, 2011 ). Although Mohrbacher suggests it may be an optionfor Stage I, II and III nipple trauma ( Mohrbacher, 2011), dermatologists rarely use a cream with multiple active ingredients because \"the bad effectsoften outweigh the good\" ( Lawrence, 2010 ), and it is difficult to determine the source of a negativereaction. Nipple Shields - If a mother inquires about using a nipple shield to relieve sore nipples, it is important to Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 44first explore with her any possible underlying causes of sore nipples. It is also important to inquire about her current breastfeeding management practices and attempts to manage her sore nipples, and then to offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding management (see earlier discussion regarding management of sore nipples). A nipple shield is an artificial nipple and areola shaped like a floppy sun hat and made of a synthetic material like silicone. Some women may have success placing one of the newer ultra-thin silicone nipple shields over the breast to facilitate latching and sucking. This has the potential to stimulate the baby's hard palate and thereby elicit the sucking reflex. It may be a familiar stimulus to coax a baby to the mother's breast who has already imprinted preferentially on the supernormal stimulus of an artificial nipple ( Wilson-Clay et al., 2008 ). Although not the first strategy recommended to manage sore nipples, short-term use of the newer ultra-thin silicone shields has been positively associated with preserving the breastfeeding relationship while mother and baby learn to breastfeed ( Meier et al., 2000; Wilson-Clay, 1996 ). Although a recent review of the literature reported that the current evidence does not yet demonstrate safe practices for the use of nipple shields ( McKechnie et al., 2010 ), expert practitioners continue to report the use of nipple shields as a possible strategy to bring a baby to the mother's breast who might otherwise refuse her breast. Reasons for refusal may include flat or inverted nipples, prematurity, neuromuscular issues and/or imprinting ( Protocol #8 Flat or Inverted Nipples; Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or Difficulty Achieving or Maintaining a Latch; Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Nipple shields may provide temporary relief for a mother who is stressed or overwhelmed and prevent the introduction of a bottle, if she is supported appropriately by a lactation expert ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Some mothers may wish to use nipple shields for longer periods; these dyads should be periodically reassessed. Lawrence advises against the use of a makeshift shield. Historically. there has been mixed evidence reported about nipple shields. Use of the older rubber or latex shields was associated with concerns about inadequate intake of breast milk that resulted in slow weight gain or failure to thrive ( Woolridge, 1980 ). Recent evidence has demonstrated infant weight gain to be similar over 2 months in babies fed with shields compared to babies fed without shields ( Chertock, 2009 ). To apply a nipple shield, it is important to use the correct fit and size. If the teat is too long for the baby's mouth it can cause gagging, but if it is too small it may not stimulate active sucking ( Mohrbacher, 2010). The teat opening needs to be large enough to accommodate the mother's nipple comfortably; if it is too small it can slow the flow of breast milk, which is counterproductive. Lauwers recommends starting with the smallest shield that accommodates both the baby's mouth and the mother's nipple. Wilson-Clay advises matching the shield size to the baby's mouth, and selecting the shortest available teat with the smallest base diameter ( 2008). Clinicians and mothers may try varying methods to directly apply the shield. In one, the mother holds the rim of the shield between her thumb and fingers. Stretching the shield at the junction of the \"nipple\" and \"areola\", she places the stretched shield over her nipple and releases the tension. As the stretch releases and the shield returns to its normal shape, it draws the mother's nipple into the nipple cavity of the shield before the baby begins to suck. Some mothers may turn the top half of the shield inside out before placing it over the nipple. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions related to care and cleaning of the nipple shield. (For further information see Wilson-Clay, 2008, Lauwers, 2011, and Genna, 2008.) Nipple shields should not be the first strategy attempted to manage sore nipples and they should only be initiated by a health care provider who has the breastfeeding expertise to thoroughly assess the potential effectiveness and risks of use for that breastfeeding dyad. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. Practitioners who do not have the capacity, i.e., lactation expertise or time, to continue to support the breastfeeding dyad appropriately should refer the mother to a lactation expert or breastfeeding clinic. The baby's weight gain and the mother's breast milk supply need to be monitored closely. There must be a comprehensive plan that includes periodic reassessment of the breastfeeding and the infant's intake of breast milk, plus a plan for re-establishment of feeding at the mother's breast. Imprinting - The concept of imprinting or \"stamping\" is sometimes used to explain the observation of nipple preference. Imprinting is drawn Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 45from other sciences such as biology and psychology, where it has been applied to explain attachment behaviours and brain pathway development. In humans, imprinting is oral/tactile ( Lawrence, 2011 ) and Gale Mobbs ( 1989) has identified the mouth as the most significant factor in impringing in humans. When babies are exposed to artificial nipples or fingers early they can become accustomed to the feeling of that particular object (bottle nipple, pacifier, finger) in their mouths and have difficulty accepting another object, such as a mother's nipple, in its place ( Righard, 1997 ). Breast Shells - Plastic breast shells may be worn inside the bra over the mother's nipple and areola. Women may wear them to improve nipple protractility by placing gentle pressure on the areola, which stretches and pushes the nipple forward (Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples ). They may be worn with effect in the early weeks of breastfeeding, but prenatal use has been found to be ineffective ( Alexander et al., 1992; MAIN, 1994 ). They may also be worn to protect the tender nipple and areola from rubbing on a bra or clothing. Some mothers may use them to relieve engorgement, when worn about 20 minutes before breastfeedings. The bra size should be bigger than the shell to avoid placing too much pressure on the delicate breasttissue. Shells should have multiple openings for aircirculation to keep the skin from becoming softenedor chapped. Although previously used to collectleaking breast milk and protect clothing, any breastmilk collected should be discarded due to potentialhigh bacterial counts. Ankyloglossia (Tongue-Tie) - A short or tight lingual frenulum may restrict infant tongue movement and may lead to breastfeeding difficulties. Although it may sometimes be associated with speech difficulties, the effect on speech has not been clearly defined ( Lalakea et al., 2003 ). There are many variations in degree of tightness, amount, and type of movement. Coryllos describes four types of tongue-tie ranging from the frenulum attached to the tongue tip; attached behind the tongue tip at the alveolar ridge; attached to the mid-tongue and mid-floor of the mouth; and attached at the back of the tongue ( Coryllos et al., 2004 ). There may be a congenital association. Difficulties that may arise with Ankyloglossia: There may be difficulty achieving a deep latchif the baby's tongue is unable to reach back towards the soft palate junction. The mother may experience nipple pain anddamage if the tip of the baby's tongue rubs thehard palate and/or if there is reflexive biting. There may also be breast refusal and difficultymaintaining the latch. If the tongue has difficulty cupping themother's breast, the infant may have difficultymanaging the bolus of breast milk, putting theinfant at risk of insufficient breast milk intakeand poor weight gain. Management of ankyloglossia is not straightforward. Disagreement may occur among health care providers regarding the management of ankyloglossia as there are many ways to describe and define this condition. In addition to Coryllos above, Walker includes descriptions of several assessment and management approaches (Walker, 2011). Conservative management may be possible for breastfeeding with tongue-tie, depending on the degree of tongue movement and pain, through offering assessment and support to facilitate optimal positioning ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). If the mother feels unable to continue breastfeeding due to persistent pain, and/or if the baby is at risk of insufficient breast milk intake and poor weight gain related to breast refusal or difficulty latching, a frenotomy, or surgical \"clipping\" or \"snipping\" to release the frenulum, may be considered to relieve pain, and facilitate effective latching and breastfeeding. Geddes et al. reported less nipple compression post-frenotomy, associated with improved breastfeeding outcomes, better latching and breast milk transfer, and less maternal pain ( Geddes et al., 2008 ). Refer to a primary health care provider for further assessment. Not all cases of ankyloglossia will be assessed as appropriate for frenotomy, depending on the degree of tongue movement, infant well-being and breastfeeding difficulty, as well as access to a paediatrician who performs frenotomies ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching; Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch; Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck; Protocol #12: Insufficient B east Milk Supply). Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 46Vasospasm/Raynaud's Phenomenon - Mothers report intense pain, stinging, tingling, burning or numbness persisting after breastfeeding. A triphasic or biphasic colour change may occur; the nipple appears blanched after the breastfeeding, and turns blue and/or red before returning to its normal colour. Offer assessment and support to optimize effective positioning and latching. Suggest that the mother avoid temperatureextremes. Some mothers apply a warm compressimmediately after breastfeeding, letting it cool onher breast, to facilitate temperature transition. Refer to a primary health care provider for furtherassessment and possible treatment. Hand Hygiene and Routine Practices Gloves are rarely needed for breastfeeding support. The Baby-Friendly Initiative recommends that most teaching and breastfeeding support should be done in a hand s-off manner. As the goal is for mothers to be able to latch their babies independently, it is important for staff to request permission before touching the mother or baby and to take a hands-off approach as much as possible. A hands-on approach is only used after asking permission and when additional help is deemed necessary ( BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011).Practitioners should follow routine practices (previously universal precautions), which incl ude the appropriate use of gloves and practicing hand hygiene ( TPH, 2006 ), when in contact with body fluids, excretions, secretions, non-intact skin, mucous membranes, or an undiagnosed rash. If the practitioner does handle breast milk, then gloves should be worn ( APIC, 2005 ). In addition, if the practitioner handles breast tissue that is not intact, such as cracked or bleeding nipples, gloves should be worn. Hands should be cleaned before donning gloves and after removing gloves. It is difficult to ensure the absence of occult blood from breast milk. Similarly, it is difficult to ensure the skin integrity of the practitioner's hand. This is a change in practice from earlier recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which previously had not listed human breast milk as a body fluid requiring special handling precautions ( CDC, 2005 ), based on the fact that occupational exposure to human breast milk has not been shown to lead to transmission of HIV , HBV , or HCV .

Breast fullness differs from engorgement in the following ways:Engorgement may have one or more underlying causes that may be mother or baby related. Observation and Assessment Breast Fullness (a normal condition) Breast Engorgement (an abnormal condition) Assess the mother for: Breast fullness, heaviness, and some tenderness that begins when the breast milkvolume increases 2-4 days after birth. Breasts that feel soft when pressed(compressible). Absence of breast pain or fever.Assess the mother for: Breasts and/or areolae that feel hard beginning 3-6 days after birth or at other times when a mother's breasts are not effectively emptied. Breasts that are not compressible. Generalized breast tightness and pain. Breasts that appear flushed. A low-grade fever. Hands and arms that may be numb and tingling if engorgement is severe. Assess the baby for: Breast refusal or difficulty achieving a latch (Protocol #9: Br east Refusal or Difficulty Achieving or Maintaining a Latch ). Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Engorgement may have one or more underlying causes that may be mother and/or baby related. Assess the mother for: Poor positioning and latching techniques ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Use of supplements and pacifiers. Restricting the frequency and length of breastfeedings. T emporarily stopping breastfeeding without expressing for the missed breastfeedings -including separation of mother and baby. W eaning abruptly. Underlying abnormal breast pathology, e.g., non-patent breast milk ducts. Stress. Fatigue. Assess the baby for: Ineffective suck ( Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Medical conditions, e.g., jaundice. Use of pacifiers (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). Suggestions \"The best management of engorgement is prevention.\" (Lawrence, 2011) Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 491.Determine the possible cause(s) of the engorgement (see previous section on \"Possible Causes\"). Assess first for ineffective positioning and latching (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Assess for infrequent or delayed breastfeedings. For an ineffective suck, refer to Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck . 2.Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with engorged breasts. Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Breastfeed early, frequently, and without restriction to promote optimal breast milk removal. Hold her baby skin-to-skin frequently. Soften the areola and ensure that the letdown orbreast milk ejection reflex is initiated. The baby'srooting, sucking and hand movements on themother's breast are the natural stimuli for letdownwhen breastfeeding is initiated early and the babyis calm, before the baby gets overly hungry andbegins crying (Protocol #3: Signs of EffectiveBreastfeeding ). A mother can try the following ideas to initiate letdown: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Use relaxation strategies - such as a warm shower, heat applied to the mother's back and shoulders,relaxation breathing, a warm drink, supportivepositions. Manage pain to support comfort and relaxation andfacilitate breast milk letdown. Initiate breastfeeding before the baby is stressedand crying. Clothe the baby in a diaper only to promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby's head higher than tummy in achest-to-chest position, with nose approaching themother's nipple to facilitate the normal neonatalreflexes and self-attachment behaviours. Gently massage her breasts. Stimulate her nipples. Gently roll her nipplesbetween the thumb and index finger for severalminutes or until the letdown reflex occurs andbreast milk leaks. Express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Apply heat to her back or shoulders for a fewminutes before or during massage until letdownoccurs. Some mothers may wish to apply heat totheir breasts - see discussion regarding applicationof heat for engorgement in General Principles . Moist or dry heat may be applied with a warm, wettowel or disposable diaper, a warm bath or shower,a bowl of warm water, a heating pad on low, or awater bottle wrapped in a cloth. Or alternatively, some women prefer to: Apply a cool cloth to their breasts for a few minutes. Try cold compresses or diapers, gel packs,frozen wet towels or frozen vegetable packs,wrapped in a cloth. Limit direct exposure to cold toprevent tissue trauma such as frostbite. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Assess that the baby is effectively positioned and latched (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Assess that the baby is effectively sucking andswallowing (Protocol #3: Signs of EffectiveBreastfeeding ). Use breast compressions during breastfeeding if thebaby is not effectively sucking and swallowing or ifher breast is not softening. Breast compressions willincrease the breast milk transfer and encourage thebaby to suck effectively. To use breast compression, encourage the mother to: Support the base or middle of her breast using the \"C\" or \"U\" hold (see diagram). Compress her breast when the baby's suckingbecomes less effective, e.g., no more \"deep andslow\" sucks (Protocol #3: Signs of EffectiveBreastfeeding ). Hold the compression but do not press so hard thatit hurts. Release the compression when the baby pauses andswallows or is no longer effectively sucking, e.g.,no more \"deep and slow\" sucks. Most babies willstop sucking completely when the compression isreleased and will resume sucking again shortly. If the baby does not resume effective sucking, waita while before compressing again. Rotate the position of her hand on all areas of herBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 50breast to ensure that all of the breast milk ducts are compressed. Continue with breast compressions until the babyis no longer sucking effectively when her breast isbeing compressed. Offer the other breast using breast compressionas needed. Breast Compression Using the \"C\" Hold After breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Express some breast milk for comfort if her breasts are still hard and full, even if the baby has breastfedeffectively and is satisfied. Both breasts should feelsignificantly softer after breastfeeding and/or breastmilk expression ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Apply cold to the softened breasts for a few minutesafter breastfeeding to provide comfort and reduceswelling. Limit direct exposure to cold to avoidtissue trauma such as frostbite. Try one of thefollowing methods: A cool wet towel or cloth. A cold gel pack wrapped in a dry towel. Another practice sometimes suggested when optimal breastfeeding management isn't enough: Cabbage Leaves - Some mothers find the use of green cabbage leaves to be helpful for increasingtheir comfort and reducing engorgement. Caution:This has not been scientifically proven. In addition,due to the possible risk of listeriosis, this may notbe an appropriate option for mothers or infantswho are immunocompromised (see notes below in General Principles). If cabbage leaves are being used: Wash hands well before and after handlingcabbage leaves. Separate raw, green* cabbage leaves and rinsewell with running, drinkable water. Slice off any large veins and cut a hole for themother's nipple. Place the leaves directly on her breasts (not hernipples), and wear them inside a bra. When the leaves wilt, usually between 2-4hours, replace them with fresh leaves. Discontinue using the leaves once theengorgement is relieved. Overuse may decreasethe breast milk supply. Many mothers reportsome relief from engorgement within 8 hours ofapplication. * Green cabbage is suggested because purple cabbage leaves can stain skin and clothing. Strategies to prevent engorgement: Observe the baby for early feeding cues to be able to breastfeed early and frequently: when the baby is showing early feeding cues,e.g., rapid eye movements under the eyelids asthe baby begins to wake, sucking/licking, handsto mouth, increased body movements, andmaking small sounds. before the baby is overly hungry or crying. when the mother's breasts becomeuncomfortable or full. at least 8 times in 24 hours, including overnight,until her breasts are no longer engorged. Wear a supportive and well-fitting bra. Avoid braswith underwires. Use analgesics as needed, e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen. To inquire about the use of acetylsalicylic acid, or a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. Feed the baby only breast milk. Avoidsupplementation unless medically indicated(Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation orBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 51Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Avoid the use of pacifiers and bottles. If the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively, encourage the mother to: Gently express each breast, until her breasts are soft, each time the baby has been unable tobreastfeed effectively. Hand expression is suggestedas the mother is less likely to remove enough breastmilk to trigger increased breast milk production. Ifbreastfeeding is stopped for any length of time themother will need to express each breast 8 times ormore in 24 hours, including overnight, as long asher breasts are engorged. The mother should also express if her breasts become uncomfortable or full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Br east Milk ). Soften the areolae before breastfeeding andinitiate the letdown reflex by using one of thefollowing techniques: Gently massage her breasts while applying wetor dry heat to the back or shoulders until theletdown reflex occurs. Some mothers may wishto apply heat to their breasts. - Wet or dry heat includes a warm, wet towel or disposable diaper, a warm bath orshower, a bowl of warm water, a heatingpad, or a hot water bottle. Then, gentlyexpress some breast milk until the areolaeare soft (Pr otocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Gently roll her nipples between her index finger and thumb for a few minutes or until the letdownreflex occurs. Then gently express some breastmilk until the areolae are soft (Protocol #19:Expressing and Storing Breast Milk). If necessary, feed the baby with the expressed breast milk using an alternative feeding method, e.g.,cup, spoon, syringe, finger feeding ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). If expressed breast milk is not available then an appropriate supplementshould be of fered (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Referral to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeedingclinic for further assessment as soon as possible isrecommended.General Principles Prevention is key to managing engorgement. Fundamental to preventing engorgement is: Early initiation of breastfeeding. Frequent and unrestricted breastfeeding. Effective removal of breast milk from the mother's breasts. Effective positioning and latching practices. Not supplementing unless medically indicated. Breast Fullness - Breast fullness is part of the normal physiological process of breast milk production. The mother's breasts usually become fuller between the second to fourth day after birth. A normal full breast will feel heavier and warmer, and may be uncomfortable. For most women this is a reassuring sign that their \"milk has come in\". Breast fullness does not interfere with breastfeeding. Breast fullness normally occurs during the initial period of rapid breast milk production. It is due to increased vascular supply and postpartum hormonal shifts following the removal of the placenta (see How the Br east Works regarding Lactogenesis II). It will gradually decrease within 2-3 weeks when the baby is breastfeeding well. When breast fullness subsides, the mother 's breasts will continue to produce plenty of breast milk despite feeling much softer and flatter. If the mother's breasts are not adequately and regularly emptied, breast fullness can lead to engorgement at any time during lactation. Breast Engorgement - Breast engorgement is considered to be abnormal in this resource; the mother's breasts become overfull due to failure to remove breast milk effectively or frequently enough ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). There may be a range of difficulties or pathology in the physiological process. Giuliani identifies three basic components of breast engorgement: accumulation of breast milk, congestion caused by increased vascularization, and edema caused by congestion and obstruction of lymphatic drainage ( Giuliani, 2004 ). The engorged breast feels hot, tender, swollen, and painful. Engorgement may be the result of the mismanagement of breastfeeding and may be a reason for early weaning ( Riordan, 2010 ) (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 52For some women, the production of breast milk may initially exceed the infant's requirements. Engorgement is a result of increased breast milk stasis together with increased blood flow to the mother's breasts. If the excess breast milk is not removed, the alveolar space may become over-distended, exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues, impeding lymph fluid drainage and leading to edema. Engorgement may be areolar engorgement, involving only the areola, and/or peripheral engorgement, involving the surrounding breast tissue, possibly including the ducts located in the axilla. Mothers with smaller breasts have less storage capacity ( Daly & Hartmann, 1995 ) and have been observed to experience greater frequency of engorgement ( Robson, 1990). This does not impede their ability to breastfeed successfully when managed effectively. Engorgement can make it difficult for the baby to latch on the mother's breast, especially if the areola is hard and non-compressible. Unrelieved engorgement may cause mother's breast milk supply to decrease. Poorly managed engorgement may lead to complications such as: difficulty with latching sore nipples decreased breast milk intake by baby decreased breast milk supply breast milk-producing cells (alveoli) being destroyed breast milk stasis plugged ducts mastitis, and decreased maternal motivation to continuebreastfeeding related to pain. Patterns of Engorgement - The experience of breast engorgement is not the same for every breastfeeding woman ( Humeniuk et al., 1994 ). It may be mild, or it may be severe. It may peak early or as late as Day 14 postpartum; it may also occur at a later time due to missed breastfeedings or weaning too abruptly. There may be a single peak or multiple peaks. Humeniuk et al. ( 1994) identified four patterns of early engorgement, the most common being a gradual intense peak followed by a gradual cessation of engorgement. For multiparas it may occur earlier, for shorter periods, and with less intensity because their \"milk comes in\" earlier ( Lawrence, 2011 ). As a result of short hospital stays, most women will experience breast fullness or engorgement after they have left the hospital. Anticipatory guidance is essential and should include education about the physiology and the patterns of engorgement as well as information about how to access breastfeeding support after they leave the hospital. Women who have had birth interventions, including a caesarean delivery, may have a delay in initiation of breastfeeding ( TPH, 2010 ). As a result, they may experience engorgement one to two days later than for a vaginal birth, particularly if there has been a delay in initiation of breastfeeding. Research Challenges - It is difficult to conduct conclusive scientific research related to engorgement because engorgement will spontaneously resolve as women continue to breastfeed no matter what treatment, if any, is tried ( Mangesi et al., 2010 ). A Cochrane systematic review in 2010 found insufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of interventions to treat engorgement. In addition, methodological limitations in the existing research have led to a high risk of bias in the results ( Mangesi et al., 2010 ). The limited number of studies not only meant that the Cochrane review was unable to carry out a meta-analysis, it also meant that several of the studies frequently cited were dated, including some doctoral theses that have not been published in peer review journals ( Robson, 1990; Sandberg, 1998 ). When Optimal Breastfeeding Management Isn't Enough - In addition to optimal breastfeeding management - frequent breastfeeding and breast milk removal, effective positioning and latching, as well as gentle breast massage - breastfeeding mothers may try and/or breastfeeding experts may suggest a variety of other strategies. The 2010 Cochrane systematic review found that in interventions such as ultrasound, cabbage leaves, and oxytocin, there was no statistically significant evidence that the interventions were associated with more rapid resolution of symptoms; symptoms tended to improve with or without the intervention. In addition, the review did not find evidence strong enough to recommend the use of acupuncture, although some women's symptoms improved after acupuncture. Heat vs. Cold Heat applied to engorged breasts has long been used by breastfeeding women to promote letdownand comfort, although concerns have arisen thatBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 53the application of heat to the mother's breasts may increase vasocongestion. Robson reported that mothers complained that heat worsened symptoms, causing throbbing and a greater feeling of fullness ( Robson, 1990 ). The Cochrane review does suggest that warm compresses be applied to the engorged breast ( Mangesi et al., 2010 ). Heat may also be applied to the mother's back or shoulders to promote relaxation, comfort, and letdown. Cold may be applied to engorged breasts to decreaselocal edema and enhance venous and lymphatic drainage, as well as provide comfort. Although thecurrent evidence is not definitive, the Cochrane review suggested that cold packs may be soothing for some women, and that application of cold doesnot cause harm and may be associated with symptom improvement ( Mangesi et al., 2010 ). Despite a lack of statistical significance, the evidence continues tosuggest clinical benefits. Mothers should protecttheir skin from direct exposure to extreme cold. As many women report comfort after applying cold and/or warmth for engorgement, these can be reasonable strategies to suggest provided that they are used conservatively and safely. It is important to prevent tissue trauma or negative physiological effects, such as increased congestion and swelling from too much heat, or possible tissue trauma such as frostbite, or impeding letdown with application of too much cold. To avoid direct exposure to hot and cold, use a layer of fabric between the skin and the source of cold or heat. To prevent tissue trauma, limit the application time so that the skin does not redden. Some practitioners continue to suggest the application of heat before breastfeeding and cold immediately afterward for relief ( Riordan, 2010 ). Expression/Pumping - If a mother is expressing breast milk from her breasts (by hand or pump) because she is uncomfortable or the baby has not removed enough breast milk, it is important that she understands that she should remove only enough breast milk to feel comfortable. The mother should not drain her breasts, because it may further stimulate the production of breast milk and possibly increase the engorgement symptoms ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Cabbage Leaves - The application of cabbage leaves to the mother 's breasts between breastfeedings to reduce engorgement is another strategy that has been used by some breastfeeding women but for which the evidence of effectiveness is inconclusive due to methodological limitations. The Cochrane review found no statistically significant evidence that the use of cabbage leaves was associated with a more rapid resolution of engorgement symptoms ( Mangesi et al., 2010 ). Despite this, many women find the application of cabbage leaves to be soothing. It is not necessary to chill cabbage leaves ( Roberts et al., 1995 ). Mothers should be informed that their breasts might smell or taste like cooked cabbage. Caution: Safety is an issue. Bacteria such as listeria have been identified on many vegetables including raw cabbage ( Heisick et al., 1989 ). Listeriosis can be a very serious disease for pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals. Although application to the skin does not have the same risk as ingestion, it is reasonable to suggest that cabbage leaves should not be applied to nipples or breasts with lesions, nor used by mothers with immunocompromised infants, including premature babies. For all applications, it is essential to: Thoroughly wash cabbage leaves in cold, running, drinkable water. Wash hands before and after handling cabbageleaves. Clean all utensils, cutting boards, and work surfaceswith a 10% bleach solution before and after use. (Source: Adapted from Health Canada, 2008 and 2009) Saline Soaks - Some practitioners may suggest that a mother soak her breasts in a mild saline solution, or soak in an Epsom salt bath. Although no specific research could be found to support the effectiveness of this practice, it is unlikely to be harmful as long as the baby is not swallowing the solution. Magnesium sulphate treatments are rated as L1 by Hale ( 2010). Promoting Areolar Grasp \"Reverse Pressure Softening\" - For most women, the gentle massage and expression described above in \"Suggestions\" are enough to soften an engorged areola. If these do not reduce the areolar edema, it may help to try \"reverse pressure softening\", as described by Cotterman ( 2004). Gentle positive pressure is applied by placing the fingertips around the base of the mother's nipple to create a ring of \"dimples\". This can temporarily reduce edema by moving some swelling slightly Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 54backward and upward into the breast, softening the areola enough to permit effective latching. It is best done with fingernails trimmed short and immediately before breastfeeding. Cultural Practices - It is important to acknowledge that some cultures traditionally avoid practices such as \"cold\" during the postpartum period. Having a conversation with the mother about traditional and cultural practices and exploring their significance for her can facilitate an informed decision. It creates an opportunity to offer accurate information about how the possible benefits and risks of traditional practices may impact her breastfeeding success. Some women may feel that certain practices are not an option, and for others an explanation of the rationale may lead to the possibility of trying a different treatment. Prevention - All findings emphasize that prevention of engorgement should remain the key priority. References Cotterman, K.J. (2004).

Protocol #6 Plugged DuctsBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 55Protocol #6: Plugged Ducts Plugged o r blocked ducts occur when one or more of the collecting ducts within a breast becomes plugged with breast milk and other cellular components. Contributing factors may include breast milk stasis or external pressure applied on specific areas of the mother's breast. Observation and Assessment Assess the mother for: Unilateral symptoms, localized in one area of the mother's breast. Mild tenderness, little or no heat, possible redness of one area of the mother's breast. If the plugged duct is close to the skin, there may bea palpable lump in one area of the breast. Possible white dot or bleb at the end of the nipple. Body temperature < 38.4\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Gradual onset of symptoms. Feeling well otherwise. Source: Adapted from Lawr ence, 2011, and Rior dan, 2010. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Plugged ducts may be mother and/or baby related.

Infrequent, hurried, shortened, or missed breastfeedings, including when the baby is ill. Weaning. Suggestions 1.Assess for possible cause(s) of the plugged duct (see the previous section on \"Possible Contributing Factors or Causes). If the mother's breasts are engorged, refer to Protocol #5: Engorgement. If the mother has an overabundant breast milk supply, refer to Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x. 2.Provide the mother with suggestions for self-care. Rest as much as possible. Eat and drink according to Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Support for herself and her household. Help with care of other children. 3.Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with plugged ducts.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 56Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Understand that most plugged or blocked ducts will resolve in 1-2 days. Follow her baby's early feeding cues, e.g., rapideye movements under the eyelids, sucking/licking,hands to mouth, increased body movements, andmaking small sounds. Breastfeed frequently, at least 8 times in 24 hours, including once overnight, to mimic the normalbreastfeeding pattern until the plugged duct iscleared. The mother should also try to breastfeedif her breasts become uncomfortable or full. Themother should be encouraged to breastfeed beforethe baby is overly hungry and crying ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Avoid missed or shortened breastfeeding. Express the breast if breastfeedings are missed or shortened. Gently massage the affected area towards her nipple while applying heat to promote removal of breast milk and drainage of the plugged duct. Heat may be applied during massage in a warm shower or bath, orby immersing the breast in a bowl of warm water. Apply moist heat and gentle nipple rolling before breastfeeding if there is a white bleb at the end ofthe nipple. If the bleb does not open with repeatedbreastfeedings or if it causes breastfeeding to bepainful, then the bleb may need to be opened witha sterile needle at a breastfeeding clinic or by aphysician. This should provide nipple pain reliefand may clear the plugged duct. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Offer the affected side first at each breastfeeding to ensure strong sucking and drainage of the pluggedduct. Gently massage the affected area towards her nipple and use breast compressions to promote drainage ofthe plugged duct. Breast massage or compressionsmay begin with the ducts closest to the nipple orfrom behind the plug. Avoid prolonged finger or hand pressure on the mother's breast. Rotate breastfeeding positions during breastfeedings to promote drainage of all the ductsin the mother's breast. Assess that the baby iseffectively positioned and latched ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Assess that the baby is effectively sucking and swallowing throughout each breastfeeding(Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Between breastfeedings, encourage the mother to: Follow self-care practices - try to rest as much as possible, eat a healthy diet, and seek support tominimize stress. Avoid placing prolonged pressure on the breasts, e.g., from restrictive clothing, tight or underwirebras, straps on a baby carrier, always sleeping onone side, or always holding the baby the same way. Monitor for signs of mastitis, e.g., changes in body temperature, breast pain, and breast redness(Protocol #7: Mastitis ). If the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively, encourage the mother to: Gently express each breast after each time the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeedingis stopped for any length of time the mother willneed to express each breast at least 8 times in 24hours, including overnight, until the plugged ducthas cleared. The mother should also express if herbreasts become uncomfortable or full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Breastfeed the baby with the expressed breast milk using an alternative method, e.g., cup,spoon, syringe, or finger feeding (Protocol #17:Indications for Supplementation or Cessation ofBreastfeeding ). Consult a breastfeeding expert or attend a breastfeeding clinic for further assessment as soonas possible. Recurrent plugged ducts: Review possible underlying factors. Try lecithin, either from dietary sources or as a supplement. Contact a Registered Dietitian todiscuss dietary sources of lecithin or any otherchange in diet, such as reducing saturated fat. Although there are no scientifically established dosages for use of lecithin in breastfeeding,supplements may be suggested by breastfeedingexperts (see General Principles regarding lecithin).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 57General Principles Continue to breastfeed frequently to promote effective removal of breast milk from the mother's breasts. Most plugged ducts will resolve within 1-2 days. Support maternal self-care, i.e., rest and diet according to Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide (Health Canada, 2007 ). Plugged ducts result from local accumulation of breast milk and cellular components in the mother's breast, with inflammation in the surrounding tissue. As there is breast tissue with lactiferous ducts located in the underarm, a plugged duct may also develop in this area. A bl eb or breast milk blister, a white dot or bump on the mother's nipple, is accumulation of breast milk solids that block the breast milk from flowing. It may be painful when the baby latches onto the mother's breast. If there is no pain, no treatment is needed. There is no specific cause of plugged ducts ( Riordan, 2010) but this condition occurs more often in women with an abundant breast milk supply and when their breasts are not adequately emptied. Plugged ducts are observed to occur more frequently in the winter months ( Riordan, 2010 ). This may be related to the cold weather or to constricting clothing. Breast trauma or surgery may have damaged the ducts, interfering with their ability to transport breast milk ( Lauwers, 2011 ). Fetherston observed that thicker breast milk may be a predictor of plugged ducts ( Fetherston, 1998 ). Some practitioners report that mothers may find it less painful to massage or knead close to the nippleand in front of the plug ( Campbell, 2006 ), rather than push the plug forward. Antibiotic treatment is not recommended forplugged ducts unless they develop into mastitis.Mastitis is differentiated from plugged ducts bythese symptoms: Fever of >38.4\u00b0C (101\u00b0F), flu-likesymptoms, intense pain/redness in the mother'sbreast, and sudden onset of symptoms ( Lawrence, 2011) (see also Protocol #7: Mastitis ). Lecithin - It has been suggested by some breastfeeding experts that lecithin may help resolve recurrent plugged ducts if the mother takes lecithin either in her diet or as a supplement. Lecithin is present naturally in breast human milk. It also occurs in the body as an emulsifier for bile salts. It is found in many foods. A Registered Dietitian can suggest dietary sources of lecithin. However, dietetic texts do not make specific recommendations of lecithin for breastfeeding women. Although there are reports of clinical observations of the successful use of lecithin for plugged ducts with no apparent side ef fects, at this time there is not enough scientific information about the safety of various supplements and natural products to recommend their general use during breastfeeding. Although the use of lecithin is suggested in many texts ( Lauwers, 2011; Riordan, 2010; Humphrey, 2003 ) and continues to be referenced by Dr. Ruth Lawrence ( Lawrence, 2011 ), no clinical research could be found related to the use of lecithin for plugged ducts. There is not sufficient evidence to determine recommendations of efficacy, dosages, side effects, or risks for either the mother or baby. However, the following are frequently cited in the lactation texts: 1 tablespoon of lecithin, by spoon or in food 3-4 times/day ( Lawrence, 2011 ) or 1-2 capsules (1200 mg) 3 - 4 times a day ( Lauwers, 2011). Breastfeeding women should approach the use of natural health products with caution and always consult with their health care provider with breastfeeding expertise ( Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding) for further discussion of natural products. Ultrasound - References are found that suggest the use of ultrasound for recurrent plugged ducts. However, there is limited published evidence to support this intervention. An early Cochrane review reported equal effects of placebo and ultrasound ( Snowden et al., 2001 ). Although reference was found to a poster abstract of a small retrospective study comparing therapeutic ultrasound as an adjunct to traditional interventions to traditional interventions alone for plugged ducts (Smillie, 2003), the study has not been published in a peer review journal. The study did observe a benefit from the use of ultrasound, but one of the authors later reported that the study clinic staff decreased use of ultrasound because the women viewed ultrasound as stressful and not empowering ( Campbell, 2006 ). Poorly managed plugged ducts can develop into mastitis (Protocol #7: Mastitis ). Recurrent plugged ducts may be associated with breast cancer. Pregnancy associated breast cancer(PABC) occurs in a small percentage of women inthe first year postpartum. It is important to referBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 58the mother to her primary health care provider to evaluate for possible breast cancer if there is recurrent mastitis or a plugged duct in the same area, febrile mastitis-like symptoms that are unresolved after antibiotic treatment, or a mass not decreasing after 72 hours of optimized breastfeeding management ( Petok, 1995 in Lawrence, 2011). It is recommended that the breast be emptied prior to a diagnostic procedure ( Lawrence, 2011 ). Plugged ducts usually resolve with continued unrestricted breastfeeding. References Campbell, S.H.

Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Continue breastfeeding and promote ef fective breast milk removal. Apply heat to the affected area for a few minutes. Moist or dry heat includes a warm shower or bath,a warm, moist towel or disposable diaper, a heatingpad on low setting, a hot water bottle or immersingthe breast in a bowl of warm water. Gently massage the affected area while applying heat to promote breast milk removal (i.e., drainageof that area). Apply moist heat and gentle nipple rolling if there isBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 60a white blister or bleb at the end of the nipple. If the blister does not open after repeated breastfeedings or if it causes breastfeeding to be painful, then the blister may need to be opened with a sterile needle at a breastfeeding clinic or by a physician. This should provide nipple pain relief and may clear an underlying plugged duct. Apply heat to her back or shoulders for comfort and relaxation. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Offer the affected side first at each breastfeeding to ensure strong sucking and breast milk removal fromthat area. Try the unaffected side first for a short time if it is too painful to breastfeed on the affected side. Use a variety of breastfeeding positions to promote drainage of all the ducts in her breast. Try positionsthat have the baby's chin or nose pointing towardsthe affected area (ABM Protocol #4, 2008) . Gently massage the affected area during the breastfeeding to promote breast milk removal fromthat area. Massage should be directed from theaffected area towards the mother's nipple (ABM Protocol #4, 2008). Assess that the baby is correctly positioned and latched (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Assess that the baby is sucking and swallowing long enough to effectively remove breast milk fromthe breast, Between breastfeedings, encourage the mother to: Observe her baby for early feeding cues to be able to breastfeed early and frequently: when the baby is showing feeding cues,e.g., rapid eye movements under the eyelids,sucking/licking, hands to mouth, increased body movements, and making small sounds (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). before the baby is overly hungry or crying. when the breasts become uncomfortable orfull, or at least 8 times in 24 hours, includingovernight, until the breasts are no longerengorged. Wear a supportive and well-fitting bra. Avoid placing prolonged pressure on the breasts, e.g., from a tight or underwire bra, straps on a babycarrier, always sleeping on one side, or always holding the baby the same way. Avoid wearing a bra to bed ( Fetherston, 1998 ). Feed the baby only breast milk. Avoid supplementation unless medically indicated(Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation orCessation of Breastfeeding ). Avoid pacifiers and bottles. Avoid missed or shortened breastfeedings. Express breast milk if breastfeedings are missed orshortened. Rest as much as possible and eat and drink according to Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Apply cold to reduce breast swelling if she wishes. Wrap a cold cloth or cold pack in a towel or cloth toavoid direct exposure to the skin. Use analgesics as needed, e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen. To inquire about the use of acetylsalicylic acid, i.e. aspirin, consult with a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. If the baby is unable to latch or breastfeed effectively, encourage the mother to: Gently express each breast after each time that the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. Ifbreastfeeding is stopped for any length of time,the mother will need to express each breast at least8 times in 24 hours, including overnight, untilthe mastitis has cleared. The mother should alsoexpress if her breasts become uncomfortable oroverly full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Feed the baby with expressed breast milk using an alternative feeding method, e.g., cup,spoon, syringe, or finger feeding (Protocol #18:Alternative Feeding Methods ). If expressed breast milk is not available, an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Attend a breastfeeding clinic or see a breastfeeding expert for further assessment as soon as possible. Antibiotic treatment: Mothers should be assessed without delay regarding the need for antibiotic treatment.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 61 Antibiotic treatment, e.g., cephalexin, cefaclor, andciprofloxacin are effective for mothers allergic topenicillin. Breastfeeding can and should continue together with any of the above antibiotics. Abruptdiscontinuation of breastfeeding for any lengthof time without regular expression to effectivelyremove breast milk from the mother 's breasts can lead to complications such as engorgement,plugged ducts, prolonged or recurrent mastitis, oran abscess. General Principles Frequent breastfeeding is found to be a protective factor against mastitis ( Fetherston, 1998 ). Frequent breastfeeding is necessary to effectively remove breast milk from the alveoli and breast milk ducts, either by breastfeeding or expression. Effective removal of breast milk from the mother's breast is essential to prevent breast milk stasis. A variety of terms may be used to describe this. Riordan uses the term \"removal\", as does Lauwers. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine uses both the terms \"removal\" and \"drainage\", as does the Cochrane Review ( Crepinsek, ). Lawrence includes the terms \"emptying\" and 'drainage'. Biancuzzo also uses the terms \"removal\" and \"emptying\". Ultimately, to support infant growth and nutrition, the breast milk must be effectively removed from the mother's breast and transferred to the baby. Mastitis is an acute inflammation or cellulitis of the interlobular connective tissue of the mother's breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection ( Foxman, 2002; WHO, 2000 ). Lactation mastitis is associated with breast milk stasis in the ducts or alveoli. It may also be associated with or result in infection. Some definitions of mastitis refer to infectious mastitis only ( Mass, 2004 ). Mastitis may be viewed as a continuum, from non-infectious inflammation of the mother's breast to infection that may lead to breast abscess ( Crepinsek, 2010 ). Non-infectious mastitis can possibly be managed by breastfeeding strategies alone to promote effective removal of breast milk from the mother's breast. Infectious mastitis is most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( Jahanfar, 2009; Osterman & Rahm, Escherichia coli ( WHO, 2000 ). Although mastitis may be associated with Candida albicans that would likely be secondary to a bacterial infection, candidiasis is a fungal infection. Candidiasis may occur following antibiotic treatment for mastitis (Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush)). In addition to effective breast milk removal from the mother's breast, infectious mastitis may also need treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics that are compatible for both the mother and baby are used whenever possible. A complete course of antibiotics is important to prevent recurrent mastitis ( Osterman, 2000; Lawrence, 2011 ). Although the Cochrane Review did report a study that suggested more rapid symptom relief with antibiotics, its overall conclusion was that there is very little evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, and there is an urgent need for high-quality double-blind randomized control trials ( Jahanfar, 2009 ). An immediate referral to a primary health care provider is recommended. Delay may lead to prolonged or recurrent mastitis ( Lawrence, 2011). The composition of breast milk changes during a breast infection. There are cellular changes that increase the risk of vertical transmission of infection, particularly retroviruses ( Michie et al., 2003 ). Anti- inflammatory components increase to protect the baby from mastitic milk ( Buescher, 2001 in Riordan ). The sodium content increases and the flavour may change. This may lead to a change in the baby's feeding behaviour. Mastitis commonly occurs in the first few weeks after birth; however, approximately a third of casesdevelop after six months. Mastitis presents a spectrum of symptoms ( Barbosa- Cesnik, 2003 ), ranging from local inflammation, to systemic symptoms, to an abscess. Poorly managed mastitis may develop into an abscess. A small percentage of mothers with mastitis develop an abscess and will need to seek medicalattention to remove the collection of pus. Recurrent mastitis may be associated with breastcancer. Pregnancy associated breast cancer (P ABC) occurs in a small percentage of women in the firstyear postpartum. It is important to refer the motherto her primary health care provider to evaluate forBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 62possible breast cancer if there is recurrent mastitis or a plugged duct in the same area, febrile mastitis-like symptoms that are unresolved after antibiotic treatment, or a mass not decreasing after 72 hours of optimized breastfeeding management ( Petok, 1995 in Lawrence, 2011 ). It is recommended that the breast be emptied prior to a diagnostic procedure ( Lawrence, 2011). Continue breastfeeding. References Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine [ABM]. (2008).

Observation and Assessment There are a variety of nipple appearances and inversions. Some nipples appear to protrude but will invert when compressed, whereas others will appearto invert but will protrude when compressed. Neither visual assessment nor self-reporting of flat nipples is adequate to determine nipple protractility. The best test for nipple protractility is done by the baby at the mother's breast. If the baby isbreastfeeding well there is no need for furtherintervention. Some practitioners may use the nipple pinch test to clarify if a nipple is flat or inverted: Gently compress the areola about 1 inch from the base ofthe nipple, placing the thumb on one side of theareola and the index finger on the opposite side. Nipple Pinch Test Regardless of how the nipple performs during the nipple pinch test, it is important not to drawconclusions about the potential for breastfeedingsuccess. Babies breastfeed, not nipple feed. Some mothers may doubt the functionality of their breasts because of variations in nipple appearance.It is important to not make any statements to a mother about the suitability of her nipples for breastfeeding, as these may negatively affect her sense of breastfeeding self-efficacy. Language such a s labelling a nipple as \"flat\" can similarly have negative effect on a mother's self-efficacy . (See General Principles .) Flat Nipple Assess the mother for: A nipple that flattens when the nipple pinch test is done. The nipple may appear to be protruding, flat,or inverted before the test. A nipple that appearsflat but protrudes with the nipple pinch test (or withcold or stimulation) is not truly a flat nipple. In thiscase, no special preparation is needed to draw outthe nipple before breastfeeding. Assess the baby for: A difficult latch and/or breast refusal. Inverted Nipple Assess the mother for: A nipple that inverts when the nipple pinch test is done. The mother's nipple may appear to beprotruding, flat, or inverted before the test. Anipple that appears inverted but protrudes with thenipple pinch test, or with cold or stimulation, isnot truly an inverted nipple. In this case, no specialpreparation is needed to draw out the nipple beforebreastfeeding. A decreased breast milk supply. A truly inverted nipple may have fewer breast milk ducts. In addition, the nipple ducts may collapse or becomeoccluded due to areolar edema as a result of breastengorgement or high suction by the baby ( Wilson- Clay, 2011 ). Assess the baby for: A difficult latch and/or breast refusal.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 64Possible Contributing Causes or Factors Flat or inverted nipples may have one or more possible causes. Assess the mother for: An areola that is non-elastic and difficult to compress. This type of areola will make it moredifficult for the baby to latch onto the mother'sbreast. An engorged areola that may flatten a normallyprotruding nipple. This is most likely the case if themother did not have a flat nipple until after birth. The following are additional explanations for flat or inverted nipples: Adhesions that connect the nipple to the inner breast tissue. Less dense connective tissue located beneath the nipple. History of breast surgery or nipple piercing. Suggestions Assess for possible cause(s) of a flat or inverted nipple (see previous section on PossibleContributing Causes or factors). If the baby is unable to latch onto the mother'sbreast, refer to Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch to rule out any other cause(s) for the latch problem. If the baby is able to latch onto the mother' s breast but is not sucking effectively, refer to Protocol #10:Ineffective Suck . Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with flat or inverted nipples. Provide the following suggestions only if nipple f latness, lack of protrusion or inversion are interfering with breastfeeding. Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: 1.Try to express some breast milk to soften the areola. She may wish to apply wet or dry heat to her breasts for a few minutes if the areola is difficult to compress. Heat may also be applied to the mother's back and shoulders. Heat may be applied with a warm wet towel or disposable diaper, a warm shower or bath, a bowl of warm water , a heating pad on low, or a hot water bottle. To express breast milk, refer to Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk . 2.Try one of the following techniques to help the nipple to protrude: If the mother's nipple can be pulled out, grasp and roll the nipple between the thumb and index fingerfor a couple of minutes. Briefly touch the nipple with a damp, cold clothfor a few seconds to help it protrude and to reduceswelling. Avoid prolonged exposure to the coldcloth as this can inhibit the letdown reflex or causetissue trauma. Use a breast pump immediately before feeding, justlong enough to help draw out the nipple. 3.Try to promote areolar grasp with reverse pressure softening - For most women, gentle massage and expression are enough to soften a swollen areola. If these do not reduce the areolar edema it may help to try reverse pressure softening, as described by Cotterman ( 2004). Positive gentle pressure is applied by placing the fingertips around the base of the nipple to create a ring of \"dimples\". This can reduce the swelling temporarily, enough to permit effective latching. It is best done with short nails and immediately before breastfeeding. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Express some breast milk onto her nipple and areola to entice the baby to latch. Try shaping her breast to create more definition to the nipple. Compress her breast and areola betweentwo fingers and the thumb to provide as muchnipple as possible. This is sometimes referred to asa \"nipple sandwich\" ( Wiessinger, 1998 ). Use a \"C\" or \"U\" hold to support her breast and slightly apply pressure with the thumb and fingers,pulling back towards the chest to help the nipple toprotrude when latching.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 65\"C\" hold Try gently pulling back on the breast tissue to create more nipple definition. Check for effective positioning and latching (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Try using different positions to support the baby to achieve and maintain a deep latch, e.g.,semi-reclined, football, or cross-cradle positions(Pr otocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). If the baby breastfeeds well on one breast but is unable to breastfeed on the other side, encourage the mother to: Continue to breastfeed on one breast, but offer the other breast. Then express from the other side after each breastfeeding. A rented hospital-gradeelectric breast pump is the most ef fective device for expressing and drawing out the nipple ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Br east Milk ). Hold her baby skin-to-skin, with or without attempting to latch. Refer to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic for further assessment as soon as possible. If in the rare case that both nipples are flat and or inverted and the baby is unable to breastfeed on either side, encourage the mother to: Begin to express regularly as soon as possible after birth and preferably within the first 6 hours after birth. Feed the baby with the expressed breast milk using an alternative feeding method, e.g., cup, spoon, syringe, or finger feeding ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). If expressed breast milk is not available, then an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding). Express each breast after each time that the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeedingis stopped for any length of time, the mother will need to express each breast on a regular basis in order to maintain her breast milk supply. Generally, this should be at least 8 times a day in 24 hours, with a minimum of 1 expression overnight, to mimic a normal feeding pattern. The mother may need to express more often if her breasts become uncomfortable or full ( Pr otocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Hold her baby skin-to-skin, with or without attempting to latch. Refer to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic for further assessment. If the mother continues to experience difficulties related to flat or inverted nipples, she may wish to consider the alternative strategies suggested below. Encourage her to: Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of nipple shields if she inquires about using them for flat or inverted nipples. Offer furtherassessment and refer for further support as needed(see notes in General Principles ). Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of breast shells if sheinquires about using them for flat or invertednipples. Offer further assessment and refer forfurther support as needed (see notes in General Principles ). Hold her baby skin-to-skin, with or without attempting to latch. Continue to follow strategies to optimize breastfeeding. General Principles Nipple protractility cannot be visually assessed ( Wilson-Clay & Hoover, 2008 ). There are a variety of nipple appearances and inversions. Some nipples appear to protrude but will invert when compressed, whereas others appear to invert but will protrude when compressed. Approximately 10% of pregnant women have flat or inverted nipples ( Alexander et al., 1992 ). In many cases these nipple variations do not prevent the baby from breastfeeding effectively since the baby needs to latch onto the areola and not the nipple to Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 66breastfeed. In addition, hormonal changes during pregnancy increase skin elasticity, which improves nipple protrusion. Most women will have good nipple protrusion by the end of their pregnancy. Generally, nipple protrusion improves with each pregnancy and breastfeeding experience. Flat or inverted nipples are associated with sub- optimal early breastfeeding behaviour and with delayed onset of lactation ( Dewey et al., 2003 ). The baby may struggle at the mother's breast if he is unable to draw her nipple up and back into contact with the hard palate, interfering with the instinctive stimulus to suck (See Suck Cycle in Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). The baby may also be frustrated if unable to create and sustain a seal, interfering with the ability to transfer breast milk and increasing the risk of low breast milk supply and low weight gain. It is important to offer early and ongoing assessment and support to optimize breastfeeding management as well as infant weight gain. Compressing the mother's breast and areola between two fingers and thumb to stimulate a nipple helps to offer the baby as much breast as possible ( Lawrence, 2011). Some women try the C hold described above. This has been described by Wiessinger using a \"sandwich\" analogy ( Wiessinger, 1998 ). The mother holds her breast near the areolar border, with her fingers underneath and thumb on top of the breast. She presses in with the thumb and fingers while simultaneously pushing back towards the chest wall. This elongates and narrows the areola, giving the baby a \"sandwich'\" or more breast tissue to latch onto. Breast Shells - Breast shells are two-piece plastic devices that may be worn inside a bra over the nipple and areola. Women may wear them to improve nipple protractility by placing gentle pressure on the areola, which stretches and pushes the nipple forward (Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples ). They may be worn with effect in the early weeks of breastfeeding, but prenatal use has been found to be ineffective ( Alexander et al., 1992, MAIN Group, 1994 ). A wide-based shell may be worn to protect the tender nipple and areola from rubbing on a bra or clothing. Some mothers may use shells to relieve engorgement, worn about 20 minutes before feedings to redistribute fluid edema. Occasionally they may be marketed as a device for catching leaking breast milk between breastfeedings, although this is not recommended because of the risk of bacterial contamination ( Riordan, 2010 ). Some women may use them to collect leaking breast milk during a breastfeeding or pumping session. The bra size should be bigger than the shell to avoid placing too much pressure on the delicate breast tissue. Such pressure increases the risk of plugged ducts. Shells should have multiple openings for air circulation to keep the skin from becoming softened or chapped. Although previously used to collect leaking breast milk and protect clothing, any breast milk collected should be discarded due to potential increased bacterial counts. Nipple Shields - If the mother inquires about using a nipple shield to manage flat or inverted nipples, it is important to first explore with her any possible contributing factors related to flat or inverted nipples, as well as her breastfeeding self-efficacy related to her nipple shape. It is also important to inquire about her previous breastfeeding history, current breastfeeding management and attempts to manage her flat or inverted nipples, and then offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding management before adding further interventions such as nipple shields (see earlier discussion regarding management of flat or inverted nipples). Although not the first strategy recommended to manage flat or inverted nipples, short-term use of the newer ultra-thin silicone shields has been positively associated with preserving the breastfeeding relationship while the dyad learns to breastfeed ( Meier, 2000; Wilson-Clay, 1996 ). Although a recent review of the literature reported that the current evidence does not yet demonstrate safe practices for the use of nipple shields ( McKechnie et al., 2010 ), expert practitioners continue to report the use of nipple shields as a possible strategy to bring babies to the mother's breast who might otherwise refuse the breast. Reasons for refusal may include flat or inverted nipples, prematurity, and/or imprinting (Protocol #4: Sore Nipples; Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch; Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Nipple shields may provide temporary relief for a mother who is stressed or overwhelmed and prevent the introduction of a bottle, if she is supported appropriately by a lactation expert ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Some mothers may wish to use nipple shields for longer periods; these dyads should be periodically reassessed. Lawrence advises against the use of a makeshift Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 67shield; nor should shields be altered for use. A nipple shield is an artificial nipple and areola shaped like a floppy sun hat and made of a synthetic material like silicone. Some women may have success placing one of the newer ultra-thin silicone nipple shields over the breast to facilitate latching and sucking. This has the potential to stimulate the baby's hard palate and thereby elicit the sucking reflex. It may be a familiar stimulus to coax a baby to the mother's breast who has already imprinted preferentially on the supernormal stimulus of an artificial nipple ( Wilson-Clay et al., 2008 ). Historically, there has been mixed evidence reported about nipple shields. Use of the older rubber or latex shields was associated with concerns of inadequate intake of breast milk that resulted in slow weight gain or failure to thrive (Woolridge, et al. 1980) . Recent evidence has demonstrated weight gain to be similar over 2 months in babies fed with shields compared with babies fed without shields (Chertock, 2009) . To apply a nipple shield, it is important to use the correct fit and size. If the teat is too long for the baby's mouth it can cause gagging, but if it is too small it may not stimulate active sucking ( Mohrbacher, 2010). The teat opening needs to be large enough to accommodate the mother's nipple comfortably; if it is too small it can slow the flow of breast milk or create friction and sore nipples. Lauwers recommends starting with the smallest shield that accommodates both the baby's mouth and the mother's nipple. Wilson-Clay advises matching the shield size to the baby's mouth, selecting the shortest available teat with the smallest base diameter ( Wilson-Clay, 2011 ). Clinicians and mothers may try varying methods to directly apply the shield. In one, the mother holds the rim of the shield between her thumb and fingers. Stretching the shield at the junction of the nipple and areola, she places the stretched shield over her nipple and releases the tension. As it releases and the shield returns to its normal shape, it draws the mother's nipple into the nipple cavity of the shield before the baby begins to suck. Some mothers may turn the top half of the shield inside out before placing it over the nipple. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions related to care and cleaning of the nipple shield. (For further information see Wilson-Clay, 2011, Lauwers, 2011, and Genna, 2008) Nipple shields should not be the first strategy recommended to manage flat or inverted nipples, and they should only be initiated by a health care provider who has the breastfeeding expertise to thoroughly assess the potential effectiveness and risks of use for that breastfeeding dyad. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. Practitioners who do not have the capacity, i.e., lactation expertise or time, to continue to support the dyad appropriately should refer the mother to a lactation expert or breastfeeding clinic. The baby's weight gain and the mother's breast milk supply need to be monitored closely. There must be a comprehensive plan that includes periodic reassessment of breastfeeding and the infant's intake of breast milk, plus a plan for re-establishment of feeding at the breast. No Prenatal Intervention - Previously, it was a common practice to encourage women with inverted nipples to wear breast shells or perform nipple exercises prenatally to draw out the nipple. Breastfeeding experts no longer recommend these practices. They have not proven to be effective and may damage a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed ( Alexander et al., 1992; MAIN Group, 1994 ). As well, nipple exercises can damage delicate breast tissue and may stimulate uterine contractions during pregnancy. Emphasis is now being placed on providing pregnant women with information about proper positioning and latching techniques as well as getting skilled breastfeeding assistance in the early weeks after birth. Mothers and practitioners have been creative over the years in trying to promote nipple eversion. In addition to the interventions described above, there are a variety of techniques described in the literature to promote nipple eversion, including application of inverted syringes, both home-made and commercial versions, rubber bands ( Chakrabarti et al., 2011 ), and surgery. For further information see Lauwers ( 2011), Wilson-Clay ( 2008), Lawrence ( 2011) and Walker (2011). There is limited scientific research to support the use of these strategies. If a mother inquires about using these interventions, refer her to a lactation consultant or breastfeeding clinic for further assessment and support. Breastfeeding self-efficacy is the confidence that a mother has in her ability to breastfeed her infant ( Dennis, 1999 ). The mother must believe that she is capable of implementing any information or strategies that might be suggested ( Bowles, 2011 ). Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public HealthBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 68Many flat or inverted nipples will resolve before the end of pregnancy with no intervention, or may be resolved over time by the baby latching and sucking. For any intervention that is suggested, it is important to consider the mother's breastfeeding goals, her capacity to manage the intervention, the baby's capacity to continue, how long it may take, and whether the baby can be kept at the mother's breast until the nipples evert, as well as how the baby will be fed in the meantime (adapted from Wilson-Clay, 2008).

Observation and Assessment Assess the baby for: Repeated inability to achieve or maintain a latch. Pushing away from the mother's breast with arms and legs. Arching and crying when brought to the mother's breast. Latching and sucking a few times, then letting the nipple slide out of the mouth. Refusal of one or both breasts. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Breast refusal or difficulty achieving a latch may be mother and/or baby related. Early Breast Refusal 1.If the baby began refusing the mother's breast in the first 1-2 days after birth,Assess the mother for: Ineffective positioning and latching techniques (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Flat or inverted nipples, especially with a hard and non-compressible areola ( Protocol Flat or Inverted Nipples ). Long or elongated nipples, especially if the baby is small. Birth interventions, trauma or stress that may delay Lactogenesis II or interfere with breast milk production,e.g., caesarean delivery, lengthy labour , intravenous therapy, pain (Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Breast edema related to intravenous therapy in labour. Assess the baby for: Birth interventions, trauma, stress, and medications, e.g., bruising from a forceps or vacuum extractiondelivery, nerve damage related to birth injury, anaesthesia, intravenous therapy, lengthy labour. Medical condition, e.g., jaundice, dehydration, hypoglycemia, sepsis. Neurological conditions affecting muscle tone, e.g., hypertonia, hypotonia, prematurity . Abnormal nasal, oral, or facial blockage of the nasal airway(choanal atresia), cleft lip/palate, other alterations inpalatal structure, receding chin. Abnormal tongue, e.g., ankyloglossia, large or short tongue, tongue curling up to the roof of the mouth,tongue thrusting, decreased tongue peristalsis.With an abnormal tongue, the tongue may not beable to extend past the lower gumline and cup theareola during breastfeeding. This can be assessed bypulling back slightly on the baby's lower lip whenthe baby is at the mother 's breast. There may also be dimpling of the cheeks or clicking/smackingsounds when the baby sucks. Any of these signswould indicate a latching or sucking problem due tothe incorrect use of the tongue during breastfeeding(Pr otocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Swaddling that entraps the baby's hands and interferes with the baby's instinctive behaviours infinding the breast, triggering letdown and latching. 2.If the baby began refusing the mother's breast between the age of 2-4 days old, Assess the mother for: Engorgement ( Protocol #5: Engorgement). Breast edema related to intravenous therapy in labour. Birth interventions, trauma or stress that may delay Lactogenesis II or interfere with breast milkproduction, e.g., caesarean delivery, lengthy labour,intravenous therapy, pain (Protocol #10: IneffectiveSuck ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 70 Forceful letdown or breast milk ejection reflex (Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/ Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Reflex ). Delayed letdown reflex. Inappropriate parental response to infant behaviour and feeding cues. Stress. Assess the baby for: Medical conditions, e.g., jaundice, hypoglycemia, sepsis. Swaddling that entraps the baby's hands and interferes with the baby's instinctive behaviours infinding the breast, triggering letdown and latching. Later Breast Refusal 3.If the baby began refusing the mother's breast between the age of 1-4 weeks old, Assess the mother for: Forceful letdown or breast milk ejection reflex (Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/ Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x).

Pregnancy.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 71 The baby biting when the mother has responded by screaming at or startling the baby. Stress, emotional distress, feeling overwhelmed or experiencing coping difficulties related to possiblepostpartum adjustment or inadequate support. Assess the baby for: Medical conditions, e.g., candidiasis, ear infection, gastroesophageal reflux. Oral discomforts, e.g., teething, cold sores. Discomfort when being held, after an injection or injury. Distractibility due to developmental changes; at 4-5 months babies may turn away from the mother'sbreast because they are developmentally moreinterested in looking at their surroundings. Emotional upsets, stress, or overstimulation, e.g., radical changes in daily routines, family crisis,baby frequently left to cry. Suggestions 1.Assess for possible cause(s) of breast refusal or difficulty latching (see previous section on PossibleContributing Factors or Causes). The baby will need to be assessed by a primary health care provider for any possible medicalcondition, e.g., jaundice, candidiasis, ear infection,hypertonia/hypotonia, breasts are engorged, refer to Protocol #5: Engorgement. If the mother's nipple is flat or inverted, refer to Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples . If the mother has a forceful letdown reflex, refer to Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/ Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x. If the baby is showing signs of incorrect tongue use during breastfeeding, refer to Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck for information on suck assessment and management, e.g., tongue does not extend pastthe lower gumline and does not cup the areola,dimpling of the cheeks, or clicking/smackingsounds when the baby sucks. If a tight frenulum is suspected and all other possible causes have been ruled out or corrected,the baby should be medically assessed to determinewhether the frenulum needs to be clipped(frenotomy).2.Provide the mother with suggestions to help persuade the baby to take her breast. Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place where she can be comfortable and well supported. Initiate breastfeeding before the baby is overly hungry or frantically crying. Breastfeed early whenthe baby is beginning to show early feeding cuesand is calm, e.g., rapid eye movements under theeyelids, sucking/licking, hands to mouth, increasedbody movements, and making small sounds. Clothe the baby only in a diaper when breastfeeding to promote skin-to-skin contact ( Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). Ensure that the baby is calm before each attempt to latch. Support the baby in a vertical position, chest-to- chest, with nose at the level of the mother's nipple,to facilitate the normal neonatal reflexes and baby-led self-attachment behaviours. Ensure that the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex is initiated. The natural stimuli for letdownare the baby's rooting, sucking, and handmovements at the mother 's breast. If necessary, she may try using one of the following techniques: \u00b0 Apply heat to her back and shoulders for comfort and relaxation. \u00b0 Gently massage the breasts while applying moist or dry heat to her breasts for a few minutes or until the letdown reflex occurs. Heat may be applied with a warm wet towel or disposable diaper, a warm shower or bath, a bowl of warm water, a heating pad on low, or a hot water bottle. Then express some breast milk (Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Br east Milk). \u00b0 Gently roll the nipples between the index finger and thumb for a few minutes or until the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex occurs. Then express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Try using reverse pressure massage to move some of the fluid away from the areola if there is breast orareolar edema ( Protocol #5: Engorgement ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 72During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Use effective positioning and latching techniques (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Try different breastfeeding positions. Some babies may prefer certain positions. The football, cross-cradle, or biological nurturing positions may be particularly effective for latching the baby onto the mother's breast as they provide better support for the baby's neck and shoulders. When using the cross-cradle position, suggest that the mother try supporting her breast in the \"U\" hold instead of the \"C\" hold when latching the baby. Using the \"U\" hold with this position may help to make latching easier. See diagram of the \"U\" hold (without the index finger and thumbs bent slightly forward). Express some breast milk onto the mother's nipple to entice the baby to take her breast ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Try breastfeeding in motion. Some babies accept the breast if the mother is moving, e.g., walking,rocking ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Avoid stroking the baby's face after the baby is latched as this may elicit the rooting reflex and cause the baby to turn away from the mother's breast. Try the slide-over technique if the baby is able to breastfeed in the cross-cradle position on one breastbut refuses the other side ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ) i.e., after breastfeeding in the cross-cradle or cradleposition on one breast, suggest the mother slide thebaby over to the other breast without changing theside that the baby is lying on. Try the Dancer hand-hold position if the baby is able to achieve but not maintain a latch, (forbabies with low muscle tone or weak muscledevelopment). For the Dancer hand-hold position, the baby is held in an upright sitting position facing the mother's breast. The mother first supports her breast in a variation of the \"U\" hold and brings her hand forward to support her breast with the first three fingers. She supports the baby's chin in the area of her hand between her thumb and index finger. See diagram of \"U\" hold. The mother then bends her index finger slightly so that it gently holds the baby's cheek on one side, while her thumb shields the other cheek. The mother uses gentle, steady, equal pressure while holding her baby's cheeks to avoid triggering the rooting reflex. This will provide steady support to the baby's jaws and chin to help maintain the latch ( Lauwers & Swisher, 2011 ). \"U\" hold with index finger and thumb slightly bent forward Dancer hand-hold position If the baby continues to have difficulty latching onto the mother's breast after trying the above suggestions, encourage the mother to: Have someone drip expressed breast milk from a clean eyedropper, spoon, or syringe onto her nippleor in the corner of the baby's mouth while latchingthe baby to her breast. Consider use of a lactation aid on her breast, using expressed breast milk, if the baby is still unable toBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 73maintain a latch ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods). If expressed breast milk is not available, an appropriate supplement should be offered (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding). Consider offering expressed breast milk using another alternative feeding method, e.g., cup,spoon, syringe, or finger feeding (Protocol #18:Alternative Feeding Methods ) if the baby is unable to latch using the lactation aid on the mother'sbreast. If expressed breast milk is not available, anappropriate supplement should be of fered (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of a nipple shield if sheinquires about using them for breast refusalor difficulty achieving a latch. Offer furtherassessment and refer for further support as needed(see notes in General Principles ). Express each breast on a regular basis if breastfeeding is stopped for any length of time.Generally this is at least 8 times in 24 hours,with a minimum of 1 expression overnight, tomimic a normal feeding pattern. The mother mayneed to express more often if her breasts becomeuncomfortable or full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Continue to follow strategies to optimize breastfeeding. Hold her baby skin-to-skin, with or without attempting to latch. A referral to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic is recommended as soon as possible. General Principles Optimizing breastfeeding by following the principles of early and frequent feeding, feeding when the baby is calm and showing early feeding cues, ensuring effective positioning and latching techniques that include baby-led latching and skin-to-skin contact, and finishing the first breast first ( Renfrew et al., 2004 ), will often prevent or help a mother to manage a latching difficulty or breast refusal before it becomes a chronic situation. The mother may feel frustrated, rejected and/or inadequate when her baby refuses her breast. She will need support and encouragement to continue breastfeeding and to not take the baby's behaviour personally. Breast refusal or difficulty achieving a latch can occur at any stage of breastfeeding and is not limited only to the early weeks after birth. The baby may have been breastfeeding well for a length of time and then suddenly refuse one or both breasts for no apparent reason; however, this is rare. The baby's age and the circumstances under which the baby begins to refuse the mother 's breast can be helpful clues for determining the cause of breast refusal. Birth Interventions and Breast Refusal or Difficult Achieving a Latch - The events experienced during birth can impact the breastfeeding process. The normal mechanical forces of labour on the cranial nerves and facial muscles can affect the baby's comfort and ability to achieve a latch, as well as his ability to suck, swallow and transfer breast milk, a situation that may be further complicated by forceps, vacuum, and surgical interventions ( Smith, 2010 & 2007 ). A long labour can be stressful and tiring for both mother and baby, and may be associated with interventions such as intravenous hydration, analgesia, epidurals and instrumental deliveries. Caesarean deliveries may lead to stress and pain, as well as separation of mother and baby. IV fluids may be associated with breast or areolar edema, which can make it difficult for a baby to latch, although research has yet to establish the degree of association ( Smith, 2010). Pain is stressful and can interfere with the mother's comfort as well as breast milk production (see How the Breast Works). Although research has not yet established a direct link between specific medications used for intrapartum pain management and breastfeeding initiation, practitioners continue to question whether medication may affect the baby's capacity to suck effectively. In addition, it is important to consider the impact of the birth process on the mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy. Ankyloglossia (Tongue-Tie) - A short or tight lingual frenulum can restrict infant tonguemovement and may lead to breastfeedingdifficulties. Although it may sometimes beassociated with speech difficulties, the effect onspeech has not been clearly determined ( Lalakea et al., 2003 ). There are many variations in degree of tightness, amount and type of movement. CoryllosBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 74describes four types of tongue-tie, ranging from the frenulum attached to the tongue tip; attached behind the tongue tip at the alveolar ridge; attached to the mid-tongue and mid-floor of the mouth; and attached at the back of the tongue ( Coryllos et al., 2004). There may be a congenital association. \u00b0 There may be difficulty achieving a deep latch if the baby's tongue is unable to reach back towards the soft palate junction. \u00b0 Nipple pain and damage may occur if the tip of the baby's tongue rubs the hard palate and/or from reflexive biting. \u00b0 There may also be breast refusal and difficulty maintaining the latch. \u00b0 If the tongue has difficulty cupping the mother's breast, the infant may have difficulty managing a bolus of breast milk, putting the infant at risk of insufficient milk intake and poor weight gain. Management is not straightforward. Disagreement may occur among health care providers regarding the management of ankyloglossia as there are many ways to describe and define ankyloglossia. In addition to Coryllos above, Walker includes descriptions of several assessment and management approaches ( 2011). Conservative management may be possible for breastfeeding with tongue-tie, depending on the degree of tongue movement and pain, through offering assessment and support to facilitate optimal positioning and latching ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching). If the mother feels unable to continue breastfeeding due to persistent pain, and/or if the baby is at risk of insufficient breast milk intake and poor weight gain related to breast refusal or difficulty latching, refer to assess for a possible frenotomy (surgical clipping orsnipping to release the frenulum) may be considered to relieve pain,and facilitate effective latching andbreastfeeding. Geddes et al. reported less nipple compression post-frenotomy, associated withimproved breastfeeding outcomes, better latching andbreast milk transfer, and less maternal pain ( 2008). \u00b0 Refer to a primary health care provider for further assessment. Not all cases of ankyloglossia will be assessed as appropriate for frenotomy, depending on the degree of tongue movement, infant well-being and breastfeeding difficulty, as well as access to a paediatrician who performs frenotomies. (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching; Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck; Protocol #12: Insufficient B east Milk Supply) Nipple Shields - If the mother inquires about using a nipple shield to manage breast refusal or difficulty achieving or maintaining a latch, it is important to first explore with her any possible contributing factors related to the difficulty in achieving or maintaining a latch, as well as her breastfeeding self-efficacy related to the breast refusal or latching difficulties. It is also important to inquire about her previous breastfeeding history, current breastfeeding management and attempts to manage the difficulty in achieving or maintaining a latch, and then to offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding management before adding further interventions such as nipple shields (see earlier discussion regarding management of flat or inverted nipples). Although not the first strategy recommended to manage difficulty achieving or maintaining a latch, short-term use of the newer ultra-thin silicone shields has been positively associated with preserving the breastfeeding relationship while the pair learns to breastfeed ( Meier, 2000; Wilson-Clay, 1996 ). Although a recent review of the literature reported that the current evidence does not yet demonstrate safe practices for the use of nipple shields ( McKechnie et al., 2010), expert practitioners continue to report the use of nipple shields as a possible strategy to bring babies to the mother's breast who might otherwise refuse her breast. Causes for refusal may include flat or inverted nipples, prematurity, neuromuscular issues and/or imprinting ( Protocol #4: Protocol #8: Flat or Inverted Nipples; Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck). Nipple shields may provide temporary relief for a mother who is stressed or overwhelmed and prevent introduction of bottle feeding, if she is supported appropriately by a lactation expert ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Some mothers may wish to use nipple shields for longer periods; these situations should be periodically reassessed. Lawrence advises against use of a makeshift shield; nor should shields be altered for use. A nipple shield is an artificial nipple and areola shaped like a floppy sun hat and made of a synthetic material like silicone. Some women may have success placing one of the newer ultra-thin silicone nipple shields over the breast to facilitate latching Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 75and sucking. This has the potential to stimulate the baby's hard palate and thereby elicit the sucking reflex. It may be a familiar stimulus to coax a baby to the mother's breast who has already imprinted preferentially on the supernormal stimulus of an artificial nipple ( Wilson-Clay et al., 2008 ). Historically, there has been mixed evidence reported about nipple shields. Use of the older rubber or latex shields was associated with concerns of inadequate intake of breast milk that resulted in slow weight gain or failure to thrive ( Woolridge, 1980 ). Recent evidence has demonstrated weight gain to be similar over 2 months in babies fed with shields as for babies fed without shields ( Chertock, 2009 ). To apply a nipple shield, it is important to use the correct fit and size. If the teat is too long for the baby's mouth it can cause gagging, but if it is too small it may not stimulate active sucking( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). The teat opening needs to be large enough to accommodate the mother's nipple comfortably; if it is too small it can slow the flow of breast milk or may create friction and sore nipples. Lauwers recommends starting with the smallest shield that accommodates both the baby's mouth and the mother's nipple. Wilson-Clay advises matching the shield size to the baby's mouth, and selecting the shortest available teat with the smallest base diameter ( 2008). Clinicians and mothers may try varying methods to directly apply the shield. In one, the mother holds the rim of the shield between her thumb and fingers. Stretching the shield at the junction of the nipple and areola, she places the stretched shield over her nipple and releases the tension. As it releases and the shield returns to its normal shape, it draws the mother's nipple into the nipple cavity of the shield before the baby begins to suck. Some mothers may turn the top half of the shield inside out before placing it over the nipple. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions related to care and cleaning of the nipple shield. For further information see Wilson-Clay, 2008, Lauwers, 2011, and Genna, 2008. Nipple shields should not be the first strategy recommended to manage flat or inverted nipples and they should only be initiated by a health care provider who has the breastfeeding expertise to thoroughly assess the potential effectiveness and risks of use for that breastfeeding dyad. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. Practitioners who do not have the capacity, i.e., lactation expertise or time, to continue to support the dyad appropriately should refer the mother to a lactation expert or breastfeeding clinic. The baby's weight gain and the mother's breast milk supply need to be monitored closely. There must be a comprehensive plan that includes periodic reassessment of breastfeeding and the infant's intake of breast milk, plus a plan for re-establishment of feeding at the breast. Flavours in Breast Milk - Mothers may be quick to blame breast refusal on something they have eaten or done. In fact, most babies will accept a variety of flavours in their mother's breast milk, reflecting the mothers' dietary choices ( Beauchamp et al., 2011 ). Flavours from the mother's diet are transmitted to the amniotic fluid prenatally and later to breast milk. Mennella et al. (2001) suggest that prenatal flavour experiences enhance the acceptance and enjoyment of similar flavours after birth. Pregnancy, changes in sodium content related to mastitis, or elevated lactic acid levels related to exercise may also temporarily change the taste of breast milk. However, Wallace et al. ( 2002) found that moderate or high-intensity exercise did not impede infant acceptance of breast milk when consumed an hour post-exercise.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 76References Beauchamp, G.K., Mennella, J.A.

Observation and Assessment Assess the mother for: Little or no pulling sensation on the mother's breast when the baby sucks despite effective positioningand latching. Pain throughout the entire breastfeeding despiteeffective positioning and latching ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching, Protocol #15:Candidiasis (Thrush)). Persistent sore nipples and/or frequent pluggedducts despite ef #4: Sore Nipples, Protocol #6: PluggedDucts). Mastitis despite effective positioning and latching (Protocol #7: Mastitis ). Unrelieved engorgement lasting more than 48hours, followed by a rapid reduction of the mother' s breast milk supply. Assess the baby for: Quick and shallow sucks with excessive pauses, not changing to slow and deep sucks, demonstratingmostly non-nutritive sucking ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Br eastfeeding ). Few or no swallowing sounds, i.e., swallowingshould sound like a quietly exhaled \"kaa, kaa, kaa\". Clicking or smacking sounds when sucking. Dimpling of the cheeks when sucking. Fluttering of the chin or chin not pressed into the mother's breast. Eyes that remain closed during the entirebreastfeeding. Sleepiness at the mother' s breast, fussiness, frequent and/or long breastfeedings without signsof effective breast milk transfer. Inadequate output and/or weight gain ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). V isually assess the infant's sucking and mouth movements. It may be helpful to adjust the baby'sposition in order to stimulate the baby to open hismouth and optimize visualization of the baby' s mouth. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes An ineffective suck may have one or more underlying causes that may be mother and/or baby related. Assess the mother for: Ineffective positioning and latching techniques (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Decreased breast milk supply ( Protocol #12: Insufficient B reast Milk Supply ). Overabundant ( Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x). Delayed letdown or breast milk ejection reflex. Forceful letdown reflex ( Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown Breast Milk Ejection Refle x). Engorgement ( Protocol #5: Engorgement). Assess the baby for: Overheating due to being overdressed or the room temperature being set too high. Birth interventions, trauma, stress and medications,e.g., caesarean section, bruising from forceps orvacuum delivery, anesthesia, intravenous therapy, lengthy labour. Sleepiness possibly to jaundice. Medical conditions, e.g., jaundice, dehydration,hypoglycemia, sepsis, candidiasis, genetic anomalies. Neurological conditions affecting muscle tone, e.g., hypertonia, hypotonia, developmental immaturity inBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 78preterm and/or almost term birth. Abnormal nasal, oral, or facial structure, e.g., narrowing or blockage of the nasal airway (choanalatresia), cleft lip/palate or other alterations in palatalstructure, receding chin. Abnormal tongue, e.g., ankyloglossia, large orshort tongue, tongue curling up to the roof of themouth, tongue sucking/thrusting, decreased tongueperistalsis (Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving and Maintaining a Latch ). An abnormal tongue may not be able to extendpast the lower gumline and cup the areola duringbreastfeeding. This can be assessed by slightly pulling back on the baby's lower lip when thebaby is at the mother's breast. There may also bedimpling of the cheeks or clicking/smacking soundswhen the baby sucks. Preference for sucking on an artificial nipple, e.g.,nipple confusion or imprinting ( Protocol #1: The Initiation of Br eastfeeding ). Suggestions The Baby-Friendly Initiative recommends that wherever possible, breastfeeding support is offered \"hands-off\" ( BFI Appendix 5.1, BCC, 2011 ). As the goal is for mothers to be able to latch their babies independently, it is important for practitioners to request permission to touch the mother or baby and to take a hands-off approach as much as is possible. Hands-on is only used after asking permission and when additional help is necessary ( BCC, 2011 ). 1.Assess for possible cause(s) of the ineffective suck (see the previous section on Possible Contributing Factors or Causes). The baby will need to beassessed by a primary health care provider for anymedical condition, e.g., jaundice, dehydration,hypertonia/hypotonia, cleft lip/palate, ankyloglossia. 2.Provide the mother with suggestions to help the baby suck effectively. Foundational (Non-Invasive) Suggestions Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Breastfeed early and frequently whenever the baby is showing ear ly feeding cues (e.g., rapid eye movements under the eyelids as the baby begins towake, sucking/licking, hands to mouth, increasedbody movements and making small sounds). Breastfeed when the baby is calm, before the babygets too hungry and cries. A ravenous baby maylatch more vigorously and initiate a more activeletdown reflex and/or lead to sore nipples. Clothe the baby in a diaper only when breastfeedingto promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby's back in a vertical chest-to-chestposition, with the nose approaching the mother 's nipple to facilitate the normal neonatal reflexes andself-attachment behaviours. Lightly brush the baby's lips with her nipple toencourage the baby's mouth to open wide and tohelp bring out the baby' s tongue over the lower gumline when latching. Try expressing some breast milk and drippingexpressed breast milk onto the mother's breast toencourage the baby's mouth to open wide. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Check that the baby is effectively positioned and latched (Pr otocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Breastfeed in a calm and quiet environment. Avoid overheating the baby , e.g., overdressing the baby or setting the room temperature too high. Clothe the baby only in a diaper when breastfeedingto promote skin-to-skin contact. Use techniques to help wake a sleepy baby, e.g.gently massage the baby's back and feet, gentlysit the baby up, talk to the baby, change the baby'sdiaper. Use breast compressions to help increase suckingand swallowing (Pr otocol #5: Engorgement). T ry alternate breast massage - alternating massage at the base of the breast with the baby's bursts ofsucking ( Bowles et al., 1988 ). If the baby is still sucking ineffectively, encourage the mother to: Express each breast on a regular basis if breastfeeding is stopped for any length of time.Generally this should be at least 8 times a day, witha minimum of 1 expression overnight, to mimicthe normal infant feeding pattern. The mother mayneed to express more often if her breasts becomeuncomfortable or full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Feed the baby with expressed breast milk usingBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 79an alternative feeding method, e.g., spoon, cup, syringe, finger feeding, or lactation aid on the mother's breast (Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods). Using a lactation aid on the mother's breast isrecommended if the baby is able to latch andmake a seal, because the baby is feeding on themother 's breast while receiving the expressed breast milk. This technique also provides stimulationto the mother's breasts. If expressed breast milkis not available, an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). A referral to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeedingclinic is recommended for further assessment assoon as possible. Understand the possible benefits and risksassociated with the use of nipple shields if sheinquires about using them for managing anineffective suck. Offer further assessment and referfor further support as needed (see notes in General Principles ). If the baby is still not sucking effectively after trying the foundational suggestions above, further assessment is recommended. If it is assessed that the baby has more significant sucking difficulties or may need suck evaluation and therapy, refer the mother to a primary care provider, abreastfeeding expert with specific training in oral-motor evaluation and therapy or, breastfeeding clinicfor further assessment. A parent may be taught to use interventions such as mouth and tongue exercises if she or he is assessed to have the capacity to use them appropriately. Strategies may be initiateddepending on the parent's level of comfort with theinterventions but only by practitioners who have specific training in oral-motor evaluation and therapy,e.g., a speech pathologist, occupational therapist and/or paediatrician. (see also General Principles) . Support the parent to make an informed decision,understanding the possible benefits and risks of theproposed intervention. Support the mother in understanding that: These interventions have the potential to be invasive and may overwhelm a baby, or leadto further resistance unless the baby's cues arerespected. These suggestions follow a sequence of increasingdegrees of intervention and invasiveness. Minimal Level Intervention Suggestions Wash the hands and ensure that the nails are clean and trimmed. A parent who has been taught by an oral-motorexpert may place a clean index finger in the baby'smouth to pacify him or to initiate rhythmic sucking. Use a supplemental feeding device either at the mother's breast or finger feeding to help ensure that the baby is getting adequate calories and fluid intake (Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods). Moderate Level Intervention Suggestions Wash the hands and ensure that the nails are clean and trimmed. A practitioner specifically trained in oral-motorevaluation places a gloved index finger in the baby'smouth to assess the oral cavity and the suck, afterobtaining parental permission. Use a supplemental feeding device to offer adequatecalories and fluid intake (Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods). Place finger pad-side up into the baby's mouth.Slight pressure is placed on the middle of thetongue while pulling the finger out slowly toencourage the baby to suck it back in.( Adapted from Lauwers, 2011 ) Higher Level Intervention Suggestions Wash the hands and ensure that the nails are clean and trimmed. Expert practitioners may recommend mouth andtongue exercises to promote effective sucking.These can be enjoyable for both parent and baby. Support the family to follow instructions taught byan oral-motor expert. A practitioner who specifically initiates the useof these interventions is responsible for assessingeffectiveness and risks. The practitioner is alsoresponsible for the ongoing management andevaluation of that intervention (see General Principles for information regarding possible tongue exercises).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 80General Principles Optimize breastfeeding by following the principles of early and frequent feeding, breastfeeding when the baby is calm and showing early feeding cues, and ensuring effective positioning and latching techniques, including baby-led latching and skin-to-skin contact. Following these principals will help to minimize the degree of any intervention, and support the baby's own sense of control and inherent capacity to self-attach and suckle. This can often prevent or resolve an ineffective suck situation. A baby with an ineffective suck does not demonstrate an effective sucking pattern, i.e., no \"deep and slow\" sucks. Effective sucking technique is defined as the infant having: a wide-open mouth, with the tongue over the gums, and transfer of breast milk from the mother' s breast by slow, deep sucks (Righard & Alade, 1992) (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). The baby may suck well initially, then suck less effectively as the breast milk volume decreases during the breastfeeding. Ineffective positioning and latching practices may contribute to an ineffective suck, and therefore these should always be assessed first (Pr otocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). An ineffective suck is usually related to two general problem areas: attachment (position and latch) or a sucking problem. The ef fectiveness of the suck will determine the amount and composition of breast milk that the baby will receive. The less effective the suck, the less breast milk will be removed and the less high-fat breast milk the baby will receive during the breastfeeding. An ineffective sucking pattern may be transitory due to labour medications/anesthesia or a medical condition that may temporarily cause the baby to be sleepy or have a decreased neurological function. Birth Interventions and Ineffective Suck - The events experienced during the birth process can impact the breastfeeding process. The normal mechanical forces of labour on the cranial nerves and facial muscles can affect the baby's comfort and ability to achieve a latch, as well as his ability to suck, swallow, and transfer breast milk, a situation that may be further complicated by forceps, vacuum, and sur gical interventions ( Smith, 2010 & 2007 ). Long labours can be stressful and tiring for both mother and baby, and may be associated with interventions such as intravenous (IV) hydration, analgesia, epidurals, and instrumental deliveries. IV fluids may be associated with breast or areolar edema, which can make it difficult for a baby to latch, although research has yet to establish the degree of association ( Smith, 2010). Pain is stressful and can interfere with the mother's comfort as well as breast milk production (see How the Breast Works). Although research has not yet established a direct link between specific medications used for intrapartum pain management and breastfeeding initiation, practitioners continue to question whether medication may affect the baby's capacity to suck effectively. In addition, it is important to consider the impact of the birth process on the mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy. Nipple Shields - If the mother inquires about using a nipple shield to manage breast refusal or difficulty achieving a latch, it is important to first explore with her any contributing factors related to ineffective suck, as well as her breastfeeding self-efficacy. It is also important to inquire about her previous breastfeeding history, current breastfeeding management and attempts to manage an ineffective suck and then of fer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding management (see earlier discussion regarding management of ineffective suck). A nipple shield is an artificial nipple and areola shaped like a floppy sun hat, and made of a synthetic material like silicone. Some women may have success placing one of the newer ultra-thin silicone nipple shields over the breast to facilitate latching and sucking. This has the potential to stimulate the baby's hard palate and thereby elicit the sucking reflex. It may be a familiar stimulus to c oax a baby to the mother's breast who has already imprinted preferentially on the supernormal stimulus of an artificial nipple ( Wilson-Clay et al., 2008 ). Historically, there has been mixed evidence reported about nipple shields. Use of the older rubber or latex shields was associated with concerns of inadequate intake of breast milk that resulted in slow weight gain or failure to thrive ( Woolridge, 1980 ). Recent evidence has demonstrated weight gain to be similar over 2 months in babies fed with shields as for babies fed Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 81without shields ( Chertok, 2009 ). Although nipple shields should not be the first strategy recommended to manage an ineffective suck, short-term use of the newer ultra-thin silicone shields has been positively associated with preserving the breastfeeding relationship while the dyad learns to breastfeed ( Meier, 2000; Wilson-Clay, 1996 ). Although a recent review of the literature reported that the current evidence does not yet demonstrate safe practices for the use of nipple shields ( McKechnie et al., 2010 ), expert practitioners continue to report the use of nipple shields as a possible strategy to bring a baby to the mother's breast who might otherwise refuse her breast.Causes for refusal may include flat or inverted nipples,an ineffective suck, prematurity, neuromuscular issues and/or imprinting (Protocol #4: Sore Nipples; Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch). Nipple shields may provide temporary relief for a mother who is stressed or overwhelmed and prevent introduction of bottle feeding if she is supported appropriately by a lactation expert ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Some mothers may wish to use nipple shields for longer periods; these situations should be periodically reassessed. Lawrence advises against the use of a makeshift shield; nor should shields be altered for use. To apply a nipple shield, it is important to use the correct fit and size. If the teat is too long for the baby's mouth it can cause gagging, but if it is too small it may not stimulate active sucking ( Mohrbacher, 2010). The teat opening needs to be large enough to accommodate the mother's nipple comfortably; if it is too small it can slow the flow of breast milk, which is counterproductive. Lauwers recommends starting with the smallest shield that accommodates both the baby's mouth and the mother's nipple. Wilson-Clay advises matching the shield size to the baby's mouth, selecting the shortest available teat with the smallest base diameter ( 2008). Clinicians and mothers may try varying methods to directly apply the shield. In one, the mother holds the rim of the shield between her thumb and fingers. Stretching the shield at the junction of the \"nipple\" and \"areola\" of the shield, she places the stretched shield over her nipple and releases the tension. As it releases and the shield returns to its normal shape, it draws the mother's nipple into the nipple cavity of the shield before the baby begins to suck. Some mothers may turn the top half of the shield inside out before placing it over the nipple. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions related to care and cleaning of the nipple shield. (For further information see Wilson-Clay, 2008, Lauwers, 2011, and Genna et al., 2008). Nipple shields should not be the first strategy recommended to manage an ineffective suck, and they should only be initiated by a health care provider who has the breastfeeding expertise to thoroughly assess the potential effectiveness and risks of use for that breastfeeding dyad. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. Practitioners who do not have the capacity, i.e., lactation expertise or time, to continue to support the dyad appropriately should refer the mother to a lactation expert or breastfeeding clinic. The baby's weight gain and the mother's breast milk supply need to be monitored closely. There must be a comprehensive plan that includes periodic reassessment of breastfeeding and the infant's intake of breast milk, plus a plan for re-establishment of feeding at the breast. Imprinting - The concept of imprinting or \"stamping\" is sometimes used to explain the observation of nipple preference. Imprinting is drawn from other sciences such as biology and psychology, where it has been applied to explain attachment behaviours and brain pathway development. In humans, imprinting is oral/tactile ( Lawrence, 2011 ) and Gale Mobbs ( 1989) has identified the mouth as the most significant factor for imprinting in humans. When babies are exposed to artificial nipples or fingers early they can become accustomed to the feeling of that particular object (bottle nipple, pacifier, finger) in their mouths and have difficulty accepting another object in its place ( Righard, 1997), such as a mother's nipple. For information about the normal suck cycle, see Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding . A specially trained oral-motor practioner can teach parents exercises that may help some babies with establishing an effective suck, including: Tongue massage (see Genna et al., 2008) Pushing the tongue down and out ( see Mohrbacher, 2010) Walking back on the tongue ( see Mohrbacher, 2010)Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 82References Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology [APIC]. 2005.

Parents may label persistent crying as \"colic\". Colic is not a disease, but a syndrome characterized by periods of inconsolable crying. Being unable to soothe her baby's crying can negatively impact a mother's sense of self-efficacy. Observation and Assessment Assess the baby for: Prolonged periods of persistent, inconsolable crying, irritability, or fussiness that may be concentrated in the afternoon and evening. A cry characterized by a high-pitched wail or scream as if the baby were in pain ( St. James-Roberts, 1999 ). Breastfeeding and gaining weight well. Being healthy aside from the colic. A tense body with fists clenched and legs pulled up. A hard abdomen that may be distended. Frequently falling into a deep sleep after a crying period. Breastfeeding frequently for short periods, thenpulling away crying. Being soothed at least temporarily by prompt attent ion such as holding, gentle rocking, walking, or breastfeeding. Any other possible causes of persistent crying, e.g.,illness, hunger, cold, injury, comfort, etc. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes The cause of colic is unknown. Colic or persistent crying may be associated with a feeding problem (e.g., overfeeding, underfeeding, excessive airswallowing), and rarely intolerance to a food in the mother's or baby's diet. It is reported in equal frequency in both breastfed and non-breastfed babies. Crying and colic in the breastfed baby may haveone or more underlying factors. Assess the mother for: Knowledge of normal baby crying and breastfeeding behaviours. Maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy, stress andcoping challenges, including available support. Ineffective positioning and latching practices(Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching). Switching breasts before the baby is finished breastfeeding from the first breast, i.e., the baby is finished the first breast when he is no longer sucking and swallowing effectively, and the breast feelssignificantly softer (Pr otocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). An overabundant supply/forceful breast milk Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Reflex). Cigarette smoking. Maternal medication or substance use. Ingestion of a food or beverage to which the baby may be sensitive (rare). Suggestions 1.Offer information to the mother about normal baby crying and breastfeeding behaviours. Encourage the mother in understanding that: Babies cry to signal a need for comfort, warmth, food, mother's presence, or to be held. Babies cry an average of 2-2\u00bd hours a day, peakingat around 2 months, and gradually decreasing by the fourth or fifth month ( Barr, 2006 ). Babies may cry for long periods, with no obvious cause, and may be inconsolable. Babies may look like they are in pain even when they are not. Babies may cry more in the afternoons and evenings. Crying is a late signal of hunger. Breastfeedings are frequent and sometimes inclusters.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 84Encourage the mother to: Respond promptly to her baby's crying. Understand that she is not spoiling her baby when she responds promptly to crying and/or holds her baby. 2. Offer information on soothing techniques. Encourage the mother to try soothing techniques such as: Holding the baby skin-to-skin (chest-to-chest). Cuddling or rocking the baby. Carrying the baby in a carrier. Wrapping the baby loosely in a blanket to reduce stimuli. Breastfeeding the baby . Burping the baby. Changing the baby's diaper. Giving the baby a bath. Giving the baby a massage. Taking the baby to a quiet room. Placing the baby near \"white noise\", e.g., vacuum cleaner, kitchen or bathroom fan, running water,clock, hairdryer, bubbling fish tank. Laying the alert baby in a prone position and patting the baby's back. The alert baby may lie prone in the crib, across the mother's lap or along her forearmwith the baby's head and chest well supported by her hand. Young babies who are not able to turn over from their back to their abdomen on their own should not be left on their abdomen or side to sleep. A back sleeping position has been associated with a decreased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in young babies. For further information see Safe Sleep for Your Baby ( PHAC, 2010 ). 3.Offer information and support for the mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy, including assessment of her coping capacities and resources. Encourage the mother in understanding that: Crying and colic are not reflective of the baby's feelings about her. Crying is unlikely to be related to breastfeedingwhen her baby is gaining weight well. 4.Assess the baby for ineffective positioning andlatching practices ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching). Encourage the mother in understanding that: Ineffective positioning and latching practices increase the likelihood that the baby will swallowexcessive air. Encourage the mother to: Use effective positioning and latching practices. 5.Assess whether the mother switches breasts before her baby has finished the first side i.e., the baby is finished with the first breast when he is no longer actively sucking and swallowing and the breast feels significantly softer ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Encourage the mother in understanding that: The fat content of breast milk changes during a breastfeeding. The baby initially receives breast milkthat is lower in fat and there is a disproportionateratio of lactose (milk sugar) to fat. As the breastfeeding progresses and the breast empties, thefat content of the breast milk increases. If she switches breasts before the baby is finished with the first breast, then the baby may receive mostly lower fat breast milk at that breastfeeding. The lower fat content of the diet may cause rapid gastric emptying and too much lactose reaching the intestines too soon. If there is not enough of the enzyme lactase in the baby's digestive system to break down and absorb this rapid loading of lactose, the baby may have symptoms of lactose malabsorption that may resemble lactose intolerance, e.g., crying, gas, and explosive watery-greenish bowel movements. A baby who reacts to an overload of lower fat breast milk is not lactose intolerant and does not need to beswitched to a lactose-free formula. The breastfeedingmother does not need a lactose-free diet. Encourage the mother to: Allow her baby to finish breastfeeding from the first breast before offering the other side. The baby isfinished with the first breast when no longer sucking and swallowing effectively and the breast feelssignificantly softer.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 85 Use breast compressions while breastfeeding to encourage the baby to suck and swallow effectively(see Protocol #5: Engorgement for a description of breast compressions). Alternate the breast she offers first at eachbreastfeeding. 6. Assess the mother for an overabundant breast milk supply/forceful letdown reflex ( Protocol #13: Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x). If the mother has an overabundant breast milk supply/forceful letdown, inform her that: A baby who receives too much breast milk too quickly may become fussy and swallow excessive air as a result of struggling with the breast milkoverflow. The baby may choke, cough, or struggle at the breast shortly after beginning the feed. The baby may come off the breast several timesduring the breastfeeding and often the mother'sbreast milk will spray. The baby may partially or completely refuse thebreast over time. This typically occurs at 3-6months of age. Encourage the mother to: Try the suggestions outlined in Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk-Ejection Refle x. 7.Assess whether the mother smokes cigarettes. Smoking is not recommended in breastfeeding mothers. If the mother smokes cigarettes, inform her that: Colic has been associated with parental smoking independent of the type of feeding ( Reijneveld et al., 2000). Nicotine rapidly concentrates in breast milkimmediately after smoking. Nicotine and majormetabolites have also been found in the breast milkof mothers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Excessive nicotine in breast milk may irritate the baby's gastrointestinal system and may causevomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, andfussiness. Nicotine may also decrease breast milk supply.Note: Breastfeeding is still recommended over artificial baby milk if the mother smokes. Encourage the mother to: Try to quit smoking or decrease the number of cigarettes she smokes. Information about smoking cessation is available from the Smokers' Helpline at 1-877-513-5333 or online at: http://www. smokershelpline.ca/. Try to smoke immediately after breastfeeding when the baby is sleeping for longer periods (the half-life of nicotine in breast milk is between 60-90 minutes) ( AAP, 2005 ). Avoid exposing the baby to second-hand smoke from any source. Do not smoke indoors or in the car. Children exposed to second-hand smoke have an increased risk for health problems such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infections, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding). (Adapted from CAMH.) 8.Assess for a family history of food allergies. First rule out all other possible causes of crying. Encourage the mother in understanding that: Diet is rarely the cause of colic. There is some evidence that cow's milk proteins may play a role in infant colic ( CPS, 2011 ), although much of the research is infant formula-based. It is possible that some foods in the mother's diet may be passed on to the breast milk and may cause the baby to be colicky,although this is unusual. This is more likely if thereis a family history of allergies. The most commonfoods that may affect the baby are made from cow'smilk, although other proteins have been implicated,e.g., beef, eggs, fish, soy, peanuts, nuts, wheat (andrelated glutens such as triticale, barley, and oats) andhigh-acid fruits or vegetables. A sensitivity to cow's milk proteins does not meanthat the baby is lactose intolerant. A mother whois lactose intolerant herself should continue tobreastfeed. A food and symptoms diary may help to identify any relationships between activities, times of day and/or foods eaten by the mother with the baby's crying. To prevent possible nutrient deficiencies it isimportant that any elimination of foods be donein consultation with a Registered Dietitian. ForBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 86example, calcium is a specific concern if milk products are removed from the diet. A Registered Dietitian can offer counselling and nutrition advice to ensure a healthy and balanced diet. Encourage the mother to: Keep a food and symptom diary for a few days. Make specific note of the times of crying, associated activities, mother's diet, and the baby's stool andgastrointestinal symptoms. Consult a Registered Dietitian before proceedingwith an elimination diet. 9.Ensure that the baby is medically assessed for possible health problems that may aggravate thecrying or colic or may actually be the underlyingcause of the colicky symptoms, e.g., ear infection,diaper rash, urinary tract infection. General Principles Crying and colic can be a significant source of stress for a mother. She may feel guilty, believing that it is something she did or ate that is to blame for her baby's distress. She may seek to identify causes such as food sensitivities or allergies in herself or her baby, however rarely they may occur. Most significant, she may feel overwhelmed and frustrated, unable to help her baby, which undermines her self-confidence and negatively impacts her maternal self-efficacy. It is important for parents to understand normal infant crying, as well as normal breastfeeding, so that they can develop realistic expectations for their babies' behaviours. Maternal knowledge about infant crying may increase with educational materials such as the Purple Period of Crying program developed by the National Centre on Shaken Baby Syndrome (Barr, 2009). Colic is not a disease, but a syndrome whereby the baby has periods of inconsolable crying with no apparent physical cause (see the section in Observation and Assessment for a list of colic symptoms). Colic usually begins about 2-3 weeks after birth, peaks in the second month, and subsides by 3-6 months. A medical condition may be present if colic continues beyond 3-4 months. The cause of colic is unknown. Colic may be defined in many ways, making it difficult to establish definitive conclusions about colic, as noted in a systematic review ( Lucassen et al., 2001 ). It is frequently defined in the research by Wessel's \"Rule of Threes\": Crying for more than 3 hours a day, for more than 3 days a week and for more than 3 weeks ( Wessel (1954) in Barr, 2006) . Aside from the periods of inconsolable crying, a colicky baby is otherwise healthy, breastfeeding and gaining weight well. The baby should be assessed for any breastfeeding or health problem that may aggravate the colic or actually be the underlying cause of the crying episodes, e.g., poor positioning and latching, ear infection, diaper rash, urinary tract infection. Colic is often confused with fussiness. A fussy baby is fussy most of the time, whereas a colicky baby is usually fussy only during the colic spells; either may be normal infant crying behaviours. Colic is reported with equal frequency in babies who are fed breast milk, infant formula, and/or mixed feeding. ( Lawrence, 2011 ). Colic-like behaviours have been associated with neurologic hypersensitivity. High responsiveness during a neurobehavioural assessment predicted those infants who cried frequently and met a definition of colic ( St. James-Roberts et al., 2003 ). Colic-like behaviours have been associated with maternal medication and substance use ( Ito, 2000; Lauwers & Swisher, 2011; Leung et al., 2004 ). Crying is a common reason that a new parent will seek medical attention. \"Caring for a baby who cries persistently can exhaust and undermine the confidence of any mother\" ( Pauli- Potti, 2000 in Riordan ). It is important to assess and monitor the mother's emotional well-being and to help her identify possible sources of physical and emotional support. The significance to the mother of feeling that she has the right support cannot be underestimated. A systematic review of treatments for colic found some treatments to be effective, but further and more rigorous scientific evaluation needs to be done to determine the efficacy of most treatments. The review found limited evidence to support the use of pharmaceuticals such as simethicone ( Garrison et al., 2000). The evidence regarding the benefits of hypoallergenic diets by breastfeeding mothers is inconclusive. There is limited evidence to support the use of soy formula for formula fed babies. The evidence is inconclusive regarding behaviouralBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 87interventions such as carrying, car rides, parent training, and infant stimulation. There are concerns regarding the use of herbal teas for babies because prolonged use may lead to decreased breast milk intake ( Garrison, 2000 ). In addition it is always important that there is caution regarding any use of natural health products because there is not enough scientific information about the safety of various herbs and natural health products for either the mother or baby to recommend their general use in breastfeeding (see Protocol #16:Drugs and Breastfeeding for further informationregarding natural health products). Stress related to persistent crying and colic can negatively impact a mother's breastfeeding experience. Stress may interfere with the hormones of lactation, potentially negatively affecting breast milk letdown and production (see How the Breast Works). Mothers of infants diagnosed with colic were less likely to find breastfeeding to be an effective way to comfort their babies. Howard et al. found that breastfeeding to comfort a crying baby had a protective effect on the duration of partial but not exclusive or full breastfeeding ( Howard et al., 2006 ).

It is rarely related to a maternal physical condition but is more frequently related to inadequate removal of breast milk from the mother's breast. There may be low breast milk supply or a misunderstanding of the baby's feeding behaviour; it may be actual or perceived. Ultimately, the question becomes \"Is the baby getting enough breast milk?\" Observation and Assessment 1.The baby may have one or more signs that may indica te a problem of inadequate breast milk intake. Assess the baby for: Absence of effective sucking and swallowing at the mother's breast (e.g., few or no deep and slowsucks). Inadequate urine and stool output (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). A loss of more than 7% of birth weight in the first 3 days of life. Inadequate weight gain. A weight gain of less than20-35 g ( - 1\u00bc oz) per day for the first 3 - 4months of age (after the initial weight loss in thefirst 3 days of life and showing a pattern of gainingby 5 days of life). Breastfed babies tend to growmore quickly than non-breastfed babies in the first6 months and grow more slowly in the second 6months of life. ( Pr otocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Birth weight that is not regained by 10 days of age. Possible lethar gy, irritability, and/or breast refusal. However, some babies with inadequate weight gainmay mistakenly appear to have a personality that iscontent and placid. Signs of dehydration, e.g., sunken fontanelle,sunken eyes, dry mucus membranes, Effective Breastfeeding ). 2.The mother may have one or more signs that may indicate a problem with actual low br east milk supply or lactation failure .Assess the mother for: No signs of the breast milk ejection or letdown reflex. Mothers may not recognize a letdownreflex unless they feel it but may recognize whenthe baby's sucks change from shallow and quickto deep and slow (Protocol #3: Signs of EffectiveBreastfeeding ). No breast changes after birth (e.g., no breastengorgement or breast milk coming in). No breast changes during pregnancy (e.g., no tenderness, darkening of the areola, enlargement, orleaking). No or minimal breast changes during puberty. One breast that is markedly different in size and/or shape from the other. Unusually shaped breasts or widely spaced breasts,e.g., cone shaped breasts ( Wilson-Clay, 2008 ). Breast injury, surgery, or biopsy in which majornerves and ducts in the mother's breasts aredamaged, e.g., burns to the mother's breast, breastreduction with incisions to the areola and/or nipple.Breast implants usually do not affect breast milksupply . History of fertility concerns or metabolicconditions, e.g., diabetes, thyroid, polycystic ovarysyndrome (PCOS). Loss of sensation in the mother's breast. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Assess the baby for: Delay in the initiation of breastfeeding after birth (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 90 Ineffective positioning and latching ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Medical conditions that may compromise the baby's suck (e.g., jaundice, dehydration,hypertonia/hypotonia, cleft lip/palate, abnormaltongue, birth and Protocol #14: Jaundice in a Br eastfed baby). The baby needs to be assessed by a primaryhealth care provider to rule out any medicalcondition. Ineffective or weak suck ( Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck). Inadequate frequency and duration of breastfeedings (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Supplementation ( for Supplementation or of Br eastfeeding ). Use of bottles and pacifiers. Assess the mother for: Knowledge of normal lactogenesis (breast milk production) and infant feeding and sleepbehaviours. Ineffective breastfeeding management, e.g.,infrequent breastfeeding, inadequate breast milkremoval. Lack of confidence in her ability to breastfeed. Supplementation for inadequate breast milk supply or perceived inadequate breast milk supply(Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Engor gement lasting for more than 48 hours (Protocol #5: Engorgement). Uncontrolled pain. Significant stress. Delayed Lactogenesis II due to postpartum or intrapartum complications interventions, postpartum hemorrhage,retained placenta, Sheehan's (pituitaryinsufficiency due blood loss and shockduring childbirth). (see Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck regarding birth interventions). Maternal medical conditions that may delay ordecrease breast milk supply, e.g., diabetes, anemia,hypertension, untreated hypothyroidism, pituitarydisorders. Use of herbs and medications that decrease breastmilk supply (e.g., sage, contraceptives containing estrogen, ergot alkaloids, thiazide cold preparations such as decongestants) ( Hale, 2010 ). Cigarette smoking. Excessive alcohol consumption. Acute dehydration or excess fluid intake. Use of a pacifier to delay breastfeedings. Pregnancy. Congenital insufficient glandular tissue (seeGeneral Principles ). Breast injury, surgery, or biopsy in which majornerves and ducts in the mother 's breasts are damaged (e.g., burns to the mother's breast, breast reductionwith incisions to the areola and/or nipple). Breast implants usually do not af fect breast milk supply. Suggestions 1.Assess whether the mother has a perceived or an actual insufficient breast milk supply. If theexclusively breastfed baby has adequate urineand stool output and is gaining weight well,offer reassurance to the mother that she does havesufficient breast milk supply. 2.Reassure her that the following signs do not indicate an insufficient breast milk supply: Fussiness with adequate weight gain ( Protocol #1 1: Crying and Colic in the Breastfed Baby ). Frequent breastfeedings (at least 8 times within 24 hours). Increased breastfeedings during a growth spurt.Growth spurts may occur at any time. These arecommonly described as occurring at, but arenot limited to, 10 days to 2 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3months, and later ( Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Cluster breastfeedings. These are periods whenthe baby breastfeeds frequently, followed byperiods when the baby sleeps longer betweenbreastfeedings. These are most common in the lateafternoon and evening. Baby takes a bottle after breastfeeding (many babieswill suck on anything even if they are full becausethey find sucking pleasurable). Breasts that normally soften 10-14 days after birthdue to the mother's breasts adjusting to the baby'sneeds.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 91 Lack of sensation when the letdown reflex occurs, or a decreased letdown reflex sensation. The mothershould also look for other signs of the letdownreflex such as when the baby's sucks change fromshallow and quick to deep and slow. Breasts that have little or no leaking. Mother reports expressing no breast milk or only asmall amount of breast milk. If the mother is assessed to have an actual insufficient breast milk supply, assess for possible cause(s) for this condition (see the previous section on Possible Contributing Factors or Causes). 3.If the baby is showing signs of inadequate weight gain, the baby needs to be assessed by a primary health care provider to rule out any possible medical condition such as jaundice, dehydration, urinary tract infection, hypertonia/hypotonia, cleft lip/palate,abnormal tongue, or birth trauma. If the baby has an ineffective suck, refer to Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck .If the mother's breasts are engorged, refer to Protocol #5: Engorgement. 4.If breastfeeding management is assessed to be ineffective or not optimal, offer suggestions to optimize breastfeeding management ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). It is always appropriate for the breastfeeding to be assessed and optimized. 5.If the baby is showing signs of failure to thrive, the baby needs to be referred to a primary health care provider for further assessment and monitoring. Immediate supplementation may be medically indicated if the baby is truly failing to thrive (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding). Offer information to the mother so that she can recognize and observe signs of slow weight gain asdiffering from failure to thrive (see chart below) Slow weight gain Gains weight slowly and consistentlyFailure to thrive Very low, erratic, or no weight gain alert, responsive, healthy appearance normal muscle tone good skin turgor pale, diluted urine, 6 or more times/day frequent seedy stool, or infrequent large stool breastfeeding well 8 or more breastfeedings/day good suck good letdown reflex weight gain consistent but slowapathetic, lethargic, or weak cry poor muscle tone poor skin turgor concentrated \"strong\" urine, few times/day infrequent scant stools difficult or ineffective breastfeeding, oftenfrom birth fewer than 8 breastfeedings/day, usually brief may have poor suck no signs of functioning letdown reflex poor or erratic weight gain ( 3rd percentileor crosses down two percentile lines); maylose weight (Adapted from Giuliani, 2002,and Lawrence, 2010)Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 926.If the mother is assessed to have an actual insufficient breast milk supply, then provide her with suggestions to increase her breast milk supply. Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Follow early feeding cues to breastfeed frequently (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Ensure that the letdown reflex is initiated. The baby'srooting, sucking and hands on the mother's breasts arethe natural stimuli for letdown when breastfeeding isinitiated early, before the baby is overly hungry and begins crying (see early feeding cues in Protocol #3:Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). The mother can try the following ideas to initiate letdown: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Use relaxation strategies, such as a warm shower, heat applied to her back and shoulders, relaxationbreathing, a warm drink, supportive positions. Manage pain to support, comfort, and relax tofacilitate breast milk letdown. Initiate breastfeeding early, before the baby isstressed and crying. Clothe the baby in only a diaper to promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby in a vertical chest-to-chestposition, with the nose approaching the mother'snipple, to facilitate the baby's reflexes and self-attachment behaviours. Gently massage her breasts. Apply moist or dry heatto her breasts for a few minutes before or duringmassage until letdown occurs. Heat may be appliedwith a warm, wet towel or disposable diaper, awarm bath or shower, a bowl of warm water, aheating pad on low, or a hot water bottle wrappedin a cloth. Then gently express some breast milk(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Stimulate the nipples. Gently roll her nipplesbetween the index finger and thumb for severalminutes or until the letdown reflex occurs. Thengently express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Breastfeed frequently-at least 8 times a day, including at least once overnight, if the baby isyounger than 6 months old. Dress the baby in a diaper only when breastfeedingto promote skin-to-skin contact. Use effective positioning and latching practices(Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Ensure that the baby is sucking and swallowingeffectively at each breastfeeding. Offer both breasts at each feeding to increasestimulation to the mother's breasts. Try \"switch nursing\" if the baby is sleepy or losesinterest quickly. Offering each breast 2-3 timesduring a feeding to keep the baby interested as thebaby's sucking slows down, can help to optimizethe amount of time the baby actively sucks andswallows. The term \"switch nursing\" has been usedby La Leche League leaders ( LLLI, 2011 ). If the baby breastfeeds on only one side, encouragethe mother to express some breast milk from theother breast. This will ensure that both breasts arestimulated at each feeding. Use breast compressions to help stimulate suckingand swallowing (see Protocol #5: Engorgement fora description of breast compressions). Feed the baby only breast milk for the first6 months of life unless supplementation ismedically indicated ( Protocol Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Breastfeed the baby first, then offer solid foods oncethe baby has begun taking solid foods. Breast milkis the primary source of nutrition. Note: Mothers are advised to exclusively breastfeed their babies to 6 months of age and to introduce nutrient-rich solid foods, with particular attention to iron, at 6 months, with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years and beyond ( TPH, 2010 ). After breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Eat and drink according to Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Avoid using bottles and pacifiers. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and caffeine. Express both breasts after breastfeeding to increase stimulation to the mother's breasts (Protocol #19:Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Get help from family and friends with cleaning,cooking, caring for the baby, caring for otherchildren.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 93If the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively, encourage the mother to: Express each breast after each time that the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeedingis stopped for any length of time, encourage themother to express each breast regularly in orderto maintain her breast milk supply. Generally,this should be at least 8 times in 24 hours, witha minimum of 1 expression overnight, to mimicthe normal pattern of feeding. The mother mayneed to express more often if her breasts becomeuncomfortable or overly full ( Pr otocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Feed the baby with expressed breast milk usingan alternative feeding method, e.g., cup, spoon,syringe, finger feeding, lactation aid on the mother's breast. Using a lactation aid on the mother'sbreast is recommended over the other alternativefeeding methods if the baby is able to latch ontothe mother's breast. This method allows the babyto remain at the mother's breast and providesthe mother's breasts with stimulation ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). If expressed breast milk is not available and it is assessed thatsupplementation is medically indicated, then anappropriate supplement should be offered (Protocol#17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessationof Breastfeeding). Consult a breastfeeding expert or breastfeedingclinic for further assessment as soon as possible. If the mother and baby are unresponsive to non-pharmacological strategies to optimize breast milk supply and the mother inquires about the use of a galactagogue, encourage her to: Understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of galactagogues if sheinquires about using such medications or herbs formanaging an insufficient breast milk supply. It isimportant that mothers be aware of this informationin order to make a fully informed decision aboutthe use of galactagogues. Offer further assessmentand refer for further support as needed (see notes inGeneral Principles ). Continue to support strategies that optimize breastfeeding. Mothers should consult a breastfeeding expert orbreastfeeding clinic.Before the use of galactagogues is considered, it is essential to optimize all non-pharmacological measures to optimize breastfeeding management, including a thorough breastfeeding assessment. If the mother inquires about using a galactagogue to increase breast milk supply, it is important to first explore with her any possible underlying causes of insufficient breast milk supply. It is also important to inquire about her current breastfeeding management practices and attempts to manage her breast milk supply, and then offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding management and to support her in making a fully informed decision.(see General Principles). 7.If the mother has had breast surgery such as augmentation or reduction mammoplasty, breast injury, or is suspected of having congenitalinsufficient glandular tissue, she should be referredto a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic fora thorough assessment. She should be encouraged toattempt breastfeeding, as full or partial lactation isoften possible. General Principles A common concern that mothers have in the early postpartum period is that they do not have enough breast milk for their baby. This is one of the most common reasons given by mothers for discontinuing breastfeeding or for supplementing with artificial baby milk. It is often the case that insufficient breast milk supply is a perceived and not an actual problem. This may be due in part to a lack of knowledge regarding normal infant behaviours and cues, and the normal process of breastfeeding, e.g., growth spurts, clusters, and frequent breastfeedings. Riordan defines insufficient breast milk as \"insufficient breast milk production to sustain normal infant weight gain despite appropriate breastfeeding routines, maternal motivation to continue breastfeeding, and skilled assistance with breastfeeding problems\" ( Riordan, 2010 ). Very few mothers experience actual insufficient breast milk supply if breastfeeding is appropriately managed from birth ( Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding ). Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 94Insufficient breast milk supply that is permanent and irreversible can be caused by congenital insufficient glandular tissue, or breast injury, surgery, or biopsy in which the major nerves and ducts in the mother's breasts are damaged, e.g., burns to the mother's breast or breast reduction with incisions to the areola and/or nipple. Breast implants usually do not affect breast milk supply. Mothers with breast injury or surgery may be able to breastfeed exclusively, whereas women with true congenital insufficient glandular tissue will need to use supplementation with breastfeeding ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding). It is rare for a woman to be born with congenital insufficient glandular tissue. This condition is referred to as primary lactation failure and is due to the underdevelopment of the alveoli (breast milk producing cells) and lactiferous ducts. A mother with this condition will often report that she experienced no changes to her breasts during pregnancy or after birth, e.g., no enlargement, tenderness, or breast milk coming in. Each breast may also be markedly different in size and/or shape, with one breast being much larger than the other. One or both breasts may also be unusually shaped, e.g., cone shaped. Slow weight gain/failure to thrive/inadequate breast milk intake - Low intake of breast milk means low caloric intake, which compromises weight gain, height, and most significantly head circumference. In turn these have been associated with compromised development and cognition. Galactagogues If the mother inquires about the use of medications or herbs to increase breast milk supply, it is important to first explore with her any contributing factors related to insufficient breast milk supply, as well as her breastfeeding self-efficacy . It is also important to inquire about her previous breastfeeding history, current breastfeeding management and attempts to manage her insufficient breast milk supply, and then offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding before introducing further interventions (see notes above). If she is unresponsive to non-pharmacological measures to enhance breast milk supply, refer her to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. Before using any substance to increase breast milk supply a thorough assessment of breastfeeding, including breast milk supply and breast milk transfer, is essential. There continues to be limited data in the form of controlled trials regarding the use of medications and herbs as galactagogues to establish standardized dosages, to determine the mechanism of action, efficacy and potential risks for the baby, or possible interactions with other medications. There is a lack of rigorous evaluations and standardizations ( Zuppa et al., 2010 ). A frequently cited study by Swafford and Berens that reported a significant increase in breast milk volume with use of fenugreek was only an observational study of 10 women, and was not published beyond a conference abstract ( Swafford et al., 2000 ). The updated Protocol of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine reports that emerging data suggest more caution be exercised in recommending galactagogues than in its previous edition ( ABM, 2011 ). Both the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Protocol #9 (2011) and Lawrence ( 2011) include appendices that present the current \"minimal specific data\" known for common galactagogues ( ABM, 2011 ). Galactagogues should not be the first strategy recommended to manage an insufficient breast milk supply and they should only be initiated by a health care provider who has the breastfeeding expertise to thoroughly assess the potential effectiveness and risks of use for the breastfeeding pair. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. Practitioners who do not have the capacity, i.e., lactation expertise or time, to continue to support the dyad appropriately should refer the mother to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. It is important that mothers be aware of this information in order to make an informed decision as well as how to monitor themselves and the baby for possible side effects. See the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine's Protocol #9: Use of Galactagogues in Initiating or Maternal Milk Secretion ( ABM, 2011 ) (Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding) . Health Canada has regulations to ensure the quality, effectiveness, and safety of natural health products (herbs). Natural health products approved under these regulations will have a Natural Product Number (NPN) or Drug Information Number - Homeopathic Medicine (DIN-HM) on the label. Few products have been tested for safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding and are thereby not recommended by Health Canada for use in breastfeeding.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 95Other messages about the use of herbs and natural remedies are mixed. According to Riordan, the use of herbs to stimulate breast milk production is \"extraordinarily common today\"; however, scientific evidence for their use is minimal ( Riordan, 2010 ). Many herbal remedies have been used throughout history to enhance breast milk supply. Most have not been scientifically evaluated but traditional use suggests safety and possible efficacy ( ABM, 2011 ). In the absence of scientific studies on herbs in lactation, many lactation experts turn to the work of Sheila Humphrey ( 2003). Humphrey has developed a body of information about the use of herbs in lactation, but it does not include controlled studies. Riordan also advises practitioners to honour cultural practices as well as to advise mothers that herbs may have pharmacological effects on their baby. At this time there is not enough scientific information about the safety of various herbs and natural health products to recommend their general use during breastfeeding. Breastfeeding women should use natural products with caution and always consult with their health care provider with breastfeeding expertise. Medications that may increase breast milk supply (galactagogues): Refer mothers to a health car e provider with breastfeeding expertise. Domperidone (Motilium) is a medication that may increase breast milk supply by stimulating the production of prolactin. It is traditionally used to treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The evidence for use of domperidone as a galactagogue, although limited, is the strongest available evidence, with a few small sample size controlled trials ( Da Silva, 2004; W an, 2008; Campbell-Yeo, 2010 ). Recommendation as a galactagogue is considered \"off label\" use in Canada. The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of domperidone by lactating women. The FDA warnings were based on reports of increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death in patients receiving high-dose intravenous domperidone concurrently with chemotherapy. In this case it was used as an antiemetic, not a galactagogue. Domperidone does not easily pass the blood-brain barrier ( Zuppa, 2010; Lawrence, 2011 ). Da Silva notes that only a minimal amount of domperidone passes into breast milk and is ingested by the infant, and advises that the use of domperidone is appropriate for lactating women with low breast milk supply who are unresponsive to non-pharmacological measures ( Da Silva, 2004 ). Wan et al. ( 2008) found that domperidone only increased the breast milk supply in about two-thirds of mothers. Hale (2010) states it is the ideal galactagogue and rates it as L1. A prescription is required. It is essential that mothers be aware of the risks associated with high dosages as well as other side effects, along with the benefits of domperidone, when making a decision to use it. Side effects of domperidone in the mother include dry mouth, skin rash, itching, headache, thirst, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and drowsiness ( Hale, 2010 ). Metroclopramide (Maxeran) is a medication that is also used to increase breast milk supply, although its primary use is as a gastrointestinal stimulant. Not all women respond to it and the effects are dose dependent. Hale rates it as L2. Side effects that include fatigue, irritability, and depression may limit compliance ( Hale, 2010 ). It is known as Reglan in the USA. A prescription is required. Herbs that may increase breast milk supply (possible galactagogues): Refer mothers to a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic. Fenugreek and blessed thistle are two herbs that have been traditionally recommended by some breastfeeding experts for increasing breast milk supply without apparent adverse effects. Hale rates both fenugreek and blessed thistle as L3 or moderately safe ( Hale, 2010 ). This expert opinion is based on clinical observation, including anecdotal evidence. Currently there are no clinical trials to establish efficacy or dosage, risks to the mother or baby, or possible interactions with other medications. Other herbs that have been used traditionally include borage, goat's rue, milk thistle (Silybum marianum), dandelion, millet, oats, anise, basil, marshmallow and others ( ABM, 2011 ). Herbs may be included in traditional foods for breastfeeding mothers. Breastfeeding women should consider the use of herbs and natural health products with caution and always consult with their health care provider with breastfeeding expertise. There are no clinically determined or standardized safe dosages: Hale suggests a dosage of fenugreek of 6 grams per day ( Hale, 2010 ). Lawrence suggests a usual dosage as 1-4 capsules (580-610 mg) 3-4 times a day, orBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 96a cup of tea (\u00bc tsp seeds crushed in 8 oz water) 3 times a day, although there is no standardized dose ( 2010). Hale says blessed thistle lacks justification asa galactagogue, although he does state that it isvirtually nontoxic ( 2010). Lawrence says it is not a galactagogue and is confused with milk thistle( 2011). There have been reported concerns related to allergic reactions ( Hale, 2010 ) and lowering of blood sugar. He suggests an adult dose of 1.5 to 3 gramsin tea up to 3 times a day. At this time both HealthCanada and Medline advise against the use ofblessed thistle in breastfeeding women due to a lackof reliable research and limited safety information. Mothers may also find information about the use of galactagogues available on the Internet.

It may be combined with a forceful letdown or breast milk ejectio n reflex. The baby may become distressed trying to cope with too much breast milk flowing too quickly. Signs of difficulty may occur a different phases of breastfeeding or ages of the baby. Optimizing breastfeeding will help the baby to manage the br east milk flow r elated to an overabundant breast milk supply or a forceful letdown. Observation and Assessment Initial Phase (the first 3 months) Assess the mother for: An overabundant breast milk supply. Pain with the initial letdown or breast milk ejection reflex, which is usually the most forceful. The painis due to stretching of the breast milk ducts. Breast milk spraying or squirting from one breastwhile the baby is feeding on the other breast. Breast milk leaking between feedings. Recurrent plugged ducts and mastitis. Assess the baby for: Choking, gulping, or sputtering when the mother's breast milk lets down forcefully. Fussiness and gassiness due to excessive air beingswallowed during and/or after breastfeeding. Spitting up excessively after breastfeeding. Coming off the mother's breast several times duringthe breastfeeding with the mother 's breast milk spraying. A poor latch on the nipple or only on a smallportion of the areola. A poor suck and swallow pattern when the mother' s breast milk lets down forcefully. This may continuethroughout part or all of the breastfeeding. The inability to \"comfort suck\" on the mother'sbreast. The baby may use other methods for comfort such as sucking on the thumb and fingers. A strong suck that maintains or increases anabundant breast milk supply . Adequate urine/stool output or weight gain. Explosive and watery green stools. This mayoccur because the baby receives too much lowerfat breast milk too fast. This may happen when ababy is switched to the second breast too soon, i.e.before the baby is allowed to finish the first breast.The baby is finished with the first breast when sheis no longer sucking and swallowing effectivelyand the mother' s breast feels significantly softer. (See General Principles for further discussionof 'explosive' and watery green stools. See alsoProtocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding, and Protocol #1 1: Crying and Colic in the Breastfed Baby). Later Phase (3 - 6 months) Assess the mother for: Decreased breast milk supply ( Protocol #12: Insufficient B reast Milk Supply ). Diminished letdown reflex. Delaying breastfeeding even when the baby is showing feeding cues. Assess the baby for: Ineffective breastfeeding for some or all breastfeedings. Assess the suck-swallow co-ordination. Partially or completely refusing the mother's breast. Inadequate weight gain. Dehydration. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Assess the mother for: Switching the baby from one breast to the other sideBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 99before the baby is finished the first breast. The baby is finished with the first breast when he/she is no longer sucking and swallowing effectively and the mother's breast feels significantly softer (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). \u00b0 Switching breasts too soon may: -Increase stimulation to the mother's breastswhich may increase breast milk production. - Cause the baby to receive more lowerfat breast milk from two breasts insteadof feeding from one breast long enoughto receive the fat as more breast milk isremoved from the breast. Knowledge of infant breastfeeding behaviours. Delaying or scheduling breastfeedings. Waiting for the baby to cry before offering themother's breast. Crying is a late sign of hunger(Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding for Early Feeding Cues). Assess the baby for: Being overly hungry and frantic, showing signs of late feeding cues, i.e. crying, fussiness, exhaustion,falling asleep ( Protocol # 1: The Initiation of Br eastfeeding ). Ineffective positioning and latching. Suggestions 1.Assess for possible cause(s) of an overabundant breast milk supply/overactive letdown reflex (seeprevious section on Possible Contributing Factors or Causes). 2.Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with an overabundant breast milk supply/forceful letdown reflex. Initial Phase (the first 3 months Encourage the mother to: Breastfeed early and frequently whenever the baby shows early f eeding cues, e.g., rapid eye movements under the eyelids as the baby begins to wake,sucking/licking, hands to mouth, increased bodymovement, and making small sounds. Breastfeed when the baby is calm, before the babygets too hungry or frantic. A ravenous baby maylatch more vigorously and cause a more activeletdown reflex. Breastfeed in a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Clothe the baby in a diaper only when breastfeedingto promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby's back so that the baby is in avertical position, chest-to-chest with the mother,with the baby's nose approaching the mother'snipple. Use effective positioning and latching techniques,i.e., the baby is supported in a vertical chest-to-chest position so that the baby's head is able to tiltback slightly and the chin touches the mother 's breast first. This will direct the flow of breast milkupward towards the hard palate and not to the backof the baby's throat, making it more comfortablefor the baby to manage the breast milk flow (seeProtocol #2: Positioning and Latching for a d iscussion on Baby-led latching). Finish the first breast first ( Renfrew et al., 2004 ). Allow the baby to breastfeed on the first breast until he isno longer sucking and swallowing effectively. Offerthe second breast if the baby is interested. Some mothers may: Offer only one breast at each breastfeeding. Offer the same breast from the previous breastfeeding again if the baby wants to breastfeedwithin 1-1\u00bd hours of the last breastfeeding. Offer one breast for two breastfeedings if the breastmilk supply is overly abundant. This will gradually decrease the breast milk supply by decreasing stimulation and breast milk removal from the mother's breasts, so that the breasts can calibrate down to meet the baby's needs. The mother should be informed that as the breast milk supply decreases over a period of weeks or months she may need to begin to offer both breasts at each breastfeeding. If the breast where the baby is not feeding becomes uncomfortably full, the mother should express justenough breast milk to relieve the pressure. It isimportant she understands that she should avoidexpressing breast milk between breastfeedingsunless absolutely necessary for her comfort.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 100Additional suggestions to try if the baby is still experiencing difficulty. Encourage the mother to: Try using a position that will reduce the force of gravity on the mother's breasts to decrease the flowof breast milk and give the baby more control overthe breast milk flow: \u00b0 side-lying \u00b0 semi-reclined - leaning back in a sitting position to breastfeed \u00b0 lying on the her back with the baby lying face down on the mother 's breast \u00b0 sitting while the baby sits upright facing the mother's breast and straddling one of the mother's legs. Burp the baby frequently, especially if the babyis continuously gulping loudly throughout thebreastfeeding. Try the following ideas to initiate letdown prior toa breastfeeding and to relieve the initial letdownbefore the baby latches: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Use relaxation strategies - such as a warmshower, heat applied to her back and shoulders,relaxation breathing, a warm drink, supportivepositions. Manage pain to support comfort and relaxation,and facilitate breast milk letdown. Initiate breastfeeding before the baby is stressedand crying. Clothe the baby in a diaper only to promoteskin-to-skin contact. Support the baby's head higher than tummyin a chest-to-chest position, with the noseapproaching the mother's nipple, to facilitatethe normal neonatal reflexes and self-attachment behaviours. Gently massage her breasts. Gently stimulate the nipples. Gently roll thenipples between the thumb and index fingerfor several minutes or until the letdown reflexoccurs and breast milk leaks. Express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Express some breast milk first before putting thebaby on the mother's breast, as the first letdownreflex is usually the most forceful ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Wait to place the baby on the mother's breast until after thesprays of breast milk from the first letdown subsideto drips. This may help to prevent the baby fromchoking on the first forceful letdown. Some mothersmay continue to experience a forceful letdownthroughout the breastfeeding. Use relaxation breathing exercises or take an analgesic such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, if the letdown reflex is painful. To inquire about the use of acetylsalicylic acid, i.e., aspirin, the mother should consult with her primary health care provider. If the baby still refuses the breast after trying the above suggestions, encourage the mother to: Express her breasts after each time that the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeeding is stopped for any length oftime, encourage the mother to express eachbreast regularly in order to maintain her breastmilk supply . Generally, this should be at least 8 times a day, with a minimum of 1 expressionovernight, to mimic the normal feeding pattern. If the mother's breasts become uncomfortable orfull before the next expression, she should expressjust enough breast milk to relieve the pressure(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Feed the baby with expressed breast milk usingan alternative feeding method, e.g., cup, spoon,syringe, finger feeding ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). If expressed breast milk is not available, then an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). If the mother inquires about the use of nippleshields to manage overabundant breast milk flow,she should be supported in understanding thepossible benefits and risks associated with theiruse. Offer further assessment and refer for furthersupport as needed (see notes in General Principles of Protocol #10: Ineffective Suck ). Seek assistance from a breastfeeding expert orbreastfeeding clinic as soon as possible.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 101Between breastfeedings, encourage the mother to: Express just enough breast milk to relieve pressure if the mother's breasts are uncomfortably full. Avoid expressing breast milk unless absolutelynecessary for her comfort. Seek assistance from a primary health care provider , breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic if the above suggestions do not help with an overabundantbreast milk supply/overactive letdown reflex. Anevaluation for prolactinoma is recommended if thehyperlactation persists for more than 1-2 weeks. Hold her baby skin-to-skin, with or without attempting to have the baby latch. A baby may be sostressed trying to cope with the flow that the babybecomes disorganized. Holding the baby in a proneposition on the mother 's chest can help the baby to become calm and to self-regulate. Later Phase (3-6 months) If the baby is refusing the mother 's breast, refer to Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch . If the mother is experiencing decreased breast milk supply, refer to Protocol #12: Insufficient B reast Milk Supply. General Principles Optimizing breastfeeding by following the principles of early and frequent feeding, breastfeeding when the baby is calm and showing early feeding cues, ensuring effective positioning and latching techniques, including baby-led latching and skin-to-skin contact, and finishing the first breast first to promote a balanced breast milk production, can often prevent or help a mother to manage an overabundant breast milk supply or forceful letdown. The Feedback Inhibition of Lactation (FIL) factor will reduced breast milk production to calibrate it to match the baby's needs. The amount remaining in the mother's breast represents what the baby does not need as long as the mother does not further express breast milk to drain her breast (see How the Breast Works). The mother should feel she needs to remove just enough breast milk for comfort, not to drain the breast. Some mothers may produce more breast milk than is required for their babies' immediate needs. This may or may not combine with an overactive or forceful letdown reflex, causing the baby to receive too much breast milk too quickly. A baby who gets too much breast milk too quickly may become fussy and swallow too much air as a result of struggling with the breast milk overflow. The baby may choke, cough, or struggle at the breast shortly after beginning the breastfeeding. Coping with this may exhaust the baby and the baby may even come off the breast several times during the breastfeeding. Often the mother 's breast milk will spray. An overabundant breast milk supply or forceful letdown may lead to an ineffective latch and suck pattern. The baby may be unable to obtain or maintain an effective latch. The baby may swallow enough breast milk at the beginning of the letdown reflex and may never establish a coordinated suck-swallow-breathe pattern. When latched effectively, the baby is better able to maintain the latch and manage the flow of breast milk. Supporting the baby to latch in a vertical chest-to-chest position, so that the nose is approaching the nipple and the chin touches the mother 's breast first, ensures that baby's head will be able to tilt back slightly. This tilt of the head will direct the flow of breast milk upward at the hard palate and not directly to the back of the throat. For an adult this might compare to experiencing difficulty swallowing when water is squirted from a hose or sports water bottle towards the back of the throat. The adult would be able to swallow more easily if the water were squirted up at the roof of the mouth. For the baby , it means that he simply gulps from the flow and does not have to suckle, thereby not initiating the tongue movements that are an important part of the suck cycle ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding regarding the suck cycle, and Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Untreated overabundant breast milk supply/overactive letdown reflex may lead to partial or complete breast refusal and a decreased breast milk supply at about 2-3 months after birth. Breastfeeding may have become a chronic negative experience for the baby and/or there may be cumulative effects of inadequate removal of breast milk from the breasts. An overabundant breast milk supply and/or forceful letdown may mask a baby's weak or inef fective suck, when the baby does not need to suckle to obtain breast milk. If optimizing breastfeeding has not Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 102improved the situation, the baby should be assessed further by the primary health care provider and/or breastfeeding expert. Explosive and watery green stools may be a sign of pseudo lactose malabsorption caused by the baby receiving too much lower fat breast milk too fast. Historically, there may have been a misunderstanding that the breast milk flowing at the start of a feeding (sometimes called foremilk) has a higher level of lactose than the later breast milk (hindmilk). In fact, the concentrations of protein and lactose remain constant throughout the breastfeeding; it is only the fat concentration that varies, rising progressively during the breastfeeding. In effect, the low-fat breast milk feedings result in rapid gastric emptying, which in turn may lead to frequent breastfeedings. A high feeding frequency means that the baby receives a higher volume of lower fat breast milk thereby, increasing the lactose load ( Woolridge & Fisher, 1988 ). The fat content of breast milk changes during a breastfeeding. The baby initially receives breast milk that is lower in fat and there is a disproportionate ratio of fat to lactose (milk sugar). As the breastfeeding progresses, the fat content of the breast milk increases inversely proportional to breast emptiness. When the mother switches breasts before the baby is finished with the first breast, the baby may receive mostly lower fat breast milk at that breastfeeding. The lower fat content in the diet may cause rapid gastric emptying and too much lactose reaching the intestines too soon. If there is not enough of the enzyme lactase in the baby's digestive system to break down and absorb this rapid loading of lactose, the baby may show symptoms of lactose malabsorption that may resemble lactose intolerance, e.g., crying, gas, and explosive watery-greenish bowel movements. A baby who receives large amounts of lower fat, low-calorie breast milk may present with inadequate weight gain. The maximum capacity for volume may be reached before the baby is able to obtain adequate calories ( Woolridge & Fisher, 1988 ). A mother expressing breast milk for comfort should limit the amount to avoid stimulating the breast to produce more breast milk. A mother with an overabundant breast milk supply/ forceful letdown reflex is more prone to recurrent plugged ducts and mastitis due to inadequate removal of breast milk from the breast. An overabundant breast milk supply/forceful letdown reflex that is treated will usually resolve within a few days or weeks. If the above strategies have not improved the situation, Lawrence suggests that the mother should be evaluated by her health care provider for a possible prolactinoma ( 2011). Block Feeding - If the overproduction of breast milk has not improved by optimizing breastfeeding management (early and frequent feeding, breastfeeding when the baby is calm and showing early feeding cues, ensuring effective positioning and latching techniques, including baby-led latching and skin-to-skin contact, and finishing the first breast first), some lactation practitioners may recommend block feeding or Full Drainage and Block Feeding (FDBF) to reduce the oversupply. This treatment sequence was originally described by van Veldhuizen-Staas ( 2007) and is also described by Wilson-Clay ( 2008). It begins with \"as-complete-as- possible\" mechanical drainage of both breasts (for some women, mechanical drainage may be enough). Mechanical expression is more efficient and faster than hand expression, although possibly, may not keep up with the pace of breast milk replacement. The baby, now able to latch onto the drained breast, is offered both drained breasts until satisfied. The rest of the day is divided into equal blocks of time of 3, 4, 5 or more hours. The same breast is offered without restriction throughout each time block. At the end of a time block or a multi-hour sleep, the baby will be offered the other breast for all feedings within the next time block - one breast per time block. Intervals between the blocks will gradually increase as symptoms decrease ( van Veldhuizen-Staas, 2007, and Wilson-Clay, 2008 ). Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER - Some women experience a feeling of abrupt dysphoria or negative emotions that occurs just before breast milk release, usually continuing for no more than a few minutes. It may be related to inappropriate dopamine activity at the time of letdown, and may disappear suddenly or dissipate slowly. No research has been published yet, only case reports ( Heise, A. M. Wiessinger., 2011). Lawrence advises that antidepression therapy seems to work, and some clinicians suggest herbal remedies ( 2011). There is a website where mothers may connect with each other: http://www.d-mer.org/Home_Page.html.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 103References Heise, A.M., Wiessinger, D.

It is a sign of elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) caused by the breakdown of red blood cells. Physiolog ic jaundice occurs as part of the normal physiologic changes after birth. In the breastfed baby th is process may be prolonged to 3 weeks or longer. Breastfeeding can and should continue. When there are breastfeedin g difficulties or inadequate breast milk intake, it may be known as \"starvation\" jaundice ( Gartner, 2001). Pathologic Jaundice is due to underlying medical conditions (see General Principles). Observation and Assessment Physiologic Jaundice (Normal) Pathologic Jaundice (Abnormal) Assess the baby for: Elevated bilirubin levels that normally develop between 2-5 days after birth, peaking on thethird to fifth day of life. Prolonged physiologic jaundice; elevated bilirubinlevels rise or continue after the first week of life and peak between 10-21 days after birth. Yellowing of the sclera, mucous membranesand/or skin, progressing from the head to theupper body. Y ellow urine. Difficulty arousing for feeds, not showing obviousearly feeding cues. Sleepiness during breastfeeding. Hydration status. Effective breastfeeding and adequate weight gain. Delay in passing of meconium.Assess the baby for: Elevated bilirubin levels that are usually evident at birth or develop within 1-2 days after birth. Bilirubin levels rising rapidly at 8.5 \u00b5mol/L (0.5mg/dL) or more per hour ( Lawrence, 2011 ). Yellowing of the sclera, mucous membranesand/or skin, progressing from the head to theextremities. Brown urine. Difficulty arousing for feeds, not showing obviousearly feeding cues. Sleepiness during breastfeeding. Delay in passing of meconium. Abdominal distension. Ineffective breastfeeding and inadequate weightgain. A medical condition that: \u00b0 increases the breakdown of red blood cells, e.g., Rh or ABO blood incompatibility,Coombs +ve. \u00b0 interferes with the liver's ability to process bilirubin, e.g., galactosemia, hypothyroidism, o r \u00b0 increases the reabsorption of bilirubin by the bowels, e.g., 2011; Riordan, 2010.Breastfeeding for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 105Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Physiologic Jaundice (Normal) The normal breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis) after birth. The normal high levels of bilirubin in the meconiumare reabsorbed by the intestines into the blood. The newborn's immature liver has a limitedcapacity to process the high levels of bilirubin thatnormally accumulate after birth. Pathologic Jaundice (Abnormal) Assess the baby for a possible medical condition that:Increases the breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), e.g., Rh or ABO incompatibility. Interferes with the liver's ability to conjugatebilirubin, e.g., G6PD deficiency bilirubin by theintestines, e.g., gastrointestinal obstruction. Factors that may be associated with hyperbilirubinemia in either physiologic or pathologic jaundice: Delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Infrequent breastfeedings. Inadequate intake of breast milk. Supplementation with water or sugar water. Mother 's breast milk taking longer than usual to come in (i.e., delayed Lactogenesis II). Medical conditions, e.g., dehydration, sepsis. Prematurity. Low birth weight. Ethnicity. Birth interventions, trauma, pain, and stress. Urinary tract infection. Suggestions1.Assess whether the baby may have physiologic or pathologic jaundice (see General Principles ). The baby will need to be assessed by a primary health care provider to rule out any medical condition, e.g., Rh or ABO blood incompatibilities, G6PD deficiency, galactosemia, hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal obstruction. 2.Reassure and encourage the mother to continue to exclusively breastfeed unless medically contraindicated, e.g., presence of galactosemia (Pr otocol Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). 3.Reassure the mother that most healthy full-term babies recover from jaundice with no short- or long-term health effects. 4.Provide the mother with suggestions to help decrease the baby' s bilirubin levels. Encourage the mother to: Breastfeed frequently: \u00b0 8 times or more per day with no more than one 4-5 hour sleep period in 24 hours, including at least once overnight, until the jaundice is cleared. \u00b0 The baby may need to be awakened to breastfeed if the baby is lethargic or sleeping for long periods. Understand that ear ly feeding cues may be masked or diminished when a baby is jaundiced. Understand that she may need to anticipate possible breastfeeding opportunities when the baby ismore easily aroused, based on the normal gastricemptying time of 90 minutes together with infantsleep cycles. Use effective positioning and latching practices(Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Ensure that the baby is sucking and swallowingeffectively , transferring breast milk throughout the duration of each breastfeeding ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Increase the amount of higher fat breast milk thebaby receives by finishing the first breast beforechanging breasts. The higher fat breast milk will promote faster excretion of bilirubin in the stools. Allow the baby to breastfeed on the first breast untilhe is no longer actively sucking and swallowing.Then offer the second breast if the baby isinterested. Use breast compressions to help increase effectivesucking and swallowing and increase the amountof higher fat breast milk the baby receives (seeProtocol #5: Engorgement for a description ofBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 106breast compressions). Use techniques to wake a sleepy baby, e.g., dress baby in a diaper only to promote skin-to-skincontact, gently massage the baby's back, feet orhands, gently sit the baby up, talk to the baby,change the baby's diaper, or change position. Ensure that the baby has adequate urine andstool output and is gaining weight appropriately(Pr otocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Discontinue any use of medications by the motheror baby that may increase the risk of kernicterus(brain damage), e.g., aspirin and other salicylates,and certain sulpha drugs. Avoid supplementing with water or sugar water, as this does not promote stooling. If the baby is assessed to need supplementation,first offer expressed breast milk (EBM). If EBM isnot available, refer to Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding for discussion of appropriate alternatives. If the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively , encourage the mother to: Express both breasts after each time that the baby is unable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeedingis stopped for any length of time, encourage themother to express each breast regularly to maintainher breast milk supply. Generally, this should be atleast 8 times a day , with a minimum of 1 overnight expression, to mimic the normal feeding pattern(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk). Feed the baby with EBM using an alternativefeeding method, e.g., cup, spoon, syringe, fingerfeeding, or lactation aid on the breast (Protocol #18:Alternative Feeding Methods ). Using a lactation aid on the breast is recommended first over the otheralternative feeding methods if the baby is able tolatch onto the breast. This method allows the baby to remain on the breast and provides the breastswith stimulation. If EBM is not available, referto Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementationor Cessation of Breastfeeding for discussion of appropriate alternatives. Avoid supplementing with water or sugar water, asthis does not support stooling. If phototherapy is required, the baby's hydrationstatus will need to be closely monitored.Phototherapy may place the baby at risk fordehydration due to increased water loss through the stool and skin. Seek further assessment and follow-up from abreastfeeding clinic or breastfeeding expert as soonas possible. General Principles Jaundice is a symptom of hyperbilirubinemia-increased levels of unconjugated (indirect) fat-soluble bilirubin in the blood that deposits in the skin, muscles, and mucous membranes. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells by the liver. The immature newborn liver may be unable to conjugate the large number of red blood cells that break down immediately after birth. The bilirubin must be eliminated in the stool or it will be readily reabsorbed in the intestine ( Lawrence, 2011). This yellowing of the skin is known as jaundice or icterus. It progresses in a cephalo-caudal pattern from the head to the trunk then to the extremities. As it may be less visible in darker pigmented skin, blanching of the skin may promote visibility. Jaundice becomes visible in the sclera (eye) when the bilirubin level reaches about 5 mg/dL. As jaundice continues down the body the bilirubin level increases progressively. Jaundice from the head to the shoulders corresponds to bilirubin levels of approximately 5-7 mg/dL. Between the shoulders to the umbilicus, levels range between 7-10 mg/dL. Between the umbilicus to the knees, levels range between 10-12 mg/dL. Below the knees bilirubin levels are greater than 15 mg/dL ( Kramer, 1969 in Lauwers, 2011 ). The significance of the level of bilirubin must be considered in relation to many factors: the gestational age of the baby (< 37 weeks), the birth weight of the baby (< 2500 gm), the baby's age at the onset of jaundice, whether the baby is healthy or has a medical condition, i.e., acidosis, anoxia, asphyxia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, or infection ( Lawrence, 2011 and CPS, 2011 ). Bilirubin levels are screened using non-invasive methods such as transcutaneous bilirubinometers or \"flash\" to determine the need for more invasive diagnostic tests to evaluate serum blood levels. While more than half of all newborns will develop jaundice within the first week of life ( Gartner, 2010 ), most cases of jaundice in the healthy full-term baby Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 107are part of a normal physiological condition that will resolve within a few days or weeks with no phototherapy treatment required. Birth interventions, trauma, pain, and stress may delay or interfere with frequent breastfeeding or be associated with increased bleeding, e.g., caesarean birth, bruising from forceps or vacuum delivery, shoulder dystocia, cephalhematoma, internal bleeding. In recent years there have been changes in the clinical assessment and management of baby hyperbilirubinemia. A less aggressive approach to treatment has been followed since Newman and Maisels reported a low risk of toxicity for healthy term newborns with physiologic jaundice ( Newman et al., 1992 ). There was an understanding that lower levels of physiologic jaundice could be managed by increased breastfeeding without phototherapy. Shorter hospital stays and higher breastfeeding rates have led to a re-examination of the significance of clinical jaundice ( CPS, 2011 ). Bilirubin levels often peak post-discharge. In the first week, the clinical significance of jaundice is evaluated relative to risk factors such as baby age by hour, weight, gestational age, sepsis, need for resuscitation, and hemolysis. In addition, the significance of successful establishment of breastfeeding is recognized. More frequent breastfeeding during the first few days has been associated with lower bilirubin levels ( Clarke et al., 2003). Extreme hyperbilirubinemia may result in permanent brain damage, known as bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. Supplementation with water interferes with mechanisms to prevent and decrease jaundice. Supplements interfere with the successful establishment of breastfeeding that is limiting the intake of colostrum and breast milk important for enhancing stool output ( de Carvarlho in Biancuzzo, 2003 ). Water and dextrose water supplements have been associated with increased bilirubin levels in term breastfed babies ( Nicoll in Lawrence, 2011 ). The evidence is inconclusive to support direct exposure to sunlight for the treatment of jaundice. The Australian Medical Association found no controlled trials comparing exposure to sunlight against either no treatment or exposure to artificial light and suggests that the use of sunlight may be based on anecdotal reports ( Johnson et al., 2003 ). Moreover, the promotion of sunlight is contradictory to other public messages for parents to limit sun exposure ( Harrison et al., 2002 ). Maisels advises that sunlight will lower serum bilirubin level, but the practical difficulties involved in safely exposing a naked newborn to the sun either inside or outside (and avoiding sunburn) preclude the use of sunlight as a reliable therapeutic tool ( Maisels et al., 2008 ). Mothers may perceive any jaundice as a serious medical problem and prematurely discontinue breastfeeding. They may feel guilty and believe that their breastfeeding caused the jaundice ( Hannon et al., 2001 ). It is important to assess the maternal interpretation of information as well as to reinforce the importance of frequent breastfeeding to help resolve physiologic jaundice. There are two major categories of jaundice: or pathologic (abnormal). Physiologic Jaundice (Normal) Physiologic jaundice usually develops between 2-5 days after birth, peaking on the third to fifth day of life. Bilirubin levels range between 104-291 mol (7-17mg/dL) ( Dennery et al., 2001 ). It is caused by a combination of 3 factors: \u00b0 the normal breakdown of excess red blood cells (hemolysis) after birth. \u00b0 the normal high levels of bilirubin (in the meconium), which is reabsorbed by the intestines into the blood, and \u00b0 the newborn's immature liver which has a limited capacity to process the high levels of bilirubin after birth. The normal lysis may be exaggerated followingbirth trauma. In most cases, physiologic jaundice is a normalclinical condition in the healthy full-term baby thatusually resolves in a few days or weeks when thebaby's liver matures and eventually processes theexcess bilirubin. Phototherapy treatment is usually not required incases of physiologic jaundice unless the bilirubinlevels become exaggerated due to breastfeedingdifficulties and inadequate intake of breast milk(Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 108 Physiologic jaundice is more prevalent and may appear later among babies whose ethnic backgroundis Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Native American( Lawrence, 2011, Brown et al., 2011 ). Physiologic jaundice that appears or continues afterthe first week of life in conjunction with appropriateweight gain was previously referred to as \"lateonset\" or \"breast milk jaundice\". Physiologicjaundice that is prolonged beyond the first weekof life is now recognized as a normal extension ofphysiologic jaundice in the healthy full-term babywho is breastfed. One third of all breastfed babies are clinically jaundiced in the third week ( Gartner, 2010 ). Prolonged physiologic jaundice will peak between 10-21 days after birth and may last for up to 3 months. Anypathological cause of jaundice will need to be ruled out. The breastfed baby with prolonged physiologicjaundice will be breastfeeding and gaining weight well and is generally healthy. Phototherapy treatmentis usually not required in cases of prolonged physiologic jaundice. Breastfeeding can and shouldcontinue whether the baby is treated or not. Offering support for early and frequentbreastfeeding is the preferred approach.Pathologic Jaundice (Abnormal) Pathologic jaundice is usually evident at birth or develops within 1-2 days after birth with high orrapidly rising bilirubin levels at a rate of 8.5 mol/L(0.5 mg/dL) or more per hour ( Lawrence, 2011 ). It is caused by a medical condition that: \u00b0 Increases the breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), e.g., Rh or ABO blood incompatibility, alloimmunity or antibody mediated hemolysis (+ve direct Coombs test). \u00b0 Interferes with the liver' s ability to process bilirubin, e.g. G6PD, galactosemia, hypothyroidism, or \u00b0 Increases the reabsorption bilirubin in the intestines, e.g., gastrointestinal obstruction. Pathologic jaundice may need immediate medicaltreatment, including possible exchange transfusion.The baby will also need to be treated for theunderlying medical condition causing the jaundice. Breastfeeding can and should continue duringtreatment, with the rare exception of galactosemia,for which the baby will need to be placed on alactose-free artificial baby milk. Galactosemia isan inherited metabolic disorder that results in theinability to metabolize lactose. References Biancuzzo, M. (2003). Breastfeeding the newborn: Clinical strategies for nurses.

Protocol #15 Candidiasis (Thrush)Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 110Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush) Candidiasis is an infection caused by a fungus or yeast called Candida albicans. It may infect the baby's mouth, anus or buttocks, the mother's breasts, vagina and/or hands. It can be passed back and forth between mother and baby. It can interfere with the success of breastfeeding. Both mother and baby must be treated simultaneously regardless of concurrent symptoms. Observation and Assessment With a Candida infection symptoms can appear in the mother and/or baby. Assess the mother for: Persistent cracked or painful nipples that do not heal despite proper positioning and latching as wellas effective sucking and swallowing ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Painful nipples that develop suddenly whenbreastfeeding was previously going well. Severe nipple pain that lasts throughout the entirefeeding and immediately after breastfeeding. Sharp shooting or burning pain in the mother 's breast during or after breastfeedings. Nipples that may be red, sore, cracked, itchy,burning, or painful. Areolae that may be red, swollen, flaky/scaly, orshiny in appearance. Recurrent mastitis. Assess the baby for: Change in breastfeeding behaviour. Temperament change, e.g., gassy, cranky behaviour. Breast refusal, e.g., repeated pulling off the mother's breast, making clicking sounds, orrefusing to breastfeed because the baby's mouth issore ( Hafner-Eaton in Mohrbacher, 2003 ). Frequent breastfeeding. White patches or plaque on the tongue, gums, innercheeks, or soft palate that cannot be wiped off witha clean damp cloth. Slow weight gain (Protocol #12: Insufficient B eastMilk Supply ). Diaper rash that has raised, red, sore-lookingpustules or red, scalded-looking buttocks ( Riordan,2010), or a rash that does not respond to zinc oxide treatment. Possible Contributing Factors or Causes Candidiasis may be associated with one or more underlying factors that may be mother and/or baby related. Assess the mother for: A current Candida infection, e.g., vaginal. A history of recurrent vaginal yeast infection. A vaginal yeast infection during pregnancy, after delivery, or in recent weeks. Nipple trauma. Diabetes. Repeated or recent antibiotic therapy. Repeated use of plastic-lined nursing pads, which create a warm and moist environment for thegrowth of Candida albicans. Use of oral contraceptives containing estrogen. Repeated or long-term use of steroids, such as forasthma. Assess the baby for: A current Candida infection. Repeated or recent antibiotic therapy. Repeated use of a pacifier. Suggestions 1.Assess for possible cause(s) of the candidiasis (see previous section on Possible Contributing Factors or Causes). The mother and baby may need further assessment by a physician for diagnosis andtreatment of the infection.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 1112.Provide the mother with suggestions for breastfeeding with candidiasis. Breastfeeding can and should continue during a Candida infection andthroughout the course of antifungal treatment. Before breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Ensure that the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex is initiated. The baby's rooting, sucking andhand movements on the mother's breast are thenatural stimuli for letdown when breastfeeding isinitiated early and the baby is calm, before the babyis overly hungry and begins crying ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). The mother can try the following techniques to initiate letdown: Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place. Use relaxation strategies, e.g., a warm shower, heat applied to her back and shoulders, relaxationbreathing, a warm drink, supportive positions. Manage pain to support comfort and relaxation andfacilitate breast milk letdown. Initiate breastfeeding early, before the baby isstressed and crying. Clothe the baby in only a diaper to promote skin-to-skin contact. Support the baby in a vertical chest-to-chestposition, with the nose approaching the mother'snipple, to facilitate the baby's reflexes and self-attachment behaviours. Gently massage the mother's breasts. Apply moistor dry heat to the mother's breasts for a few minutesbefore or during massage until letdown occurs.Heat may be applied with a warm, wet towel ordisposable diaper, a warm bath or shower, a bowlof warm water, a heating pad on low, or a hot waterbottle wrapped in a cloth. Some mothers may preferto apply a cool cloth if her breasts are feeling itchyor irritated. Then gently express some breast milk(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Stimulate the nipples. Gently roll the nipples between the index finger and thumb for several minutes or until the letdown reflex occurs. Then gently expresssome breast milk (Protocol #19: Expressing andStoring Breast Milk ). If only one side is sore, try breastfeeding on thepain-free side first until the letdown reflex occurs.Then switch to the sore side. Numb her nipple if it is sore just before latching byapplying ice wrapped in a clean cloth to the sorenipple for a few seconds. Avoid prolonged exposureto the ice; this can inhibit the letdown reflex andcause tissue trauma. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Check for effective positioning and latching practices ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching ). Check for effective sucking and swallowing(Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Avoid pulling the baby off her breast. If the motherdecides to take the baby off her breast before thebaby is finished, suggest that she break the suctionby trying one of these methods: Press down on her breast near the baby'smouth. Gently pull down on the baby's chin. Gently insert a finger into the corner of thebaby's mouth. Bring the baby in closer to her breast so that thenose is covered briefly with breast tissue; thismay be more effective for an older baby. After breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Wash her hands frequently to avoid spread of the candidiasis. Wash hands in warm, soapy waterbefore and after breastfeeding, before and afterhandling her breasts or expressing breast milk, aswell as before and after diapering the baby. Wash her breasts and nipples with clear water at theend of each breastfeeding and then air dry. Do notapply or leave expressed breast milk on her breast.Breast milk left on her breast may encourage thegrowth of Candida albicans. Apply a cool cloth for comfort. Some practitionerssuggest that the mother apply a cool cloth soakedin vinegar to her breasts. Discontinue use if themother's breasts become irritated. Avoid using breast pads if possible. If used, changebreast pads after each breastfeeding or more often ifthey become wet. If breast pads are needed for leaking, use 100%cotton, not plastic-lined pads. 100% cotton breastpads are more breathable and reduce trapping ofmoisture against the nipples. Use well-ventilated breast shells betweenBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 112breastfeedings if her nipples are too painful when they come in contact with a bra or clothing. Express both breasts after each time the baby isunable to breastfeed effectively. If breastfeedingis stopped for any length of time, encourage themother to express each breast on a regular basis inorder to maintain breast milk supply. Generally, thisis at least 8 times a day, including once overnight,or more often if her breasts become uncomfortableor overly full ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Avoid saving and freezing expressed breast milk(EBM) during a candidiasis outbreak. EBM can beused on the day that it is expressed. Sterilize all breast pump parts that touch the breast each day. Wash all items in hot soapy water first.Rinse thoroughly. Boil in a covered pot of water for10 minutes. Allow the items to air dry. Antifungal Precautions Encourage family members to: Wash their hands frequently to avoid the spread of candidiasis. Wash hands in warm, soapy waterbefore and after handling breasts, breast milk orinfant feeding equipment, as well as before andafter diapering the baby. Thoroughly wash and then boil once a day all itemsthat come in contact with the baby's mouth, e.g.,toys, pacifiers, bottle nipples, teethers. Wash items daily in hot, soapy water first. Rinsethoroughly. Boil in a covered pot of water for10 minutes. Allow the items to air dry. Frequently wash toys that cannot be boiled invery hot, soapy water and rinse well. Pacifiers, bottle nipples, and teethers should bediscarded and replaced with new ones after oneweek of antifungal treatment (see the followingsection on Antifungal treatment). Avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary. Whennecessary, a short course of antibiotics should be used. Inform the sexual partner of the possibility ofconcurrent yeast infections and the need to betreated for candidiasis if there is a history ofrecurrent vaginal yeast infections. Use of condomsis recommended. Avoid bathing with other family members. Avoid sharing personal items with other familymembers (e.g., toothbrush, cup). Eat a well-balanced diet that follows Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Antifungal treatment: Support the mother to make an informed decision about the use of antifungal treatment. It is importantthat she understand the benefits and risks associatedwith treatment for candidiasis to enable her to makea fully informed decision. Breastfeeding can and should continue throughoutthe course of antifungal treatment. Both the mother and baby need to be treatedsimultaneously with antifungal medication even ifone of them is asymptomatic. Treatment may beneeded even when cultures are negative for both themother and baby. With antifungal treatment, the symptoms mayworsen first before improving. The more severe theinfection, the longer it will take the treatment towork. Topical treatments are usually the first course oftreatment. Systemic treatments may be needed for recurrent orongoing candidiasis. Over-the-Counter Treatments Miconazole (topical) Ketoconazole (topical) Treatments that Require a Prescription Nystatin (topical or oral) Medications including \"azole\", e.g., clotrimazole (topical), miconazole (topical), itraconazole (oral),ketoconazole (topical or oral), and fluconazole(oral). All Purpose Nipple Ointment (APNO) For further information see General Principles . Although specific research has not been found to support the use of vinegar as a disinfectant inbreastfeeding, it is readily available, inexpensive,and the idea for its use is suggested from othersciences such as microbiology and dentistry( Pinto, 2008 ). Some practitioners suggest using itBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 113to disinfect items and clothing ( Riordan, 2010; Tait, 2000; Pinto et al., 2008 ). However, it should be noted that some women may find it irritating to their skin (Hanna et al., 2011 ). Other creative suggestions found in the literatureinclude application of tea bags and essential oilssuch as peppermint or tea tree oil. Although theevidence of their effectiveness is mixed ( Abdul- Rahman et al., 2005; Agarwal et al., 2007; Devkatte et al., 2005; Inouye et al., 2009 ), many of these substances have been used traditionally in many cultures. Systemic antifungals may not combine well with some other medications. Before taking any other medicine or over-the-counter preparation, the mother should consult her primary health care provider. Some experts may recommend other topical preparations based on clinical observations. Thesemay include mupirocin, grapefruit seed extract, ormixtures of mupirocin, betamethasone ointments,and miconozole powder. Controlled clinical trials for efficacy andappropriate treatment are not available ( Lawrence, 2011). A review of Hale ( 2010a ) indicates that there are no American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)ratings for many antibiotics and steroids; theireffects on the baby are unknown. It is also very important not to confuse grapefruit seed extract with grape seed, which can be very toxic. General Principles Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by a yeast called Candida albicans. If the infant's infection is oral it may be known as monilia or thrush. In lactating women it may also be called Mammary Candida a commensal organism colonizing the oropharnyx, gastrointestinal tract, vagina and skin, usually without ill effect until a change disrupts the balance ( Lawrence, 2011 ). It thrives in warm, moist areas such as the mother's nipples, breast milk ducts and vagina, and the baby's mouth and diaper area. Candidiasis should be suspected if a mother has persistent sore nipples ( Riordan, 2010 ), sometimes with no identified problems with latching, positioning, or sucking. Riordan refers to candidiasis as a \"family disease\", because of the easy communicability and cross-infection between family members ( Riordan, 2010 ). Simultaneous treatment is recommended for all members with or without symptoms. It is important to reassess positioning, latching, and sucking if candidiasis is suspected, before and after treatment. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs and symptoms (Francis- Morrill et al., 2004 ). A survey of members of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine indicated that most physicians do not use laboratory cultures for diagnosis ( Brent, 2001 ). Cultures are problematic because it takes several weeks for results and it is difficult to differentiate an infection from normal skin bacterial colonization ( Chetwynd, 2002 ) because Candida is part of the normal flora. Francis-Morrill et al. (2004) reported that the predictive value of colonization was highest when combined with three or more signs or symptoms ( Francis-Morrill et al., 2004). Candidiasis must be treated with antifungal medication. Both the mother and the baby must be treated simultaneously even if one of them is asymptomatic. Breastfeeding can and should continue during a Candidia infection and during the course of antifungal treatment. Over-the-Counter TreatmentsBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 114Miconazole or clotrimazole (topical) - Cream or lotion applied to the mother's nipples or areole 2-4 times a day for 7 days ( Amir et al., 2002 ). It is rated as L2 (safer), as very little is absorbed systemically (0.1%) and there is poor oral absorption ( Hale, 2010a ). Ketoconazole (topical) - Cream or lotion applied directly to the mother's nipples or areolae 2 to 4 times a day until at least 2 days after symptoms have disappeared ( Amir et al., 2002 ). Treatments that Require a Prescription Nystatin (topical or oral) - Previously the most common medication prescribed for Candida albicans, although its effectiveness is questionable ( Hale, 2010b; Chetwynd, 2002 ). Hale reports that some studies suggest that nystatin resistance is increasing and only 45% of strains are sensitive to nystatin ( Hale, 2010b ). Nystatin mother's nipples and areole. Nystatin suspension may be applied to the baby's mouth, but is poorly absorbed orally ( Hale, 2010b ). If nystatin is prescribed, the cream and suspension will need to be applied to the appropriate areas after every breastfeeding for a course of 2 weeks. The cream will also need to be applied on the baby's buttocks if a diaper rash is present. Due to poor oral absorption, there is little likelihood that it would get into the breast milk ( Hale, 2010b ). Hale rates it as L1 (safest) (2010a ). Fluconazole/diflucan (oral - Fluconazole is used for mothers when topical treatments are ineffective. Hale advises that it is cleared for use in infants 6 months and older but not for neonates ( Hale, 2010b ). Medications including the clotrimazole (topical), miconazole (topical), itraconazole (oral), ketoconazole (topical or oral), and fluconazole (oral). (For further discussion see Hale, 2010b and CPS, 2007.) All purpose nipple ointment - A compounded ointment developed by Canadian paediatrician Dr. Jack Newman, known as all-purpose nipple ointment (APNO) contains an antibiotic, steroid, and antifungal ( Newman, 2009 ). It is commonly recommended but not yet researched ( Mohrbacher, 2010; Lauwers & Swisher, 2011 ). Although Mohrbacher suggests it may be an option for Stage I, II and III nipple trauma (Mohrbacher, 2010 ), dermatologists rarely use a cream with multiple active ingredients because \"the bad effects often outweigh the good\" ( Lawrence, 2011), and it is difficult to determine the source of a negative reaction. Mothers may also find information about the management of Candida albicans available on the Internet. This may include information from Thomas Hale, a pharmacist with expertise related to medications and breastfeeding at: Thomas Hale's website for parents: http://www.infantrisk.com/category/breastfeeding. Freezing breast milk contaminated with Candida will temporarily deactivate the yeast but will not destroy it ( Riordan, 2010 ). If contaminated frozen expressed breast milk is fed to the baby after the treatment of candidiasis is completed, this could cause the infection to recur. It should be noted that freshly expressed breast milk can be fed to the baby during a candidiasis outbreak. The Antifungal Precautions discussed above are based on the understanding that fungi like Candida albicans are considered to be microbes that require \"intermediate-level disinfection\". Disinfection is a process that kills nearly all disease-producing organisms, including fungi, but not resistant bacterial spores ( CPSO, 2004 ). There is inconsistency among the recommendations regarding the cleansing and sterilization of equipment and toys. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that parents boil items for 10 minutes ( Sacks, 2009 ). Some practitioners recommend boiling items for 20 minutes when there is recurrent infection ( Mohrbacher, 2010; Lauwers et al., 2011 ). Some practitioners recommend boiling or treating items only when there is recurrent infection Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 115(Mohrbacher, 2010; Riordan, 2010 ), recognizing that the amount of work is stressful for the family. The effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatment should be evaluated first. Dietary recommendations - It is very important that lactating women eat a well-balanced diet that followsEating Well With Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Some experts may recommend specific dietary changes to reduce the potential for recurrent candidiasis. It is important that the mother be encouraged to consult a Registered Dietitian before making any dietary changes: Examples include recommendations to reduce the ingestion of dairy products, heavily sweetenedfoods and artificial sweeteners; to reduce the ingestion of alcohol, cheese, bread, wheat products, sugar, honey, and condiments; or to eat plain yogurt with active acidophilus or take acidophilus supplements, as these may decrease the recurrence of candidiasis. According to Heinig et al. ( 1999), these recommendations are not supported by the currentscientific evidence. No studies were found ofspecific nutritional interventions among lactatingwomen ( in patients using fixed orthodontic appliances after the use of peppermint. Al-Rafidain Dental Journal, (1), 91-96.

With the proper choice of medication, maternal conditions should be tr eated and breastfeeding can continue during drug therapy. In contrast, the risks to the infant of artificial baby milk (ABM) a e significant and should not be trivialized (Adapted from Hale, 2010 Hale, 2010 ). Suggestions Encourage the mother in understanding: 1.There are possible benefits and risks related to the use of a medication during breastfeeding and that she may require support from a health care provider tomake a fully informed decision. 2.It is rarely appropriate for a mother to forego the benefits of necessary pharmacological therapyin order to breastfeed. This includes physical andmental health therapies. 3.If the use of a drug is necessary or it can be postponed, e.g., for a medical condition that does notneed to be urgently diagnosed or treated. 4.Medications and herbs not absolutely necessary should be avoided ( Hale, 2010b ). 5.When it is necessary for the her to take a drug, the drug that is chosen should ideally: Be compatible with breastfeeding. Be taken with at minimum dose that is effective and for the shortest duration. Be used in paediatric drug therapy. Have the least toxic effect on the baby. Have the shortest half-life. Have the least concentration in breast milk, e.g.,low breast milk-to-plasma ratio. Have the poorest oral bioavailability to limit oralabsorption. Have published controlled studies. 6.Before the mother takes any drug, it should be checked for compatibility with breastfeeding with: the prescribing health care , or a breastfeeding clinic. 7.Before she takes a drug there should be an evaluation of the age, stability, and condition of thebaby to determine if the baby can handle exposure tothe medication. 8.If the drug chosen is compatible with breastfeeding, she should be encouraged to take the drug during or immediately after breastfeeding,especially at times when the baby sleeps for longerperiods. This will maximize the clearance of the drugfrom the breast milk before the next feeding. 9.If she is prescribed a necessary drug that is contraindicated with breastfeeding, she should inquire whether there is an alternative drug that iscompatible with breastfeeding. Information aboutspecific drugs and breastfeeding can be website: http://www.infantrisk.com/ category/breastfeeding a breastfeeding clinic. 10.If she is prescribed a necessary drug that is contraindicated with breastfeeding and thereis no alternative drug that is compatible withbreastfeeding, she should be encouraged to: Discontinue breastfeeding until it is safe to resume.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 118 Express both breasts on a regular basis in order to maintain her breast milk supply. Generally, thisshould be at least 8 times a day, with a minimumof 1 expression overnight, to mimic the normalfeeding pattern. The mother may need to expressmore often if her breasts become uncomfortableor full. Discard the expressed breast milk (EBM)(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Feed the baby with a supplement using analternative method not at the breast, e.g., cup,spoon, syringe, finger feeding (Protocol #18:Alternative Feeding Methods ). EBM that was collected prior to the use of the drug can beused as the supplement. If previously collectedEBM is not available, an appropriate supplementshould be offered (Protocol #17: Indications forSupplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). 11.The following drugs should be avoided or limited when breastfeeding: TobaccoIf the mother smokes cigarettes, inform her that:Smoking is not recommended in breastfeeding mothers. Breastfeeding remains the recommended method of infant feeding even if the mother smokes. Nicotine rapidly concentrates in breast milkimmediately after smoking. Nicotine and its majormetabolites have also been found in the breast milkof mothers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Excessive nicotine in breast milk may irritate thebaby's gastrointestinal system and may causevomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, andfussiness. Smoking can affect breast milk production and maynegatively impact infant growth and alter the baby'ssleep patterns in the short term ( Health Canada, 2012 ). Encourage the mother to: Decrease the number of cigarettes she smokes or try to quit smoking. Information about smokingcessation is available from the Smokers' Helpline at1-877-523-5333 or http://www.smokershelpline.ca/. Try to smoke immediately after breastfeeding whenthe baby is sleeping for longer periods (the half-lifeof nicotine in breast milk is between 60-90 minutes( AAP, 2001 ). Avoid exposing the baby to second-hand smokefrom any source. Do not smoke indoors or in the car. Children exposed to second-hand smoke have an increased risk of health problems such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infections, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. (Adapted from information from CAMH (2003)). Caffeine If the mother consumes caffeinated beverages, encourage her in understanding that: Caf feine passes into breast milk and reaches peak levels within 60-120 minutes of maternal consumption ( Hale, 2010a ). Excessive caffeine in breast milk may cause thebaby to become overstimulated, e.g., wide-eyed,active, alert, have difficulty sleeping, and unusuallyfussy ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Caffeine can be found in many foods and drugsin addition to beverages, e.g., foods containingchocolate, some analgesics and cold remedies,coffee, tea, most cola soft drinks, and some energydrinks. (Source: Adapted from Health Canada, FactSheet - Caffeine It's Your Health, 2011 and FactSheet - Caffeine in Food, 2011.) Encourage the mother to: Limit her intake of caffeine to 300 mg per day from all sources. On average (where 1 cup is equal to 8fluid ounces or 250 ml), 300 mg of caffeine wouldbe contained in: less than 2 cups of filter drip coffee 3 cups of instant coffee 6 cups of tea 6 cans of cola beverages (where a can is 12fluid ounces or 355 ml) Try to consume caffeinated beverages, foodsor drugs immediately after breastfeeding whenthe baby is sleeping for longer periods. (Source: Adapted from Health Canada, Fact Sheet - CaffeineIt's Your Health, 2011 and Fact Sheet - Caffeine in Food, 2011.) Alcohol Moderate, occasional alcohol consumption is not likely to pose a problem to an infant, but heavy alcohol consumption is to be avoided. Wait at least 2 hours before breastfeeding the baby to avoid unnecessary infant exposure ( Best Start, 2005).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 119If the mother consumes alcohol, inform her that: Alcohol passes into breast milk. Any alcohol consumed by a breastfeeding mother will pass intoher breast milk in concentrations similar to her ownbloodstream. Alcohol is not stored in breast milk. Just moderate levels of alcohol in breast milk havepotential or proven adverse effects for the baby. Alcohol has been associated with impaired motordevelopment. Alcohol has been associated with altered sleeppatterns in the baby. Alcohol has been associated with a risk ofhypoglycemia in the baby. Alcohol may inhibit the letdown reflex ( Coiro et al., 1992, and Cobo, 1973 ). Alcohol may alter the odour or taste of breast milk (Mennella, 1998, 1993 ). Alcohol has been associated with decreased breastmilk intake by the baby ( Mennella, 2001 ). Excessive alcohol consumption may impair herability to care for her baby. Alcohol content in non- or low-alcohol beveragesmay be higher than declared ( Goh et al., 2010 ). 1 drink = 340 g (12 oz) of 5% beer, or 141.75 g(5 oz) of 11% wine, g (1.5 of 40%alcohol ( Koren, 2002; Best Start, 2005 ). Encourage the mother to: Avoid or limit her intake of alcohol to an occasional drink. If the mother decides to consume alcohol on alimited basis, advise her that she can ensure that herbaby is not exposed to any alcohol by: careful planning of the breastfeeding schedule,i.e., breastfeed first, drink after ( CAMH, 2003 ), storing EBM before drinking, and/or waiting for complete alcohol elimination ( Ho et al., 2001 ). 12.The following drugs should be avoided when breastfeeding: Cannabis, e.g., marijuana, hashishCocaine, e.g., coke, crack Club drugs, e.g., rohypnol, ketamine (Please see Protocol #12: Insufficient B east Milk Supply for a discussion regarding the use of galactagogues.) (Adapted from information from Best Start (2005), and CAMH (2003).) General Principles Most drugs are quite safe to be used by breastfeeding mothers. The hazards of using artificial baby milk (ABM) are well documented ( Hale, 2010a ). Although most drugs will pass into breast milk to some degree, the amount is low and the majority of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are compatible with breastfeeding. Only rarely does the amount transferred into breast milk produce clinical doses in the infant ( Hale, 2010a ). Avoid using medications that are not necessary. Herbs, high-dose vitamins and supplements, etc. are not necessary and should be avoided ( Hale, 2010a ). It is rarely necessary for a mother to discontinue breastfeeding in order to take a medication. Similarly, it is rarely appropriate for a mother to forego the benefits of necessary pharmacological therapy in order to breastfeed. When a drug is incompatible with breastfeeding, there is usually an alternative drug that can be safely prescribed. Drugs that are generally safe when breastfeeding include: Drugs that are safely prescribed for babies, e.g., antibiotics, analgesics. Drugs that are inhaled or applied to the skin,eyes, or nasal passages. They are poorly absorbedand rarely reach significant maternal plasmalevels. Doses given by intravenous therapy orintramuscular generally accumulate in breast milkfaster . Drugs with low oral bioavailability are not readilyabsorbed in the stomach or intestines of the motheror baby. Drugs with a large molecular structure do notreadily pass through the alveolar membranes of thebreast into breast milk. Drugs that have short half-lives.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 120Drugs that are usually considered contraindicated or incompatible with breastfeeding include : Antineoplastics and immune suppressants. Chemotherapy drugs, which can be toxic to an infant at very low levels. Anticonvulsants. Only a few anticonvulsants areexcreted in high concentrations into breast milk,e.g., phenobarbitol, the exception of methylergonovine on a short-term basis, which is compatible with breastfeeding). Caution is recommended regarding the use of oral contraceptives. Estrogens have a long but poorly documented history of suppressing breast milk production; Riordan ( 2010) reports variable sensitivities among mothers. Progesterone has a poor oral bioavailability; however, Hale advises that the effect on breast milk production is poorly studied ( Hale, 2010 ). Low-dose progestin-only birth control pills are suggested for use after breast milk supply is established or at about 6 weeks postpartum. All mothers should be advised to wait to start oral contraceptives for as long as possible and to observe for a possible reduction in breast milk supply. PPD - A mother affected by postpartum depression (PPD) should discuss the risks and benefits of varioustreatment options with her health care provider. It is important to support mothers in understanding that medications may be necessary but that breastfeeding can continue. It is important to provide prompt and effective breastfeeding support so that there is minimal impact on a new mother's mental health ( TPH, 2011 ). The above list is not inclusive and may have been updated since the printing of these protocols. In addition, some drugs that are usually contraindicated may be given on an individual basis if closely monitored by a physician. Before the mother takes any drug, it should be checked for compatibility with breastfeeding with their prescribing health care provider or a breastfeeding clinic. Drugs that should be avoided or limited when breastfeeding include: Tobacco (nicotine) Caffeine Alcohol Cannabis - Although there is limited scientific data available about the passage of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive compound in marijuana, into breast milk, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) report s that it appears to be excreted into breast milk in moderate amounts. However, it is stored in fat and can be detected for up to a month after use in chronic users. Similarly, THC can accumulate in breast milk to high concentrations with chronic use, potentially affecting infant brain development. Cannabis exposure via breast milk has not been shown to increase risk to the baby, but babies need close mon itoring. Cocaine - Cocaine passes into breast milk in notable concentrations and it may accumulate in infants, as they are less able to metabolize it. Although there is limited data about cocaine in breast milk, irritability, trembling, vomiting, diarrhea, and seizures have been observed in infants. Opio ids - At therapeutic levels, most opioids are excreted into breast milk in minimal amounts and can be compatible with breastfeeding. However,toxicity may occur when the mother is abusinga drug. Recent research suggests that codeinemay not be safe for all breastfed babies, as thereis a minority of mothers who may metabolizecodeine into morphine. Infants and mothersneed to be observed for central nervous system[CNS] depression. It is now advised that painmanagement beyond Day 4 postpartum be changedto a non-codeine analgesic, or the dose of codeineBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 121be decreased. Methadone is compatible with breastfeeding (Adapted from Madadi, 2009 and CAMH et al., 2007). Non-alcoho lic beverages - Previous research supported recommendations to choose non-alcoholic beverages as a safer choice over alcohol;Mennella found that infants consumed 23% lessbreast milk following maternal ingestion of alcoholcompared with a non-alcoholic option ( Mennella et al., 1993 ). However, more recent research has found that it may be difficult for women to makea safe choice, as the amount of ethanol (alcohol)was higher than stated in almost 30% of the non-alcoholic beverages tested ( Goh et al., 2010) . Alternative therapies, natural health products (herbs)and over-the-counter preparations - Both clients andhealth care professionals must approach the use ofover-the-counter and natural health products withcaution. At this time, there is not enough scientificinformation about the safety of various herbsand natural health products to either determinestandardized dosages, mechanisms of action orrecommend their general use during breastfeeding.Breastfeeding women should always consult withtheir health care provider and/or a breastfeedingexpert knowledgeable about the use of herbs andnatural products in breastfeeding mothers forinformation, as well as a risk-benefit assessment forboth mother and baby. If the mother inquires about the use of medications or herbs when she is breastfeeding, it is important to first explore with her any contributing factors related to her concerns, as well as her breastfeeding self-efficacy. It is also important to inquire about her previous breastfeeding history, current breastfeeding management and attempts to manage her concerns, and then offer suggestions to optimize basic breastfeeding. It is important for mothers to understand the possible benefits and risks associated with the use of herbs and natural health products in order to make an informed decision about their use. Caution is recommended regarding the use of alternative therapies or natural products such as herbs when breastfeeding, as many contain chemical substances that may be dangerous to the baby ( Hale, 2010a ). Similar caution applies to the use of over-the- counter medications. All of these products contain chemical substances that may be dangerous to an infant. There is mixed evidence to support their use. Limited information is available from formal scientific research to establish dosages, benefits, and risks, or possible interactions with other medications. However, several products have traditionally been used in breastfeeding ( Protocol #12: Insufficient Breast Milk Supply; Protocol #6: Plugged Ducts ; Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush)). Health Canada has regulations to ensure the quality, effectiveness, and safety of natural health products (herbs). Natural health products approved under these regulations will have a Natural Product Number (NPN) or Drug Information Number - Homeopathic Medicine (DIN-HM) on the label. Few products have been tested for safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding and are therefore not recommended by Health Canada for use in breastfeeding. Health Canada follows the precautionary principle, advising that breastfeeding women should consult with their health care provider before using any natural health products to minimize possible risk (2011c) . However in the most recent edition of Medications and Mothers' Milk ( Hale, 2010a ), Thomas Hale lists some herbs commonly used in breastfeeding management as rated L3 (moderately safe) for use by breastfeeding women. For example, blessed thistle and fenugreek are rated L3. For advisories and warnings about specific drugs and health products, go to the following Health Canada website: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/index-eng.php. It is important to note that herbal products may not be standardized, so there may be different doses of the active ingredient used by various manufacturers. In addition, there may be increased risk of allergic reactions because the product may contain pollen, mould, or mould spores. If a mother inquires about the use of alternative therapies or natural health products, refer her to a health care provider and/or breastfeeding expert knowledgeable about the use of herbs and natural products in breastfeeding mothers. These products should only be used under the supervision of a health care provider with breastfeeding expertise. It is essential that there be a comprehensive plan that includes a thorough assessment to clarify need, screening for contraindications and side effects, discussion of the information (or lack thereof) regarding efficacy, safety, timing of dosages, and Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 122potential risks, and appropriate follow-up assessment. General concerns about drugs and breastfeeding include: Whether the drug will affect the baby's health. Whether the drug will affect breastfeeding, e.g., decrease breast milk supply, change the quality ofthe breast milk, or inhibit the letdown reflex. Whether there is a risk of weaning and how thismay impact the mother and baby, e.g., severeengorgement and mastitis resulting from abruptweaning, or baby may refuse supplementation. Whether there are other options to taking the drug,e.g., avoid taking the drug if it is not necessaryor find alternative drugs that are compatible with breastfeeding. Whether there is the potential for impairment incare of the baby if the mother's judgment of herlevel of sedation is affected. Drugs will have less impact on breastfed babieswho are: Heavier. Older. Born as healthy and full-term versus premature (the more premature the baby is, the more impact thedrug will have). Taking solid foods at an appropriate age in additionto breastfeeding. The impact of a drug on the breastfed baby will also depend on the mother's kidney and liver function. If the mother's kidneys and/or liver are compromised, the clearance of the drug from breast milk may be impaired and prolonged. If the baby becomes drowsy as a result of a drug or substance ingested by the mother, the baby may show less interest in breastfeeding or may not suck as effectively. Subramanian (1988) found that alcohol did not alter baseline serum prolactin levels. It was associated with an inhibition of suckling-induced prolactin release and milk consumption in rats. These results have shaped our understanding of the relationship between alcohol and lactation. Research has also identified a link between a family history of alcoholism in first degree relatives of non-alcoholic lactating women with a blunted prolactin response to breast stimulation (suckling); mothers with a positive family history also reported more frequent daily breastfeeding ( Mennella et al., 2010 ).

Protocol #17 Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of BreastfeedingBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 125Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding Support mothers to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months, unless supplements a e medically indicated BFI - Step 6, BCC, 2011). Supplementation - any food or drink other than that received from the breast - is rarely necessary and should only be given when medically indicated. Unnecessary supplementation is associated with shortened duration of breastfeeding. Wherever possible, the goal of supplementation is to return to feeding at the breast. Observation and Assessment The following is a list of indications for consideration of possible supplementation or cessation of breastfeeding (temporary and complete cessation). It is adapted from BFI Integrated 10 Steps Practice Outcome Indicators Appendix 6.2 ( BCC, 2011 ) together with Protocol #3: Hospital Guidelines for the Use of Supplementary Feedings in the Healthy Term Breastfed Neonate from the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine ( ABM, 2009 ). Medical Indications for the Possible Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding Assess the baby for: A medical condition for which the baby should not receive breast milk or other milk except specializedformula: Classic galactosemia - Needs a special galactose-free formula Maple syrup urine disease - Needs a specialformula free of leucine, isoleucine and valine Phenylketonuria - Needs a specialphenylalanine-free formula (some breastfeedingmay be possible with careful monitoring). A medical condition for which breast milk remainsthe best feeding option but which may needsupplementation with other food for a limitedperiod, together with support to optimize thebreastfeeding. Birth weight less than 1500 g (very low birth weight): Born at less than 32 weeks gestation (verypreterm) At risk of hypoglycemia related to impairedmetabolic adaptation or increased glucosedemand, e.g., preterm, small for gestational age, experiencing significant intrapartum hypoxic and/or ischemic stress, illness, born to a diabetic mother if blood sugar fails to respond to optimal breastfeeding or breast milk feeding Significant weight loss in the presence ofclinical indications (mother's breast milkproduction not established) Birth weight not regained by 10 days after birth Clinical indications of insufficient breast milkintake, e.g., no stools or fewer than one stool per day (in the first few weeks of life), or mec onium 5 or more days after birth, dehydration that doesnot respond to optimizing the frequency andeffectiveness of breastfeeding Inadequate average weight gain - less than: - 20-35 g ( - 1\u00bc oz) per day for the first3-4 months of age (post Lactogenesis II) - 115 g/week for the first 2-4 months - 85 g/week for the first 4-5 months - 60 g/week from 6-12 months(Protocol #3: Signs of EffectiveBreastfeeding) A medical condition that may require special considerations for breastfeeding, e.g.,neuromuscular difficulties such as Down'ssyndrome or cleft lip/palate, where the baby isunable to create enough negative pressure whensucking on the breast. Separation from mother due to illness or surgery. Inability to latch and breastfeed effectively(Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchievingor Maintaining a Latch; Pr otocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 126Assess the mother for: Medical conditions that may justify avoidance or complete cessation of breastfeeding. Severe illness such as sepsis, psychosis, eclampsia or shock that prevents her from caring for her infant. Herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) that necessitatesavoidance of direct contact between lesions on themother's breasts and the baby's mouth until all activelesions have resolved. The baby may continue to feedon the other breast if there are no lesions. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection indeveloped countries. Human T-lymphotropic virus. Maternal medications including: sedating psychotherapeutic drugs, anti-epilepticdrugs and opioids and their combinations.These may cause side effects such asdrowsiness and respiratory depression and arebetter avoided if a safer alternative is available radioactive iodine-131. It is better avoidedgiven that safer alternatives are available - amother can resume breastfeeding about twomonths after receiving this substance excessive use of topical iodine or iodophors (e.g.,providone-iodine), especially on open wounds ormucous membranes. These can result in thyroidsuppression or electrolyte abnormalities in thebreastfed infant and should be avoided cytotoxic chemotherapy. This requires that amother stop breastfeeding during therapy Insufficient breast milk supply due to primaryglandular insufficiency ( Protocol #12: Insufficient Breast Milk Supply ). Insufficient breast milk supply due to breast injury or surgery in which major nerves and ducts in the breasts are damaged (e.g., burns to the breast, breast reductionsurgery with incisions to the areola and/or nipple) (Protocol #12: Insufficient B east Milk Supply). Delayed Lactogenesis II (Day 5 or later) andinadequate intake by the baby. \u00b0 Retained placenta \u00b0 Sheehan syndrome - postpartum hemorrhage followed by absence of lactogenesis Separation from the baby due to illness or surgery. Maternal conditions that are of concern, but duringwhich breastfeeding may continue: Breast abscess - Breastfeeding should continue on the unaffected breast; feeding can resume on the affected breast once treatment has begun; Hepatitis B - Babies should receive Hepatitis B vaccine within 48 hours of birth or as soon aspossible after birth; Hepatitis C - There is no definite case of mother to baby transmission via breast milk (Riordan 2010); Mastitis - If breastfeeding is very painful, breast milk must be removed by expression to prevent progression of the condition; Substance use - Maternal use of nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines and related stimulantshave been demonstrated to have harmful effectson babies. Alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines and cannabis may cause sedation in both the mother and baby. Mothers should be encouraged not to use these substances and offered opportunitiesand support to abstain and apply harm reduction principles. A medical condition that may make it difficult tobreastfeed more frequently, such as intolerable painthat is unrelieved by intervention. Supplementation is not medically indicated but the situation must be assessed and support offered to optimize breastfeeding management for: A sleepy baby with fewer than 8 feedings in the first 24 to 48 hours, less than 7% weight loss and nosigns of illness. An infant with bilirubin levels 20 mg/dL 72 hoursafter birth, but is breastfeeding and stooling well. An infant who is fussy at night and/or constantlybreastfeeding for several hours. A sleepy or tired mother. Mother treated with antibiotics for an infection. An infant with a weight loss of greater than 7% associated with maternal fluid overload following perinatal bolus IV therapy. (Source: Adapted from ABMProtocol #3, 2009.) Note: Large volumes or a bolus of intravenous fluids during labour may artificially increase the infant's birth weight and may lead to an artificially large weight loss. See note in General Principles.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 127Suggestions 1.The baby should be referred to a primary health care provider/physician for assessment to determine or rule out any medical condition that may be an indication for supplementation, e.g., hypoglycemia, dehydration, phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease. 2.Assess the mother and baby for indications to supplement breastfeeding (see the section on \"Medical Indications for the Possible Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding\" under Observation and Assessment). Depending on the severity of the following cases and the baby's condition, breastfeeding should be optimized and increased in frequency before determining if supplementation is required for: Birth weight loss of more than 7% in the first 3 days of life. Failure to regain birth weight within 10 days of age. Inadequate weight gain of less than: 20-35 g ( - 1\u00bc oz) per day for the first 3-4months of age 1 15 g/week for the first 2-4 months 85 g/week for the first 4-5 months 60 g/week from 6-12 months(Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding) A medical condition, e.g., hypoglycemia, dehydration. 3.Offer assessment and support to optimize breastfeeding management, including effective positioning and latching, as well as effective sucking and swallowing, including breast milk transfer (Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching, and Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Indications for the Supplementation of Breastfeeding If the supplementation of breastfeeding is medically indicated, provide the mother with suggestions to help her maintain and preserve lactation while supplementing. Before initiating the use of a supplement or alternative feeding method, the practitioner is responsible for assessing the possible benefits and risks of that intervention for the breastfeeding dyad. The practitioner is also responsible for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. During breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Offer the breast first, whenever possible. Allow the baby to finish the first breast beforebreastfeeding from the other breast, so that the babytransfers higher fat breast milk as the first breastprogressively empties. Use expressed breast milk (EBM) as a supplementto breastfeeding, whenever possible. Avoid supplementation with artificial baby milk (ABM) or sugar water, whenever possible.Supplementation with ABM may increasethe baby's risk for developing allergies.Supplementation with sugar water has beenassociated with rebound hypoglycemia, weight loss,and increased bilirubin levels in babies (Protocol #14: Jaundice in a Breastfed Baby ). Refer to the \"Supplemental Fluid Guideline for Healthy Term Infants\" chart that follows. Feed the baby with the supplement using analternative feeding method (e.g., cup, spoon,syringe, finger feeding, or lactation aid) ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). Using a lactation aid on the breast may be preferable toother alternative feeding methods because it allowsthe baby to remain at the breast and providesthe breasts with stimulation. Encourage themother to offer the breast first before initiating anintervention. The practitioner who initiates the use of an alternative feeding method is responsible forassessing the benefits and risks of that interventionas well as for establishing a plan with the motherfor the ongoing management and evaluation ofthe intervention. The baby's weight gain and themother's breast milk supply need to be monitoredclosely. There must be a comprehensive plan thatincludes periodic reassessment of the breastfeedingand the infant's intake of breast milk, plus a plan forre-establishment of feeding at the mother's breast. Offer the supplements in amounts to mimic thenormal volume and frequency of breastfeeding,following the baby's cues of satiation. Frequent andsmall quantities, instead of less frequent and largerquantities, can prevent the baby from skipping anentire breastfeeding session. After breastfeeding, encourage the mother to: Express her breasts to obtain breast milk to be used Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 128as a supplement to breastfeeding if this is appropriate (Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Indications for the Temporary Cessation of Breastfeeding If the temporary cessation of breastfeeding is necessary, offer the mother suggestions to help her maintain and preserve lactation. Encourage the mother to: Express breast milk from each breast regularly to maintain her breast milk supply. Generally, this willbe at least 8 times in 24 hours, with a minimum of 1expression overnight, to mimic the normal feedingpattern. The mother may need to express moreoften if her breasts become uncomfortable or full(Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk) . Discard the expressed breast milk if the motheris taking a drug that is incompatible withbreastfeeding or if there are herpes lesions on thebreast. This will prevent the baby from consumingbreast milk contaminated with an incompatibledrug or with HSV-1. Previously expressed breastmilk that is not contaminated may be used as asupplement in these situations. Choose an appropriate supplemental fluid (refer tothe chart below). Feed the baby with the supplementusing an alternative feeding method, e.g., lactationaid on the breast, cup, spoon, syringe, or fingerfeeding (Protocol #18: Alternative FeedingMethods). If the mother is taking a drug that is incompatiblewith breastfeeding or if there are herpes lesions onthe areola, a lactation aid on the breast should notbe used. This is to prevent the baby from consumingbreast milk contaminated with an incompatible drugor direct contact with the herpes simplex virus. 4.Assess the mother and baby for indications to completely cease breastfeeding (see Observation and Assessment). If the complete cessation ofbreastfeeding is necessary provide the mother withsuggestions for weaning (Protocol #21: Weaning). 5. Encourage the mother to consult a breastfeeding expert or breastfeeding clinic for inquiries regarding whether a drug or medical condition requires supplementation or cessation of breastfeeding. Supplemental Fluid Guideline for Healthy Term Infants First Choice: Mother's own expressed breast milk (EBM).EBM is not appropriate if: a)the baby has a medical condition that contraindicates breastfeeding, e.g., galactosemia, poorly controlled phenylketonuria, or maple sugar urine disease. Appropriate ABM should be used. b)the mother is taking a drug incompatible with breastfeeding or if she has herpes lesionson her breasts. Second Choice: Artificial Baby Milk (ABM) Do not supplement with water or sugar water.BFI recommends human donor milk as the second choice of breast milk supplement, if available from a Human Milk Bank Association of North America (HMBANA) milk bank. See discussion in General Principles. Note: There may be variations in the use of this guideline based on the baby's condition or individual physician practice.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 129General Principles Whenever interruption or cessation of breastfeeding is considered, the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the risks posed by the use of breast milk substitutes and the need to intervene because of the presenting medical condition ( BCC, 2011 ). There are few situations that require breastfeeding to be supplemented or temporarily discontinued. There are even fewer situations where breastfeeding is contraindicated and should not be initiated or continued if the baby is already breastfeeding. The primary health care provider should assess the mother and infant dyad and consider all the data when determining whether the clinical benefits of supplementation or temporary cessation of breastfeeding outweigh the potential negative consequences of such feedings ( ABM, 2009 ). When the healthy term baby is effectively breastfeeding, the initial post-birth weight loss will quickly stabilize and thereafter reflect a steady weight gain. The presence of weight loss indicators should be a sign that further assessment and support are needed to optimize breastfeeding (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding). Unnecessary supplementation increases the risk of early discontinuation of breastfeeding ( Lawrence, 2010 ). If a mother has received a bolus of intravenous fluids during labour there may be a fluid shift to the fetus. This may artificially increase the infant's birth weight ( Lauwers & Swisher, 2011 ), and may lead to a more than 7% post-birth weight loss. This may also lead to breast edema, making it difficult for the infant to latch ( Smith, 2010 & 2007; Riordan, 2010; Biancuzzo, 2003 ) (see Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding for discussion of the impact of birth interventions). Wherever possible, the goal of medically indicated supplementation is to return to feeding at the breast. If the mother has made a fully informed decision to continue to use supplements, she is to be supported in feeding her baby in a safe and nurturing way (see Informed Decision-Making about Infant Feeding ). EBM is the first choice as a supplement for most babies, especially breast milk that is expressed after the baby has breastfed. When the mother expresses after a feeding she may be able to drain her breasts as much as possible and produce breast milk that is high in fat and will provide the baby with extra calories ( Rodriguez et al., 2005 ). The second choice is ABM. For infants with special needs, there are specific formulas as discussed above. BFI recommends human donor milk as the second- best choice for supplementation, if it is available from a milk bank that is a member of HMBANA. HMBANA is a non-profit association of human donor milk banks established in 1985 to set standards for and facilitate establishment and operation of milk banks in North America. This website provides information on milk banking and how to contact a milk bank to donate milk or to order human donor milk. This site is also a resource for health care providers and others seeking information on HMBANA's resources and services. Further information is available from: www.hmbana.org. In Canada, human donor milk is not a feasible option for general use. Currently, there are three HMBANA milk banks in operation in Vancouver , Calgary and Toronto. Attempts to establish additional milk banks have been slow to come to fruition due to concerns related to safety. A few hospitals import human donor milk from American milk banks for premature babies. It is not appropriate for mothers to informally share EBM. Supplementation with water or sugar water should be avoided. Supplementation with sugar water has been associated with rebound hypoglycemia ( Heck, Erenberg in Lawrence, 2010 ) and weight loss in babies. Even in hot weather, water supplementation is not necessary for the baby; the mother can drink more fluids and offer more breast milk if she is concerned. Volume of Supplementation: The amount of supplementation necessary must be determined on an individual basis. The principleis to mimic the volume and frequency of normalbreastfeeding ( Wight, 2005 ), and to follow the baby's cues of satiation. The amount of supplementation offered in the firstfew days should correspond to the normal intake ofearly breast milk or colostrum by the healthy terminfant, as well as to the newborn's gastric capacity(Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding fordiscussion of gastric capacity). The average intake of breast milk in the first 24 hours is low. It hasbeen reported as 6 g per feeding and 6 feedings inthe first 24 hours ( Saint et al., 1984 ), or as 6 ml/kg/24 hours for Day 1, 25 ml/kg/24 hours for Day 2, 66ml/kg/24 hours at Day 3 and 106 ml/kg/24 hours forDay 4 or 96 hours post-birth ( Evans et al., 2003 ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 130The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM, 2009) suggests supplement intakes for the first fewdays as: the older baby, the amount of supplementationshould be determined by the baby's cues ofsatiation. Supplementation may negatively affect thecontraceptive effect of lactation due to reducedstimulation of the breast. When supplementation or temporary cessation ofbreastfeeding is necessary, efforts should be madeto maintain and preserve lactation. Offer a supplement using an alternative method thatwill promote a return to the breast ( Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). The mother should be encouraged to regularlyexpress her breasts to maintain her breast milksupply whenever breastfeeding is stopped for anylength of time ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). Most drugs are safe for the mother to take while breastfeeding. When there is a drug that is incompatible with breastfeeding, there is usually an alternative drug that can be prescribed that is compatible with breastfeeding ( Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding ). There are very few maternal illnesses that contraindicate breastfeeding, including infections. Since the majority of infections are viral, the mother would already have exposed the baby to the virus before she even knew she was ill. The continuation of breastfeeding will pass antibodies to the baby to provide protection against the viral infection. In the absence of breast lesions, breastfeeding is not contraindicated by maternal hepatitis C virus (HCV) ( PHAC, 2009 ). Breastfeeding may also continue in the presence of maternal hepatitis B virus (HBV) if the infant has been immunized according to the recommendations of the Public Health Agency of Canada ( PHAC, 2010 ).Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) is transmitted through breast milk. Mothers who have been counselled and tested for HIV should be provided with full information about the benefits and risks of the infant feeding options available to enable them to make an appropriate decision about feeding their baby. This includes information on HIV transmission, including vertical transmission, factors affecting risk of HIV transmission and ways to decrease this risk, as well as treatment options. World Health Organization (WHO) Principles and Recommendations for the management of infant feeding when mothers are HIV-positive recognize that national authorities should decide whether health services counsel and support mothers to breastfeed and receive antiretroviral interventions or to avoid all breastfeeding (WHO, 2010) . In Canada, where there is an acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe breast milk substitute (commercial infant formula), mothers who are HIV-positive are advised to avoid breastfeeding. If breastfeeding has begun before the mother is tested for HIV , she should continue until the results are known. If she is found to be HIV-positive, she should discuss her concerns and whether she should continue or discontinue breastfeeding with her primary health care provider ( TPH, 2002 ). Research indicates that infants who are exclusively breastfed have less risk of vertical transmission of HIV than infants who are partially breastfed mixed with ABM ( Coutsoudis et al., 2002 ). Mothers who are HIV-positive should be advised that breastfeeding and ABM feeding at the same time may increase the risk of passing HIV to her baby. The choice of feeding method may be a difficult and value-laden decision for the mother. It is important that mothers are supported to feed their babies in a safe and nurturing way.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 131References Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine [ABM].

For most babies these are temporary measures, a nd the ultimate goal is to establish feeding at the breast. Suggestions 1.Assess whether supplementation and the use of an alternative feeding method are required ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation ofBreastfeeding ). Provide the mother with information about the various alternative feeding methods: cup feeding spoon feeding syringe feeding lactation aid at the breast finger feedin g paced bottle feeding. 2. It is important to support the mother in understanding the possible benefits and risksassociated with the use of an alternative feedingmethod, so that she is able to make an informeddecision about an appropriate method forsupplementation. Offer further assessment and referfor additional support as needed. Wilson-Clay suggests Criteria for Selecting an Alternative Method of Infant Feeding: It does not harm the baby. It is a good match for the baby's stamina, physical condition, and level of maturity. It is easy for the parents to manage. It involves equipment that the parents can easily obtain and clean. It is a suitable intervention for the length of time needed to remediate the feeding problem. It will help the baby learn to breastfeed.(Source: Adapted from Wilson-Clay et al., 2008)3. Before initiating an alternative feeding method, support the mother in identifying a plan to facilitatethe baby feeding at the breast. The followinginformation will assist the mother to consider heroptions. Cup FeedingSupport the mother in understanding that: Cup feeding is most successful when it follows the principles of baby-led practices and the baby is able to control the pace and amount of the milk flo w. The baby sips or laps the milk from the cup. Cup feeding is the preferred choice as an alternative oral feeding method. Cup feeding encourages the baby's tongue to move downward and forward to sip or lap (like a kitten) up the supplement from a small cup. Cup feeding should be used on a short-term basis and be evaluated frequently. Cup feeding can be a relatively easy process. However, some mothers may find it challengingto handle the equipment. Support from a familymember may be helpful. There may be some spillage and it can be messy. The equipment is easier to clean than bottles or tubes. The baby may only take 5-10 ml of the supplement at first. However, the amount of supplement taken will depend on many factors, e.g., the baby's satiation, the reason for cup feeding, age and status of the baby . The baby may hold the milk in his mouth until there is enough volume for a bolus to trigger swallowing. The baby always leads and controls the pace.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 133Equipment Small cup or glass, e.g., plastic medicine cup, shot glass Cloth to be placed under the baby's chin Supplement fluid: expressed breast milk (EBM) or artificial baby milk (ABM) if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation ofBreastfeeding ). Procedure 1.Wash hands before handling the equipment.2.Assemble equipment on a clean surface.3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy. 4. Ensure that the baby is awake and alert. 5. Fill the cup about half full with the supplement.6. Support the baby in a semi-upright sitting position on the lap. Support the baby's neck and upper back with one hand. Place a cloth under the baby's chin. 7. Bring the cup to the baby's mouth, tipping it so that the supplement just touches the baby's lips. Thesupplement should not be poured into the baby'smouth. The baby's tongue will move forward andsip or lap up the supplement like a kitten. 8. Keep the cup tipped throughout the entire feeding so that the supplement is always touching thebaby's lips. This will allow the baby to control thepace of the feeding. Baby Cup FeedingCleaning Instructions When Using Cup Feeding For Healthy Full-Term Babies at Home After each feeding, wash the cup in hot soapy water, then rinse well and air dry. Store the cup in a dry and clean area away from food preparation. For Premature or Hospitalized Babies and Mothers and/or Babies with Candidiasis Use a new plastic medicine cup after each feeding. The cup cannot be sterilized by boiling. Hospital policies may vary. If a cup is used at home and it can be boiled, e.g., a shot glass, it should be boiled after each feeding. The cup should first be washed in hot soapy water and rinsed well. Next it should be boiledin a covered pot of boiling water for 10 minutes(Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush) and CPSO, 2004), and then removed from the pot to air dry.The cup should be stored in a dry and clean areaaway from food preparation. ( Source: Adapted from Lauwers, 2011, and Mohrbacher, 2010) Spoon Feeding Support the mother in understanding that: Offering a small amount of supplement on a spoon can calm a fussy baby or awaken a drowsy baby ( Wilson-Clay, 2008 ). It can be used when a small cup is not available. A spoon is an easy and accessible way to offer a small volume of milk to a baby, such as the earlybreast milk (colostrum). Spoon feeding is most successful when it follows the principles of baby-led practices and the baby is able to control the pace of the milk flo w. The baby may only take 5-10 ml of the supplement at first. Howeve, the amount of supplement taken will depend on many factors, e.g., the baby'ssatiation, reason for spoon feeding, age of the baby. The baby always leads and controls the pace. Equipment Small clean spoon Cloth to be placed under the baby's chin Supplement fluid: EBM orABM if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 134Procedure 1.Wash hands before handling the equipment.2.Assemble equipment on a clean surface.3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy. 4. Ensure that the baby is awake and alert.5. Fill the spoon with a mouthful of the supplement.6. Support the baby in a semi-upright sitting position on the lap. Support the baby's neck and upper bacwith one hand. Place a cloth under the baby's chin. 7. Bring the spoon to the baby's mouth, tipping it so that the supplement just touches the baby'slips. The supplement should not be poured intothe baby's mouth. The baby's tongue will moveforward and lap up or sip the supplement. 8. Give the baby time to swallow before refilling the spoon and offering more. This will allow the babyto control the pace of the feeding. 9. Clean the spoon according to the same instructions for cleaning a cup as above. (Source: Adapted from Lauwers, 2011 and Mohrbacher, 2010) Syringe or Eye-Dropper Feeding Support the mother in understanding that: Syringe feeding is somewhat similar to cup feeding An eye-dropper can also be used. Syringe or eye-dropper feeding is most successful when it follows the principles of baby-led practices and the baby is able to control the pace of the milk flo . The baby may only take 5-10 ml of the supplement at first. However, the amount of supplement taken will depend on many factors, e.g., the baby's satiation, reason for syringe feeding, age of the baby. The baby always leads and controls the pace. Equipment Syringe or eye-dropper that will hold the amount of supplement needed Cloth to be placed under the baby's chin Supplement fluid: EBM orABM if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).Procedure 1.Wash hands before handling the equipment.2.Assemble equipment on a clean surface.3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy . 4. Ensure that the baby is awake and alert. 5. Wrap the baby securely to prevent his hands from hitting the syringe.k 6. Fill the syringe or eye-dropper with the supplement. 7. Support the baby in a semi-upright sitting position on the lap. Place a cloth under the baby's chin. 8. Support the baby's head and upper back with one hand. Bring the syringe or eye-dropper to the baby's mouth. Gently drip the supplement slowlyinto the baby's mouth. 9. Give the baby time to swallow before offering more. This will allow the baby to control the paceof the feeding. 10. Clean the syringe or eye-dropper according to the same instructions given previously for cleaningthe cup. (Source: Adapted from Mohrbacher, 2010) Lactation Aid at the Breast. There are three types of lactation aids: 1. Lactation aid using a bottle 2. Lactation aid using a syringe3. Commercial lactation aid. Support the mother in understanding that:A lactation aid at the breast provides additional breast milk during breastfeeding if the baby is able to latch and form a seal at the breast. It provides stimulation to the breast and helps to increase breastmilk supply. The lactation aid at the breast allowsthe baby to receive a supplement and breastfeed atthe same time. The lactation aid is a feeding tubeconnected to a supply of either EBM or ABM. A lactation aid at the breast may be the method of choice to supplement breastfeeding if the baby isable to latch onto the breast and if breastfeedingor breast milk are not temporarily contraindicated,e.g., a maternal drug that is contraindicated withBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 135breastfeeding, herpes lesions on the breasts, or cracked nipples when the mother is hepatitis C positive. The lactation aid at the breast will deliver a faster flow of milk, which may reward and encouragethe baby to continue breastfeeding when the breastmilk supply is low or when the baby has difcultiessustaining suction ( Wilson-Clay, 2008 ). Caution: A flow that is too fast can overwhelm and discouragea baby. The lactation aid at the breast may help to train and stimulate the baby's nutritive sucking reflexes toimprove oral coordination. It also helps to increasematernal condence and promote maternal-infantbonding, since the baby is on the breast whilereceiving the supplement. Lactation Aid Using a Bottle Equipment Baby bottleArticial nipple for the bottle 36-inch #5 French feeding tube ScissorsTape Small syringe for cleaning the tube after each feeding Supplement fluid: EBM or ABM if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).Procedure 1. Wash hands before handling the equipment.2. Assemble equipment on a clean surface.3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy. 4. Enlarge the hole on the articial nipple by cutting it with clean scissors. 5. Insert the tip of the feeding tube through the bottom of the hole on the articial nipple. 6. Place the larger end of the tip of the feeding tube into the bottom of the bottle. 7. Place the required amount of supplement into the bottle, ensuring that the open end of the feedingtube is submerged in the supplement fluid. 8. Screw the nipple and cap onto the bottle. 9. Position the bottle on a surface that is level with the baby's head. Alternatively, place the bottle in a pocket of the mother's shirt that is level withthe baby's head. Caution: If the position is too high, the milk flow will be too fast and the babymay choke. If the position is too low, the babywill need more energy to suck and may tire easilyand become frustrated. 10.Tape the feeding tube onto the breast so that the tip of the tube is level with the end of the nipple.Then latch the baby. Alternatively, latch the babyrst and then slip the uncut tip of the tube into thecorner of the baby's mouth over the tongue whilethe baby is sucking. Ensure that both holes of thetube are inside the baby's mouth. When the baby sucks on the breast, the supplement will be drawn through the feeding tube and into the baby's mouth. Encourage the mother to choose a comfortable position. The football or cross-cradle position may allow the mother to provide optimum support of the baby's neck and shoulders when learning to use a lactation aid. Inform the mother that the lactation aid is working properly when the baby is effectively sucking and swallowing milk. (Source: Adapted from Lactation Aid at the Breast, (TPH, 2003a))Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 136Lactation Aid Using a Syringe Equipment 20 cc syringe with the plunger removed 36-inch #5 French feeding tubeTape - pieces of tape Small syringe for cleaning the tube after each feeding Supplement fluid: EBM or ABM if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Procedure 1.Wash hands before handling the equipment.2.Assemble equipment on a clean surface.3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy. 4.W ith the plunger removed from the 20 cc syringe, insert the syringe tip into the larger end of thefeeding tube. 5.T ape the feeding tube onto the breast so that the tip of the tube is level with the end of the nipple. Thenlatch the baby. Alternatively, latch the baby rstand then slip the tip of the tube into the corner ofthe baby's mouth over the tongue while the babyis sucking. Ensure that both holes on the tube areinside the baby's mouth. 6. Pour the required amount of supplement into the syringe. If the supplement starts to flow, pinch theend of the tube.7. Secure the syringe to the mother's shoulder or chest with tape. When the baby sucks on the breast, the supplement will be drawn through the feeding tube and into the baby's mouth. Encourage the mother to adopt a comfortable position. The football or cross-cradle position may allow the mother to provide optimum support of the baby's neck and shoulders when learning to use a lactation aid. Inform the mother that when the lactation aid is working properly, it will generally require 15-20 minutes for the baby to take one ounce or 30 ccs of supplement from the syringe. (Source: Adapted from Lactation Aid at the Breast, (TPH, 2003a)) Cleaning Instructions When Using the Lactation Aid with a Bottle or Syringe For Healthy Full-Term Babies at HomeAfter each feeding, ll a small syringe with clean hot water. Insert the syringe into the larger end of the feeding tube. Push the plunger to force water into the tube3-5 times to clean it out. It is not necessary to usesoapy water, but if soapy water is used, the tubemust be thoroughly rinsed out. Force 1-2 plungers of air through the tube to clear out any remaining water. Air dry the feeding tube in a clean area away from food preparation. Use a new feeding tube frequently, and especially if the tube becomes stiff, brittle or discoloured.

Then boil the items in a covered pot of water for 10 minutes ( Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush) and CPSO, 2004). Remove the items from the pot and allow them to air dry. Store items in a dry and clean area away from food preparation. In the hospital, sterilized bottles and articial nipples may be provided for each feeding. Commercial Lactation Aid Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.Finger FeedingSupport the mother in understanding that: Finger feeding is a temporary feeding method when the baby is unable to latch or it is necessary to discontinue breastfeeding temporarily. A feedingtube is attached to one of the caregiver's ngersand is connected to a supply of EBM or ABM toprovide supplementation to the baby. Finger feeding can facilitate proper use of the oral muscles, promoting coordination of suck-swallow-breathing ( Hazelbaker in Riordan, 2010 ) to help the baby develop effective rooting, latching, and suckingpatterns. There are some concerns that it is invasive and may be addictive ( Riordan, 2010 ). To minimize the possibility of imprinting and in the absence ofevidence-informed practices, it is prudent to advisethat nger feeding should be used infrequently, forshort periods of time, e.g., one day at a time, andevaluated before continuing. Before initiating nger feeding, it is important to rst explore with the mother any possiblecontributing factors related to the need for possiblesupplementation, as well as her breastfeedingself-efcacy. It is also important to inquireabout her previous breastfeeding history, currentbreastfeeding management and attempts to manageor establish breastfeeding, and then to offer hersuggestions to optimize basic breastfeedingmanagement before introducing interventions.It is also important to include discussion of hercapacity to manage the equipment associated withan intervention. It is important to support the mother in understanding the possible benets and risksassociated with the use of nger feeding if sheinquires about the use of nger feeding forsupplementation. Offer further assessment andrefer for additional support as needed (see notes in General Principles ). Whenever possible, the use of a lactation aid at the breast is preferred over nger feeding because thebaby is at the breast and stimulation to the breast isprovided. Finger feeding is used when the baby isunable to latch onto the breast or if breastfeeding istemporarily contraindicated, e.g., a maternal drugthat is contraindicated with herpeslesions on the breasts, or cracked nipples when themother is hepatitis C positive. W ith nger feeding, the motion of the tongue and jaw is similar to when the baby breastfeeds. Finger feeding is working properly when the baby is effectively sucking and swallowing milk. Baby Finger Feeding Equipment Baby bottleArticial nipple for the bottle 36-inch #5 French feeding tube ScissorsTape Small syringe for cleaning the feeding tube after each feeding Supplement fluid: EBM or ABM if breast milk is unavailable or not appropriate ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 138Procedure 1. Wash hands with soap and water. Ensure that the nail of the index finger used for finger feeding i trimmed and clean. 2. Assemble equipment on a clean surface. 3. Prepare the supplement and begin the feeding process before the baby gets overly hungry or fussy. 4. Enlarge the hole on the artificial nipple by cutting it with clean scissors. 5. Insert the tip of the feeding tube through the bottom of the hole on the artificial nipple 6. Place the larger end of the feeding tube into the bottom of the bottle. 7. Place the required amount of supplement into the bottle, ensuring that the larger end of the feeding tube is submerged in the supplement fluid 8. Screw the nipple and cap onto the bottle. 9. Place the bottle on a surface that is level with the baby's head. Alternatively, place the bottle in a pocket of the mother's shirt that is level with thebaby's head. Caution: If the position is too high,the flow of milk will be too fast and the baby maychoke. If the position is too low, the baby willneed more energy to suck and may tire easily andbecome frustrated. 10. Place the baby in a comfortable position, such as the cross-cradle position. 11. Line up the feeding tube so that it sits on the soft part of the index finge r. The tip of the feeding tube should be level with the fingertip. Tape the tubing onto the finger behind the second joint to prevent the baby from sucking on the tape. 12. Gently touch the baby's lips with a finger until the mouth opens wide. Then allow the baby to suck, and draw the index finger with the feeding tube in past the baby's gumline with the nail side down on the tongue. In most cases the baby will begin to suck as soon as the finger pad reaches the middle of the hard palate. Try to keep the index finger flat in the bab y's mouth (not pointing towards the palate). This will help to stimulate the tongue and jaw movements, which simulates breastfeeding by flattening the baby s tongue down and moving the lower jaw forward.

Paced Bottle Feeding Paced bottle feeding is an approach to feeding a baby with a bottle when the baby is unable to feed at the breast and the mother has made an informeddecision to feed with a bottle (see Informed Decision-Making about Infant Feeding ). For infants who may struggle to cope with the flow of milk from a bottle, paced bottle feeding can beless stressful. Encourage the mother to: Watch for the baby's early feeding cues, ( Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ) so that theBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 139baby can be fed in a calm state, before becoming overly hungry or fussy. \"Watch the baby, not the clock.\" Hold the baby in an upright position, supporting the shoulders and neck, so that the baby's neck canextend back into the natural drinking position, likebreastfeeding. Use a slow-flow nipple Wait for an indication of the baby's readiness to accept the bottle - opening the mouth. See that the entire nipple is in the baby's mouth. Tip the bottle just enough that there is milk in the nipple. At the beginning of the feeding, the bottle will be almost horizontal, and slowly becomes moreangled as the feeding progresses. Watch the baby for coordinated breathing, sucking and swallowing - or signs of distress. Pause thefeeding frequently (about every 3 swallows) tomimic the pattern and pace of breastfeeding. Topause, try lowering the tilt of the bottle or removingthe bottle from the baby's mouth. Let the baby determine how much milk to take and when to stop feeding. Do not try to encourage thebaby to finish the bottle.The feeding will likelytake as long as an effective breastfeeding, oncebreastfeeding is established. General Principles Alternative feeding methods allow the mother to provide oral supplementation to her baby. Alternative feeding methods include cup feeding, spoon feeding, syringe feeding, the use of a lactation aid at the breast, finger feeding or paced bottle feeding.Alternative feeding methods are contraindicated if the baby does not have a suck, swallow, or gag reflex It is important to support the mother in understanding the possible benefits and risks associated with the useof an alternative feeding method, so that she is able to make an informed decision about an appropriate method for supplementation. It is important to include discussion of her capacity to manage the intervention (see Criteria for Selecting an Alternative Method of Infant Feeding above). Some mothers may find it overwhelming to manage the care and handling of the equipment associated with alternative feeding interventions. Offer further assessment and refer for additional support as needed. Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy is the confidence thata mother has in her ability to breastfeed her infant ( Dennis, 1999 ). The mother must believe that she is capable of implementing any techniques or strategies that might be suggested ( Bowles, 2011 ). The evidence about alternative feeding methods is limited and is based upon the results of research involving feeding preterm infants that has been extrapolated to feeding healthy term infants. Cue-based and baby-led practices should be applied in the use of alternative feeding methods wherever possible. Watching for the baby's early feeding cues (Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ) and following the baby's signals for readiness to accept food promotes a more normal feeding experience as well as facilitating a return to the breast. A plan to wean from the alternative feeding method to feeding at the breast should be identified before themethod is initiated. The plan should include regular (daily) monitoring by a health care professional with breastfeeding expertise to reassess when the breast milk supply has increased or that the baby's latching and sucking has improved. The practitioner who initiates the use of an alternative feeding method is responsible for assessing the benefits and risks ofthat intervention, as well as for establishing a plan with the mother for the ongoing management and evaluation of the intervention. The baby's weight gain and the mother's breast milk supply need to be monitored closely. There must be a comprehensive plan that includes periodic reassessment of the breastfeeding and the infant's intake of breast milk, as well as the re-establishment of feeding at the mother's breast. Although readily available, the bottle or artificial nipple is not the ideal method for most babies. Using a method other than the bottle reinforces the non-verbal message to parents that supplementation is temporary ( Wight, 2005 ). An artificial nipple may cause the baby to become confused, particularly if breastfeeding is not well established. The process of suckling is complex and the mechanics of sucking at the breast and the bottle are different. \"Nipple confusion\" refers to a baby's difficulty inachieving the correct oral configuration, latchingtechnique, and suckling pattern necessary for successful breastfeeding after bottle feeding or other exposure to an artificial nipple Neifert et al., 1995 ). See also Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding regarding learning to suck and imprinting. Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 140Babies need to learn the normal mechanics of sucking baby is not feeding at the breast. Although some believe the mechanics of finger feeding are more like breastfeeding and it is used by some experts to evaluate the baby's suck reflex, these have not been systematically evaluated. Nor is there data to establish safe practices for finger feeding. The adult finger is firmer and narrower than the breast. Some babies may find the feel of a feeding tube on th eir hard palate to b e distracting (Wilson-Clay, 2008). Although parents do not need to wear gloves, health care professionals should wear gloves before inserting anything into the baby's mouth. A Lactation Aid at the Breast enables the baby to stimulate the breast by sucking at the breast, as well as simulate the experience of remaining on the breast while receiving the supplement. Paced Bottle Feeding - Paced bottle feeding is an approach to feeding a baby with a bottle when the baby is unable to feed at the breast and the mother has made an informed decision to feed with a bottle. With paced bottle feeding, the baby is better able to control the milk flow and set the pace of the feedingof either EBM or ABM. It supports cue-based feeding practices and transitioning to feeding directly at the breast. Paced bottle feeding is physiologically similar to the pattern of breastfeeding. Breastfed babies normally exhibit a coordinated sucking and breathing pattern - \"suck-swallow-breathe\" - ideally in a 1:1:1 ratio.However, babies may not pause to breathe regularlywhen they are trying to cope with the fast flow ofmilk from a bottle. They may appear to be hungrilygulping the milk, when they are actually havingtrouble coordinating breathing and swallowing.These babies may become distressed. The paced bottle feeding approach was originally used in NICUs for transitional feedings with premature babies. There is growing interest in extending this approach to any baby being bottle fed. Not only is it more comfortable for the baby to have the sucking, swallowing, and breathing coordinated, it helps to avoid overfeeding. When the baby controls speed, the baby also controls volume. (Adapted from ABA, 2009; Wilson-Clay 2008 and Lauwers et al., 2011)at the breast. This includes learning to manage the flow of milk from the breast. Feeding only at thebreast helps to prevent the baby from learning to suckimproperly on the breast tissue, which may in turn lead to breast refusal or painful nipples. As stated in Lawrence ( 2010), this \"nipple confusion\" has not been established in the medical literature, but there is strong evidence in the psychosomatic literature related to \"imprinting\" of sucking behaviours that supports the concept. Imprinting - The concept of imprinting or \"stamping\" is sometimes used to explain the observation of nipple preference. Imprinting is drawn from other sciences, such as biology and psychology, where it has been applied to explain attachment behaviours and brain pathway development. In humans, imprinting is oral/tactile ( Lawrence, 2010 ) and Gale Mobbs (1989) identified the mouth as the most significant factor in imprinting in humans. When babies are exposed to artificial nipples or finger early, they can become accustomed to the feeling of that particular object (bottle nipple, pacifie r, finger) in their mouths and have difficulty acceptin g another object, such as a mother's nipple, in it's place (Righard, 1997). Cup feeding has been found to support infant physiological stability and to be both effective and time efficient (Howard et al., 1999). It is the preferred alternative method for supplementing the non- breastfeeding baby ( BFI Appendix 9, BCC, 2011). Gomes et al. ( 2006) found that babies use the same mouth and facial muscles for both cup feeding and breastfeeding. It is simple, safe, inexpensive, and non-invasive ( Gupta et al., 1999 ). Cup feeding has been practiced traditionally around the world and therefore is familiar to many new Canadians. Howard et al. also found that cup feeding was a better way than bottle feeding to supplement babies born by caesarean section ( Howard, 2003). Although some research found that cup feeding protects oxygen saturation rates (Renfrew et al., 2009 ) or may lead to oxygen desaturation (Rocha, 2002), the evidence is mixed ( Collins et al., 2008 ). It is important that both parents and practitioners follow the baby's cues to prevent him from being overwhelmed by the flow of milk Finger Feeding - There is very limited research available to support the use of finger feeding a an alternative method of supplementation when a Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 141Supplementation may be provided in addition to breastfeeding or temporarily in place of breastfeedinguntil breastfeeding can be resumed ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). EBM is the first choice as a supplement for mostbabies, particularly breast milk that is expressed after the baby has breastfed. When the mother expresses after a feeding, she may be able to drain her breasts as much as possible and produce breast milk that is high in fat. This can provide the baby with extra calories. See Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding for further information. If EBM is not available, then an appropriate supplement, ABM, should be offered (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).

The reason the mother is expressing her breast milk will determine the method she uses, whether and how she stores the breast milk, and whether it is long-term or occasional. Observation and Assessment Indications for expressing and storing breast milk Assess the mother for: Separation from the baby, e.g., due to return to work or school, illness, or surgery. A decreased breast milk supply that she wants to increase ( Protocol #12: Insufficient B reast Milk Supply). Engorged breasts that are too hard for the baby to latch onto ( Protocol #5: Engorgement). Use of a medication that is incompatible withbreastfeeding and for which there is no safealternative ( Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding ). Assess the baby for: Separation from the mother such as prematurity, illness, or surgery . Inability to latch and breastfeed effectively(Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch; Protocol #10:Ineffective Suck ; Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ). Suggestions Expressing Breast Milk 1.Assess the mother and baby for indications for expressing and storing breast milk (see Observation and Assessment).2.Encourage the mother in understanding information to support her choice of a method of expression: Expression, both by hand and mechanically, is a learned skill. It will become easier and faster as shegains experience. Hand expression is a foundational skill for thebreastfeeding mother, and is particularly importantin the first 24 hours postpartum, when the volumeof breast milk is very small. It is recommended that all mothers learn how to hand express prenatally ( BFI Step 3, BCC, 2011 ) or before they leave hospital (BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011 ). Waiting until the last few weeks of pregnancy (37+ weeks) to practice hand massage on the mother's breasts will decrease any potential risk of triggering preterm labour. It is easier to see a positive output with handexpression for a small volume of breast milk. Thevolume may be too small to collect in the reservoirof a mechanical pump. This may negatively impactthe mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy, leading herto believe that she is not able to produce enoughbreast milk. It can be more affirming for the motherto express her breast milk into a small reservoirsuch as a medicine cup or shot glass.

Not recommendedPROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 150General Suggestions for Breast Milk Expression Before expressing, encourage the mother to: Wash her hands with soap and water. Clean all collection equipment that will have contact with her breast or breast milk. Have container(s) ready to store the breast milk.For healthy full-term babies use clean, air-driedglass, or hard plastic containers. For prematureor hospitalized babies use sterilized glass or hardplastic containers. See Cleaning Instructions below. Express in the morning when the breasts feel the fullest or after breastfeeding, when the letdown reflex has already occurred. If the mother is single pumping and her baby is with her , she may pump one breast while breastfeeding the baby on the other side. Allow enough time to express to avoid feelingrushed -approximately 20-30 minutes with singlepumping (10-15 minutes per breast) or 10-15minutes with double pumping. Sit in a familiar and comfortable setting. Decrease distractions, e.g., turn of f the phone and TV , and close the door. Have something to eat or drink available. Use relaxation techniques, e.g., play relaxingmusic, use breathing exercises to minimize stressthat could interfere with the hormones that controllactation (see How the Breast Works ). Use stimuli that remind her of her baby, such as apicture of the baby , recording of the baby sounds, or an article of clothing with the baby's smell. If thebaby is present, suggest that she keep the baby closeto her when expressing. Hold her baby skin-to-skin before trying to expressbreast milk, in order to relax and help trigger thehormones that control lactation. Initiate the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex byusing one of the following techniques: \u00b0 Use relaxation strategies to be calm, e.g., a warm shower, heat applied to her back and shoulders, relaxation breathing, a warm drink, or supportive positions. \u00b0 Manage pain to increase comfort and relaxation and facilitate breast milk letdown.\u00b0 Gently massage the breasts. Apply moist or dry heat to her breasts for a few minutes before or during massage until letdown occurs. Heat may be applied with a warm, wet towel or disposable diaper, a warm bath or shower, a bowl of warm water, a heating pad on low, or a hot water bottle wrapped in a cloth. Then gently express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expr essing and Storing Breast Milk ). \u00b0 Stimulate the nipples. Gently roll the nipples between the index finger and thumb for several minutes or until the letdown reflex occurs. Then gently express some breast milk ( Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing Breast Milk ). During expressing, encourage the mother to: V isualize the direction of breast milk flowing out of her breast. Use a rhythmic motion that mimics the baby's suck rhythm. Massage her breast(s) as described above. Switch breasts several times during the expression,whenever the flow of breast milk decreases, if she isexpressing one breast at a time. This will stimulateseveral letdown reflexes more effectively thancontinuously expressing each breast for a specified time. Be aware that she may only get a few drops whenfirst learning to express, especially in the early daysafter birth, when her breasts are producing breastmilk in small amounts. Hand Expression Encourage the mother to: Wash her hands with soap and water. Have a clean, dry bowl or glass measuring cup ready to collect the expressed breast milk. Stimulate the letdown reflex as discussed above,especially if her breasts are engorged. Gently massage her breasts to soften them and toencourage the breast milk to move down toward theareola. She may try one or more ways to massageher breasts. For example, some women massagetheir breasts in a warm shower or bath. Somewomen may use their fingertips; others may supporttheir breast with one hand while stroking the breastwith the other hand. Place the thumb and fingers about 1-1\u00bd inchesPROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 151behind the nipple or along the edge of the areola. The thumb and fingers are on opposite sides of her breast (see the diagram Position for Hand Expression below). Massage using small circles to rotate all around herbreast. Push straight back towards the chest wall. Gently compress the breast between the thumb andfingers and roll the fingers toward her nipple; thenrelax her fingers. If no breast milk comes, shift thethumb and finger placements either further from orcloser to the nipple and compress again; this willhelp the mother identify the sweet spots or ductsthat will yield breast milk ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Rotate her fingers and thumb around the breast. Repeat the above procedures in a rhythmic motionthat mimics the rhythm of the baby's suck, e.g.,position, push back, compress and/or roll, relax. Some practitioners may suggest that motherscompress their fingers using a pulsating motion. Switch breasts whenever the flow of breast milkdecreases, which may occur several times during the expression. This will stimulate several letdown reflexes more effectively than continuing on one side for a set time before switching. Rotate the thumb and fingers in different positionsaround the nipple to ensure that all the breast milkducts are emptied. Expect that it may take about the same time as itdoes to breastfeed, about 20 minutes or more, toeffectively hand express at the beginning. It maybecome faster once she is more proficient. (Source: Adapted from Riordan, 2010; Biancuzzo,2003; Mohrbacher, 2010.) Position for Hand ExpressionPush Back Compress and/or Roll Forward Breast Pumps Encourage the mother to: Wash her hands with soap and water. Assemble the breast pump according to the manufacturer's instructions. Moisten her breast with water before positioningthe breast shield over the nipple to help create abetter seal. Position the breast shield on her breast so that it iscentred over the nipple. For electric br east pumps, set the pump to the lowest setting before turning it on. The mother can gradually increase the setting during the pumping session. Inform the mother that an increased setting that causes her discomfort can inhibit the letdown reflex. The pump should also be kept on the minimal setting if the mother's breasts are engorged. Once the areola has softened, the mother can gradually increase the setting according to comfort. Using PROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 152a setting that is too high may contribute to nipple trauma. The container should be changed when it is three quarters full to prevent breast milk from backing up into the pump. Pump each breast until the breast is effectively drained, or just until softened if pumping to relieve engorgement: Double pumping is recommended, if possible, as this will decrease the pumping time in half andincrease the mother's prolactin levels. If the mother is single pumping, encourage her toswitch breasts whenever the flow of breast milkdecreases, which may occur several times duringthe pumping session. This will help to stimulateseveral letdown reflexes. When finished, the breast shield should be slowlyand carefully removed from her breast. Cleaning Instructions for Breast Pumps and Collection Equipment For Healthy Full-Term Babies at HomeWash your hands with soap and water before touching the breast milk containers. Prior to first use, sterilize all pump parts that come in contact with your breast or breast milk. Sterilization may not be necessary if you have purchased a pump that indicates that it is already sanitized or sterilized. Sterilization can be achieved by boiling pump parts for ten minutes, by using an electric sterilizer, byusing a sterilizer made for the microwave, or bywashing them in the top rack of a dishwasher. After each use, rinse all pum p parts in cool water to remove breast milk residue and then wash themwith hot water and mild soap or detergent. Avoidusing bottle brushes, abrasives or chemicals becausethey might scratch or damage the pump parts. Rinsethe pump parts thoroughly with clear water and airdry them on a clean towel or dish rack. Cover partswith a clean towel when not in use. Avoid storingwet or damp parts. Cleaning the tubing is necessary only ifcondensation or breast milk appears in the tubing.If condensation appears in the tubing, continuerunning the pump for another 1-2 minutes. If breastmilk gets in the tubing, remove the tubing from thepump, wash in warm soapy water and rinse in cold, clear water. To dry, shake out the droplets and hang to air dry or reattach the tubing and run the pump for 1-2 minutes. For Premature or Hospitalized Babies/Mother and/or Babies with Candidiasis All breast pump and collection parts should be sterilized after each pumping session (hospitalpolicies may vary). At home, the parts should first be washed in hotsoapy water and rinsed in hot water. The pump partsshould then be boiled in a covered pot of boilingwater for 10 minutes, then removed from the potto air dry (Protocol #15: Candidiasis (Thrush) andCPSO, 2005). Frequency of Breast Milk Expression If breastfeeding is stopped for any length of time, encourage the mother to express each breast ona regular basis in order to maintain breast milksupply. Generally, this is at least 8 times a day,with a minimum of 1 expression overnight. Themother may need to express more often if herbreasts become uncomfortable or full. A rentedhospital-grade electric breast pump is the mosteffective device for maintaining breast milk supplyif breastfeeding is stopped for any length of time. During the first 24 hours, if the baby is noteffectively transferring breast milk, expressionshould be initiated, beginning within 6 hours ofbirth and continuing 8 or more times in 24 hoursto promote establishment of lactation ( BFI Step 6, BCC, 2011 ). The preferred method is hand expression during the first 24 hours after birth. Storage of Breast Milk Provide the mother with information regarding the storage of breast milk. Containers for Storing Breast Milk in the Refrigerator or Freezer Glass or BPA-free hard plastic containers with an airtight lid should be used. Most mothers usecontainers manufactured specifically for breast milkcollection, but small jars and bottles with lids, suchas Mason jars, may be used. The mother can alsouse specially manufactured breast milk freezer bags. Disposable bottle liners should be avoided becausePROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 153they are made from a thin plastic that may break when frozen. These bags also do not have an airtight seal and can contaminate the breast milk or leak. Bottle liner bags are made for bottle feeding and not for storage. Note: If most of the baby's nutrition is from expressed breast milk, glass containers are the first choice for freezing, followed by hard plastic containers. Fewer antibodies are lost with glass than with plastic when freezing breast milk. Cleaning Instructions for Storage Containers For Healthy Full-Term Babies at Home Containers should be washed in hot soapy water, then rinsed in hot water and allowed to air dry.Once the containers are dry, they should becovered and stored in a dry, clean area away fromfood preparation until they are needed. For Premature or Hospitalized Babies/Mothers and/or Babies with Candidiasis Containers should first be washed in hot soapy water and rinsed well in hot water. They shouldthen be boiled in a covered pot of boiling water for10 minutes, and removed from the pot to air dry. Inthe hospital, sterilized containers may be provided. Storage Tips Encourage the mother to: Refrigerate or chill freshly expressed breast milk within 1 hour of expression if it is not going to beused within 6-8 hours. Expressed breast milk left at room temperature formore than 6-8 hours should be discarded. Store breast milk in small portions to minimizewaste, e.g., 60-120 ml (2-4 ounces). Combine smaller amounts of chilled breast milkexpressed on the same day to get the desiredamount. Always chill freshly expressed breast milk beforeadding it to frozen breast milk. This will preventthe frozen breast milk from thawing, and preventpotential bacterial growth. Place the breast milk at the back of the fridge orfreezer, where it is coldest. When freezing, leave a 1 inch space at the top of thestorage container or breast milk freezer bag becausebreast milk will expand when frozen. If a breast milk freezer bag is used, remove as much air as possible from the bag. Label each container with the date and time. Add the child's name if being used outside of the home. Storage Times Room Temperature: 25\u00b0C or 77\u00b0F for 6-8 hours. Insulated cooler with ice pack: 24 hours. Refrigerator: 4\u00b0C or 40\u00b0F: 5 days Freezer of a refrigerator -18\u00b0C or 0\u00b0F: 3-6 monthsChest or Upright freezer -20\u00b0C or 6-12 months (Source: Adapted from ABM, 2010 and TPH, 2011) Thawing Frozen Breast Milk Check the date on the container to make sure that the storage time has not expired (see previoussection on Storage Times). Any expired breast milkshould be discarded. Use the container with the earliest date first. Thaw the frozen breast milk by using one of thefollowing techniques: \u00b0 Place the container in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours; \u00b0 Place the container under running water or in a bowl of water. Do not permit the tap or water to touch the opening of the container. Caution: Frozen breast milk should never be left to thaw at room temperature, as this will increase the bacterial count in the breast milk. PROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 154 Do not thaw frozen breast milk on the stove top or in a microwave. Extreme heat from the stove ormicrowave will destroy vitamin C and antibodies inbreast milk. Use the thawed breast milk immediately or store itin the refrigerator for no longer than 24 hours. Never refreeze thawed breast milk. Shake the thawed breast milk. Breast milk that has been frozen and thawed will separate into layers, with the fat rising to the top. The breast milk can be gently shaken or mixed before it is fed to the baby. Thawedbreast milk may have a different smell and taste than freshly expressed breast milk. It is still safe for use if the date of the thawed breast milk has not expired. Warm the thawed breast milk by placing it in a bowlof warm water. Do not heat it in a microwave. The warmed breast milk should then be used within an hour. Do not return to the fridge after it has been warmed. It can be offered using an alternative feeding method (Protocol #18: Alternative Feeding Methods ). General Principles The establishment of a healthy breast milk supply requires early breast stimulation and frequent removal of breast milk from the mother's breasts, beginning soon after birth (Protocol #1: The Initiation of Breastfeeding). Early and frequent breast stimulation causes the mother's blood prolactin levels to rise, which contributes to increased breast milk production (see How the Breast Works). When breast milk is not regularly removed from the mother's breasts, the mother may be at risk for developing complications such as engorgement, plugged ducts, mastitis, and decreased breast milk supply. In addition, unrelieved engorgement may cause the mother' s breast milk supply to decrease (Protocol #5: Engorgement). Elicit the letdown or breast milk ejection reflex before initiating any method of breast milk expression (Riordan, 2010) . If the baby is not frequently and effectively breastfeeding, the expression of breast milk will be necessary to either establish or maintain a breast milk supply. Breast milk expression may be achieved by hand or with a mechanical device such as a breast pump. Hand expression is a foundational skill for the breastfeeding mother, and is particularly important in the first 24 hours postpartum, when the volume of breast milk is very small. It is recommended that all mothers know how to hand express prenatally ( BFI Step 3, BCC, 2011 ) or before they leave hospital ( BFI Step 5, BCC, 2011 ). Waiting until the last few weeks of pregnancy (37+ weeks) to practice hand massage of the mother's breasts will decrease any potential risk of triggering preterm labour. It is easier to see a positive output with hand expression for a small volume of breast milk. Thevolume may be too small to collect in the reservoirof a mechanical pump. This may negatively impactthe mother' s breastfeeding self-efficacy, leading her to believe that she is not able to produce enoughbreast milk. It can be more affirming for the mother toexpress her breast milk into a small reservoir, such as amedicine cup or shot glass. A recent qualitative descriptive study reflects a concern expressed by some lactation experts that there is a growing over-dependence on breastfeeding technology by both practitioners and parents ( Buckley, 2009). Buckley interviewed experienced lactation consultants (LCs), who observed that with increased medical interventions and technology in births, there has been an increased use of breast pumps, as a consequence. She reported a perception that pump use increased a mother's control over feedings. In addition, it quantifies breast milk. Some mothers plan to purchase breast pumps prior to birth, in anticipation and expectation that they will need them, and before they know specifically how they will use them. The assumption that a pump is needed can further undermine a mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy. Double pumping (pumping both breasts at the same time) with a hospital-grade electric breast pump is the most effective method for increasing or maintaining breast milk supply if breastfeeding is stopped for any length of time. Double pumping also decreases pumping time by half and increases the mother's blood prolactin levels when compared to single pumping or pumping one breast at a time ( Neifert & Seacat, 1985 in Riordan, 2010 ). The suction from the breast pump removes breast milk but does not completely empty the breast. Combining pumping and breast massage has been shown to increase breast milk production in research conducted by Jane Morton, MD, Stanford University, and PROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 155Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. She found that using both breast massage and \"hands-on pumping\" increased a mother's average daily volumes by 48% (Morton et al., 2009). Breast milk expression is physical as well as psychological in nature. When the mother expresses breast milk, the physical cues that she would receivefrom her baby for a letdown reflex to occur are absent. The mother needs to understand that breast milk expression does not replicate putting her baby to her breast to remove breast milk. She will need continued support and practice to successfully express breast milk. Chilled or thawed previously frozen breast milk may be reported to be sour, rancid, or have a soapy odour, and may be rejected by the infant. This has been attributed to a change in the lipid structure during the freeze-thaw process, but does not mean that the breast milk is spoiled or unsafe. Some women may have more lipase activity than others. Lawrence reports that when these mothers heated their breast milk to scalding (not boiling) prior to chilling the effect was not apparent and the breast milk was accepted by their infants ( Lawrence, 2010 ). To avoid the disappointment of discarding large amounts of expressed breast milk, a mother could first chill a small amount of expressed breast milk to ensure that it does not smell or taste rancid before planning to freeze large amounts of it. Storage times recommended for breast milk depend on when the breast milk will be used, the conditions under which it is collected and stored, and a balance between preventing contamination and protecting the physiochemical and antibacterial properties of breast milk. Most contamination of stored breast milk occurs during collection regardless of how it is stored (Orgundele, 2002) . Breast milk should be refrigerated or chilled within1 hour of expression if it will not be used within6-8 hours. Breast milk should be frozen immediately if it willnot be used within 5 days. Room Temperature - Although the recommended storage times for breast milk at room temperature vary from 4 hours at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) to 24 hours at 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) ), up to 8 hours ( Ogundele, 2002) and up to 10 hours at 19-22\u00b0C (66-71\u00b0 F) (Barger & Bull, 1987 in Mohrbacher, 2010 ), the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends storage at 6-8 hours at room temperatures from 16-29\u00b0C (60-85\u00b0F) under very clean conditions ( ABM Protocol #8, 2010 ). Refrigerator - Similarly, there is variability in the recommended times for refrigerator storage of breast milk. Pardou (1994) found that storage at 0-4\u00b0C was safe for up to 8 days, Health Canada proposed 3 days in its updated Nutrition for Healthy Term Infants ( Health Canada, 2012 ), and Lawrence recommends 48 hours in the refrigerator ( Lawrence, 2010 ). The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends that breast milk may be safely stored in a refrigerator for up to 72 hours in optimal conditions (not defined), or for up to 5 days if it is collected under very clean conditions ( ABM, 2010 ). Toronto Public Health recommends that the refrigerator temperature be 4\u00b0C or 40\u00b0F ( TPH, 2011 ). Breast milk should be stored at the back of the refrigerator, furthest away from the door. Freezer - The type of freezer determines the recommended storage times for frozen breast milk. A freezer with a separate door is able to maintain a more stable temperature. The less frequently a freezer is opened, the longer the breast milk can be stored safely. A deep freezer, chest, or upright freezer at -20\u00b0C or -4\u00b0F can safely store breast milk for 6-12months. A refrigerator/freezer with separate doors at -18\u00b0C or 0\u00b0F will store breast milk safely for 3-6 months. A freezer compartment located within a fridge can store frozen breast milk for only 2 weeks ( CDC, 2010 ) because the door opens frequently and the temperature varies. Breast milk should be stored at the back of the freezer, furthest away from the door.PROTOCOL REVISED Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 156References Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine [ABM].

Being able to anticipate and understand these changes can facilitate ongoing maternal/child cohesion and the mother's breastfeeding self-efficacy. Observation and Assessment Assess the baby for: Breast refusal Change in behaviour Altered attention span Developmental milestones including appropriate growth (see Appendix D and E: WHO Growth Charts) Health status Signs of teething Changes in breastfeeding patterns Signs that the baby is ready for introduction to solids. Assess the mother for: Breastfeeding expectations and goalsSore nipples Changes in breast milk supply Maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy, stress and coping challenges, including available support Ineffective latching ( Protocol #2: Positioning and Latching) Return to work or school/change in routine Maternal infant separation Changes in fertility and menstruation Suggestions 1.Offer information to the mother about expected developmental changes in her baby and the impact developmental changes can have on breastfeeding ( Riordan & Waumback, 2010 ). General Developmental Principles Age Breastfeeding Behaviour First day postpartum-may or may not breastfeed following delivery -sleepy, learning to suckle -can generally maximize the use of basic reflexes to self-latch 1 month-becoming efficient at suckling -breastfeeds at least 8 times per day 2 months -easily pacified by frequent breastfeeding 3 months- will interrupt breastfeeding to turn to look at the father or anotherfamiliar person coming into the room or to smile at the mother 4-5 months-continues to enjoy frequent breastfeeding at the breast -beginning of teething; may interrupt breastfeedings due to sore gumsBreastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 158General Developmental Principles (continued) Age Breastfeeding Behaviour 7-8 months-will breastfeed anytime and anywhere -actively attempts to get to the breast, i.e., tries to unbutton mother 's shirt 9-10 months-easily distracted by surroundings and interrupts breastfeeding frequently -may hold the breast with one while breastfeeding 11-12 months-tries \"acrobatic\" breastfeeding 12-15 months-uses top hand to while breastfeeding, e.g., forces a finger into the mother's mouth, plays with her hair or pinches her other nipple -hums or vocalizes while breastfeeding -vocalizes need to word 16-20 months-verbalizes delight with breastfeeding -takes mother by her hand and leads her to favourite breastfeeding place 20-24 months-stands up at times while breastfeeding -breastfeeds more for comfort than for nourishment -when asked to do so by the mother, willing to wait until later for brestfeeding Encourage the mother in understanding that: Growth spurts are rapid periods of growth in which the baby will breastfeed more often in responseto an increased caloric need. The mother shouldbreastfeed in response to infant feeding cues. Herbreast milk supply will increase accordingly ( Walker, 2011). It can be expected that babies will increase the number and lengths of breastfeeding during thesecond and third week of life. This can also happenat around 6 weeks and 3 months ( Mohrbacher et al., 2010). It is very important to keep in mind that each infant is an individual and may present a range ofbreastfeeding behaviours that change over time i.e.,may experience growth spurts at different times,may gain weigh differently, may prefer one breastover the other, may start solids at different times,and may wean at different times ( Walker, 2011 ). Growth spurts can affect the baby's temperamentand sleeping patterns, but are temporary. Teething can cause changes in establishedbreastfeeding patterns due to the baby's painfulgums ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Babies who breastfeed during teething have beenshown to experience less discomfort ( The Nigerian Dental Journal, 2009 ). Older babies may bite as a result of learning/exploring the new capabilities of their growingand changing bodies, and not out of \"meanness\"( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). Many babies never bite. There comes a time when breastfeeding alone willno longer fulfill the baby's nutritional needs andsolids should be introduced ( Riordan and Wambach, 2010). Encourage the mother to: Respond promptly to the cry of her older baby. She will not spoil the baby by being attentive to his/herneeds. Breastfeed in a quiet, dimly lit room, if possible,giving the baby her focused attention.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 159 Learn to notice cues that the baby is finished breastfeeding to limit the opportunity for the babyto bite. Ensure baby is well latched. Keep breast milk supply high by avoidingunnecessary/over-supplementation. Pump according to her regular breastfeeding patternwhen away from the baby to maintain her breastmilk supply. Make note of behaviours that precede biting. Make breastfeeding a relaxed and positiveexperience. Pressuring the baby to breastfeed cancause breast refusal and biting, as well as otherfeeding concerns in the future. If biting does occurs, stop breastfeeding and offerthe baby something suitable to bite, or quickly setthe baby on the floor or in a safe place away fromher. Continue to be in tune to baby's hunger andsatiety cues. A baby-led approach during bothbreastfeeding and introduction to solids can help toensure that feeding remains a positive experience( Mohrbacher, 2012 ). Offer nutrient-dense complementary solid foods,with particular attention to iron, at 6 months of age( TPH). As baby's intake of solid foods increases, the intakeof breast milk will proportionally decrease. Continued frequent breastfeeding is encouraged forbabies over a year old as they still receive essentialnutrients from breast milk, e.g., essential fatty acids,vitamin A, calcium and riboflavin ( Mohrbacher, 2012 ). Approach breastfeeding times with patience,encouragement, and eye contact and do not be tooconcerned about breast milk quantity ( Mohrbacher, 2012). 2.Offer information that supports the mother as her body changes. Encourage the mother in understanding that: As baby's body and needs change, so does her body. If she has a large storage capacity the baby will more likely sleep through the night, but if herstorage capacity is small, night breastfeedings maybe necessary for many months. Breast tissue is at its peak at 1-6 months post-partum. It decreases between 6-9 months. Decreasein breast tissue is not reflective of breast milkproduction. At 15 months postpartum, breast tissue has usuallyreturned to pre-pregnancy size. Health issues can change breast milk supply afterthe first weeks postpartum. These include, but arenot limited to, hormonal, thyroid, and pituitaryproblems, PCOS, pregnancy, serious illness orstress, routine, and drugs that change breast milksupply. Other factors can cause breastfeeding issues in olderbabies and need to be assessed. These include: \u00b0 Overabundant breast milk supply ( Protocol #13: Overabundant Breast Milk Supply/Forceful Letdown or Breast Milk Ejection Refle x) \u00b0 Insufficient breast milk supply ( Protocol #12: Insufficient B east Milk Supply disease, i.e., cancer. 3.Offer information that supports the breastfeeding mother while she returns to fertility. Encourage the mother in understanding that: Return of menstruation can also alter the baby's breastfeeding behaviour. Decreased estrogen levels and increased prolactatinlevels during exclusive breastfeeding will impacther fertility. Lactation Amenorrhea Method (LAM) has been shown to be 98% effective when used within parameters that maintain/ensure this hormonal balance. Mothers can be taught to appropriately use LAM by frequently evaluating and re-evaluating these questions: 1.Have your menses returned? 2. Are you supplementing or allowing long periods(more than 6 hours during the night, 4 hoursduring the day) without breastfeeding? 3.Is your baby more than 6 months old? (Mohrbacher, 2010)Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 160If the mother answers \"yes\" to any of the questions above, another form of birth control should be used. Light spotting is the first indication that she is becoming fertile again (Morbacher, 2010) . She can continue to breastfeed if she becomespregnant; breast milk still contains nutrition forchildren of any age. Breast milk may change in taste as a resultof hormonal changes from menstruation andpregnancy, and the baby may refuse to breastfeed.This is especially true late in the second trimester ofpregnancy, when the components of mature breastmilk begin to resemble colostrum, which is moreviscous, contains more sodium, and is smaller involume. Breast/nipple changes during pregnancy may causediscomfort in breastfeeding. Breastfeeding throughout a healthy pregnancy hasnot been shown to pose a risk to the mother or thefetus. The mother must remain well nourished andtake supplements. The mother may notice uterine contractions duringbreastfeeding or intercourse due to increasedoxytocin levels. These contractions have notbeen shown to cause complications or concernsin a healthy pregnancy. Women with high-riskpregnancies or a history of prenatal concerns shouldconsult their health care practitioners for guidance. The mother may need to adopt new breastfeedingpositions as her abdomen grows ( Mohrbacher, 2010 ). References Mohrbacher, N. (2012). Breastfeeding answers made simple: A guide for helping mothers.

Ideally, the process begins when it is mutually agreeable for both mother and baby. Like all other aspects of breastfeeding, it is most successful when it is baby-led. Observation and Assessment Signs of Natural Weaning (Baby-Led) Assess the baby for: Gradual lack of interest in breastfeeding that takes place over a period of weeks or months, andgenerally occurs between the ages of 2 and 4 years. Absence of any other cause for breast refusal(Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchievingor Maintaining a Latch ). Signs that are Commonly Mistaken as the Need to W ean (Mother-Initiated) Baby is teething. Mother is feeling overwhelmed with caring forthe baby. Caring for a baby may be challengingregardless of the method of feeding. Mother develops mastitis ( Protocol #7: Mastitis ). Mother plans to return to work or school. If breastfeeding the baby or expressing breast milk atwork is not feasible, the mother can still breastfeedher baby when she is home. Mother is prescribed a drug that is incompatiblewith breastfeeding. When there is a drug that isincompatible with breastfeeding, there is usuallyan alternative drug that can be prescribed ( Protocol #16: Drugs and Breastfeeding). Mother or baby are ill/hospitalized. In the case ofan ill baby , the anti-infective properties of breast milk will aid in the baby's recovery. If temporaryweaning is medically indicated, the mother canexpress breast milk to maintain her breast milksupply until breastfeeding can be resumed ( Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessationof Breastfeeding ). Mother is pregnant with no complications. Signs of \"Nursing Strikes\" (NOT Weaning): Baby had been breastfeeding several times a day. Baby suddenly refuses to breastfeed ( Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving orMaintaining a Latch ). Is usually temporary. Can occur at any age. Suggestions 1.Assess whether the decision to wean is baby-or mother-initiated (see previous section on Observation and Assessment). If the decision is mother-initiatedand she is sure that she wants to wean, then herdecision should be respected. 2.Assess whether weaning is necessary (i.e., related to a medication that is not compatible with breastfeeding or to a procedure that may separate themother and baby). 3.If the decision to wean is made, provide the mother with suggestions to facilitate the weaning process. General Tips for Weaning Encourage the mother to: Not offer the breast, but also not refuse to breastfeed. Postpone breastfeeding if she feels that the baby can wait. This is a useful technique to encourageweaning if the baby breastfeeds irregularly andthe mother finds it difficult to gradually eliminatecertain breastfeedings. Shorten the breastfeedings that she wants toeliminate before she actually stops. Change daily routines that trigger or usuallyprecede a breastfeeding (e.g., avoid sitting in theplace where breastfeeding usually occurs). Offer substitutions and distractions during the timeswhen breastfeeding is anticipated (e.g., offering asnack, reading, singing, or going to the park beforethe child has a chance to think about breastfeeding).Ask other family members to help providesubstitutions and distractions.Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 162Gradual Weaning Encourage the mother to: Eliminate breastfeeding gradually. Suggest she eliminate one breastfeeding at a time every sooften until the selected or all breastfeeding(s)are eliminated over a period of time (severalweeks, months or years). Begin by eliminatingthe breastfeeding(s) the baby is least interested in.Early morning and late night feedings are usuallythe most difficult for the baby to give up. If thebaby is younger than 9-12 months, replace theeliminated breastfeeding(s) with artificial baby milk(iron fortified infant formula). If the baby is morethan 9-12 months and is eating a variety of foods,the eliminated breastfeeding(s) can be replacedwith appropriate food and beverages. A cup may beintroduced at between 6-9 months of age (Best Start, 2011) . Express only enough breast milk for comfort asneeded (Protocol #19: Expressing and StoringBreast Milk ). Avoid expressing breast milk unless absolutely necessary. This gradual approach willslowly decrease the mother's breast milk supply andminimize breast fullness and discomfort. Observe for signs of engorgement, plugged ducts,and mastitis ( Protocol Abrupt Weaning If weaning is due to an incompatible medication, a medical procedure, or separation, encourage the mother to: Express only enough breast milk for comfort as needed (Protocol #19: Expr essing and Storing Breast Milk ). Avoid expressing breast milk unless absolutely necessary. Inform the mother that shewill gradually express less breast milk at fewerintervals until her breast milk supply dries up withina couple of weeks. Observe for signs of engorgement, plugged ducts,and mastitis ( Protocol # Protocol #7: Mastitis ). Apply a cold wet cloth to the breasts afterexpressing to provide comfort and reduce swelling. Wear breast pads, if necessary, for leaking. Wear a firm bra for support. Avoid bras withunderwire. Eat and drink a balanced diet according to Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide ( Health Canada, 2007 ). Drink when thirsty. There is no need to restrict fluidintake. Avoid binding the breasts as this has not beenproven to be effective. Binding may increase breastdiscomfort as well as the risk of plugged ducts andmastitis. Avoid drugs used to decrease breast milk supply(e.g., bromocriptine). These drugs can have seriousside effects such as strokes and seizures. Consult her primary health care provider orbreastfeeding expert to discuss alternativemedications compatible with breastfeeding or a planfor temporary cessation that includes expressionand discarding of breast milk. Nursing Strikes To encourage the baby to return to the breast, suggest that the mother: Give the baby more eye-to-eye contact. Clothe the baby in a diaper only to promote skin-to- skin contact. Breastfeed in a quiet, relaxed place with fewdistractions. Initiate breastfeeding before the baby is stressed andcryin g (see early feeding cues in Protocol #3: Signs of Effective Breastfeeding ). Write down a record of changes in both diet andactivities. This may help to show if there has beenan illness, teething, or a different food, clothing, orproduct used. Express some breast milk for comfort if her breastsare too full. Offer expressed breast milk from a cup. Relax. Be patient. Be reassured that the baby willusually resume breastfeeding in a few hours ordays. General Principles Weaning begins when the baby is introduced to sources of foods other than breast milk and completely ends with the last breastfeeding. Babies are developmentally ready to begin the introduction of complementary foods at about 6 months of age. Foods other than breast milk that are introduced before 6 months will compromise the mother's Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 163breast milk supply and may deprive the baby of nutrients. Breast milk feedings should not be replaced prematurely by foods such as infant cereals or other \"first foods\" as these may displace breast milk, resulting in inadequate energy and nutrient intake and depriving the baby of some of the long-term benefits of breastfeeding. Early use of complementary foods may interfere with the bioavailability of iron in breast milk and may increase the risk of iron deficiency anemia ( ADA & DC, 2000 ). For the healthy term infant there is no nutritional or developmental advantage from introducing other foods before 6 months. Ideally, weaning is a joint decision shared by the mother and baby and is based on the nutritional and developmental needs of the baby. In North America, weaning commonly takes place during the first year and tends to be mother-led. Historically, this mother-led weaning occurred when the mother returned to work or school routines. Weaning that is naturally initiated by the baby will usually occur between the ages of 2 and 4 years and will take place over a period of weeks or months ( Dettwyler, 2004 ). If the baby is less than a year old and is refusing to breastfeed, it is unlikely that this is natural weaning (see Nursing Strikes above and Protocol #9: Breast Refusal or DifficultyAchieving or Maintaining a Latch). Although breastfeeding beyond a year has not been common practice in Western society, later breastfeeding continues to provide benefits to both the mother and baby. The importance of breastfeeding includes: For the baby, reduced risk of: \u00b0 Sudden infant death syndrome \u00b0 Gastrointestinal, ear, and respiratory infections during infancy and childhood \u00b0 Diabetes \u00b0 Childhood obesity ( TPH, 2010 ) For the mother, reduced risk of: \u00b0 Diabetes \u00b0 Breast cancer\u00b0 Ovarian cancer ( TPH, 2010 )There are three types of weaning:Partial \u00b0 Selected breastfeeding session(s) are replaced with other sources of foods. \u00b0 Partial weaning can be reversed and the mother can return to more frequent breastfeedings at a later time. Complete \u00b0 All breastfeedings are replaced with other sourcesof foods. Temporary \u00b0 Occasionally breastfeeding may be interruptedtemporarily, such as when either the mother or child is ill or separated. Breast milk is expressed manually or by pump (see Protocol #19: Expressing and Storing of Breast Milk ). If breastfeeding is interrupted due to an incompatible medication or procedure, breast milk should be discarded. There are two methods of weaning: Gradual \u00b0 Weaning takes place over a period of time (several weeks, months, or years). \u00b0 Least traumatic for both the mother and baby and minimizes complications (e.g., plugged ducts, mastitis). Abrupt \u00b0 Weaning occurs immediately. \u00b0 May be more traumatic for both mother and baby. \u00b0 Increases the risk of complications (e.g., plugged ducts, mastitis, and depression due to the sudden drop in prolactin levels). \u00b0 May be necessary due to medical reasons (Protocol #17: Indications for Supplementation or Cessation of Breastfeeding ).Breastfeeding Protocols for Health Care Providers | Toronto Public Health 164References American Dietetic Association [ADA] and Dietitians of Canada [DC].
