We are at a crucial juncture in the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a pressing need to analyse emerging data from countries around the world to identify the most important factors that can help slow the spread of the virus and help find long-term solutions to the pandemic. Science has helped to guide the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and there is more the community can do to complement existing efforts. DELVE: Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics is a multi-disciplinary group, convened by the Royal Society, to support a data-driven approach to learning from the different approaches countries are taking to managing the pandemic. This effort has been discussed with and welcomed by Government, who have arranged for it to provide input through SAGE, its scientific advisory group for emergencies. DELVE will contribute data driven analysis to complement the evidence base informing the UK's strategic response, by: This work will be carried out by three cross-disciplinary groups: The Committee includes the following individuals: Venki Ramakrishnan FRS (Chair), President of the Royal Society Charles Bangham FMedSci FRS, Professor of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London Paul Edelstein, Emeritus Professor CE of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Nigel Field (Chair of Working Group), Director of the Centre of Molecular Epidemiology and Translational Research at the Institute for Global Health, University College London Tim Gowers FRS, Royal Society Research Professor, Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge Bryan Grenfell FRS, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Public Affairs, Princeton Demis Hassabis FREng FRS, Co-founder and CEO of DeepMind (serving in a personal capacity) Anne Johnson FMedSci, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at University College London and Vice President of the Academy of Medical Sciences Daniel Kahneman, Professor of Psychology and Public Affairs Emeritus at the Woodrow Wilson School, the Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton University, and a fellow of the Center for Rationality at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem Neil Lawrence (Working Group), Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge Julie Maxton, Executive Director, Royal Society Lalita Ramakrishnan FMedSci FRS, Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases and Head of Molecular Immunity Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge Sylvia Richardson FMedSci, Chair of Biostatistics and Director of the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, President Elect of the Royal Statistical Society Devi Sridhar, Professor of Global Public Health, University of Edinburgh Nick Stern FBA FRS, IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government, Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and Head of the India Observatory at the London School of Economics Yee Whye Teh (Working Group), Professor at the Department of Statistics of the University of Oxford (seconded from his part time role as a Research Scientist at DeepMind) The Royal Society is also convening the [Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) initiative](/topics-policy/Health-and-wellbeing/ramp) to support efforts to model the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. RAMP is bringing modelling expertise from areas other than pandemic modelling to support the pandemic modelling community already working on Coronavirus (COVID-19). "}
