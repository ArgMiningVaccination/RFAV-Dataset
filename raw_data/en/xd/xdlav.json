Typically a chiropractor in Chapel Hill, NC, will administer some form of massage to help loosen any tension before the adjustment. Often during the adjustment, patients will hear a snap, crackle, pop sound. This is nothing to be concerned about and is the result of pockets of gas being released during the adjustment. While in some cases, patients may experience slight discomfort or pressure, much of the time, the adjustment is followed by relief. #2.
