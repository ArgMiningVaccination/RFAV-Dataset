The positive rate wa s between 80%-100% and GMT (1:) of serum antibody titer between 9.3~46.7. After immunization with COVID-19 vaccine, there was a good cross reaction between serum and all strains. Recently, the Institute of zoology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and CDC of Guangdong Province have conducted cross neutralization evaluation on the sera of vaccinated patients with British and South African strains respectively. The evaluation results show that the human sera immunized with vaccines can effectively neutralize the mutated virus strains imported from Britain and South Africa, and the neutralization effect is lower than that of domestic virus strains. 600SU with the schedule 0,14 was vaccinated by emer gency use procedures in the three countries, it showed good safety without vac cine enhancement disease (VED).
