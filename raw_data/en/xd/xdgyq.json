On this page, uncover more about renewable energy sources, including wind, sunlight, waste plastic, and biomass. Access educational resources on high-efficiency homes, organic waste to energy production, and solar energy leases. Renewable Energy Sources Renewable energy is energy derived from [replenishing natural sources](https://extension.psu.edu/renewable-and-nonrenewable-resources). Trees are one of the most popular and useful renewable energy resources. [Wood energy](https://extension.psu.edu/wood-energy) can be utilized in numerous ways, including pelletizing. While most pellets in use today are made from wood, [biomass grass pellets](https://extension.psu.edu/on-farm-production-of-biomass-grass-pellets-a-case-study) from switchgrass and other perennials could be an exciting new opportunity for farmers in the US. Wind is another natural energy resource that has quickly been growing in popularity among Pennsylvanians. [Wind energy systems](https://extension.psu.edu/wind-energy) typically generate electricity through windmill turbines that range from small wind turbines for homes to large units that soar hundreds of feet in the air. Other popular types of renewable energy sources are hydro energy, tidal energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy.

Solar Energy and Solar Leases Sunlight is one of the most important sources of renewable energy. One of the main [solar energy](https://extension.psu.edu/solar-energy) advantages is that sunlight is an abundant resource that is not finite or exhaustible. Generally speaking, there are two main types of solar energy systems - photovoltaics and thermal. [Solar photovoltaic systems](https://extension.psu.edu/solar-pv-electric-systems-is-there-a-good-fit-for-me) use various methods, including silicon panels, to convert solar radiation to electricity. Thermal systems aim to store heat from the sun via active systems (such as solar hot water heaters) or passive systems (such as buildings that automatically store and utilize solar energy). With utility-scale solar electricity projects expanding across the States, many landowners are faced with the decision of whether to lease their land for solar energy development. Leases can provide extra income to landowners; however, it's worth noting that this leasing decision [can affect the property](https://extension.psu.edu/landowner-leasing-for-utility-scale-solar-farms) in the long-term. Penn State Extension provides property owners with a number of educational resources on [solar leasing](https://extension.psu.edu/solar-leasing-for-landowners). Webinars and workshops are available on how to [ensure a good lease deal](https://extension.psu.edu/dealing-with-solar-leases), as well as what to consider [before signing a lease](https://extension.psu.edu/solar-leasing-ten-things-you-should-know-before-leasing-your-land-for-solar-development) for solar development. Waste to Energy Bioenergy, or biomass energy, is energy derived from organic matter that can be used to fuel vehicles, as well as produce heat and electricity. While wood is among the best-known biomass energy sources, bioenergy can be generated by using other resources, such as materials that would otherwise go to waste. [Resource recovery](https://extension.psu.edu/resource-recovery-turning-waste-into-energy) is an important step towards reducing the volume of waste entering the landfill while gaining valuable energy. What's more, converting waste to energy provides the US with an excellent opportunity to [increase sustainability](https://extension.psu.edu/sustainability-in-america-waste-to-energy) and grow new business ventures. Potential waste streams include food processing waste, urban wood waste, and [waste plastic](https://extension.psu.edu/waste-plastics-as-fuel). Additionally, by utilizing an anaerobic digester to [convert manure to energy](https://extension.psu.edu/biogas-from-manure), animal waste can be used as an alternative energy source for many livestock farmers, as well. On this page, find comprehensive information on renewable energy sources. Topics include, among many others, [manufacturing fuel pellets](https://extension.psu.edu/manufacturing-fuel-pellets-from-biomass) from biomass and producing [waste biogas](https://extension.psu.edu/waste-biogas-production-from-stackable-long-stem-materials) from stackable materials. An online course on [applied biogas technology](https://extension.psu.edu/applied-biogas-technology-converting-organic-waste-to-energy) is also available. The course teaches the basics of biogas, allowing participants to learn how it's produced, as well as its advantages over fossil fuel.
