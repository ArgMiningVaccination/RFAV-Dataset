We've heard you and put together a list of answers to the most asked questions. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now known as Comirnaty, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are available for children ages 6 months and older through emergency use authorization (EUA). The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also has permanent approval for people ages 12 and older. Vaccinating this age group will help kids get back to their normal lives including school, sports and more, while keeping high-risk family members and others safe. While most children are at lower risk for severe illness from COVID-19, there are still many unknown long-term effects. While uncommon, it is also possible for children infected with COVID-19 to become seriously ill or worse. Vaccination also allows for safe return to activities and normal life. Vaccination will: Clinical trials show COVID-19 vaccines are very effective in children. In fact, data shows the immune response for children ages 12 to 15 was better than trial participants ages 16-25, with no COVID cases in the vaccinated group. Trials for younger children took place during the Omicron waves, which lowered the vaccine's effectiveness. However, the vaccines were still protective, generating similar antibody levels as vaccines for older age groups. Side effects in children are similar to those in other age groups. The most common side effects include: For the Pfizer vaccine, 12- to 15-year-olds will receive the same dosing as adults. Clinical trials tested the adult dose and two smaller doses to determine safety and efficacy. This dose was proven safe and shown to be most effective for this age group. Children aged five to 11 years receive a smaller dose as part of a two-dose series, and children six months to 4 years receive an even smaller dose in a three-dose series. For Moderna, children aged six months to 5 years receive one-quarter the adult dose in a two-dose series. Children aged six to 11 years receive half the adult dose, and children 12 to 17 years old receive the full adult dose, both as a two-dose series. It's mostly fat, salt, electrolytes and sugar. Lipids, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), are the \"fatty layer\" that protects the delicate mRNA so it has time to work before getting chopped up. Potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride and dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate and sucrose are just fancy names for some salts and sugar. These ingredients help keep the vaccine stable and are natural preservatives. Billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been given worldwide. The COVID-19 vaccine is no longer \"new.\" Scientists and pediatricians feel confident in the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine and the booster. Waiting puts children at higher risk for infection and illness. The vaccine and booster got to us fast because: Since it has been given to so many with very few complications over a year now, there is a lot of confidence in the safety of the COVID vaccine. We now know that COVID complications from the disease can be MUCH worse than complications we have seen with the vaccine. As of June 2022, over 13 million COVID-19 pediatric cases have been reported in the U.S. The CDC estimates 209,254 pediatric hospitalizations in the U.S. As of June 2022, there have been 8,525 cases of MIS-C, a serious health condition affecting multiple organs that has been linked to COVID-19 infection. Over 1,200 pediatric deaths* have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S. Although this seems low compared to adults, COVID is now one of the top 10 causes of death for adolescents in the United States. Data from: [https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3) Long COVID has also been reported among kids. The U.K Office for National Statistics is reporting that roughly 12-14% of kids experience long-term side effects of COVID. The Omicron variant has changed the game. It is three times more transmissible than the Delta variant and spreads much more quickly. More quarantine, worsening mental health and school concerns: Those children and teens without the vaccine will likely face more quarantines and more isolation from school, sports, and other activities. This can lead to increased mental health concerns. Myocarditis is an extremely rare side effect of the mRNA vaccine, affecting about 26 cases of per one million doses given. That's a 0.0026% risk. Most cases are mild, and teens often recover on their own or with minimal treatment like ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin). In addition, we know that myocarditis is much more common if you get COVID or even the flu, and the risks of heart disease from COVID infection can be more severe and long lasting. The vaccine requires two doses three or four weeks apart, depending upon vaccine. Immunity takes some time to develop- at least two weeks after last the last injection. For example, someone vaccinated in late December won't be fully protected until late January or early February. To be considered up to date on COVID vaccines, [people should receive all recommended boosters.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) Although the risk that fully vaccinated people could become infected with COVID-19 is lower than for unvaccinated people, any fully vaccinated person who experiences [symptoms consistent with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) should [isolate themselves from others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html), be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, and tested for COVID-19, if indicated. The symptomatic fully vaccinated person should inform their healthcare provider of their vaccination status at the time of care.
