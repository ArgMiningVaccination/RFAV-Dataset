Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses, animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, and modeling estimates, the median infectious dose is likely between 10 and 1,000 viral particles (plaque -forming units, PFU). We need to know the infecti ous dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How eas ily is it spread? ..................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, primarily through close contact and aerosol transmission.30, 78, 314, 528 At least six variants have higher transmission rates than the original, non -variant SARS -CoV-2 lineage.93 COVID -19 vaccines reduce transmission rates by approximately 54% (range of 38 -66%).680 The amount of infectious virus emitted from an infectious individual is unclear, but appears highly variable. Asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2634 and play a large role in new case growth.452 Infection risk is particularly high indoors,50 while outdoor transmission is rare.85 Household transmission is rapid,16 and household contacts spr ead infection more than casual community contacts.548 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low,292 particularly on airplanes.578 Infection in children is underestimated,212, 747 and children of any age can acquire and transmit infection.708 There is some evidence that younger children (<10 -15) are less susceptible439 and less infectious449 than older children and adults.293 We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission and the effect of new variants. Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ........................................................ 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SA RS-CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.455, 467, 469 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.67 SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated i n 2002/2003. Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans, but the potential role of long -term reservoir species is unknown. Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection.378 We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during thi s time? ........................ 6 On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. Acute Clinical Presentation - What are the initial signs and symptoms of an infe cted person? .............................................. 7 Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.115 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions493 are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.572 Fever is most often the first symptom. The B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants are associated with increased hospitalizatio n and mortality.124 Approximately 33% of individuals will remain asymptomatic after SARS -CoV-2 infection.571 COVID -19 is more severe than seasonal influenza,729 evidenced by higher ICU admissi on832 and mortality rates.608 In the US, 29 -34% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission, and 12.6 -13.6% died from COVID -19.524, 549 Adults >60 years old584 and those with comorbidities278, 481 are at elevated risk of hospitalization565 and death.737, 858 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19,527 independent of underlying conditions.545 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,201 though generally show milder133, 487 or no symptoms. We need to know the impact of new SARS -CoV-2 variants on presentation and disease severity. Chronic Clinical Presentation - What are the long -term symptoms of COVID -19 infection? .................................................... 8 COVID -19 symptoms co mmonly persist for weeks735 to months96 after initial onset539 in up to 73% of those infected.541 We need to know the rate of PASC and chronic symptoms in different patient populations. Protec tive Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ....................................... 9 Recovered individuals appear protected against reinfection for at least several months. Reinfection is rare, though novel variants may increase reinfection frequency. Immune responses persist in most patients for >6 months. Convalescent patients are exp ected to have long -lasting protection against SARS -CoV-2, especially after vaccination.791 The impact of emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants on protective immunity and reinfection risk is unclear. Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible but appears rare, though the true frequency is unknown. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 In patients recovered from natural infection, one dose of an mRNA vaccine increases protective immunity, but the benefits of a second dose are unclear.198 In uninfected individuals, two doses of mRNA vaccines show clear benefits. We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? ..................10 Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.611 We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? .........................................................................................................11 COVID -19 treatment recommendations are provided by the WHO,808 NIH,552 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA),55 and British Medical Journal (BMJ),64 based on ongoing analysis of evidence from clinical trials. Recommendations for the use of Remdesivir vary. We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ...............................................................................................................................12 Three safe284 and effective589 vaccines are currently being administered under US FDA Emergency Use. \"Breakthrough\" infections are rare102 and associated with milder illness, but more common in those with comorbidities.32 We need to understand the long -term impact of SARS -CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy and the need for boosters. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? .....................13 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission. Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.591 Particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreadi ng events are more likely.819 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. Lifting NPIs before widespread vaccine upta ke is predicted to increase COVID -19 cases and deaths.157, 585 We need to understand the magnitude of measures necessary to limit spread of new SARS -CoV-2 variants. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .......................................................................14 SARS- CoV-2 can survive o n surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity.52 Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS- CoV-2 transmission in humans. Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks. SARS- CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium. There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food or food packaging.372, 801 We need to quantify the duration of viable SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? .........................................................15 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Several methods exist fo r decontaminating N95 respirators564 and other PPE. We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to indoor aerosol transmission. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .....................................................................................................16 Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high r isk of acquiring COVID - 19, even with recommended PPE. We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ...............................................................................17 Current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? .................................................................................18 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Several viral variants have higher transmissibility and disease severity than initial SARS -CoV-2 strains. We need to identify differences in transmissibility or severity caused by different SARS -CoV-2 mutations and v ariants. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods exist? ................................................................................................. 19 Several platforms provide digita l dashboards summarizing the current status of the pandemic in US states and counties. The US CDC provides ensemble forecasts of cases and deaths based on the average of many participating groups.104 Ensemble forecasts gener ally show better predictive accuracy than individual forecast models.163 Additional forecasting efforts are designed to assess the effects of interventions such as social distancing and vaccination. We need to know how different vaccine uptake rates will affect the epidemic in the US and neighboring countries. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses , animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, and modeling estimates, the median infectious dose is likely between 10 and 1,000 viral particles ( plaque -forming units , PFU). The UK has initiated a human challenge study to determine the intranasal infectious dose of \" non-variant \" SARS -CoV-2,178 where non-variant is defined hereafter as the original or comparator SARS -CoV-2 strain in a particular study (e.g., WA -1). Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) o f the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected cynomolgus macaques via combination total dose).650 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed mild infections when expose d to 1x106 PFU intranasally.487 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at (106 TCID 50).191 Rhesus macaques infected 50 of -CoV-2 by the intranas al, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human disease.534 Rhesus macaques ocular inoculation TCID 50), resulting in mild infection; however, gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose), suggesti ng a limited role of gastric transmission. Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.190 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and intratracheal routes),823 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),337 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.62 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.383 Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non -human primate model of human COVID -19.486 Rodents and other animal models The SARS -CoV-2 median infectious dose in Golden Syrian hamsters via the intranasal route was experimentally estimated at Low-dose (1,800 PFU) with SARS- CoV-2 resulted in mild clinical symptoms, the production of infectious virus, and seroconversion.527 Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID 50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections.693 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,130 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected after timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID 50 (~630- 756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25- 30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).48 This paper has methodological caveats (e.g., particle size). infected with 316,000 TCID 50405 or 600,000 TCID 50642 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.405, 642 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact.405 In a separate ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 1 02 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.660 While the infectious dose is unknown, Syrian hamsters exposed to soiled bedding of SARS -CoV-2 infected hamsters for 48 hours showed clinical evidence of infection (weight loss) as well as viral shedding, demonstrating fomite transmission.526 Modeling estimates The infectious dose of a pathogen can be estimated by the amount of genetic material passed between an infector and infectee (called \"bottleneck\" size ); 704 using epidemiological data, sequencing data, and statistics, the average \"bottleneck\" size for SARS -CoV-2 has been estimated as ~1,200 viral particles , though exposure routes were not possible to identify .613 Modeling aerosol exposures from 5 case studies suggests the inhalation ID 50 for SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 361 -2,000 viral particles, which is approximately 250 -1,400 PFU.615 Related Coronaviruses Humans exposed TCID 50 (~7 PFU).72, 541 The inhalation infectious dose of seasonal coronavirus 229E is unknown in humans. The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -C oV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 P FU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).181, 186 A model -estimated ID 50 for SARS -CoV-1 in humans is 280 PFU.794 What do we need to know? We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develo p diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Does exposure dose determine disease severity? What is the ratio of virus particles/virions to PFU for SARS -CoV-2? Does the SARS -CoV-2 infectious dose in humans differ by viral variant? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans , primarily through close contact and aerosol transmission.31, 79, 315, 529 As of 7/13/2021, pandemic COVID -19 has caused at least 187,347,393 infections and 4,040,938 deaths globally.378 In the US, there have been 33,890,077 confirmed COVID -19 cases and 607,442 confirmed deaths,378 though both cases29, 555 and fatalities are underestimates.370, 570, 718, 822 Estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1.502, 581, 647, 827, 855 SARS- CoV-2 can spread via aerosol or \"airborne\" transmission307 beyond 6 ft in certain situations811 such as enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.115 The risk of infection from fomites is believed to be low ,338 and vertical transmission is rare.739 Meteorological factors may play a moderate role in SARS -CoV-2 spread (explaining 17% of variation in new case growth), with cooler, dryer locations and lower levels of UV radiation associated with higher transmission rates.496 At least six variants have higher transmission rates than the original, non -variant SARS -CoV-2 lineage.94 The B.1.1.7 variant (Alpha) is associated with a 50 -75% higher transmission rate than other strains,173, 774 potentially due to higher patient viral loads ,91, 270, 402 higher rates of symptomatic illness,6 and a longer infectious period.220 The US CDC estimates that the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant comprises 28.7 % of new cases (as of 7/3/2021), while the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is now responsible for 51.7% of new cases; prevalence of the Gamma (P.1) variant declined to 8.9% .104 Secondary attack rates of the Delta variant are 51 -62% higher than the Alpha variant in the UK .128, 229 The Delta variant is asso ciated with case increases in younger populations (<50) in the UK ,646 and accounts for 99% of new cases there.606 COVID -19 vaccines reduce transmission rates by approximately 54% (range of 38 -66%).681 Vaccination provides protection to uninfected individuals by reducing viral load742 and transmission .332, 518 In the US, locations with lower vaccination rates are experiencing more new COVID -19 cases than those with higher rates.396 The amount of infectious virus emitted from an infectious individual is unclear, but appears highly variable. Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per hour .495 Individual emission rates vary substantially .711, 841 Individuals with pre -symptomatic, asymptomatic, or mild illness can have higher viral loads than hospitalized patients.386 Higher viral load s in COVID -19 patients result in higher secondary attack rates , with a rate of 12% with viral loads below 106 genome copies/mL (nasopharyngeal swab), and 24% with viral loads more than 1010 viral genome copies/mL.508 Higher viral loads have also been associated with larger SARS -CoV-2 clusters, though evidence is indirect.421 Asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2635 and play a large role in new case growth .453 Individuals are infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset ,37, 796 meaning p re-symptomatic66, 411, 707, 725, 835, 858 or asymptomatic46, 364, 493 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2.481 Most transmission o ccurs before symptoms begin450 and within 5 days of symptom onset,311 as demonstrated by case studies136 and models.745 Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.724 Asymptomatic individuals transmit SARS - CoV-2 less often than symptomatic individuals ,58, 85, 731 causing 66% fewer secondary cases.450 Infection risk is particularly high indoors ,51 while outdoor transmission is rare.86 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation an d exhalation11, 449, 669, 712 in indoor areas such as restaurants260, 458 or offices.256 Clusters are often associ ated with indoor gatherings,436, 582 including bars,668 restaurants,847 and gyms.131, 442 In an experiment a t a concert held when community prevalence was low , COVID -19 transmission was inhibited through the use of natural ventilation, rapid COVID -19 tests (Panbio Ag, Abbott), universal N95 masking, and temperature checks.640 Household t ransmission is rapid ,17 and household contacts spread infection more than casual community contacts.549 The secondary attack rate of SARS -CoV-2 is 24% on average,166 but higher for symptomatic index cases, spouses of index cases, and adults.498 High viral load may increase transmission risk.395 In an outbreak of the Delta variant, household transmission occurred in 46% , with 80 -100% of household members becoming ill, resulting in a secondary attack rate of 53%.205 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. Most new infections come from a few infectious individuals (overdispersion parameter k = 0.2 -0.5).16, 228, 431, 435, 782, 857 Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low ,293 particularly on airplanes.579 Several studies have identified plausible transmission on airplanes45, 144, 348, 401, 536 despite pre -departure screening.728 Fluorescent tracer research on commercial airplanes s uggests a low risk of aerosol or surface transmission during flights ,695 though leaving middle seats open may reduc e aerosol exposure.198 Outbreaks have also been linked to trains360 and buses.492 Infection in children is underestimated,213, 748 and children of any age can acquire and transmit infection .709 There is some evidence that younger children (<10 -15) are less susceptible440 and less infectious450 than older children and adults.294 Few studies have direct ly assessed the trans mission rate of SARS -CoV-2 from children ; those that have generally found lower rates compared to adults.284 Children <17 were found to have lower concentrations of infectious virus than adults .87 Transmission in schools is generally low,275, 353, 387, 834, 864 but follows community incidence119, 304 after a lag710 and is affected by protective measures.292 The US CDC recommends that schools reopen with in- person education in the fall of 2021, with masks advised for unvaccinated staff and students older th an two years.109 What do we need to know? We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission and the effect of new variants. What is the emission rate of infectious particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising (for all variants) ? Are certain variants more transmissible in different subpopulations or age classes (e.g., children)?180 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviru ses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.456, 468, 470 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.68 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002 /2003. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range .515 Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans, but the potential role of long -term reservoir species is unknown . Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.574 White -tailed deer are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal inoculation and can efficiently transmit the virus to other deer through indirect contact.575 Their potential status as a reservoir species is unknown. In the US, researchers experimentally exposed big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus) to SARS -CoV-2 via the oropharyngeal and nasal route and found no subsequent signs of infection, clinical symptoms, or transmission.324 Urban r ats in Belgium did not show evidence of SARS -CoV-2 exposure despite large surges in human cases.157 Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal exposure (104 or 105 TCID 50)236 and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.308 Their capacity as a reservoir species is unknown. Rabbits are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route (dose = 104-106 TCID 50) and develop asym ptomatic infections, though infectious virus can be found in the nose for up to 7 days after exposure.537 Their reservoir potential is unknown. Bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ) seroconvert after exposure, but are asymptomatic and do not transmit infection to others.762 Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection.379 Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters and ferrets are susceptible to infection.130, 405 Infected mink in the US have been linked to human infections.2 SARS -CoV-2 cases in mink on US farms show h igh mortality rates,216 and farms have implemented strict biosecurity measures.426 Mink presumed to have escaped from commercial farms in Utah have been found in the wild with detectable SARS -CoV-2 antibody levels, providing a plausible pathway to disease establishment in wild mink, though confirmation of SARS -CoV-2 in wild mink has not been established.691 In Spain, feral populations of American mink have been found with SARS -CoV-2 RNA , suggesting a p otential reservoir.20 After an initial outbreak on a mink farm, r einfection levels in mink were high (75%) , with reinfection caused by SARS -CoV-2 with several additional mutations compared to the original outbreak strain.628 Humans and mink are able to transmit infectious virus back and forth, potentially facilitating development of new variants.88 Several non -human primates are also susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 including cynomolgus macaques,650 African green monkeys,823 and Rhesus macaques.487 Raccoon dogs (mammals related to foxes) are susceptible to COVID -19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosures.274 Otters at a US zoo tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 after experiencing mild respiratory symptoms.75 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000 -520,000 PFU via the intranasal route688 or a combination of routes323), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.688 Serial passage of SARS- CoV-2 in domestic cats attenuates transmissibility, suggesting that they are not long -term reservoirs.49 Stray cats in Spain were found to be SARS -CoV-2 seropositive at low frequencies (3.5%).772 Wild cats (tigers and lions)795 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.503, 853 Studies have confirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.50 Captive gorillas have tested positive for SARS -CoV-2, and experience mild symptoms (cough, congestion).288 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens ,688 100,000 PFU for pigs ,688 ~70,000 all route).688 When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route (106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted.607 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -C oV-2 after experimental exposu res.720 Cattle exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.763 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies69 but exhibited no clinical s ymptoms.688, 699 In Italy, approximately 3 -6% of domestic dogs and cats showed detectable neutralizing antibodies to SARS -CoV-2, though no evidence exists of transmission from dogs or cats to humans.588 What do we need to know? We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. What is the intermediate host(s) (if any)? Which animal species can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID -19 is between 5432 and 6797 days.839 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.432 However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.617 This could mean that 5 -10% of individuals undergoing a 14 - day quarantine are still infectious at the end.617 There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID -19 incubation periods, creating a U - shaped relationship between incubation period length and patient age ,412 while adolescent and young adult populations (15 - 24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.460 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.46, 129, 316, 738, 858 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,117, 654, 738, 858 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.37, 403, 865 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.343 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.37 Of individuals quarantining after a COVID -19 contact in the home, 81% of those testing negative on day 7 also tested negative on day 14; 19% of individuals undergoing a 7 -day quarantine, then, were at risk of developing and potentially transmitting COVID -19.652 The percentage of individuals at risk declined to 7% for those still asymptomatic and test -negative 10 days after contact.652 This indicates that quarantines of less than 14 days still carry some risk of disease and transmission, and that care should be taken after completing a shortened quarantine period (e.g., wearing a mask, avoiding close conta ct).652 It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. A systematic review of published studies on SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, and MERS -CoV found none that reported isolation of infectious virus from COVID -19 patients beyond 9 days from symptom onset , despite high viral loads by genetic tests .126 While the amount of virus needed to infect another individual is unknown, mild -moderate COVID -19 cases appear to be infectious for no longer than 10 days after symptom onset, while severely ill or immunocompromised patients may be infectious for 20 -70 days 40 after symptom onset; individuals can also transmit infection before symptoms appear.777 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for between 5.76594 and 9.5 days .361 The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximatel y 5 days. On average, there are approximately 4212 to 7.5452 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additional meta -analysis, the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.211, 622, 839 The serial interval of COVID -19 has declined substantially over time as a result of increased case isolation,24 meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time. The generation time (time between infection events in a chain of transmission) for SARS -CoV-2 is estimated as 4-5 days.309 Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).490 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.439 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals. 797 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symptoms begin.776 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,776 though patients can test positiv e for SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.776 Patients being released from the hospital may still exhale detectable levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (~7,000 genome copies per hour), though the infectivity of these patients is unknown.861 What do we need to know? We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? How soon can asymptomatic patients transm it infection after exposure? Does the incubation period correlate with disease severity or exposure dose? Do novel SARS -CoV-2 variants alter the incubation period of COVID -19? Do they affect the generation time or serial interval ?

What do we know? Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.116 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions494 are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.573 Fever is most often the first symptom. Most symptomatic COVID -19 cases are mild (81%) .738, 817 Fever,34, 316 cough,316 and shortness of breath118, 132, 363 are generally the most common symptoms, followed by malaise, fatigue, and sputum/secretion.168 Chills, muscle pain,535 skeletal pain,354 symptoms,462 delirium,397 and dermatological symptoms168 also occur .118 While fever is the most common early symptom,427 many individuals do not exhibit fever at all.771, 846 Headaches are common, may persist for weeks, and may be associated with shorter disease duration.98 Gastrointestinal symptoms (particularly abdominal pain) may be associated with increased risk of severe disease.851 Loss of taste or smell (anosmia) is predictive of COVID -19,521 occurring in 28% of pediatric COVID -19 cases.418 Adults experiencing post -acute COVID -19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS -A) may be underdiagnosed.179 The B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant s are associated with increased hospitalization and mortality .125 The B.1.1.7 variant is linked to higher hospitalization rates561 and 61%175 to 70%355 higher mortality than non- varia nt virus . Individuals infected with the B.1.617.2 variant were hospitalized almost twice as often as those with the B.1.1.7 variant.684 The B.1.617.2 variant may be associated with different symptoms than prior SARS -CoV-2 variants, including headache, runny nose, and malaise, with fewer reports of loss of taste or smell.3, 221 Approximately 33% of individuals will remain asymptomatic after SARS -CoV-2 infection.572 Modeling721 and seroprevalence studies,344 however, the asymptomatic ratio is much higher (>80%). When asymptomatic individuals do transmit, those they infect are more likely to develop asymptomatic COVID -19.830 COVID -19 is more severe than seasonal in fluenza,730 evidenced by higher ICU admission833 and mortality rates.609 In the US, 29- 34% of hospitalized patients required ICU admission, and 12.6 -13.6 % died from COVID -19.525, 550 Almost all (99.5%) US deaths from COVID -19 in May and June 2021 have occurred in unvaccinated individuals .446 Higher SARS -CoV-2 RNA loads at initial screening or upon admission have been linked to greater risk of death ,81, 298, 499, 800 though the finding is not universal and many factors play a role in disease severity.667 High viral loads (RT -PCR cycle threshold value <28) are associated with symptom severity six months after illness onset.751 COVID -19 also causes p arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke,516, 600 respiratory complications ,764 and shock .316, 363, 778, 859 SARS -CoV-2 attacks blood vessels in the lung90 and is associated with hyperactive platelets,67 leadin g to ARDS.15, 769 Clotting affects multiple organs626 and is present in 15 -27% of cases.489 Low oxygen saturation and shallow breathing upon hospital admission are associated with elevated mortality risk.133 Adults >60 years old585 and those with comorbidities279, 482 are at elevated risk of hospitaliza tion566 and death.738, 859 Cardiovascular diabetes,513, 670 cancer,784 down syndrome,152 and respiratory conditions increase the CFR.738, 859 Kidney disease ,567 dialysis,729 and lack of physical activity666 may increase disease severity . Estimates of the av era ge age- specific infection fatality rate, or the true percent of individuals who die after acquiring COVID - 19, were identified in a large meta -analysis: 0 -34 years = 0.004%; 35 0.068%; 45 -54 years = 0.23%; 55- years = 0.75%; 65 -74 years = 2.5%; 75- 84 years = 8.5%; 85 and older = 28.3%.447 These estimates do not account for recent variants. Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19,528 independent of underlying conditions.546 Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations , incl uding children,47 acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups261, 302, 576, 614 and are hospitalized281, 616 and die disproportionately.352, 517 Hispanic and Black COVID -19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.824 Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID -19 risk.171, 184 Pregnant women with COVID -19 have higher mortality rates compared to those without COVID -19 (though overall mortality is low).377 COVID -19 elevates rates of certain neonatal morbidities (e.g., respiratory distress), but more data are needed.557 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,202 though generally show milder134, 488 or no symptoms. 21% to 28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic .488, 583, 618 Most symptomatic children show mild or moderate symptom s.300, 583 Severe disease in children472 and infants83, 488 is more likely in those with complex medical histories.303, 685 A rare inflammatory condition in children ( MIS-C)291 is linked to COVID -19 infection ,648, 749 though the prevalence is unknown.111 Children with any initial symptoms can develop MIS-C,290 though non- white children are overrepresented .438, 591 What do we need to know?

What are the pathogenic pathways of SARS -CoV-2 infection in children,544 and why ar e their illnesses typically mild ?287 Are associations between COVID -19 severity and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) caused by the particulates themselves or conditions associated with living in areas with more air pollution?233 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 8 Chronic Clinical Presentation - What are th e long -term symptoms of COVID -19 infection ? What do we know? COVID -19 symptoms commonly persist for weeks736 to months97 after initial onset540 in up to 73% of those infected.542 The US NIH has defined the effects of \"long -haul\" COVID -19 as Post -Acute Sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 infection (PASC).543 Estimates of the prevalence of PASC range from 5 -10% of COVID -19 patients,23, 138 with obesity,28 age, female sex,63 and number of initial symptoms increasing risk.156, 723 Hospital readmission rates are 9 -29% of COVID -19 patients.41, 203, 433 The importance of initial symptom severity for subsequent development of PASC is unclear, with some studies showing high risk in mildly ill patients768 while others show higher risk in severely ill patients.59 Long -term symptoms such as fatigue,362 smell/t aste disorders,122, 479 and neurological impairment176 may affect the ability to return to work.176 Approximately 8% of mildly ill individuals had disrupted work schedules 8 months a fter initial illness.341 In a cohort of 410 COVID -19 patients, 39% reported symptoms 7 -9 months after initial infection, with fatigue, los s of taste or smell, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and headache the most common chronic symptoms.548 In a smaller study (n=96), 77% o f patients reported ongoing symptoms 12 months after initial infection, with the most common symptoms being reduced exercise capacity, fatigue, dyspnea, and difficulties with concentration, finding correct words during speech, and sleep. 675 What do we need to know? We need to know the rate of PA SC and chronic symptoms in different patient populations.

What do we know? Recovered individuals appear protected against reinfection for at least several months. Reinfection is rare, though novel variants may increase reinfection frequency . Immune responses persist in most patients for >6 months. Infection with SARS -CoV-2 provid es robust protection against reinfection for at least 3 -6 months.339, 491 In a study from Italy (n=6,000), prior COVID -19 infection reduced the likelihood of subsequent infection by 94.6%.506 Protection from novel SARS - CoV-2 variants is still under investigation. T cell and antibody responses did not differ between individuals with acute or chronic COVID -19 nine months post - infection,596 suggesting that differences in immune response are not the only cause of chronic COVID -19 (PASC). Vaccine -derived immunity is robust in pregnant and lactating women,155 with evidence that antibodies are transferred to neonates by the placenta305 and through breast milk.599 Neutralizing antibody responses are present within 8 -19 days after symptom onset480, 727 and can persist for at least a year in most individuals.423 Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing antibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.676 Asymptomatic cases generate weaker antibody responses.143 Protective immunity from vaccines may take longer to develop in patients undergoing active cancer treatment.299 Convalescent patients are expected to have long -lasting protection against SARS -CoV-2, especially after vaccination.792 Multiple components of the human immune response to SARS -CoV-2, including circulating antibodies, memory B cells, and memory T cells, are detectable for at least 6 -8 months after infection regardless of initial symptom severity.170 Bone marrow plas ma cells (BMPC) are generated by natural infection and vaccination and persist for several months, suggesting a lasting humoral immune response to SARS -CoV-2 infection.755 The impact of variants on lo ng-term humoral and antibody protection are unclear ,92 but T -cell responses to B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants suggest some protective efficacy.286 In a cohort of recovered in dividuals, those who were subsequently vaccinated showed increased neutralization of SARS -CoV- 2 variants relative to the non -vaccinated but recovered individuals.791- 792 The impact of emerging SARS -CoV-2 variants on protective immunity and reinfe ction risk is unclear. Convalescent plasma from those infected with Gamma (P.1) or Beta (B.1.351) variants showed reduced neutralization of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, suggesting elevated potential for reinfection. 465 The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant is also resistant to neutralization by bamlanivimab (but not all monoclonal antibodies) .610 Current vaccines (from AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech in this study) provide protection ag ainst novel VOCs, with neutralization ability against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants comparable to Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Gamma (P.1) variants, and higher than neutralization of the Beta (B.1.351) variant.465 After one dose of an mRNA vaccine, only 10% of individual serum showed any ability to neutralize the Delta variant, though this increased to 95% after the second dose. 610 Vaccination provi des greater protection from the Delta variant than prior infection with non -Delta SARS -CoV-2.218 SARS- CoV-2 mutations can reduce responses to serum from vaccinated patients,793 though data from Moderna suggest a robust immune response to the B.1.1.7 variant, and a lower response to the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) variant.829 T cells of individuals infected with non -variant SARS -CoV-2 were able to recognize and respond to three SARS -CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1), though the overall contribution to long -term immunity is not yet clear.630 Unpublished work suggests that the South African variant (called 501Y.V2 or B.1. 351) is able to escape neutralization from some SARS -CoV-2 antibodies , and that prior SARS -CoV-2 infection may not protect against 501Y.V2 reinfection.816 Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible but appears rare, though the true frequency is unknown. Infection with COVID -19 appears to provide at least an 83% reduction in the risk of reinfection for at least 5 months,325, 500 and reinfection was plausibly identified in 44 out of 6,600 COVID -19 patients.437 Individuals aged 65 and older were more likely to be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2 after initial illness than those under 65 ; prior infection protection against reinfection was 47.1% for those 65, and 80. 5% for those <65.328 A prospective cohort study identified possible rei nfections in 10% of Marine recruits who had evidence of prior infection.444 Possible reinfections were found in 4.8% of patients in one retrospective study, though some of these could represent lingering viral shedding .683 Only 2.4% of patients developed symptomatic COVID -19 >90 days after initial infection.683 There is some evidence that individuals can be infected with multiple SARS -CoV-2 strains simultaneously.169 In patients recovered from natural infection, one dose of an mRNA vaccine increases protective immunity, but the benefits of a second dose are unclear.199 In uninfected individuals, two doses of mRNA vaccines show clear benefits. In previously infected patients, the first dose of an mRNA vaccine (e.g., Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech) results in a large increa se in the body's ability to neutralize wild -type and variant SARS -CoV-2.714 The second dose, however, may not increase neutralizing capability in previously infected individuals .641 This \"hybrid vigor\" (e.g., natural infection paired with vaccination) may involve increased activation of memory B cells.165 What do we need to know? We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. How long does protective immunity last for children compared to adults? What is the probability of reinfection, particularly with SARS -CoV-2 variants?

When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Screening solely by temperature or other symptoms is unreliable. As of 7/9/2021 the FDA has granted E mergency Use Authorization to 395 test and sample collection devices, including 282 molecular tests and sample collection devices, 84 antibody, and 29 antigen tests.266 There are 52 authoriz ed molecular tests for home -collected samples with one prescription at-home molecular test, three prescription at- home antigen tests, five OTC at -home antigen tests , and two OTC molecular tests.266 The US FDA is creating guidance for diagnostic, therapeu tic, and vaccine developers to evaluate the impact of SARS -CoV-2 variants on their products ,265 and released guidance on the impact of SARS -CoV-2 mutations on diagnostic tests.269 The FDA has also issued guidance on interpreting serological test result performance in light of background COVID -19 prevalence.267 The US FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to a non -invasive, non -diagnostic device based on machine learning algorithms that screens for biomarkers of SARS -CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals older than 5 years.264 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT -PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more li kely to give false -negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.417 Low viral loads can lead to false -negative RT -PCR tests.467 The duration of PCR -detectable viral samples is lo nger in the lower respiratory tract than the upper respiratory tract; nasopharyngeal sampling is most effective (89%) between 0 and 4 days after symptom onset but falls significantly (to 54%) by 10 to 14 days.504 After 10 days, alternative testing m ethods (e.g., lower respiratory samples) may be necessary.504 A smartphone app (COVID Symptom Study) in the US and UK has been used by researchers to predict the need for respiratory support722 and provide data on PASC (\"long -haul\" COVID -19) symptoms.723 Traine d dogs show high accuracy for SARS -CoV-2 detection (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.99), and could be used to identify individuals needing confirmation via rapid antigen or molecular testing.463 With training, dogs are able to recognize odors (volatile organic compounds , VOCs ) from infected individuals even if they're asymptomati c; this work is also supporting development of organic semi -conducting sensors to detect COVID -19 VOCs.263 While nasopharyngeal swabs are the gold standard for COVID -19 diagnosis, pooled nasal and throat swabs also show high diagnostic accuracy, while saliva, nasal swabs, and throat swabs all showed lower accuracy.752 However, homoge nization of saliva samples prior to RNA extraction increases diagnostic accuracy, with results comparable to nasopharyngeal swabs .665 Researchers have demonstrated the utility of disposable , bio -functional strips for SARS -CoV-2 identification.831 In children, v iral loads from saliva correlated better with clinical outcomes than viral loads from nasopharyngeal swabs.149 Rapid tests based on RT -PCR or standard laboratory nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are preferred over rapid isothermal NAATs in symptomatic individuals to reduce the chance of false -positives.329 CRISPR -based diagnostics can supplement PCR tests, identifying transient SARS -CoV-2 infections that were initially missed.366 Symptom -based screening at airports was ineffective at detecting cases (9 identified out of 766,044 passengers screened),201 and intensive screening on a US military base during mandatory quarantine did not identify any COVID -19 cases.444 Infrared temperature readings may be misleading when used at the entrance of buildings with low outdoor temperatures.214 Exhaled breath condensa te may be an effective supplement to nasopharyngeal swab- based PCR .659, 680 Foam swabs lead to more accurate diagnostic tests than polyester swabs for collecting patient samples, though polyester swabs are good enough to be used in case of a shortage in foam swabs. 336 Immunological indicators42, 227, 273, 280, 342, 365, 547, 608, 708, 726, 779, 850 blood glucose levels ,785 oxygen levels407 and bilirubin levels477 may help identify future severe cases,146 and tools for diagnosing severe infections511, 698, 826 and predicting mortality539 exist. A high- throughput assay for screening asymptomatic individuals has received US Emergency Use Authorization.70, 268 Self- or caregiver- taken diagnostic swabs could be as accurate as those taken by healthcare workers in some instances .334 Wearable technology may be able to detect COVID -1 9 days before symptoms begin,347, 701 and several attempts to create mobile applications for disease notification are underway.321, 757 Aerosol detection devices are capable of identifying SARS -CoV-2 in the air (minimum of approximately 6,000 particles).702 Researchers have identified a plausible, non -invasive test for COVID -19 involving the human microbiome.636 Long -COVID patients appear to have auto -antibodies not present in patients who have recovered, sparking interest in developing a diagnostic blood test to identify the proteins.399 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.612 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) are less accurate than ELI SA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.464 Lateral flow assay testing showed lower accuracy in pregnant women than other patient cohorts .235 What do we need to know? We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests.

What do we know? COVID -19 treatment recommendations are provided by the WHO ,809 NIH,553 Infectious Disease Society of America (I DSA),56 and British Medical Journal ( BMJ ),65 based on ongoing analysis of evidence from clinical trials . Treatment recommendations For hospitalized , critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation or ECMO (with organ failure and ARDS ), dexamethasone is strongly recommended; if alternative corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone) is recommended.135, 356, 580, 584, 717, 747, 825 Methylprednisolone may increase the duration of viral shedding.733 In hospitalized patients with sever e but not critical disease, there is a conditional recommendation for dexamethasone treatment.356 Dexamethasone may be beneficial for those on mechanical ventilation.750 For hospitalized patients, it is recommended that convalescent plasma treatment only proceed in a clinical trial, as benefits are not uniformly reported.25, 367, 388, 390, 507, 589, 627, 697 Convalescent plasma is more beneficial when given early in tr eatment with high SARS -CoV-2 antibody titers ,389 though the treatment fails to show benefits in large, randomized trials.358 For any subset of patients, there is a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin424 and lopinavir/ritonavir96, 278, 310, 459 due to lack of observed benefit. For ho spitalized patients with non -severe illness, SpO2 94% , and no supplemental oxygen, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of glucocorticoids.356 WHO guidance includes a strong recommendation for the use of tocilizumab or sarilumab in patients with severe or critical COVID -19.9, 808 A large meta -analysis found that 28 -day all -cause mortality was lower in patients receiving IL -6 inhibitor (e.g., tocilizumab, sarilumab) treatment, with significant clinical improvement in those patients also receiving corticosteroids.313 The effects were most beneficial in patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation.313 The BMJ publishes a tool that shows treatment opt ions based on patient comorbidities and disease severity.64 The US FDA has granted EUA for sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment for those at risk of severe disease.239 Recommendations for the use of Remdesivir vary. The US FDA has approved the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients 12 years and older,251 with an Emergency Use Authorization for other patient groups .242, 551 In the US, there is a conditional recommendation for Remdesivir treatment in hospitalized, severe patients.55, 578, 790 In the US, for hospitalized patients on supplemental oxygen but not mechanical ventilation, there is a conditional recommendation of 5-day course of Remdesivir vs. 10 -day course.56 In the US, in hospitalized patients not on supplemental oxygen, there is a conditional recommendation against the routine use of Remdesivir,56 though it may be considered for patients at high risk of severe disease.553 The WHO and BMJ , however, recommend against Remdesivir use in patients of a ny severity.65, 809 For hospitalized patients with severe disease who are not on mechanical ventilation and cannot receive corticosteroids, there is a conditional recommendation for the use of ba ricitinib plus Remdesivir.56, 392 For hospitalized patients, treatment with Remdesivir, baricitinib, or corticosteroids is recommended only in clinical trial s.56 Regeneron's REGN -COV2 treatment has received Emergency Use Authorization to treat mild/moderate COVID -19 patients,634 but not hospitalized patients with high oxygen requirements.631 It is recommended by the US NIH for use in non - hospitalized COVID -19 patients.276 REGN -COV2 reduced progression to symptomatic COVID -19 by up to 76% in clinical trials,633 and protected household contacts from developing symptomatic COVID -19 when given prophylactically.564, 632 The IDSA conditionally recommends the use of combination bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, or sotrovim ab alone in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID -19 at risk of progression to severe disease.368 Clinical trial updates The US has ceased the use of the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab on its own, due to spread of SARS -CoV-2 variants.147 Due to lack of clear benefit from clinical trials, IDSA guidel ines strongly recommend against the use of bamlanivimab (alone) in those hospitalized with severe COVID -19, and conditionally recommend against its routine use in ambulatory patients.57 A clinical trial for GlaxoSmithKline's monoclonal antibody VIR -7831 showed a significant reduction in hospitalization and death compared to a placebo when administered early in disease course to high -risk patients.314 Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that high doses of anticoagulants may reduce rates of mechanical ventilation in those with mild -moderate COVID -19.552 The WHO conditionally recommends anticoagulants at a standard dosing level ;803 high doses of anticoagulants were not more effective at improving outcomes for critically ill patients.662, 849 Common treatment medications for existing disease pre -COVID -19 diagnosis Prior use of s ta tins,510, 663 RAAS inhibitors ,788 anticoagulants,189 NSAIDs,207 and ACE inhibitors483 do not appear to elevate COVID -19 risk , and potential benefits of aspirin use require assessment in a clinical trial.145 What do we need to know? We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. What treatment, or combination of treatments, is most effective for different disease s everities and patient demographics? What is the efficacy of transmission -blocking peptides428 and nasal sprays in humans?185 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 12 Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? What do we know? Three safe285 and effective590 vaccines are currently being administered under US FDA Emergency Use . As of 7/12/2021, 184,365,333 people in the US have received at least one dose of an approved coronavirus vaccine, while 159,499,224 have been given all required doses .108 Around 92% of individuals have received required second doses.649 In the US, both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine efficacy has been estimated at 88% overall,590 with 80% efficacy two weeks after the first dose, rising to 90% or more two weeks after the second dose.741 In the UK, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine shows efficacy against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 despite high prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant.326 After 2 doses, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also highly effective against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant (88% reduction in symptomatic disease) ,230 though protection against the Delta variant is low after only a single dose.177 The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has reduced efficacy against the B.1.351 variant.14 In Israel, real -world efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine declined from 94% to 64% (in terms of reducing infections) as the Delta variant gained prominence, though the vaccine maintains 93% efficacy against hospitalization.842 The duration of vaccine -derived immunity is unclear, but vaccine -derived antibodies may persist for at least 6 months204 and vaccination stimulates memory B cells, suggesting prolonged protection.756 Vaccine -induced antibody titers appear to show positive correlations with vaccine efficacy.215 Pfizer and others are working on variant -specific booster shots .604 On July 8, 2021 , the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a state ment that they not believe boosters are necessary , but are continuing to evaluat e evidence regarding booster necessity .346 Preliminary data suggest that administering di fferent vaccines for first and second doses results in more systemic side effects than administering the same vaccine for each dose, though the side effects were generally mild .682 Early results suggest efficacy after such \"mixed\" vaccine doses is high, though only two vaccines have been tested in combination to date.473 Initial evidence from a small (n=900) survey found that vaccines may reduce symptom severity in approximately half of those with PASC, though the effects were not consistent across symptom types (e.g., fatigue, muscle pain).687 A UK study will examine the effect of monthly vaccine doses in an effort to combat chronic COVID -19 syndrome (PASC).408 If vaccines are limited, those without prior COVID -19 infection may be prioritized , though those with prior COVID -19 still benefit from vaccination.690 Initial work suggests the rates of a specific type of blood clot (cerebral venous thrombosis, CVT) is higher in COVID -19 patients than in those receiving mRNA vaccines,734 though additional work is needed to assess risks. The US FDA has revised fact sheets for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines to include information about risks of myocarditis and pericarditis after administration, which is rare but more common in young males after the second dose. 241 Pfizer/BioNTech - mRNA vaccine named BNT162b2 (also called Tozinameran ,805 Comirnaty223). US EUA248 and WHO EUL.815 This v accine is given as 2 shots, 21 days apart.602 Six months after the first doses were administered, efficacy was 91.3% in terms of preventing symptomatic COVID -19, and >95% in terms of preventing severe COVID -19.603 The US FDA granted EUA for use in 12 -15 year- olds.240 Moderna - mRNA vaccine name d mRNA -1273.523 US EUA,247 approved in Canada95 and European Union ,225 WHO EUL .639 The vaccine is given as 2 shots, 28 days apart .523 The vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy, 14 days after the second dose ,43 consistent across age,524 race, ethnicity, and sex.43 Trials with reduced doses show high neutralizing responses, potentially expanding vaccine availability.200 A booster shot (mRNA -1273.351) developed specifically for the B.1.351 variant induced higher neutralizing antibody concentrations against both the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.522 Johnson and Johnson /Janssen - named COVID -19 vaccine . US EUA,246 approved in EU.224 This vaccine is given as a single shot to adults 18 and older.246 In clinical trials, the vaccine was 77 -85% effective at preventing severe and critical COVID -19 14 -28 days post injection, and 67% effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID -19.246 Trials are planned for younger age groups.375 Initial evidence shows efficacy against the Delta variant.381 Associated with a rare clotting disorder102 and an elevated risk of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome.244 \"Breakthrough\" infections are rare103 and ass ociated with milder illness , but more common in those with comorbidities .33 In the US, vaccination has provided robust protection from infection, evidenced by low rates of \"breakthrough\" infections (infections in individuals receiving all required vaccine doses ). 746 Individuals generally experience milder symptoms after breakthrough infection than unvaccinated individuals ,99, 737 and most hospitalizations from breakthrough infections have occurred in individuals older than 65.107 Additionally, infections in those who have been previously vaccinated, even parti ally, transmit to fewer household members than infections in unvaccinated individuals (38 -49% reduction).333 SARS- CoV-2 variant s of concern result in significantly more breakthrough infections than non -variant SARS -CoV-2.419, 512 What do we need to know? We need to understand the long -term impact of SARS -CoV-2 variants on vaccine efficacy and the need for boosters . Does vaccination of individuals with post -acute sequelae of SARS -CoV-2 infection affect their long -term symptoms?36 What are the correlates between neutralizing antibody levels and vaccine -induced efficacy in humans?441 How protective are vaccines in those taking immunosuppressants71 or with autoimmune disorders?REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 13 Non -pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission . Social distancing and other policies quickly reduced spread throughout China,414, 416, 422, 484, 501, 781 Europe,282, 394 and the US.413 Delaying control measures increases outbreak duration ,210 mortality ,844 and effective viral population size .620 Tiered restrictions in the UK resulted in 2 -44% reductions in transmission, depending on restriction severity.174 Widespread lockdowns in the UK also reduced the genetic diversity of circulating SARS -CoV-2 lineages.209 Reductions in transmission appear 6-9 days after the implementation of NPIs, and increased transmission is generally visible 14-20 days after NPIs are lifted.457 Re-opening restaurants in the US was associated with significantly higher mortality 61-100 days after relaxation of restrictions.320 US counties678 and states359 with mask mandates ha d lower case growth rates and higher likelihoods of controlling transm ission619 than neighboring counties lacking mask mandates. Modeling shows that s light increases in mask adherence (e.g., from 75% to 90% of individuals) can dramatically reduce simulated infections .301 In the US, shelter -in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases ,161 with SIPOs particularly effective at reducing transmission.208 Limiting gatherings to fewer than 10 people, closing schools and universities, and closing non- essential businesses also resulted in large reductions in SARS -CoV-2 transmission.74 Essential workers have a 55% greater risk of COVID -19 than non -essential workers, and family members of essential workers are similarly 17% more likely to acquire COVID -19.706 In Los Angeles, workplace -associated outbreaks disproportionately affected manufacturing jobs, suggesting that sector - specific NPIs may help reduce COVID -19 burden.159 Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with reductions in COVID -19 case growth.44, 331 Social distancing and reductions in both non -essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rates.531 Reducing c apacity at crowded indoor locations such as restaurants, gyms, hotels, cafes, and religious organizations may be an effective way to reduce COVID -19 transmission without more substantial lockdowns.131 Increasing indoor air flow rates,569 improving mechanical filtration efficiency, and wearing masks may also reduce (but not eliminate) indoor transmission.398 NPIs and societal aid focused on populations at highest risk of infection, such as those living or working in crowded environments, are more effective than NPIs that assume equal risk of infection and transmission across subpopu lations.123 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing ) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.592 Face masks inhibit transmission by both reducing the number of exhaled particles from infectious individuals, as well as reducing the number of inhaled particles when worn by uninfected individuals.114 Those self -reporting greater social distancin g and mask use had reduced odds of contracting COVID -19.296 Always wearing masks, maintaining physical distance >1m, and frequently washing hands were all associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection in individuals who had direct contact with infected individuals. 206 Universal mask ing coupled with physical barriers significantly reduced transmission in US meatpacking facilities.345 Particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.820 Eliminating superspreading events26 can result in slower case growth while easing broadly restrictive interventions.391 Focusing interventions on high -risk activities or locations (e.g., gyms, bars , and restaurants) may help reduce transmission.819 Retrospective contact tracing may help identify the source of large clusters of cases , and should be implemented due to the overdispersion or heterogeneity in secondary transmission arising from each primary COVID -19 case.124 Reducing contacts between random individuals is more effective t han reducing regular, repeated contacts.703 Modeling suggests that mitigating COVID -19 spread in elem entary schools is difficult , and that reducing community prevalence, increasing ventilation, and universal monitoring/testing are impactful interventions .754 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. NPIs are being re- implemented in many locations worldwide due to the D elta (B.1.617 .2) variant, even in locations with robust vaccination programs (e.g., Israel, UK).672 Premature relaxation of public health control measures may facilitate rapid increas es in prevalence at the state level.277 Modeling suggests that rolling840 periods of social distancing or lock -down may be effective in reducing exposure s.753 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.753 Rolling int erventions may be necessary . Synchronizing public health interventions across US state lines may reduce the total number of required in terventions .655 Travel restrictions may be effective in certain conditions, such as when countries have low incidence themselves .657 Lifting NPIs before widespread vaccine uptake is predicted to increase COVID -19 cases and deaths.158, 586 Modeling suggests that NPIs will need to be in place for 6 -12 months after the initiation of vaccination campaigns.451, 838 What do we need to know? We need to understand the magnitude of measures necessary to limit spread of new SARS -CoV-2 variants . What NPIs are effective at reducing transmission from common SARS -CoV-2 variants? How does NPI effectiveness change over time as a result of changes in adherence or behavior? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 14 Environmental Stability - How lon g does the agent live in the environment? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity.53 Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS -CoV-2 transmission in humans. There is still limited evidence to support transmission of SARS -CoV-2 through fomites despite positive identification of the viral RNA near people who are infected. As a result, guidance on cleaning and disinfecting surfaces continues to evolve.448 Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS -CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).61 Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4 \u00b0C).330 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to be stable up to 7 days (25 -27\u00b0C; 35% RH) on smooth surfaces, to include plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical masks.474 At 22 \u00b0C, SARS -CoV-2 was shown to be detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.330 SARS- CoV-2 was found to be stable across pH 3 -10 on several surfaces at 22 \u00b0C.142 After 3 hours (22\u00b0 C, 65% RH), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found on stainless steel or plastic.142 At standard room temperature and humidity, SARS -CoV-2 becomes undetectable on common library items after 2 to 8 days of quarantine depending on the material (e.g., book cover vs leather) and conditions (e.g., stacked vs unstacked).7, 372, 677 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for up to 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)766 and infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH)142 and other PPE for at least 72 hours at 22\u00b0 C.322 In indoor environments, infectious virus persisted on cloth for up to 1 day, on steel and concrete for up to 3 days, and on nitrile, Tyve k, N95 respirators, Styrofoam, cardboard, rubber, and glass for up to 4 days.420 SARS- CoV-2 RNA was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days .530 SARS- CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID -19 surveillance,21 and can warn of SARS -CoV-2 cases ahead of positive PCR tests and hospital admissions.593 In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can p ersist on surfaces for weeks. In the absence of sunlight, infectious SARS -CoV-2 can remain on non- porous (e.g., glass, vinyl) surfaces for at least 28 days at 20\u00b0C and 50% RH; higher temperatures greatly reduce the environmental stability of SARS -CoV- 2.645 This value is longer than other stability estimates,141, 645, 766 potentially due to a fluid matrix with more protein to simulate human respiratory fluid and a higher inoculation dose.645 In simulated saliva on stainless steel surfaces, SARS -CoV-2 shows negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on simulated UVB radiation .629 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity , also considering UV light .195 SARS -CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. DHS has developed a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.194 Due to the effects of evaporation, m odeling suggests that hot, dry conditions increase the aerosol risk of SARS -CoV-2, though cold, humid conditions facilitate transmission by droplet spread.856 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (simi lar to mid -June) and 19 minutes in low - intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October).674 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva.674 Humidity alone had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.674 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to have an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (without sunlight, particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH),766 retaining infectivity for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23\u00b0 C, 53% RH, no sunlight).252 Aerosol stability of several SARS -CoV-2 isolates, including the B.1.1.7 variant, is similar to non -variant SARS -CoV-2.673 Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium. RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real-time RT -PCR results.700 Storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (18 -25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.597 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food or food packaging .373, 802 SARS- CoV-2 can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4 \u00b0C).141, 625 SARS -CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when inoculated on frozen foods and stored below - 20\u00b0C.259 Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been found on frozen food packaging, but has not been linked to actual infections .638 Several outbreaks have a hypothesized food origin.327 What do we need to know? We need to quantify the duration of viable SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. It is unclear how viability of SARS -CoV-2 is affected across the food supply chain .845 Can SARS -CoV-2-contaminated wastewater cause infections?466, 621 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. A systematic review identified sunlight, UV light, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite as methods to reduce surface contamination.53 However, the levels of decontamination necessary to affect transmission per se are sti ll unknown.53 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.415 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.140 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants that have been found effective against SARS -CoV-2 specifically .231 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.571 Regular disinfection of hospital rooms (with benzalkonium wipes) can reduce the presence of SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, though contamination is wides pread without regular cleaning.404 Chlorhexidine digluconate may be ineffective.39 Heat, soa p, and were also able to decontaminate SARS -CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) on various surfaces.514 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of SARS -CoV-2, completely inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests (for 15 -30 s) .60 Efforts are ongoing to create paint -on surfaces54 or other surface coatings232 that can rapidly -CoV-2. Iodine -based antiseptics can decontaminate nasal passages,318 though any influence on transmission is unknown.272 A mouth- spray previously investigated for the 229E (ColdZyme \u00ae) effectively inactivated SARS -CoV-2 in vitro ; additional tests are necessary to determine any clinical benefit.317 Indoor air filters based on non- thermal pla sma or reactive oxygen species may be effective at reducing circulating SARS -CoV- 2 concentrations, estimated by reductions in surrogate virus, though additional testing on live SARS -CoV-2 virus is needed.664 Indoor air filtration devices based on hydroxyl radical cascades, which do not emit ozone, are being trialed at 4 UK hospitals due to their efficacy in reducing concentrations of a surrogate virus (M2 phage).22, 758 In tests with a surrogate virus (Phi6 phage), a modified version of the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) was effective at decontaminating military airc rafts in approximately three hours using high heat and humidity ;713 Phi6, however, may be less stable than SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, and therefore may not be the best surrogate.801 Aquila Bioscience has developed a spray decontamination technique to pair with its existing alcohol - and chemical -free wipe; these products may be used to capture SARS -CoV-2 on skin, surfaces, an d washable masks via high -affinity binding.73 Peracetic acid dry fogging inactivated SARS -CoV-2 on stainless steel coupons, simulating whole -room fumigation.167 Initial research suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can be inactivated within 1 minute on pure copper and copper -coated surfaces.82 Due to the lack of do cumented transmission via fomites, widespread decontamination of surfaces (e.g., streets, sidewalks) may not be necessary.545 The Air Force Research Laboratory is studying the effects of microwave exposure on aerosolized pathogens.349 Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators565 and other PPE. Researchers have identified three methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heatin g to 70\u00b0 C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP).258 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.258 Dry heat and UV decontamination can also be used under certain conditions.257 Additional methods showing efficacy against SARS -CoV-2 on respirators include pulsed xenon ultraviolet light,696 wet heat (using a multi cooker),196 and methylene blue plus light.443 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.643 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have b een granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.243 The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals ,76 though fit failure after reuse remains a concern.461 Respirator decontamination methods such as VHP appear to maintain filtration efficiency after repeated decontamination cycles.595 Several decontamination methods, including VHP, moist heat, and UVC, are capable of decontaminating N95 respirators for 10 -20 cycles without loss of fit or filtration efficien cy.10 Stacking respirators may increase decontamination rates without compromising efficiency.658 Peracetic acid may be effective in combination with VHP.380 The US FDA has issued guidance for bioburden reduction systems using dry heat to decontaminate certain respirators.759 A Canadian technology (\"D -Pod\") using heat and UVC for PPE is being manufactured for North American distribution.289 A thermal inactivation model for SARS -CoV-2 provides estimates of infectivity reduction based on time and temperature.843 Forced air ozone reactors may be able to decontaminate surgical gowns, though SARS -CoV-2 tests are needed.151, 471 What do we need to know? We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to indoor aerosol transmission. Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? What level of decontamination is necessary (e.g., log -reduction) to eliminate transmission risk from contaminated surfaces? We need to understand how different testing methods and standards affect decontamination efficacy estimates. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 16 PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? What do we know? Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID -19 more often than other casual contacts.787 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.644 Universa l masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.786, 863 A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are primarily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with greater risk while in closer proximity to patients. 385 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions , airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"110 The WHO considers face shields as inferior to masks and respirators for control of droplet transmission.807 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long - sleeve gowns as well as gloves.804 PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.253, 798 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, E UFFP2 or recommended for those working with potential aerosols ,806 though procedure type is not the only factor influencing risk of aerosol generation in hospitals.406 Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with hood), should be considered for high -risk procedures .80 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.245 On May 7 , 2020, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer a uthorized.250 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply. 587 Particular care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.187 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.187 The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices. 249 Lack of eye protection was associated with elevated COVID -19 infection risk in healthcare workers.679 Mathematical modeling suggests that mask efficacy depends heavily on the aerosol concentration of SARS -CoV-2, with higher efficacy in situations with lower aerosol concentrations; pairing mask use with other interv entions that reduce aerosol concentrations, such as increasing ventilation, can greatly reduce transmission risk.137 Non- medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission, though data specific to SARS -CoV-2 are sparse.5, 8 Effective February 1, 2021, the CDC requires all passengers on public transit to wear facemasks.77 The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves,101 as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.770 The US CDC maintains a list of NIOSH -tested facemasks with estimates of minimum and maximum filter efficiency.112 Mask fit is another critical component of effectiveness,150 in addition to filter efficiency. Experiments with mannequins show that masks reduce particle exposure when wo rn by infectious emitters,761 uninfected recipients,78 or both, with protective benefits maximized when mask use is universal. Wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask ( i.e. \"double masking\") significantly improved filtration efficiency.694 Infected individuals w earing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.789 A meta -analysis of SARS -CoV-1, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission ,148 with N95 respirators more effective than surgical masks.148 In a separate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.568 N95 respirators were associated with up to 80% reductions in SARS -CoV-1 infections .568 Surgical face masks, respirators , and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals to other individuals.172, 445, 765 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amo unt of seasonal coronavirus expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m).445 Homemade masks reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63 -86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer's face.773 Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,410 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).780 Of 42 homemade materials tested , the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers.848 Neck fleeces (gaiters) commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles, compared to wearing no mask at all.255 Cotton T -shirt masks appear ineffective at reducing emitted particles when individuals talk, breath e, sneeze, or cough, with those made of single layers increa sing emitted particles during these activities.38 Smaller aerosol particles (e.g., <0.1 m) are more difficult to filter for most respirators and face masks.150 What do we need to know? We need to continue asse ssing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Can mask efficacy be predicted from material composition? What is the efficacy of combining multiple facemasks compared with single multilayered masks?100 Very few studies have been conducted to assess the risk of COVID -19 to those collecting nasopharyngeal swab s.19 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribu tion. What do we know? Current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. The WHO and others have called for more research into SARS -CoV-2 origins.814 Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 and related SARS -like coronaviruses suggests that SARS -CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host.68 Current sampling of pangolin viruses does not implicate the m as an intermediate to human SARS -CoV-2.68 Based on phylogen etic analysis, SARS -CoV- 2 most likely emerged from Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country,430 though historical recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS -CoV-2 genome.262 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlik ely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.30, 862 Phylogenetics suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pang olins.468, 470 The SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is a major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.485 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat coronaviruses485 and coronaviruses found in pangolins.470 Ancestors of SARS -CoV-2 underwent diversifying selection in bats, making host jumps to other mammals, including humans, feasible even without the presence of an intermediate species.497 At least one mutation in the SARS -CoV-2 genome (A1 114G; T372A) shows evidence of increased viral replication in human lung cells, and appears to have undergone positive selection that potentially enabled infection in humans.393 Additional work is needed to confirm the role of this mutation, as well as to identify other mutations that enabled a jump to humans. Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signatures shared among high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.319 These data further suggest that SARS -CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.319 Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples, suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection, but does confer a fitness advantage in the human host.821 Additional whole - genome sequencing in huma ns would help to confirm this finding. Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"30 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.854 There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.30, 454, 469, 854 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the h uman ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).162 A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein , demonstrating that such insertions can occur naturally. 860 Additionally, \" [...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,30 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a labora tory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"30 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif. 182 A report claiming a laboratory origin of SARS -CoV-2837 has been heavily disputed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University.4 What do we need to know? We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species , if it exists ? Are there closely related coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 18 Genomics - How does the dis ease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Preliminary genomic analyses that the first hu man cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.32, 52, 623 The estimated mutation rate for SARS -CoV-2 is 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.767 Reducing infections is crucial for reducing the emergence of new variants.743 The US CDC maintains a prevalence tracker for SARS -CoV-2 variants in the US.104 Several viral variants have higher transmissibility and disease severity than initial SARS -CoV-2 strains. There is some evidence that variants with the E484K mutation can result in co -infection of multiple SARS -CoV-2 lineages.271 The N501Y mutation, which has arisen independently in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants, appears to increase replication relative to wild -type SARS -CoV-2 in experimentally infected hamsters and human cell lines.475 In cell culture, the N440K mutation shows higher infectious titers than SARS -CoV-2 strains without the mutation , though any impact on human transmission requires additional research; the mutation has been found in several case clusters in India.732 Immunosuppressed patients are a possible source of vir al variants due to prolonged virus replication within a single host.12 SARS- CoV-2 variants are common in children, reflecting overall prevalence in the US.197 The WHO has applied different names to major SARS -CoV-2 variants using Greek letters.810 B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1) (VOC202012/01) (Alpha) - This variant has been associated with higher transmission rates357 and higher mort ality175 in modeling studies. It has been found in domestic dogs and cats in households with B.1.1.7 cases .127, 283 The variant consists of several mutations linked to the viral Spike protein (HV 69 -70 deletion, N501Y, N493K ).624 There are currently no concerns relating to the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech533, 832 or Moderna vaccines ,828 and the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine appears to show efficacy against B.1.1.7 (though lower than efficacy against non -variant SARS - CoV-2).226 Serum from patients with non -B.1.1.7 variant SARS -CoV-2 can neutralize B.1.1.7 virus .605 The E484K mutation has appeared independently in several individuals with the B.1.1.7 variant in the UK312 and US .505 B.1.617.2 (Delta) - Variant of concern812 initially identified in India in January 2021, containing several mutations of concern (E484Q and L452R).692 The variant has been documented in California and the UK.340 Initial research suggests that this variant is more transmissible813 and more virulent836 than non- variant SARS -CoV-2. Resists neutralization by certain monoclonal antibodies351 and is mor e resistant to vaccine -derived antibodies than non- variant SARS -CoV-2; serum from patients given mRNA vaccines was able to neutralize the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) lineage.217 B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) (Beta) - First identified in South Africa in December 2020735 with notable mutations N501Y, E484K, and K417N.562 This variant is resistant to neutralization from convalescent plasma and vaccine recipient sera.783 Preliminary studies from Moderna ,829 Johnson and Johnson,219 AstraZeneca,532 and Novavax559 suggest a lower vaccine response to this variant , though the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears to generate neutralizing ability in laboratory476 and human trials .603 Convalescent serum from patients with B.1.351 infection shows high neutralization ability against non-variant virus.121 The B.1.351 variant is partially resistant to the monoclonal antibody casirivimab and is fully resistant to bamlanivimab .350 P.1 (20J/501Y.V3) (Gamma) - First identified in Brazil ,237 contains various mutations including K417N, E484K, and N501Y .237 The P.1 variant h a s rapidly become the dominant variant in Brazil, increasing from 28% to 73% of sampled specimens from January to March 2021.254 The variant is estimated to be 1.7 -2.4 times more transmissible than non -variant SARS -CoV-2.238 Prior infection with non -variant SARS -CoV-2 is estimated to provide only 54 -79% protection against infection with the P.1 variant,238 potentially explaining the r esurgence of COVID -19 in Manaus, Brazil after a large initial epidemic.89, 661 Partially resistant to the monoclonal antibody casirivimab and is fully resistant to bamlanivimab.350 Appears less resistant to neutralization than the B.1.351 variant despite three critical shared mutations (E484K, K417N/T, and N501Y), suggesting RBD mutations are not the only factor influencing variant immune escape. 188 Preliminary analysis suggests this variant leads to increased mortality in younger individuals, specifically those age 20-29.183 P.2 (Zeta) - Shares E484K mutation and other background with P .1 but lacks K417N and N501Y mutations ; E484K mutation has been suggested in both published715-716 and unpublished work306, 478 to be resistant to neutralization. The detection of the P.2 variant in previously infected individuals suggest that it is capable of causing reinfection.556, 637 B.1.429 (Epsilon) ([CAL.20C (20C/S:452R) ] L452R563 mutation located on the Spike protein was first reported in Denmark384 and has increased in prevalence in California.163 The B.1.429 lineage is more transmissible and leads to more severe disease than non -variant SARS -CoV-2,509 and is partially resistant to antibodies.192, 775 The US CDC has labeled the B.1.429/B.1.427 variant as a variant of concern (VOC).113, 193 B.1.526 (Iota) - Contains several mutations of concern (D235G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V ), primarily in New York.429, 799 Does not appear to be associated with more severe illness or greater likelihood of reinfection.740 What do we need to know?

Vaccination focused on interrupting transmission (prioritizing younger individuals) may reduce mortality more than prioritizing vulnerable groups when vaccine campaign initiation is delayed. 376 CovidSim: SEIR model allow users to simulate effects of future intervention policies at state and national levels (US only).139 Covasim: Agent -based model for testing effects of intervention measures, also available as Python library.400 University of Georgia: Statistical models used to estimate the current number of symptomatic and incubating individuals, beyond what is reported (e.g., \"n owcasts\").

Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences 2021, 477 (2245), 20200584. https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rs pa.2020.0584 %X By modelling the evaporation and settling of droplets emitted during respiratory releases and using previous measurements of droplet size distributions and SARS -CoV-2 viral load, estimates of the evolution of the liquid mass and the number of viral copies suspended were performed as a function of time from the release. The settling times of a droplet cloud and its suspended viral dose are significantly affected by the droplet composition. The aerosol (defined as droplets smaller than 5 m) r esulting from 30s of continued speech has O(1h) settling time and a viable viral dose an order -of-magnitude higher than in a short cough. The time -of-flight to reach 2m is only a few seconds resulting in a viral dose above the minimum required for infec tion, implying that physical distancing in the absence of ventilation is not sufficient to provide safety for long exposure times. The suspended aerosol emitted by continuous speaking for 1h in a poorly ventilated room gives 0.1 -11% infection risk for initial viral loads of 108 -1010copies mlll, respectively, decreasing to 0.03 -3% for 10 air changes per hour by ventilation. The present results provide quantitative estimates useful for the development of physical distancing and ventilation controls. 570. O lson, D.

These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. SARS -CoV-2 variants with multiple amino acid mutations in t he spike protein are emerging in different parts of the world, raising concerns regarding their possible impact on human immune response and vaccine efficacy against the virus. Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS -CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. Next -generation sequencing analysis of amplicons synthesized from sewage concentrates revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences, first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to &gt;95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs b ecoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on vi rus antigenicity. Although we did not detect such mutation in viral RNAs from sewage, we did detect mutations at amino acids 478, 490, and 494, located close to amino acid 484 in the spike protein structure and known to also have an effect on antigenicity. IMPORTANCE The recent appearance and growth of new SARS -CoV-2 variants represent a major challenge for the control of the COVID -19 pandemic. These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Here, we show how environmental surveillance for SARS -CoV-2 can be used to help us understand virus transmission patterns and provide an early warning of variants becoming prevalent in the population. We describe the detection and quantification of variant B.1.1.7, first identified in southeast England in sewage samples from London (UK) before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious from clinical cases. Variant B.1.1.7 was first detected in a sample from early November 2020, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 mutations detected in sewage rapidly increasing to &gt;95% in January 2021, in agreement with increasing SARS -CoV-2 infections associated with B.1.1.7 viruses. 819. Wodarz, D.; Komarova, N. L.; Schang, L. M., Role of high -dose exposure in transmission hot zones as a driver of SARS -CoV-2 dynamics. Journal of The Royal Society Interface 2021, 18 (176), 20200916. https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2020.0916 %X Epidemiological data about SARS - CoV-2 spread indicate that the virus is not transmitted uniformly in the population. The transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transm ission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low -dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so -called transmission hot zones, characterized by high -dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. The model yields different types of epidemiological dynamics, depending on the relative importance of hot zone and community transmission. Interesting dynamics occur if the rate of virus release/deposition from severely infected people is larger than that of mildly infecte d individuals. Under REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 7/13/2021 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 92 this assumption, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high -dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. In this regime, residual hot zone transmission can account for continued virus spread during community lockdowns, and the suppression of hot zones after community interventions are relaxed can cause a prolonged lack of infection resurgence following the reopening of society. This gives rise to the notion that targeted interventions specifically reducing virus transmission in the hot zones have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. Epidemiological trends in the USA and Europe are interpr eted in light of this model. 820. Wong, F.; Collins, J. J., Evidence that coronavirus superspreading is fat -tailed.
