Cover photo : handling, and October 2022 iv Acknowledgments The PATH Center of Excellence for Microarray Patch (MAP) Technology would like to thank the many individuals involved in the development of this draft target product profile (TPP) for a COVID -19 vaccine MAP. These individuals represent a broad range of bac kgrounds and expertise , including immunology, vaccine development, clinical trials, MAP technology, vaccine delivery, and vaccine manufacturing. The TPP was developed based on background research on the landscape of COVID -19 vaccination and MAP development . Specific attributes were then refined in consultation with PATH subject matter experts. PATH staff who contributed to the drafting and review of this document include Tham Chi Dung , Robert Choy, Margaret and Darin Zehrung . This version of the TPP serves as the first draft distributed for external consultation. Please send any feedback or comments to maps@path.org . This TPP reflects the status of the COV ID-19 field and vaccine pipeline as of October 2022 . Since the COVID -19 pandemic and vaccine landscape are constantly evolving, t he TPP will serve as a living document that will be updated as new data are generated.

MAPs, also known as microneedle patches, consist of hundreds or thousands of microscopic projections that deliver dry vaccine or drug into the skin. They are applied to the body and projections penetrate only the top layer s of the skin. Some platforms require an applicator for delivery (integrated or separate). Administration may be perceived as less painful than an injection , since the micro - projections are shorter than a needle and often do not reach dermal pain receptors. Wear times range from a few seconds to hours to release the payload, depending on the MAP design. As of October 2022 , development of COVID -19 MAPs was in the early clinical stage . This TPP includes consi derations for dissolving MAPs and solid -coated MAP subtypes. Although the goal of PATH's Center of Excellence for Microarray Patch Technology is focused on advancing the MAP technology platform for high-priority needs in low - and middle -income countries (L MICs), a product with a dual market \u2014available in both LMIC and high -income country (HIC) markets \u2014is more sustainable from a commercialization and market potential perspective and could reduce costs in LMIC markets. Therefore, this TPP describes a global pr oduct driven by the needs of LMICs that would also benefit users in HICs. Ideally, a COVID -19 MAP product could be suitable for both markets with minimal differences. Key targets that would differ between LMIC and HIC contexts are defined . The clinical development plan should ensure that the safety and efficacy of a COVID -19 MAP are comparable and acceptable across diverse populations, including those living in LMIC s. The TPP will serve as a living document based on the COVID -19 landscape as of October 2022 and will benefit from stakeholder input and evolve over time as new data are generated. COVID -19 overview The World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare d COVID -19, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2), a public health emergency of international concern in Jan uary 2020 , leading to worldwide shutdown in Mar ch 2020 .1 Vaccines for COVID -19 were developed in record time; the first vaccination programs in HICs started in December 2020. Despite efforts of the COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) ,a access to vaccination has been higher in HICs, while the rollout to LMICs has been impacted by shortages of vaccine and ancillary supplies, the need to enhance supply chain capacity , and lack of equitable distribution of vaccines. As of October 2022 , only 23% of the population in low-income countries had received one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine , compared to 6 8% of the global population .2 COVID -19 MAPs are currently in clinical development. Recruit ment for a Phase 2a study began in March 2022 ,3 and another Phase 1 study is planned for later in 2022.4 Multiple candidates are in preclinical studies.5-10 The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the US Department of Health and Human Services has funded three MAP developers to develop COVID -19 MAPs.11,12 Several MAP developers are slated to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials in late 202 2 or early 2023 and do not anticipate a commercial product for several years.13-15 Thus, it is envisioned that COVID -19 MAPs will not a COVAX is led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization, in partnership with the United Nations Children 's Fund . 2 be ready to help with the global pan demic but will be utilized as part of routine or booster immunizations when COVID -19 becomes endemic , to respond to local outbreaks or to vaccinate against novel variants that may emerge . Current presentation Several COVID -19 vaccine candidates have been quickly progressed through clinical studies as a response to the pandemic. These candidates span vaccine platforms including nucleic acid -based , viral vector, inactivated, protein subunit, and live attenuated vaccines . Most vaccines induce antibodies to either the spike protein or more specifically to the receptor -binding domain on the spike protein to block the entry of the virus into the host cell. Current vaccines are based on the virus that circulated in the beginning of the pandemic. As the virus evolves and mutates, vaccine composition may need to evolve . For instance, Omicron -specific boosters targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariant lineages are currently approved in Canada, the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United Sta tes.16- 20 Future vaccines may be monovalent against a specific variant of concern , or multivalent .21,22 DRAFT June 2022 3 Table 1.

Product is comparable to AstraZeneca's product . 2. Product is comparable to Novovax's product . DRAFT June 2022 4 Other notable COVID -19 vaccines As of October 2022 , 47 COVID -19 vaccines are approved for use countries.26 Gamaleya Research Institute's Sputnik V (Gam -COVID -Vac), a viral vector vaccine, was approved by Russian authorities . WHO approval was paused until manufacturing facilities met the required standa rds, and European Medicines Agency officials could not complete their review as clinical trial data w ere missing from the submission. Zydus Cadila's DNA vaccine, ZyCoV -D, was approved for emergency use by Indian authorities and is delivered intradermally by a disposable syringe jet injector.27 COVID -19 microarray patch value proposition Due to increased ease of use , a MAP presentation could enable delivery by lesser trained personnel such as community health worker s, trained volunteer s, or teacher s, or facilitate self-administration . Routine immunizations were disrupted during the COVID -19 shutdowns, with outreach services being more impacted than fixed -post immunization services.28 As COVID -19 transitions from a pandemic to being an endemic disease requiring routine COVID -19 vaccinations, a MAP presentation could reduce the impact of additional vaccinations on routine immunization programs. A MAP could r educe missed opportunities as a single -dose presentation, which would eliminate reluctance to open multi -dose vaccine products when fewer people are present at a vaccination session than the number of available vaccine doses . MAP s could improve thermostability . They could remove t he need for ultra-cold chain (UCC) , requiring refrigerated or frozen storage , which could simplify the storage and distribution of some COVID -19 vaccines and improve access in remote areas. For some vaccines, MAPs might enable sufficient stability for storage in a controlled temperature chain (CTC) at up to 40\u00b0C for a short period of days to weeks immediately prior to use .29 CTC use also has potential programmatic benefits to routine immunization by reducing cold chain requirements for COVID -19 and increasing the cold chain capacity available for other vaccine products. However, improved heat stability and CTC qualification must be determined on a vaccine -specific basis and is unlikely to apply to all COVID -19 vaccine/MAP combinations. Once MAP manufacturing facilities are constructed and operational, MAPs could eliminate some manufacturing bottlenecks seen at earlier points of the COVID -19 response, such as glass vials, vial fill/finish, and ancillary supplies (e.g., needles and syringes). MAPs have demonstrated the potential for dose sparing of influenza vaccine, for example, which can be important if antigen supply is limited . A COVID -19 MAP could improve safety and decrease waste disposal costs , since it would eliminate the need for reconstitution /dilution , which is required for some COVID -19 vaccines , including Pfizer/BioNTech's Comirnaty\u00ae, and reduce or eliminate the risk o f needlestick injuries. MAPs could enable alternative delivery scenarios . By fostering self -administration, pickup in a pharmacy or transporting MAPs through the postal system to people's homes become s a potential new mechanism to get vaccines to more people . Alternatively, s upervised self -administration could increase throughput at immunization sites if one health care worker can supervise groups of individuals while still allowing for vaccine documentation and observation perio ds by health care 5 worker s. This approach could also spare personnel for allocation to routine immunizations and other health services . MAPs have the potential to reduce vaccine hesitancy , particularly in the needle -phobic population. However, as MAPs repr esent a novel technology, some users and vaccine recipients may be skeptical of or reluctant to use them. A COVID -19 MAP could potentially enable a dual HIC/LMIC market in which the manufacturer could subsidize COVID -19 MAP products in LMICs using profits generated from HIC markets. This business model could increase the value proposition for a commercialization partner to bring this novel technology to market and make the product more affordable for LMIC markets, assuming HIC and LMIC product attribute needs are sufficiently similar. 6 Target product profile This section describes minimally acceptable and optimal targets for a COVID -19 MAP (dissolving or solid-coated). The baseline presentation s for comparison (as defined in many of the minimally acceptable targets) are the current COVID -19 vaccine s delivered by n eedle and syringe. The TPP describes a COVID -19 MAP product that would be clinically and programmatically suitable for use informed by the current development status and underst anding of this early -stage technology. Unless otherwise specified, the targets apply to both LMIC and HIC contexts. Indication Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 1.1 Indication For immunization to prevent severe disease and death caused by COVID -19. For immunization to prevent severe disease and death caused by COVID -19. Activity against other coronaviruses (including other sarbecoviruses) and/or potential future variants is highly preferred. Matches the WHO COVID -19 vaccine target product profile 's indication for use .30 1.2 Target population Adults , 18 years of age and older . All individuals, irrespective of age . WHO COVID -19 vaccine target product profile states that the minimal target is adults, including elderly , and the optimal is all ages , including pediatrics and individuals who are pregnant or lactating . As of October 2022, approved COVID -19 vaccines are safe for people as young as 6 months of age , including most pre -existing conditions such as auto -immune disorders and pregnant people . WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization recommend ed the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine for use in children age d 5 and older and recommends that countries consider vaccinating younger children ( from age 6 months) only when high vaccine coverage h as been achieved in the high -priority groups . The US Food and Drug Administration and other national regulatory authorities have approved vaccination of children age d 6 months and up under an Emergency Use Authorization .31,32 7 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 1.3 Intended use case Fixed -site immunization by a trained health care provider. Fixed -site or mobile (e.g., home - based) immunization. The MAP could be delivered by a trained health care provider , community health worker, trained volunteer, or caregiver, or through self -administration. A COVID -19 MAP could increase ease of use and enable delivery by other user groups , including community health workers, traine d volunteers, caregivers, and/or self -administration. Campaign settings would benefit from the ease of use and speed of delivery of a MAP presentation. The thermostability profile of a COVID -19 MAP will impact the use cases. Ability to remove the MAP from cold chain or ultra-cold chain storage simplifies log istics and allows for wider use of MAPs , such as in campaign settings or home -based immunizations. Use cases will be impacted by the required training and critical use errors identified and assessed in risk evaluations (e.g., removing the MAP before sufficient wear time for complete dose delivery ). In some countries , vaccines may also be administered at pharmacies , which is standard practice in many HICs and an emerging immunization setting in LMICs . If delivery of a COVID -19 MAP requires an observation period after administration, similar to the current injectable formulation, delivery of a COVID - 19 MAP in a home setting may not be suitable. However, it is unknown whether the same recommendation would apply to a COVID -19 MAP . In certain settings, MAPs that can be distributed by mail and self -administered in the home could increase access and improve uptake . However, this use case may not be suitable if stringent documentation of vaccination is required. 1.4 Target countries All countries , with initial launch in HICs. Availability and use of a COVID -19 MAP in all countries. Ideally , a COVID -19 MAP would be available in all countries at launch, which would improve vaccine access and equity. This may not be feasible with an emerging technology. Introduction of a COVID -19 MAP may be initiate d in HIC markets and then extend to all countr ies. Strategies for introduction should account for health equity. COVID -19 vaccines have been predominantly procured by government agencies , COVAX , and through multinational purchasing arrangements like the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust. 8 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 1.5 Product registration path LMIC context : Approval by any maturity level 3 or 4 NRA as defined by WHO, followed by WHO prequalification. HIC context : Approval by NRA. Same as minimal ly acceptable target and COVID -19 MAP launched with product registration in LMICs. As of October 2022, WHO has granted emergency use listing to eleven COVID -19 vaccines. The Africa Regulatory Taskforce has approved five COVID -19 vaccines.33 Due to timing of availability of a COVID -19 MAP in relation to the state of the COVID -19 public health emergency, Emergency Use Authorization may not be a viable regulatory pathway and full NRA approval may be required. COVID -19 MAP developers should engage regulatory authorities early to discuss which mechanism may be most appropriate . A COVID -19 MAP would be regulated and approved as a novel combination (device/biologic) product and the vaccine manufacturer would likely be the sponsor for the Investigational New Drug/Biologics License Application . In this role, the vaccine manufacturer instead of the MAP developer would lead the discussions with the NRA and take on the regulatory and investment risk. It is recommended to engage regulatory authorities early to discuss the potential regulatory pathwa y, as this could streamline the approval process of a novel combination product. WHO prequalification would be needed for United Nations Children's Fund procurement and support of COVID -19 MAPs from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance . The MAP product should also b e programmatically suitable for low -resource settings, which is part of the WHO prequalification process to ensure the \"suitability of the vaccine for the immunization services where it is intended to be used.\" For a COVID -19 MAP to receive WHO prequalific ation , there would first need to be a policy recommendation published in a WHO technical report series.34 Experience with similar technologies such as transdermal patches, intradermal injection devices, or MAPs for other vaccine and drug applications may be useful for drafting initial regulatory strategies . However , regulatory pathways for vaccine MAPs are still untested and are a new concept for both manufacturers and regulators. Abbreviations: COVAX, COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access ; HIC, high country; LMIC NRA, national regulatory authority; WHO, World Health Organization . 9 Dosage and administration Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 2.1 Formulation Formulation containing COVID -19 antigen (encapsulated mRNA, inactivated virus, etc.) . Necessary excipients and/or additives (e.g., stabilizers, polymer, other inactive ingredients) may be added that are currently used clinically and generally regarded as safe by the US Food and Drug Administration . Same as minimal ly acceptable target . The formulation could facilitate dose sparing (see 2.5 \"Antigen Content \" attribute) and improve thermostability (see the \"Storage, handling, and distribution\" table, 5.8 \"Heat stability ,\" on page 19 ) and light sensitivity compared to the current presentation . The necessary excipients/additives will depend on MAP format (solid -coated or dissolving), particularly to improve stability and release . Concentration of the antigen will be important for both dissolving and solid -coated microprojections. MAP delivery will require a higher antigen concentration than the current liquid for mulation. Alternative databases for safe excipients such as the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative's Safety and Toxicity of Excipients for Paediatrics database may also be consulted. 2.2 Use of adjuvants The COVID -19 MAP includes an adjuvant that can be formulated into the MAP and is safe for skin delivery. The COVID -19 MAP is shown not to require an adjuvant. Adjuvants are not currently included in the formulations of m ost COVID -19 vaccines with World Health Organization emergency use listing . Notable exceptions include Sinopharm and Sinovac 's use of an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant ;35 Bharat's (inactivated -based Other adjuvants have been formulated with injectable COVID -19 vaccines , but due to a lack of clinical trial results, their uptake remains to be seen .37 For COVID -19 vaccines that use adjuvants, t here is a potential opportunity to reduce or remove the adjuvant dose in a MAP formulation , since MAP delivery into the dermal layer of the skin could improve immunogenicity compared to intramuscular injection .38 Adjuvants currently included in injectable formulations may be unacceptable to include in a COVID -19 MAP because of concerns around delivering adjuvants to the skin and potential for increased reactogenicity. Novel adjuvants , such as granulocyte macrophage colony -stimulating factor or double -mutant heat -labile toxin, which enhance the immune response within the 10 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes skin and mucosal tissues , may be more suitable for MAP delivery, but they will increase regulatory hurdles.39,40 2.3 Dose presentation A single -dose, single -use presentation composed of an integrated delivery device in which COVID -19 vaccine is presented as a solid -coated or dissolving microarray format. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. The MAP is a combination product that integrate s a vaccine delivery device , and the antigen is incorporated into solid -coated or dissolving microarray projections. The size of the COVID -19 MAP should be driven by the minimal surface required to achieve the optimal antigen dose. 2.4 Vaccine schedule The COVID -19 MAP should follow the schedule of COVID -19 vaccine administered by the intramuscular route. Booster vaccinations may be required, comparable to COVID -19 vaccines administered intramuscularly . The COVID -19 MAP requires a single application to fully immunize the patient. Booster vaccinations may be required, comparable to COVID -19 vaccines administered intramuscularly . Within a vaccination series, the COVID -19 MAP may be used interchangeably with currently available COVID -19 vaccines administered intramuscularly . The dosin g schedule for the primary vaccination series is listed in Table 1. Most vaccines require two doses weeks to months apart. The recommended MAP vaccine schedule will depend on the schedule that generates a comparable or preferably superior immune response to an intramuscular injection . A vaccine schedule with fewer doses has cost -saving and programmatic advantages \u2014particularly beneficial in low -resource settings. There is an opportunity that application of a single COVID-19 MAP could deliver the complete vaccine regimen through controlled release technology. Some MAP technologies can slowly release vaccine for prolonged antigen presentation, which can simulate prime and boost vaccine doses in a single administration.41,42 Booster vaccinations such as administration of annual seasonal vaccin es may be necessary , depending on the duration of protection and virus variants. MAPs should f ollow the same dosing schedule for boosters based on public health guidance. MAPs would follow the same schedule as intramuscular vaccinations for boosters and could be used interchangeably, regardless of the antigen received at the prior vaccination . 2.5 Antigen content The antigen content of a COVID - 19 MAP should be the minimum required to give a non -inferior immune response to the currently available liquid vaccine delivered by intramuscular injection. The antigen content of a COVID -19 MAP should be reduced compared to the quantity of antigen contained in an intramuscular injection . Target dosage for the COVID -19 MAP should be the minimum required to give a non-inferior immune response to the currently available COVID -19 vaccine deliver ed by intramuscular injection , as the antigen content will have a significant impact on MAP cost and production capacity. It is possible the MAP will require a reduced dose of antigen to induce an equivalent immune response due to the immune -enhancing benefits of MAP 11 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes delivery. Eliminating the adjuvant could reduce the feasibility of achieving dose sparing with a MAP presentation. 2.6 Route of admin istration Product should be suitable for delivery to dermis and/or epidermis at an anatomic site that is acceptable to users and immunization programs. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. Some patches might deliver primarily intradermally , but others might deliver to both the epidermis and dermis. There are insufficient data to specify the optimal depth or target tissue within the skin. Preliminary clinical studies with mRNA COVID -19 vaccines delivered intradermally were safe, well tolerated, and generated a robust immune response.43 MAP vaccination into the skin may induce mucosal immunity , which may be beneficial for a respiratory pathogen such as SARS -CoV-2.44 2.7 Application site Site of the application should be accessible and acceptable to the majority of vaccine recipients . Same as minimal ly acceptable target. Currently approved COVID -19 vaccines are administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle , which would also be suitable for MAP administration . To be consistent with current immunization recommendations f or infants, the anterolateral thigh muscle could be the site of MAP application. MAPs in development are being tested on various anatomical sites , such as the deltoid, wrist, and forearm. Multiple application sites may be evaluated in clinical studies to ensure that different anatomical sites do not have an impact on vaccine efficacy. In a previous in -country usability study for vaccine MAP delivery in Ghana , easily accessible sites (lower arm) were preferred for delivery in adult women over sites that required removal of clothing (upper arm or back), if administered by a health care provider in a clinic setting.45 Abbreviations: MAP, microarray patch; mRNA, messenger RNA. 12 Safety and efficacy Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 3.1 Systemic reactions Systemic a dverse events should be no more serious and frequent than those of the current injectable vaccines . Minor and severe s ystemic a dverse events should be less frequent and less serious compared to the current injectable vaccines . WHO emergency use listed COVID -19 vaccines have been shown to have a favorable benefit -risk profile . Mild adverse events such as redness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and low -grade fever have been noted. Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, myocarditis, and other safety signals have been associated with WHO emergency use listed COVID -19 vaccines. L ong-term adverse events are extremely rare. The safety of COVID -19 vaccines continues to be studied as the vaccine rolls out to additional populations.46,47 Monitoring of specific adverse events will be needed depending on the antigen selected (e.g., myocarditis for mRNA vaccines, thrombocytopenia for adenovirus viral vectored vaccines). Since the frequency of these adverse events is rare, a comparison of the incidence of adverse events between MAP and intramuscular delivery will likely not be determined until after the MAP product has been introduced. The safety of COVID -19 MAPs would need to be established in pre -licensure safety studies in the target popula tion for whom this product is indicated. Safety and reactogenicity should provide a highly favorable benefit -risk profile based on the observed efficacy per the WHO COVID -19 vaccine TPP. 3.2 Local reactions The severity and/or frequency of local reactogenicity at the application site may increase with MAP delivery due to the route of administration compared to intramuscular vaccination. Pain at the application site should be less in severity and/or duration co mpared to injectable formulation. Local reactogenicity is similar to or less than intramuscular injection. Pain at the application site should be less in severity and/or duration compared to injectable formulation. Slight reactogenicity such as redness or pain at the site of injection has been noted in COVID -19 vaccines when administered intramuscularly . MAP delivery to the dermal layer of the skin has the potential to increase reactogenicity compared to an injection. Minor local reactions lasting several days to weeks have been observed after MAP application in clinical studies with seasonal influenza va ccine . However, these were generally found to be acceptable. o In a Phase 1 study for a dissolving seasonal influenza MAP, application resulted in a mild and transient reactogenicity, mostly reported as tenderness (66% of recipients), erythema (40% of recip ients), and pruritus (82% of recipients), lasting on average between 2 and 3 days. Of MAP 13 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes recipients, 20% reported pain after vaccination , compared to 44% of intramuscular injection recipients .48 o In a Phase 1 study of a solid -coated seasonal influenza MAP, the skin response following vaccination peaked at 3 days and faded between days 7 and 28. All application site reactions were mild or moderate, with the exception of a single subject with \"severe \" coloration at 10 minutes aft er application. Erythema and edema were reported .49 o Similar local reactions ( e.g., visible erythema) are expected to occur post vaccination with a COVID -19 MAP and may take weeks to fully resolve. However, since reactogenicity is likely to be antigen depen dent, local reactions observed for a COVID -19 MAP may differ from those observed following vaccination with a seasonal influenza MAP . The frequency and severity of such reactions should be assessed in pre - licensure clinical safety trials and prior to intro duction to assess vaccine acceptability, taking into consideration other benefits of the COVID -19 MAP vaccine compared to the injectable presentation. A visible local reaction, if highly reliable, may be a desirable feature as an indicator of the success o f vaccination. 3.3 Immunogenicity /efficacy Immunological endpoints should meet correlate of protection once established. Non-inferior to licensed vaccine as measured by immunobridging studies . Superior to licensed vaccine as measured by immunobridging studies . Correlate s of protection such as binding and neutralizing antibodies may predict vaccine efficacy but have not yet been defined for COVID -19 vaccines.50,51 Vaccine efficacy has been shown to vary by population demographics, geography, and locally circulating variants at the time of the study.52 Per the WHO COVID -19 vaccine TPP, vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease must be higher than 50% at a minimum. Greater than 70% efficacy is the preferred target. The efficacy against severe disease is 70 % to 80% and 90% for minimum and preferred targ ets, respectively. It is desirable for a COVID -19 vaccine MAP to have efficacy above the minimum for emergency vaccination. Developers should consult with regulators if an immunobridging approach is acceptable. Per the WHO COVID -19 vaccine TPP, \"immunobri dging, based on standardized and validated assays, and with appropriate regulatory 14 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes concurrence, can be used to predict that vaccines will meet specific efficacy criteria. \"30 o If the antigen used in the COVID -19 MAP is investigational and has not been previously licensed in an injectable formulation, then an efficacy study will be required. 3.4 Seasonal antigens to combat variants Confers protection from same variants as intramuscular injection . Confers protection against several or all variants . As new variants arise, the antigens in the COVID -19 vaccines may be altered to better match cir culating strains of the SARS -CoV-2 virus similar to seasonal influenza vaccines . Antigen(s) in the COVID -19 MAP should be a good match for strains circulating at the time the MAP becomes available and follow WHO guidelines on suitable COVID -19 vaccine anti gens. 3.5 Duration of protection Confers protection for at least 6 months . Confers protection for at least 1 year. Per the WHO COVID -19 vaccine profile; WHO, World Health Organization. 15 Microarray patch application and delivery Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 4.1 Human factors and usability A summative usability evaluation must demonstrate that safety - related use r errors related to the device, applicator (if needed), labeling, and training have been identified and mitigated. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. For intended users and the scenarios of use for a COVID -19 MAP ( see the \"Indication \" table, page 6 ), usability/human factors of the device must be assessed in the relevant target population and geography. The usability engineering process in IEC 62366 -1:2015 Medical devices \u2014 Part 1: Application of usability engineering to med ical devices should be followed to verify and validate the final COVID -19 MAP design and applicator (if required for use). This includes establishing a usability engineering file.53 Human factors principles outlined in American National Standards Institut e/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation HE75 Human factors engineering - Design of medical devices should be followed.54 Key components of usability for a COVID -19 MAP are described in other sections of this TPP, including labeling, pa ckaging, user training requirements, application site, delivery time, wear time, applicator, indication of successful vaccination, and disposal. To guide user -centered product development efforts, formative usability testing should be conducted iteratively throughout the development process to ensure the \"suitability of the vaccine for the immunization services where it is intended to be used,\" which is part of the WHO prequalification process.34 4.2 Applicator If an applicator is required , the MAP is delivered using a simple, single -use, disposable applicator (integrated or separate) while maintaining compliance with packaging requirements. If an applicator is not required, the MAP is applied similar to standard transdermal patches . Use of an applicator is not required. Similar to standard transdermal patches, the MAP is a stand -alone patch that can be successfully administered manually. Some MAP platforms may require an applicator, either a separate component or integrated with the MAP , to successful ly penetrate the skin and deliver the vaccine. The geometry and design of the MAP and its projections will inform the need for an applicator. Ideally, the MAP could be successfully applied to the skin by manual pressure without the use of an applicator, since an integrated applicator could increase the packag ing volume in the cold chain, and a separate applicator would increase logistical complexity . However, a simple, single -use disposable applicator may be required to ensure the MAP is applied consistently and correctly ( dependent on MAP design ). 16 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes If an applicator is required, an integrated applicator would be preferable from a usability and logistics perspective, provided this has no unacceptable negative impact on cost or cold chain storage volume. Regardless of the need for an applicator, usability studies per international standards and regulatory guidance will be required to ensure that the MAP can be successfully applied by intended users. If self -administration is an intended use case for the MAP, the applicator should be suitable for self -administration and evaluated through usability studies with the intended user group. If an applicator is required, it should maintain compliance with packaging requirements. 4.3 Delivery time Total time for delivery of a COVID - 19 MAP should be comparable to delivery by intramuscular injection . Total time for delivery of a COVID -19 MAP should be less than delivery by intramuscular injection . Delivery time should be acceptable to the health care system in question (informed by usability testing). Preparation and applicat ion of a MAP should be comparable to the estimated time required for delivery of the current COVID -19 vaccine by intramuscular injection. This excludes wear time, which is described below. Average time to prepare and inject from a multidose vial is 15.2 s econds .55 Minimizing the time required to deliver each dose would be beneficial to overall program logistics and capacity. These benefits would likely be most suitable in high-throughput campaign settings. 4.4 Wear time Up to 5 minutes, under observation, before removal of MAP by a health care worker , trained lay health worker, caregiver, or patient. Less than 1 minute, under observation or unobserved , before removal of the MAP by a health care worker , trained lay health worker , caregiver, or patient. Required wear times for vaccines are expected to range from seconds to minutes depending on the MAP design. Wear time will depend on technical feasibility and must be evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies to ensure successful delivery of the required antigen dose. A wear time of 5 minutes is deemed acceptable and to fit with in current workflows , since it is currently recommended to observe vaccinees after vaccination by needle and syringe .56 o For COVID -19 vaccination, health care providers are currently encouraged to observe vaccinees for approximately 15 minutes after COVID -19 vaccination to enable rapid treatment of any allergic event (anaphylaxis) . 17 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes Acceptable wear time will be evaluated by end users in stakeholder interviews and usability studies; end -user feedback should be considered and incorporated during product development to help ensure future product uptake. There should be minimal safety concerns associated with leaving the patch o n for longer periods. 4.5 Indication of successful vaccination The design should include at least one functional, auditory, visual, or tactile cue during or after application as an indicator of successful vaccine delivery. This indicator would provide the user feedback that the patch was properly applied to the skin. The indicator should be intuitive and easily understood by intended users. The design should include more than one functional, auditory, visual, or tactile cue during or after appli cation of a single dose as an indicator of successful MAP application. This indicator would provide the user feedback that the patch was properly applied to the skin. The indicator should be intuitive and easily understood by intended users. There is likely a need for an auditory or visual (color -based) indicator to confirm appropriate pressure has been applied over the entire surface area during patch application to ensure that the MAP projections have been inserted into the skin correctly to sufficie ntly deliver the dose and provide confidence to the user that the MAP has been correctly applied. The success rate of delivery (penetration of the skin by a sufficient percentage of the microarray projections) by typical users in target countries should be validated under ideal and non -ideal conditions (e.g., with minimal training and instructions). Future usability studies may be required to ensure that intended users can successfully understand and confirm indication of successful MAP application . Failure to activate the indicator will inform the user that the application process was faulty. 4.6 Autodisable feature The MAP should be designed to prevent reuse. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. For WHO prequalification, vaccine delivery devices are required to be autodisable.57 Reuse of a MAP would likely result in non -vaccination of the subsequent recipient. The indicator or integrated applicator should have an autodisable mechanism (i.e., once used, it is automatically disabled without any additional action from the user and cannot be intentionally or accidentally reused). 4.7 User training requirements Minimal training required (e.g., 15 minutes) . The MAP can be correctly administered by a health care provider or trained lay health worker with printed instructions after minimal training. No in-person device training required. Similar to currently available transd ermal patches, the MAP can be correctly administered by a health care provider, patient (self - administration), or caregiver after Some studies have shown that people with minimal training can apply MAP s.58,59 Patches are designed to be easy to apply and have been shown to facilitate consistent, reproducible application by non -medically trained volunteers. The MAP should be suitable for both clinic and community settings , since it is expected that MAPs will be used in remote areas with limited access to trained health workers. 18 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes Printed, written instructions must be made available in at least one of the recognized languages of the destination country, pre -tested for comprehension, and revised as needed. Training materials should also include simple pictorial instructions. reading simple product instructions or package insert. At the initial introduction of MAP technology, minimal training may be required. As the MAP technology becomes more ubiquitous, less or no training could become more common. If a no training scenario is proposed, appropriate end user testing would be required to demonstrate that no errors were made during the MAP preparation, application, and disposal. 4.8 Co- administration Co-administration with other vaccines is possible, similar to the liquid presentation. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. The COVID -19 MAP should be suitable for co -administration with the same vaccines as the current liquid presentation . Per the WHO COVID -19 vaccine TPP , the long-term preferred attribute for a COVID -19 vaccine is that it can be administered with other vaccines that are typically administered during campaigns. Interim US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines state that COVID -19 vaccines may be administered \"without regard to timing of other vaccines .\" 60 Abbreviations: IEC, International Electrotechnical Commission; MAP, microarray patch ; TPP, target product profile; WHO, World Health Organization . 19 Storage, handling, and distribution Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 5.1 Primary packaging Primary packaging (in direct contact with vaccine) should protect the projections to prevent damage and/or contamination of projections during shipping and storage. Primary packaging should include a moisture -impermeable barrier. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. Packaging components and design must follow regulatory guidance, such as WHO and FDA (or applicable national regulatory authority ) guidance and International Organization for Standardization standards.61 The COVID -19 MAP will require a moisture -impermeable barrier, such as a foil pouch, and protection from the environment and mechanical impact during shipping. The COVID -19 MAP may also need to be packaged with a desiccant. An integrated applicator could potentially serve as the MAP's pri mary packaging, depending on the design. Stability studies according to regulatory guidance of the COVID -19 MAP will be required to ensure safety and efficacy of the product throughout the duration of labeled shelf life and required storage conditions.62 The environmental impact of primary packaging , including its disposal, should be minimized. See 5.10 \"Disposal \" on the environmental impact of disposal. If the COVID -19 MAP is sensitive to light, the packaging should protect the vaccine from light. Howeve r, efforts should be made to optimize the formulation so that the COVID -19 MAP is not light sensitive (see the \"Dosage and administration\" table, 2.1 \" Formulation ,\" page 9 ). In LMICs, barcodes are not typically included on primary packaging, but their inclusion could improve tracking of vaccine products to reduce vaccine stockouts and wastage and could enable better vial tracking in case of adverse events following immunization. They could also increase data accuracy and reduce health care worker time f or service delivery when integrated into electronic immunization records compared to manual data entry with paper -based forms.63 5.2 Secondary packaging MAPs within their individual primary packages will be grouped into a secondary package to facilitate transport and storage. Same as minimally acceptable target. Secondary package s of currently available COVID -19 vaccines are typically packaged in 50 - to 100-dose cartons. 20 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes Secondary packaging , such as a cardboard box, should facilitate transport, storage, and handling within the public -sector health system and distribution channels. Packaging should withstand mechanical impact during shipping. Paper -based packaging must be coated or laminated to prevent mold growth in humid environment s. Secondary packaging that allows the vaccinator or supply chain personnel to visualize the number of single -dose MAPs remaining should be considered. A future packaging assessment should be conducted to optimize packaging configuration from a technical, programmatic, and usability standpoint. The environmental impact of secondary packaging should be minimized and include recycled and recyclable or biodegradable materials. 2D barcodes are currently used on secondary and tert iary vaccine packaging, which offers efficiencies to vaccine inventory and supply chain management. GS1-compliant barcodes for secondary/tertiary packaging are recommended by WHO and required by Gavi and UNICEF as of 2021.64 5.3 Storage volume The cold chain volume per dose should be no greater than that of a single -dose vial (~15.0 cm3). The cold chain volume per dose should be less than that of a single - dose vial ( ~15.0 cm3). Currently available COVID -19 vaccines are in multi -dose vials or single -dose vials. MAP storage volumes are not expected to be feasible to match the per - dose volumes of most multi -dose vials (~2cm3 to 5cm3), due to the size of the product and the need for protective packaging.65 Storage volume should be efficient and minimized as much as possible. HIC settings will have more flexibility in storage capacity compared to LMIC settings. Current cold chain volume estimates of MAP prototypes range from 5 cm3 to more than 25 cm3. Designs with integrate d applicators increase the cold chain footprint. MAPs should be sized to fit into WHO -approved refrigerators and freezers.66 For patches that do not require cold chain storage, comparator volume for total packaging comprises the vaccin e and delivery syring e (0.5 mL autodisable N&S, 43 cm3). For the prefilled syringe comparator, there are no additional components stored in dry storage (i.e., outside of the cold chain). 21 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes 5.4 Tertiary packaging Product should be contained within suitable tertiary packaging that is compatible with the existing immunization supply chain. Same as minimal ly acceptable target. For LMIC context s, tertiary packaging should comply with the Vaccine Presentation and Packaging Advisory Group's generic preferred product profi le recommendation to \"minimise volume and weight of tertiary packaging and limit the need for repackaging for in -country supply chain distribution.\"67 Paper -based packaging must be coated or laminated to prevent mold growth in humid environment s. The environmental impact of tertiary packaging should be minimized and include recycled, recyclable , and/or biodegradable materials. 2D barcodes are currently used on secondary and tertiary vaccine packaging, which offers efficiencies to vaccine inventory and supply chain management. GS1-compliant barcodes for secondary/tertiary packaging are recommended by WHO and required by Gavi and UNICEF as of 2021.64 5.5 Labeling Labels should comply with regulatory guidance and include required sections and formatting.68 Same as minimal ly acceptable target. MAPs should be clearly labeled on both the primary and secondary packaging with simple language to explain pertinent information \u2014such as product title, manufacture date and batch number, expiration date, indication and usage, dosage forms and strength, and contraindications \u2014that enables consistentl y successful use by the intended end user. If more detail is required, a package insert with instructions for use may be added and a job aid developed. Simple pictorial instructions may be included. If CTC is indicated, additional labeling is required (see 5.6 \"Temperature indicator \" below). 5.6 Temperature indicator Vaccine vial monitor label is included on the primary packaging. For CTC use, a separate peak threshold indicator should be included. Same as minimally acceptable target, or a combined indicator with an integrated threshold indicator could be on primary packaging. Temperature indicators should be included with individ ual MAPs to allow MAPs to be removed from their secondary packaging. For CTC, the MAP must be labeled with a peak threshold indicator. 5.7 Product shelf life Shelf life should be 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for at least 12 months. Shelf life should be more than 24 months at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. Product shelf life (i.e., long -term storage) of the COVID -19 MAP should be comparable or improved compared to the current presentation. 22 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes Vaccine potency stability profiles should not rely on ultra-cold chain temperatures. The shelf life may depend on the duration of CTC use that would add programmatic value , since by WHO's current definiti on of CTC, the vaccine must be sufficiently heat stable at the end of its shelf life. The recommended shelf life of current COVID -19 vaccine products is summarized in Table 1. The WHO Prequalification minimum storage temperature range is 2\u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C for 6 months; however , this may be shorter under emergency procedures.69 The WHO COVID -19 vaccine TPP specifies the minimal target of at least 2 weeks at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. The preferred target is higher storage temperatures and higher thermostability to enhance vacci ne distribution and availability . 5.8 Heat stability Vaccine potency stability profiles should accommodate storage between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for at least 12 months. Stability profiles should have enhanced thermostability to allow for temperature excursions up to 40\u00b0C (i.e., use under CTC conditions for at least 3 or 7 days ).70,71 A COVID -19 MAP should offer a better stability profile than the current COVID -19 vaccine s. Cold chain capacity in HIC s and LMICs has been stretched during the COVID -19 pandemic. MAPs that do not require ultra-cold chain or -20\u00b0C storage would allow for inc reased access and vaccination coverage. An improved stability profile could ease logistics and add value , including improving the storage and transport of vaccines delivered outside of a health facility (e.g., community outreach setting). 5.9 Freeze stability A COVID -19 MAP may be freeze sensitive. A COVID -19 MAP should be formulated so that it is not freeze sensitive. Pfizer /BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines cannot be refrozen. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is initially stored frozen and then thawed to 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C; it cannot be refrozen. AstraZeneca's vaccine cannot be frozen.69,72 5.10 Disposal The MAP should be disposed of as non -sharps biohazard waste. The MAP and packaging materials should be safe to dispose of in typical health care waste management practices , including for burning and burial as per local guidelines . The MAP should be safe to dispose of in the community. The MAP should have a r educed disposal volume compared with liquid COVID -19 vaccine s, including the N&S. After application, the COVID -19 MAP will need to be disposed of as per local guidelines, either at the immunization setting itself and/or in the community , within the context of community outreach, caregiver administration, or self - administration based on local guidelines/regulations on waste disposal. In some settings, disposal in the community may not be allowed and waste will need to be collected at the immunization site and returned to the health center. For dissolving MAPs, after removal of the patch, the MAP projections are dissolved and no longer able to penetrate skin, thereby precluding the potential for reuse or needlestick injury. 23 Attribute Minimally acceptable target Optimal target Rationale/notes The MAP should have a similar disposal volume compared with the liquid COVID -19 vaccine , including the N&S. For solid -coated MAPs, if the projections cannot penetrate the skin without an applicator, they could be considered non -sharps waste. MAP technology has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of providing medical services by reducing the volume of biohazardous waste and elim inating the need for injections that generate sharps waste that can be an infectious disease hazard to communities if disposed of improperly. Disposal volume of N&S vaccination is approximately 40 cm3.73 For delivery at the community level, MAP design fea tures should mitigate risks to the community, household members, and environment associated with exposure to residual vaccine on the MAP backing or surface of the skin after MAP use. MAPs should be made of materials that limit environmental impact; future assessments should review the MAP life cycle from manufacture to disposal to identify and address potential areas for reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact. The environmental impact of an applicator, if required, should also be minimized.

The COVID -19 MAP price should be less than or equal to the current intramuscular vaccine in the applicable market segment . Trade -offs between potential increases in the price per dose of a COVID -19 MAP versus the programmatic benefits compared to intramuscular injection will be considered by decision -makers and purchaser s when making product procurement decisions. Cost -effectiveness will also be impacted by wastage - adjusted vaccine price differential, scenarios of use , and delivery strategies. Current COVID -19 vaccine prices in HICs range from US$2 to $37/dose in the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States , and range from $3 to $7.50 (2022 prices) for Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance procurement through COVAX ( 91 participants funded by the C OVAX Advance Market Commitment).74,75,76,77 Total cost of delivery should be considered in costing and cost-effectiveness analysis . In February 2021, WHO estimated the total cost of delivering COVID -19 vaccines was equivalent to $1.66/dose and $3.70/person vaccinated with two doses, excluding the price of the vaccine.78 As a novel delivery device, a MAP is likely to be more expensive than the current vial presentation s. Several MAP developers have suggested their technologies could be similar to or less in price t han a prefilled syringe (~ $1) plus the cost of antigen. The actual cost of a COVID -19 MAP will depend on factors such as antigen content, device design, production yield, and manufacturing volume. The manufacturing conditions (e.g., manufacturing in an aseptic versus low - bioburden environment) will also impact cost. Manufacturing under asep tic conditions compared to low bioburden could at least double the cost of goods. It is unclear whether regulators would approve a low -bioburden product. There are opportunities to reduce the delivery/programmatic costs with a MAP presentation, which coul d reduce the total cost of delivery. However, previous analyses have shown that the MAP price is the largest driver of program costs , especially for relatively expensive antigens .79 Potential delivery cost savings for LMICs could come from cold chain costs (especially if controlled temperature chain use is feasible), ease of administration if self -administ ered or community health workers can administer , and non-sharps waste disposal.
