She felt constant back and neck pain, and her mind ached for new inspiration. Little did she know, 15 minutes from her home in Magnolia, she'd find her sanctuary. \"I just knew, this is what I've been looking for,\" Kiger, 57, said, taking a break from an intuitive development class at Inspirit Studios in Dover. Nestled in Kent County, Inspirit Studios is an oasis for integrative medicine and meditation. The studio is the brainchild of two former Kent County Vocational Technical schoolmates, Kim Stockslager and Anita Brown. Though Kent Vo-Tech has ceased to exist, their passion for integrative medicine has spanned the times. Two years ago they started Inspirit Studios as a way to combine Eastern medicine such as Reiki, healing touch, and crystal therapy into everyday life. \"We are trying to create a cooperative feel up here,\" Brown said, gesturing around the studio located in a converted early-1900s house near the end of South State Street in Dover. The entire second floor of the house has been transformed into an Eastern healing haven: Beautiful crystals sparkle throughout while soft light and candles set a relaxing mood. Relaxation is one of the most integral elements of energy work, Brown said. If a client falls asleep during a session, they've made a breakthrough, she joked. Healing touch helps with such breakthroughs, since it combines meditation with physical touch to hone in on parts of the body that might be stressed or in pain. A simple touch of the hand can help harness positive energy to an area, Brown said. That technique, among others, can be used in tandem with clinical medicine, said Dr. Frances Zappalla, a pediatric cardiologist certified in integrative medicine with Nemours. \"When you're sick or in surgery or there's some kind of illness going on there, energy fields are out of balance,\" Zappalla said. The healing touch techniques are being incorporated more and more, she said. Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children has an active healing touch program to help patients cope with different diseases, especially those receiving chemotherapy treatments. Though Zappalla admitted she was a bit skeptical at first, after following up with patients after such healing touch practices, she said she sees real benefits. \"In and of itself we know the importance of the connectivity between mind and body,\" she said, noting that the practice lowers heart rate and blood pressure. A significant component of integrative medicine practices is lifestyle, Zappalla added. There is a large emphasis on eating healthy and exercising regularly in addition to any clinical diagnoses. Inspirit Sutdios emphasizes such healthy eating and mindfulness. Anglea Allbee, a student of Brown, has a small herbal tea and remedy startup at the studio. She recommends echinacea tea to combat allergies and elderberry for overall health. \"Integrative medicine isn't something you do instead of conventional medicine; it's additional,\" Zappalla said. \"You may be able to come off medicine.\" Nemours specifically integrates healing touch, meditation, aromatherapy and yoga as well as music, art and pet therapy. More than 100 staff members are in various levels of healing touch training, Zappalla said, though she is the only physician certified. \"It's being done throughout the hospital,\" she said. \"We've gotten so many letters from parents talking about the benefits for their children.\" Nurses interested in healing touch can become certified by the American Holistic Nurses Association. Brown said she is working on her certification with one of the integrated medicinal nurses from Nemours. But in the meantime, the team at Inspirit Studios trains staff at Bayhealth Kent General on healing touch on a volunteer basis. \"In this same token we are finding a lot of doctors are embracing Reiki, too. What I always say is before you make a judgment, just try it,\" Brown said. Inspirit Studios offers Reiki classes as well as intuitive development, to help practitioners in energy work. Brown said students work with pendulums to assess chakras, tarot cards, aura gazing and singing bowls. Eventually, the studio would like to expand to offer life-coach classes for those in the corporate sector. There are seven chakras in conjunction with anatomy of the body, according to Tantric tradition. Brown said the pendulums and singing bowl can measure the energy that is out of whack, since they are tuned to different chakra regions. For instance, the root chakra is located at the base of the spine, and represents a person's physical and mental stability, Brown said. Imbalances can be caused by a new job or major construction work on a new home. \"Everybody has intuitive abilities, it's just something if you work on you can reach them in different styles,\" Brown said. \"It's kind of like being an artist and figuring out what your medium is. It's what you are bringing to the table.\" The beginning of energy work is as simple as going to the grocery store and leaving someone with a kind word. Or entering a stressful meeting with a positive attitude. \"It's kind of bringing an awareness of what you can bring in the world,\" Brown said. Jen Rini can be reached at "}
