DEFINITION OF ENDOMETRIAL CANCER This definition comes from and is used with the permission of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the United States of Ame rica. Cancer that forms in the tissue* lining the uterus (the small, hollow, pear -shaped organ in a woman's pelvis in which a fetus develops). Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas * (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Anatomy of the female reproductive system. The organs in the female reproductive system include the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. The uterus has a muscular outer layer called the myometrium and an inner lining called the endometrium Important no te regarding other types of cancer of the uterus Cervical cancer Cervical cancer is a cancer forming in the cervix of the uterus, unlike endometrial cancer which forms in the corpus of the uterus. Diagnosis and treatment of this type of cancer is differen t from endometrial cancer. Uterine sarcoma* Uterine sarcoma* is another type of cancer forming in the corpus of the uterus. It forms in the muscle of the uterus (myometrium) or in other tissues* in the uterus. Although the treatment of uterine sarcoma* and endometrial cancer have some similarities, the information presented here is valid for endometrial cancer but not for uterine sarcoma* . Uterine carcinosarcoma* Uterine carcinosarcoma is a type of cancer forming in the corpus of the uterus. It is now a cknowledged that carcinosarcoma may be a type of aggressive endometrial cancer. The information provided on endometrial cancer is therefore also valid for uterine carcinosarcoma .

Endometrial cancer is the most common cance r of the organs of the female reproductive system. In Europe, 1 to 2 in every 100 women will develop endometrial cancer at some point in their life. In the European Union, over 88,000 women are diagnosed with an endometrial cancer each year. This number is increasing in the majority of European countries. It is the seventh most common cause of death from cancer in women in Western Europe. Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women over the age of 50 and thus after menopause, but up to 25% of cases may occu r before the menopause. At diagnosis, about 75% of women have a cancer confined to the uterus (stage I). For these women, the prognosis* is good and the 5 -year survival rate is 90%.

Today, it is not clear why endometrial cancer occurs. Some risk factors have been identified. A risk factor increases the risk that cancer occurs, but is neither a necessary nor sufficient to cause cancer. A risk factor is not a cause in itself. Some women with these risks factors will never develop endometrial cancer and some women without any of these risk factors will develop endometrial cancer. The majority of endometrial cancers need estrogens * to grow. Without estrogens they stop growing or grow more slowly . This is why, with a few exce ptions, the factors increasing the risk of endometrial cancer are linked to estrogens. The main risk factors of endometrial cancer are: Aging: the risk of endometrial cancer increases as women get older . Genes: women with hereditary nonpolyposis colon ca ncer syndrome, also known as HNPCC or Lynch syndrome, have a high risk of developing colon and endometrial cancer. One in 2 women with this syndrome will develop an endometrial cancer at some point in their life. This syndrome is an inherited disorder due to a mutation of a gene. It accounts for up to 5% of endometrial cancers. Family history of endometrial cancer: having a first -degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) who had endometrial cancer increases the risk of having endometrial cancer. Persona l history of breast or ovarian cancer: o Having had a breast cancer or an ovarian cancer increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer. o For women with a personal history of breast cancer, the risk also increases if the patient has been treated with tam oxifen *. Tamoxifen is an anti -estrogen substance and a decrease in the risk should be expected, but tamoxifen also has a stimulating effect on the endometrium that can support the development or growth of endometrial cancer. On the whole, for women with br east cancer where tamoxifen is indicated, the benefit of taking tamoxifen outweighs the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Personal history of certain gynaecological diseases: o Polycystic ovarian syndrome: this syndrome leads to a higher level of estrog ens* and a lower level of progesterone * than usual and consequently increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer . o Endometrial hyperplasia: endometrial hyperplasia is a proliferation of cells of the endometrium. The cells are normal but may become ca ncerous later. The risk of cancer is very low for simple or mild hyperplasia but is high for atypical hyperplasia Exposure to estrogen *without, or with insufficient amount of progesterone *, for example: o There is sometimes a natural imbalance in some wome n. o The use or intake of external estrogens, especially hormone therapies that contain only estrogens and no progesterone * after the menopause . Overweight and obesity : being overweight or obese increases the risk of endometrial cancer because it modifies t he level of estrogens * and their effects.

The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . Diabetes: women with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer because it modifies the level of estrogens * and their effects. Hypertension *: it has been suggested that hypertension is assoc iated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer, but the mechanism of this possible association is not yet clear. Geographic factors: women living in North America or in Europe are at increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. No pregnancy: women who have never been pregnant are at a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. On the other hand, women who have had one child or more are at a lower risk of developing endometrial cancer. This is especially the case for women with 5 or more children. Total number of menstrual cycles: having more menstrual cycles in a lifetime increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer, again for hormonal reasons. Taking contraceptive pills containing both estrogen * and progesterone * lower the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Other factors have been suspected to be associated with an increased risk (alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity) or a decreased risk (consumption of phyto -estrogens found in soya food, coffee , and vegetables) of developing endometrial cancer , but the evidence is inconsistent.

In contrast to cervical cancer, n o systematic s creening1 for endometrial cancer is recommended. Cervical cancer screening (cervical smear usually taken every 3 ye ars) performed during gynaecological examination aims to detect cervical cancer and not endometrial cancer. Cervical cancer is the cancer of the cervix, the lowest and narrow part of the uterus that leads to the vagina as shown on the picture presented in the definition. Nevertheless, some cervical smear tests may detect endometrial cancer even if this is not their goal. The most frequent sign of endometrial cancer is vaginal bleeding. After menopause, there should not be vaginal bleeding , the presence of vaginal bleeding is therefore not normal . Vaginal bleeding after menopause should alert women to consult their doctor. Before menopause, vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or unusually heavy vaginal bleeding during menstrual periods, should also alert women to consult their doctor. Endometrial cancer is not the single and most frequent cause of such vaginal bleeding and doctors will recommend further examination. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is based on the three following examinations : 1. Clinical examination *. This includes gynaecological examination to assess the location and volume of the tumor and if it has extended to other organs in the pelvis. 2. Radiological examination. This includes ultrasound examination of the uterus. A probe is i ntroduced into the vagina in order to be closer to the uterus , thus allowing for a better examination. This is called trans -vaginal ultrasound. During this examination, the thickness of the endometrium is measured . If the thickness is more than 3 to 4 mm , a sample of the endometrium should be taken (biopsy *). Additional investigations such as chest X -ray* , abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT -scan * may be performed to exclude metastasis* . If it is suspected that the cancer has spread to the cervix of the u terus, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging* (MRI) should be requested. 3. Histopathological * examination. This is the laboratory examination of the tumor cells by dissecting a sample from the tumor (a biopsy* ). This laboratory examination is performed by a patholog ist who will confirm the diagnosis of endometrial cancer and will give more 1 Screening consists of p erform ing an exa mination in order to detect cancer at an early stage, before any sign of the cancer appears. A systematic screening is proposed if a safe and acceptable exam can be performed and if this exam is able to detect cancer in the majority of cases. It should als o be proved that treating screened cancers is more effective than treating cancers diagnosed because signs of cancer were present. For example, this has been demonstrated for the Pap smear test used in cervical cancer screening.

The biopsy is usually obtained by hysteroscopy, which involves introducing a thin telescope into the uterus together with a specia l device to take the biopsy . A second histopathological * examination will be performed later by examination of the tumor removed by surgery.

WHAT IS IT IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO GET THE OPTIMAL TREATMENT ? Doctors will need to consider many aspects of both the patient and the cancer in order to decide on the best treatment. Relevant information about the patient Personal medical history History of cancer in relatives, especially breast and ovarian cancer Status regarding menopause Results from the clinical examination * by the doctor General well -being Before the operation, a preoperative evaluation will be performed to assess the risks of the anaesthesia* and the risks of the operation. A preoperative evaluation consists of specific questions and physical e xamination *. It also usually requires a chest X -ray* and blood tests to assess the white blood cells, the red blood cells, the platelets, and the functioning of the liver and kidneys . Some additional exam ination s may be necessary according to the medical history of the patient. Relevant information about the cancer Results of the biopsy* The biopsy performed with the special device introduced into the uterus during the gynaecological examination will be examined in the laboratory. This examination of the biopsy is called histopathology* . A second histopathological examination will be performed later by examination of the tumor and the lymph nodes * after their surgical removal . Before surgery, results of the examination of the biopsy* should include: o Histological type * Histological type is based on the type of cells that the tumor is composed of . Endometrial cancers form in the endometrium, the tissue* lining the uterine cavity. The main histological type of Endometrioid carcinomas are composed of cells that resemble the normal endometrium and can be associated with or preceded by the abnormal multiplication of normal cells of the endometrium, a phenomenon hyperplasia. Papillary serous carcinomas (also called serous carcinomas) are composed of cells that are different from the normal endometrium and share similarities with the most frequent form of cancer of the ovary or ovarian tube. o Grade Grade is based on how different from normal endometrial cells tumor cells look and on how quick ly they grow. For endometrial cancer, the grade will be between 1 and 3. The lower the grade, the better the prognosis* . When the h istological type is endometrioid, Endometrial Cancer : a guide for patients - Information based on ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines - v.2012.1 Page 10 This document is provided by the Anticancer Fund with the permission of ESMO . The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . the grade can be 1, 2 or 3. When the histological type is papillary serous carcinoma* or clear cell carcinoma* , the grade is always 3 and carries a worse prognosis . o Lymphovascular space invasion A lymphovascular space inva sion means that tumor cells are found in the blood vessels and in the lymph vessels of the tumor. Finding tumor cells in these vessels means that it is more likely that tumor cells have spread to the lymph nodes *, or to other organs. o Gene expression profil e* The quantification of a distinct set of genes expressed by the tumor can also be performed on the biopsy* . This is not routinely performed, but can help to predict the aggressiveness of the tumor and the likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy* . Based on the histological type *, the grade and the gene expression profile* , doctors sometimes divide endometrial cancer into two types. Type I endometrial cancers are typically endometrioid carcinomas and grade 1 or 2 cancers. They are thought to be caused by excess of estrogen *. They are usually less aggressive and are less likely to spread to other tissues* than type II endometrial cancers. Type II endometrial cancers are usually papillary serous carcinoma s*, clear cell carcinomas* or carcinosarcomas* and g rade 3 cancers. They also have different mutations of their genes and express different proteins than type I endometrial cancers. They don't seem to be caused by an excess of estrogen *. Cells from these tumors do not usually have estrogen and progesterone * receptors. Clear cell carcinomas never present with such hormone receptors. Because they are more likely to grow and spread outside the uterus, doctors tend to use more aggressive treatment to treat patients with type II cancers. Staging* Doctors use staging* to assess the extension of the cancer and the prognosis* of the patient. For endometrial cancer, the staging* system from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) is commonly used. This FIGO staging* system is based on the sp read of the tumo ur from its initial location in the endometrium to other tissues* or organs. The stage is fundamental for the decision regarding treatment . The more advanced the stage, the worse the prognosis* . For endometrial cancer, the stage is defined after the patient has been operated on, based on what the surgeon actually observed during the operation and on the results of the laboratory analysis of the removed tumo r. The staging* is thus surgical and pathological. The pathologist will assess the de pth of invasion of the tumor in the muscle of the uterus, its spread to the cervix, its size and location, its extension to the fallopian tubes and ovaries, its grade, its histological type * and the lymphovascular space invasion. If lymph nodes * have been removed during surgery, the pathologist will check for the presence of cancer cells in these lymph nodes. The table below presents the different stages of endometrial cancer. The definitions may be technical, so it is recommended to ask doctors for more detailed explanations .

Stage Definition Stage I The tumor is found in the uterus but has not spread outside the uterus. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB according to the thickness of the tumor in the uterus. Stage IA The tumor is either limit ed to the endometrium or has invaded less than 50% of the thickness of the muscle of the uterus. Stage IB The tumor has invaded more than 50% of the thickness of the muscle of the uterus. Stage II The tumor is found in the uterus and has spread to the ce rvix. Since 2009, stage II endometrial cancer is not divided into stage IIA and IIB anymore. Stage III The tumor has spread beyond the uterus and cervix to other part(s) of the female genital organ (vagina, ovary, fallopian tube or tissues* around the uterus) or to lymph nodes* in this area. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, IIIC1 and IIIC2 based on the organs to which the tumor has spread. Stage IIIA The tumor has invaded the outer membrane of the uterus (called the serosa ) or the fallopian tube(s) or to the ovaries . Stage IIIB The tumor has invaded the vagina or the parametrium, the tissue surrounding the cervix. Stage IIIC1 Tumor cells are found in pelvic* lymph nodes* . Stage IIIC2 Tumor cells are found in para -aortic * lymph nodes* . Stage IV The tumor has spread to the bladder or the bowel or to other organs in the body (metastasis* ). Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB. Stage IVA The tumor has invaded the bladder or the bowel mucosa . Stage IVB Tumor cells are found in lymph node s* in the groin or in the abdomen or in distant organs such as the liver or the lungs . Note: the stages presented in this table are based on the 2009 -FIGO staging* system. Another FIGO staging* system was used before 2009. Consequently, all data and evid ence for management of endometrial cancers are available on the basis of the old staging* system and unfortunately do not fully apply to the current staging* system. Evaluation of the r isk of recu rrence * in stage I cancers Most women are diagnosed with stage I cancer and treatment by surgery at this stage is very effective . For these women , it is essential to evaluate the risk of recurrence, or, in other words, the risk that the cancer could come back. Evaluating the risk of recurrence allows doctors to decide on the best treatment to reduce this risk as much as possible without over treating by some therapies that would not reduce the risk but could alter the quality of life . It is known today that t he risk of recurrence is increased when the cancer presents some of the following characteristics: histological types * other than endometrioid, grade 3, stage IB, lymphovascular space invasion and tumor diameter larger than 2 cm. In this regard, stage I cancers are subdivided into three risk categories: Women whose cancers do not present any of the abovementioned characteristics, i.e. whose cancers are stage IA tumors, less than 2 cm, of the endometrioid type with grade 1 or 2 and no lymphovacular invasion are considered at low risk of recurrence. Women whose cancers are either stage IA tumors of the endometrioid type with grade 3, or stage IB tumors of the endometrioid type with grade 1 or 2 are considered at intermediate risk of recurrence.

Women whose cancers are either stage IB tumors of the endometrioid t ype with grade 3, or tumors of histological types * other than endometrioid regardless of sub-stage (IA or IB) or grade are considered at relative high risk of recurrence *. It also happens , after examination following surgery , that a cancer thought to be s tage I before surgery is shown to be a higher stage.

The cornerstone of treatment is surgery. Radiotherapy* and chemotherapy* used after surgery are called adjuvant * therapies, meaning that they are used in addition to s urgery. Treatments listed below have their benefits, their risks and their contraindications. It is recommended to ask doctors about the expected benefits and risks of every treatment in order to be informed of the consequences of the treatment. For some patients , several treatment possibilities are available and the choice should be discussed according to the balance between expected benefits and risks. Surgery A preoperative evaluation is performed for every patient. Surgery might not be feasible in 5-10% of patients with endometrial cancer due to medical contraindications and the risk posed by anaesthesia* . This is usually because of conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiac diseases. For patients considered operable, the goal of the surgery is to stage the disease and to remove the uterus containing the tumor. Staging* the disease Surgery will allow for staging* of the disease. This is done by examination of the tumor to evaluate its size, location and to check whether tumor cells can be foun d in the cervix, in the ovarian tube s, in the ovaries, in the lymph nodes* or elsewhere in the pelvis and in the abdomen. During the operation, surgeons inspect and palpate other abdominal organs (liver, diaphragm, omentum* , peritoneal* surfaces). Surgeons also pu t liquid in the abdominal cavity, remove it by suction and send it to the laboratory to search for cancer cells. This is called peritoneal washing. All tissues* removed during the operation are sent to the laboratory to be examined by the patholog ist (histopathological * examination ). Removing the tumor The uterus containing the tumor will be removed The operation involves removing the uterus, the two ovarian tubes and the two ovaries. Removal of the uterus is called hysterectomy * and removal of both ovarian tubes and both ovaries is called bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy* , or bilateral salpingo -ovariectomy. For patients with stage I, stage II and stage III cancer, this operation can be performed by making an incision to the lower abdomen (laparo tomy *), or by a technique called laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy *. This technique uses a video camera to project and enlarge the image on a television screen in order to guide the removal of the uterus, the ovarian tubes and the ovaries thro ugh the vagina. This latter technique seems to provide equivalent results in terms of quality of the remov al of the tumor and survival, and compared to laparotomy * has been showed to reduce the length of hospital stay , reduces the use of pain killers, lowe rs the rate of complication after surgery and improve s quality of life.

The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . The standard surgical approach for stage I endometrial cancer consists of remov al of uterus, ovaries, and ovarian tubes with or without lymph nodes * removal. Many surgeons suggest removal of lymph node s* in patients with intermediate and high risk stage I endometr ial cancer (stage IA grade 3 and stage IB). The surgical approach for stage II endometrial cancer consists of removal of uterus, ovaries, ovarian tubes, and pelvic * lymph no des* with or without removal of paraaortic * lymph nodes. For patients with stage III and stage IV cancers, the goal of the surgery is to remove as much of the primary tumor as possible. This is called debulking or cytoreductive surgery. Several lymph no des* in the pelvis and along the aorta* may be removed Removal of lymph nodes* in the pelvic* area and along the aorta* may be performed. This practice varies between hospitals. Even if the removal of lymph nodes* helps doctors to be more accurate in defining the stage of the cancer, there is no evidence that it has any added value in treating the cancer and ensuring that it does not come back. Removal of the lymph nodes* increases the risk of lymphoedema, a condition where lymph fluid accumulate s in the l egs. However, it is part of the staging* procedure and helps to identify patients who may need adjuvant * therapies. Many surgeons suggest that lymph nodes should be removed for all patients operated on, with the exception of patients with a stage IA and gr ade 1 or 2 tumor. Adjuvant * therapy An adjuvant therapy is a therapy given in addition to surgery. There is no definitive data supporting the routine use of adjuvant treatment for patients with disease confined to the uterus (localized endometrial can cers). For all stages, there is still controversy and lack of clear evidence of what the best options are. It is recommended that the decision for treatment of endometrial cancer should be based on discussion in an inter -disciplinary team of medical profes sionals. This meeting of different specialists is called a multidisciplinary meeting * or tumor board review . In this meeting, the planning of treatment is discussed according to the relevant information mentioned above. Adjuvant treatment for stage I can cer The options for patients with stage I cancer include : Observation* , which consists of medical consultations on a regular basis that includes history -taking (a review of the patient's medical history) , a physical and a vaginal examination* . Further ex aminations such as a radiological examination, blood tests and an examination under anaesthesia* can be undertaken if signs or symptoms are noticed . Adjuvant v aginal brachytherapy* , which is an internal type of radiotherapy* where the source of radiation i s placed in the vagina.

The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . Adjuvant p elvic* radiotherapy* , which is an external type of radiotherapy* where radiations are produced by an external source and then directed to the pelvis. Adjuvant c hemotherapy *, which is the use of anticancer drugs to kill ca ncer cells or limit their growth. It is not clear which combination of drugs are the most effective but they should include one drug containing platinum (cisplatin * and carboplatin * are platinum containing drugs used in the treatment of endometrial cancer ). For patients with stage I cancers, t he choice of the treatment after surgery mainly depends on the risk of recurrence. For patients with l ow risk of recurrence * (stage IA and grade 1 -2 tumor ), observation* is recommended. For patients with intermediat e risk of recurrence (either stage IB and grade 1 -2 tumors , or stage IA and grade 3 tumors): Observation* is also an option , but vaginal brachytherapy * can be proposed . Adjuvant p elvic * radiotherapy and chemotherapy* can be discussed when the patient is more than 60 years old, when a lymphovascular space invasion was found during the histological examination or when the tumor is large. For patients with high risk of recurrence (stage IB and grade 3 tumors): Adjuvant p elvic * radiotherapy * is recommended Adjuvant c hemotherapy* can be discussed when the patient is more than 60 years old, when a lymphovascular space invasion was found during the histological examination or when the tumor is large. Adjuvant * treatment for stage II cancer The options for patie nts with stage II cancer include : Adjuvant v aginal brachytherapy* , which is an internal type of radiotherapy* where the source of radiation is placed in the vagina. Adjuvant p elvic* radiotherapy* , which is an external type of radiotherapy* where radiatio ns are produced by an external source and then directed to the pelvis. Adjuvant c hemotherapy *, which is the use of anticancer drugs to kill cancer cells or limit their growth. It is not clear which combination of drugs are the most effective but they shoul d include one drug containing platinum (cisplatin * and carboplatin * are platinum containing drugs used in the treatment of endometrial cancer ). Vaginal brachytherapy* can only be used in patients with grade 1 -2 tumors with no lymphovascular invasion , and for which lymph nodes * were removed and were free of tumor cells according to the histological examination . When the lymph nodes* have not been checked for tumor cells during the surgery, both pelvic* radiotherapy* and vaginal brachytherapy* are recommend ed. Adjuvant c hemotherapy* may be considered alone or together with pelvic * radiotherapy *. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the risk of extra -pelvic recurrence* (spread of cancer outside Endometrial Cancer : a guide for patients - Information based on ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines - v.2012.1 Page 16 This document is provided by the Anticancer Fund with the permission of ESMO .

It is not clear which combination of drugs are the most effective but they should include one drug containing platinum (cisplatin * and carboplatin * are platinum containing drugs used in the treatment of endometrial cancer ). Treatment of advanced disease (stage III and IV) The treatment of advanced endometrial cancer usually includes combination of surgery, radiotherapy *, and chemotherapy *. In 5 -10% of patients with advanced endometrial cancer, it will not be possible to perform surgery due to medical contraindications. The se patients may be treated with external radiotherapy* (radiations produced by an external source and then directed to the tumor) and/or internal radiotherapy* called brachytherapy* (involves placing a source of radiation in the cavity of the uterus and/or vagina) , and additionally by s ystemic treatment *. Adjuvant * treatment for stage III cancer The adjuvant options for patients with operated stage III cancer include: Adjuvant v aginal brachytherapy* Adjuvant p elvic* radiotherapy* Adjuvant hemotherapy * Historically, p elvic* radiotherapy* and vaginal brachytherapy* were recommended after surgery for stage III patients. Now, t here is growing evidence tha t chemotherapy * should be administered to patients with stage III disease instead of or in addition t o radiotherapy . The optimal treatment should be discussed with doctors. Adjuvant c hemotherapy* should includ e one platinum containing drug (c isplatin * and carboplatin * are platinum containing drugs used in the treatment of endometrial cancer ). It should be noted that adjuvant radiotherapy* , both internal and external , protects against local tumor re -growth (in the pelvis). Chemotherapy* protects against the spread of the disease outside the pelvis. Treatment for stage IV endometrial cancer For patients with stage IV disease, the goal of the treatment after cytoreductive surgery is to act on cancer cells that are left in the body, in the pelvis or elsewhere (metastasis *). Postoperative radiotherapy * has effect locally in order to prevent tumor recurrence in the pelvis . A systemic treatment * acts on cancer cells all over the body and not only locally. Systemic treatment * may consist of chemotherapy * or hormon al therapy.

The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . Chemotherapy * drugs include platinum -based compounds, anthracyclines *, and taxanes *. Paclitaxel *-based combination regimens are preferred for first -line chemotherapy in patients with advanced endometrial cancer , because they have been shown to be more effective and better tolerated. The use of h ormon al therapy is reco mmended for endometrio id histolo gies only . It involves the use of drugs containing the hormone progesterone *. Tamoxifen * and aromatase * inhibitors are two other drugs that are also being used . Therapies administered to patients with advanced endometrial cancer should be indivi dualized to the needs, prognosis* and health status of each patient. Specificities of therapy* for papillary serous * and clear cell * tumors Papillary serous * and clear cell carcinomas* are cancers that are more aggressive , but less frequent than endome trioid carcinomas. They require complete staging with remov al of uterus, ovaries, ovarian tubes, pelvic * and para -aortic * lymph nodes *, as well as removal of appendi x*, biopsy * and removal of abdominal lining. Platinum -based adjuvant * chemotherapy * should be proposed for early (stage I and II) disease. Platinum -based chemotherapy is recommended in patients with stage III or IV disease. The same chemotherapy regimens usually employed for epithelial ovarian cancer can be considered in patients with advanced , or recurrent , papillary serous or clear cell uterine cancer. Papillary serous endometrial carcinomas are not considered as hormone responsive.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE TREATMENT S? Surgery Some risks are common for every surgical intervention performed under general anaesthesia*. These complications are unusual and include deep vein thrombosis *, heart or breathing problems, bleeding, infection, or reaction to the anaesthesia . The female reproductive organs are l ocated in the pelvis together with the lower urinary tract and the lower digestive tract. During the surgical intervention, the urinary tract and the intestines may be damaged. When lymph nodes* in the pelvis and along the aorta* are removed, it can damag e or block the lymph system resulting in lymphoedema, a condition where lymph fluid accumulates in the legs and makes them swell. It can occur right after the intervention , but also later. Having a hysterectomy * also increases the risk of urinary incontin ence and vaginal prolapse years after the surgical intervention, because it can damage or weaken the supporting pelvic* floor muscles. Women operated on before the menopause will experience symptoms of menopause quickly after the operation because of the removal of the ovaries. Hot flashes, mood swings, night sweats, vaginal dryness and trouble concentrating are frequent. Side effects can be relieved and advice should be provided by the specialists in oncology. Side effects of adjuvant * therapies The most frequent side effects of adjuvant therapies are usually reversible after treatment. Some strategies are available to prevent or relieve a certain range of these side -effects. This should be discussed upfront with doctors. Pelvic* radiotherapy* Side effects of external radiotherapy* to treat endometrial cancer are mainly due to the irradiation of the organs surrounding the uterus. Effects of radiation on the urinary tract include painful urination, bladder spasm s resulting in an urgent need to urinate, presence of blood in the urine, urinary tract obstruction, and ulceration or necrosis of the mucous membrane lining the bladder. Effects of radiation on the lower digestive tract include rectal discomfort, diarrhea, mucus and blood rectal discharge, and , rarely , perforation of the intestines. Vaginal narrowing is another possible late effect of pelvic* radiotherapy* . Treatment options for these post -radiation reactions should be advised by the oncologist. Modern techniques of external radiotherapy* such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy* (IMRT) are intended to reduce its toxicity. Intravaginal brachytherapy* The aforementioned side effects of external radiotherapy* can also appear with intravaginal brachytherapy* , but less frequently, since this type of radiotherapy* is better targeted. Vaginal Endometrial Cancer : a guide for patients - Information based on ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines - v.2012.1 Page 19 This document is provided by the Anticancer Fund with the permission of ESMO . The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . dryness is frequent during and after the treatment. Vaginal narrowing and dryness can also occur and can result in long -term sexual dysfunction. In young women radiation stops the ovarian function and this may resu lt in further vaginal dryness and sexual dysfunction. It may also result in a higher risk for osteoporosis and/or insufficiency fractures of pelvic* bones. Women must be under the care of a specialist for these problems. Chemotherapy* Side effects of chemotherapy* are very frequent. They will depend on the drug(s) administered, on the doses and on individual factors. If you have suffered from other problems (such as heart problems ) in the past, some precautions should be taken and/or adaptation of the t reatment should be made. Combination s of different drugs usually lead to more side effects than the use of a single drug. The most frequent side effects of the drugs used for chemotherapy* in endometrial cancer are hair loss and decreased blood cell count . Decreased blood cell count can result in anaemia, bleeding and infections. Once the chemotherapy* is over, the hair grows back and the blood cell count returns to normal. Othe r frequent side effects include : allergic reactions, such as flushing and ras h nerve problems affecting the hands and/or feet (peripheral neuropathy *), which can cause tingling feelings in the skin, numbness and/or pain temporary loss of or changes in your eyesight ringing in the ears or changes in your hearing low blood pressure nausea, vomiting and diarrhea inflammation of areas such as the lining of the mouth loss of sense of taste lack of appetite slow heart beat dehydration mild changes in nail and skin which soon disappear painful swelling and inflammation where the injection is given muscle or joint pain seizures tiredness Other les s frequent , but more serious side effects can occu r. These include especially, stroke, myocardial infarction and damage to the function of the kidneys and liver . Any of these symptom s should be rep orted to a doctor. Apart from these, each drug can also give different unwanted effects. The most common ones are listed below, although not everyone will have side effects, or get them to the same extent. Cisplatin * may lead to hearing loss, and to kid ney damage. The kidney function is assessed from blood tests before starting the treatment. To prevent damage it is very important to drink a lot of water during the treatment. Endometrial Cancer : a guide for patients - Information based on ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines - v.2012.1 Page 20 This document is provided by the Anticancer Fund with the permission of ESMO . The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . Doxorubicin can cause damage to the heart muscle, therefore the assessment of heart function is important before therapy with this drug. It can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight and cause reddening in areas where the patient has had radiotherapy * in the past. The urine may turn red or pink for a few days after treatment. This is not blood and is only due to the color of the medication. Paclitaxel * can cause a peripheral neuropathy * which is dependent upon the dose administered, the duration of the infusion, and the schedule of administration. Presenting symptom s include numbn ess, paresthesia * and burning pain in the hands and legs as if burning gloves and burning stockings were worn . Symptoms are often symmetrical, and usually have their origins distally in the lower extremities. Patients commonly report the simultaneous onset of symptoms in toes and fingers, but asymmetric presentations have been described too. Facial involvement is less common. Although mild symptoms have been reported to improve or resolve completely within several months after discontinuation of therapy, th e symptoms and deficits have been reported to persist longer in patients who develop severe neuropathy *. Docetaxel * sometimes causes fluid retention, temporary nail discoloration and an itchy skin rash. Some people also develop the palmar -plantar syndrome *, or simple numbness and tingling in hands and feet. About one in four patients will suffer from an all ergic reaction during the first or second infusion with docetaxel. Common side effects of topotecan * are constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain, tiredness, vomiting, and weakness. Severe side effects that occu r when using topotecan are severe allergic reactions, blue or unusually pale skin or nails, fever, chills, or persistent sore throat, painful or burning urination, persistent or severe cough, persistent or severe pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, persistent or severe stomach pain , or cramps, persistent or severe tiredness , or weakness, shortness of breath, unusual or unexplained bruising or bleeding, and yellowing of the eyes or skin. Hormon al therapy: Hormone therapy is associated to some side effects. They can be minor such as headaches, nausea and/or breast pain; or more serious such as blood clots in a vein of the legs (deep vein thrombosis *), blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus), heart problems , stroke and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding.

It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE TR EATMENT ? Follow -up* with doctors After the treatment has been completed, doctors will propose a follow -up* program consisting of consultations on a regular basis which aim to: detect possible recurrence* at an early stage evaluate treatment -related complications and manage them provide psychological support and information to enhance your return to normal life implement a surveillance schedule because there is an increased risk of breast, ovarian and colon cancer . This increased risk to develop other cancers is not true for every woman, but some women may be at increased risk, mainly because of some genetic factors and sometimes because of the treatments received. Patients should undergo follow -up* visits every 3 -4 months with physical and gynecological examination for the first 2 years, and then with a 6 month interval until 5 years. Further investigations can be performed , if clinically indicated. Return to normal life It can be hard to live with the idea that th e cancer can come back. From what is known today, no specific way of decreasing the risk of recurrence* after completion of the adjuvant * treatment can be recommended. As a consequence of the cancer itself and of the treatment, return to normal life may no t be easy for some people. Questions related to body image, sexuality, fatigue, work, emotions or lifestyle may b e of concern to you. Discussing these questions with relatives, friends or doctors may be helpful. Support from ex -patients' groups or telephon e info rmation services and helplines is available in many countries. What if the cancer comes back? If the cancer comes back, it is called a recurrence* and the treatment depends on the extent of the recurrence* . If the cancer comes back, it is usually w ithin the first 3 years following the initial treatment. The extension of the recurrence* should be fully evaluated by physical examination* , radiological examinations and blood tests. The majority of recurrences * for patients for whom the initial tumor was limited to the uterus , arise in the pelvis. The treatment options will depend on the extension of the recurrence* . Discussion of treatment options should be done in a multidisciplinary* meeting. Endometrial Cancer : a guide for patients - Information based on ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines - v.2012.1 Page 22 This document is provided by the Anticancer Fund with the permission of ESMO . The information in this document does not replace a medical consultation. It is for personal use only and cannot be modified , reproduced or disseminated in any way without written permission from ESMO and the Anticancer Fund . If cancer comes back as a pelvic * recurrence* , surger y, radiotherapy* and chemotherapy * are the options. If the recurrent tumor is located next to solid organs in the pelvis (central recurrence), it should be remove d by surgery whenever possible or treated with r adiotherapy. If the r ecurrence occurs in lymph nodes * located in the pelvis (regional recurrence), radiotherapy is the preferred option, with, if possible , chemo therapy. Radiotherapy* can only be considered for the treatment of the recurrence* if it was not given before. In fact, there is a maximal dose of radiotherapy that can be delivered and any previous radiotherapy has usually reached this maximal dose. However , external radiotherapy* can be given if only internal ( brachytherapy* ) was given before and vice versa. A paclitaxel *-based combinat ion regimen is preferred for first -line chemotherapy of recurrent disease . Endometrial cancer recurring after first -line chemotherapy is to a large degree resistant to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy d rugs showing a clinical benefit and good tolerance in such s ituation s are paclitaxel, and a combination of weekly topotecan * and docetaxel *. If cancer comes back as a recurrence* with metastasis* , options are chemotherapy* and hormon al therapy. Chemotherapy* can be proposed and considered after discussion in a multidisciplinary* meeting and discussion with the patient. Decisions should be taken after considering the expected benefits and side effects of chemotherapy* . A p aclitaxel *-based combination regimen is preferred as a first-line chemotherapy regimen . Endometrial cancer recurring after first -line chemotherapy is to a large degree resistant to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy d rugs showing a clinical benefit and good tolerance in such situation s are paclitaxel, and a combination of weekly topotecan * and docetax el*. Side effects of chemotherapy* are very frequent. These side effects have been described previously in the chapter , entitled 'What are the treatment options'. The main predictors of a good response in the treatment of metastatic * disease if the tumor is well - differentiated*, a long disease -free interval and the location and extent of extrapelvic (particularly pulmonary) metastases. Hormone therapy can be proposed to patients with grade 1 tumors and positive progesterone * receptor status. A progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate or megestrol), a type of drug that has the same effect as progesterone, or tamoxifen *, which counteracts the action of estrogens *, can be used. Side effects of hormone therapy are less frequent than those of radiotherapy* and chemotherapy* . Build -up of fluid causing swelling of the ankles, increase in appetite, and weight gain are the most common side effects of progestins. Other les s frequent but more serious side effects can occur. R Risk of blood clots (including clots in th e lung s), stroke and heart attack increase significantly . Any symptoms should be reported to your doctor.

DEFINITIONS OF DIFFIC ULT WORDS Adenocarcinoma Cancer that begins in cells that line certain internal organs and that have gland -like (secretory) prop erties . Adjuvant Adjuvant in cancer is a therapy that helps another therapy to reach its ultimate goal and reinforces its effect. For example radio or/and chemotherapy help a surgery to accomplish its goal of eliminating a cancerous tumor. In a context different to the oncological one, it can also be an agent added to vaccines to stimulate the immune system 's response to the antigen. Anaesthesia Reversible state of loss of awareness in which the patient feels no pain, has no normal reflexes, and responds less to stress . Anaesthesia is induced artificially by the employment of certain substances known as anaesthetics . It can be complete or partial and allows patients to undergo surgery. Anthracycline Antibiotic drug used in chemotherapy * to treat a wide range of cancers. Aorta The largest artery in the body. It carries oxygen -rich blood away from the heart to vessels that reach the rest of the body. Aromatase inhibitor A drug that prevents the formation of estradiol, a female hormone, by interfering with an aromatase enzyme. Aromatase inhi bitors are used as a type of hormone therapy for postmenopausal women who have hormone -dependent breast cancer. Bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes ( see picture) . Biopsy The removal of cells or tissues * for examination by a pathologist. The pathologist may study the tissue* under a microscope or perform other tests on the cells or tissue*. There are many different types of biopsy procedures. The most common types include: (1) incisional biopsy, in which only a sample of tissue* is removed; (2) excisional biopsy, in which an entire lump or suspicious area is removed; and (3) needle biopsy, in which a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle. When a wide needle is used, the procedure is called a core biopsy . When a thin needle is used, the procedure is called a fine -needle aspiration biopsy. Brachytherapy A type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters is placed directly into or near a tumor . Also called implant radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiation brachytherapy.

Carboplatin A drug that is used to treat advanced ovarian cancer that has never been treated or symptoms of ovarian cancer that has come back after treatme nt with other anticancer drugs. It is also used with other drugs to treat advanced, metastatic *, or recurrent non -small cell lung cancer and is being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer. Carboplatin is a form of the anticancer drug cisplatin * and causes fewer side effects in patients. It attaches to DNA in cells and may kill cancer cells. It is a type of platinum compound. Carcinosarcoma A malignant tumor that is a mixture of carcinoma (cancer of epithelial tissue, which is skin and tissue* that lines or covers the internal organs) and sarcoma * (cancer of connective tissue*, such as bone, cartilage and fat) . Chemotherapy A type of cancer treatment using drugs that kill cancer cells and/or limit their growth. These drugs are usually administe red to the patient by slow infusion into a vein but can also be administered orally, by direct infusion to the limb or by infusion to the liver, according to cancer location. Chest X-ray An X-ray of the structures inside the chest. An X-ray is a type of high -energy radiation that can go through the body and onto film, making pictures of areas inside the chest, which can be use d to diagnose disease Cisplatin A drug used to treat many types of cancer. Cisplatin contains the metal platinum. It kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA and stopping them from dividing. Cisplatin is a type of alkylating agent. Clear cell carcinoma A rare type of tumor, usually of the female genital tract, in which the insides of the cells look clear when viewed under a microscope. Also called clear cell adenocarcinoma * and mesonephroma . Clinical examination (or physical examination) An exam of the body to check for general signs of disease. Computerized tomography (CT-scan) A form of radiography in which body organs are scanned with X-rays and the results are synthesised by a computer to generate images of parts of the body. Also ca lled CT scan. Deep vein thrombosis The formation of a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg or lower pelvis. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the affected area. Also called DVT. Docetaxel Docetaxel belongs to the group of antica ncer medicines known as the taxanes *. Docetaxel blocks the ability of cells to destroy the internal 'skeleton' that allows them to divide and multiply. With the skeleton still in place, the cells cannot divide and they eventually die. Docetaxel also affect s non - cancer cells such as blood cells, which can cause side effects.

Estrogen A type of hormone made by the body that helps develop and maintain female sex characteristics and the growth of long bones. Estrogens can also be made in the laboratory. They m ay be used as a type of birth control and to treat symptoms of menopause, menstrual disorders, osteoporosis and other conditions. Follow -up Monitoring a person's health over time after treatment. This includes keeping track of the health of people who par ticipate in a clinical study or clinical trial for a period of time, both during the study and after the study ends . Gene expression profile Information about all messenger RNAs that are made in various cell types. A gene expression profile may be used to find and diagnose a disease or condition and to see how well the body responds to treatment. Gene expression profiles may be used in personalized medicine. Histological type The category in which a tumor is grouped, considering the characteristics of its cells and other structures under the microscope. Histopathology The study of diseased cells and tissues* using a microscope. Hypertension A blood pressure of 140/90 or higher. Hypertension usually has no symptoms. It can harm the arteries and cause an i ncrease in the risk of stroke, heart attack , kidney failure, and blindness. Also called high blood pressure. Hysterectomy Surgical procedure to remove the uterus and, sometimes, the cervix. If both the uterus and the cervix are removed, it is called total or simple hysterectomy. If only the uterus is removed, then it is called partial or supracervical hysterectomy. Radical hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus, cervix, and part o f the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, and nearby lymph nodes * may also be removed. Laparotomy A surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen. Lymph node A rounded mass of lymphatic tissue* that is surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue . Lymph nodes filter lymph (lymphatic fluid), and they store lymphocytes (white blood cells). They are located along lymphatic vessels. Also called lymph gland. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) An imaging technique that is used in medicine. It uses magnetic resonance. Sometimes a fluid is injected that enhances the contrast between different tissues * to make structures more clearly visible.

Metastasis The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. A tumor formed by cells that have spread is ca lled a metastatic tumor or a metastasis . The metastatic tumor contains cells that are like those in the original tumor. Multidisciplinary opinion A treatment planning approach in whi ch a number of doctors who are experts in different specialties (disciplines) review and discuss the medical condition and treatment options of a patient. In cancer treatment, a multidisciplinary opinion may include that of a medical oncologist (who provid es cancer treatment with drugs), a surgical oncologist (who provides cancer treatment with surgery), and a radiation oncologist (who provides cancer treatment with radiation ). Also ca lled tumor board review. Observation In medicine, watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Omentum A fold of the peritoneum* (the thin tissue* that lines the abdomen) that surrounds the stomach and other organs in the abdomen. Paclitaxel A drug used to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and AIDS -related Kaposi sarcoma *. It is also used together with another drug to treat non -small cell lung cancer. Paclitaxel is also being studied in the treatment of ot her types of cancer. It blocks cell growth by stopping cell division and may kill cancer cells. It is a type of antimitotic agent. Palmar -plantar syndrome A condition marked by pain, swelling, numbness, tingling, or redness of the hands or feet. It somet imes occurs as a side effect of certain anticancer drugs. Also called hand -foot syndrome or palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia. Papillary serous carcinoma An aggressive cancer the uterus/endometrium, peritoneum*, or ovaries .

Pelvic Having to do with the pelvis (the lower part of the abdomen located between the hip bones). Peripheral neuropathy A nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. It usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse o ver time. Peripheral neuropathy may be caused by physical injury, infection, toxic substances, disease (such as cancer, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition), or drugs, including anticancer drugs. Also called neuropathy.

Peritoneum The tissue* that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen. Progesterone Progesterone is a predominantly female sex hormone secreted by the ovaries and placenta. It takes care of the change in the e ndometrium in the second half of the menstrual cycle, preparing it for the implantation of a fertilized egg cell, the development of a placenta and the development of mammary glands. It may be used as a type of birth control and to treat menstrual disorder s, infertility, symptoms of menopause and other conditions. Prognosis The likely outcome or course of a disease; the chance of recovery or recurrence*. Radical hysterectomy Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallop ian tubes, and nearby lymph nodes * may also be removed (see picture). Hysterectomy *. The uterus is surgically removed with or without other organs or tissues*. In a total hysterectomy*, the uterus and cervix are removed. In a total hysterectomy* with sal pingo -oophorectomy, (a) the uterus plus one (unilateral) ovary and fallopian tube are removed; or (b) the uterus plus both (bilateral) ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. In a radical hysterectomy*, the uterus, cervix, both ovaries, both fallopian tub es, and nearby tissue* are removed. These procedures are done using a low transverse incision or a vertical incision. Radiotherapy A therapy in which radiation is used in the treatme nt of cancer always oriented to the specific area of the cancer.

Recurrence Cancer or disease (usually auto -immune) that has come back, usually after a period of time during which the cancer or disease was not present or could not be detected. This may ha ppen at the same location as the original (primary) tumor or to another location in the body. Also called recurrent cancer or disease. Sarcoma A cancer of the bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue*. Staging Performing exams and tests to determine the extent of the cancer within the body especially whether the disease has spread from the original site to other parts of the body. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan the best treatm ent. Systemic treatment/therapy Treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, reaching and affecting cells all over the body. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are examples of systemic therapy. Tamoxifen A drug used to treat certain types of breast cancer in women and men. It is also used to prevent breast cancer in women who have had ductal carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells in the ducts of the breast) and in women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer. Tamoxifen is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer. It blocks the effects of the hormone estrogen * in the breast. Tamoxifen is a type of antiestrogen. Also called tamoxifen citrate. Taxane A type of drug that blocks cell growth by stopping mitosis (cell di vision). Taxanes interfere with microtubules (cellular structures that help move chromosomes during mitosis). They are used to treat cancer. A taxane is a type of mitotic inhibitor and a type of antimicrotubule agent. Tissue A group or layer of cells that work together to perform a specific function. Topotecan Topotecan is an anticancer medicine that belongs to the group 'topoisomerase inhibitors'. It blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I, which is involved in the division of DNA. When the enzyme is blocked, the DNA strands break. This prevents the cancer cells from dividing and they eventually die. Total hysterectomy Surgery to remove the entire uterus, including the cervix. Also called complete hysterectomy. The ESMO / Anticancer Fund Guides for Patients are designed to assist patients, their relatives and caregivers to understand the nature of different types of cancer and evaluate the best available treatment choices. The medical information described in the Guides for Patients is based on the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines, which are designed to guide medical oncologists in the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment in different cancer types.These guides are produced by the the Anticancer Fund in close collaboration with the ESMO Guidelines Working Group and the ESMO Cancer Patient Working Group.
