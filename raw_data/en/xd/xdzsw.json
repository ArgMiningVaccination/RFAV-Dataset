R ecent research has suggested that the shift to new drugs may lower health care spending by reducing th e demand for hospitalizations and other health care services. Using a 20% sample of Medicaid recipients from the state of California for the 1993-2001 period, I investigate this hypothesis for antipsychotic drugs - the therapeutic category that has accounted for more government spending than any other during the past decade. Using three different identification strategies, my findings demonstrate that the 610% increase in Medicaid spending on antipsychotic drugs during the study period caused by the shift to three new treatments has not reduced spending on other types of medical care, thus undermining the hypoth esis that the drugs have \"paid for themselves.\" Because of data limitations the findings for health outcomes are necessarily more speculative but suggest that the new medications have increased the prev alence of diabetes while reducing the prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms among the mentally ill. 31. Introduction From 1996 to 2002, spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. grew at a 15% annual rate, with the $178 billion spent in 2002 accounting for more than 11% of all health care expenditures. This growth was mainly driven by an increase in the average price of a prescription, which rose by more than 10% per year from 1996 to 2001. Price increases were caused both by an increase in the price of existing drugs and by a shift to newly approved dr ugs, which tend to be more expens ive than the drugs that preceded them in the same therapeutic category (NIHCM, 2002). The growth in pharmaceutical spending has been similarly rapid within the federal-state Medicaid program, with expenditures there increasing from $12.3 billion in 1996 to $29.6 billion in 2002.1 State governments have differed in their response to the increase, with some requiring co-pays by Medicaid recipients, others introducing dispensing limits, and still others requiring physicians to obtai n prior authorization before prescribing drugs not on the state's formulary. Determining how optimally to respond - if at a ll - to the growth in Medicaid prescription drug spending is clearly a complicated problem. The pr ogram provides valuable insurance to millions of society's most disadvantaged individuals, covering the cost of more than 520 million prescriptions for nearly 47 million Medicaid recipients in 2002. But because Medicaid recipients typically do not share in the cost of their prescription drugs, the program distorts medical care purchase decisions, potentially leading a Medicaid recipient to select an expensive drug over a much cheaper alternative even if he/she is almost indifferent between the two. It is therefore plausible that - in some cases - a Medicaid recipient would derive a benefit from a drug treatment that is substantially lower than the cost to taxpayers.2 But as recent researchers have noted, the difference between two drug prices may not accurately reflect the difference in health care spending that w ould result if a patient were to choose one treatment over another (Lichtenberg, 1996, 2001). For example, a more expensive drug may deliver health benefits that reduce the patient's demand for other health care ser vices, to some extent offsetting its higher price. A similar offset effect could occur for individuals w ho otherwise would take no treatment. Even with no 1 Dollar figures cited here and elsewhere in the paper are adjusted to 2001 dollars using the CPI-U index. 2 This moral hazard effect is of course not unique to Medicaid. Individuals with other forms of health insurance also typically pay a small share (if any) of the costs of additional medical care. 4offset effect, a more expensive treatment may deliver h ealth or quality of life benefits that are sufficiently large to pass a cost-benefit test. In measuring the va lue of any drug treatment, one would like to know its effect on both spending and health, with these e ffects potentially varying across individuals. In this paper, I investigate the effect of ne w prescription drugs on both Medicaid spending and health outcomes. This question is inherently difficu lt given that drug treatment is not randomly assigned and because there are thousands of drugs covered by Medicaid at a point-in-time. Rather than simultaneously considering all of them, I focus on the one therapeutic category that accounts for more Medicaid spending than any other. Antipsychotic drug s are used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia and the Medicaid program spent $3.73 billion on them in 2002. Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel - three drugs that were approved by the FDA and entered the market during the mid-1990s - accounted for 88% of this spending. These three \"second-generation\" antipsychotics are substantially more expensive than the drug treatments that prec eded them and were numbe rs one, two, and four, respectively, among all prescription drugs in terms of 2002 Medicaid spending. To estimate the impact of these new drug treatments and the accompanying increase in prescription drug spending, I utilize complete claims and eligibility data for a 20% sample of Medicaid recipients from the state of California for the 1993-2001 period. I construct the initial sample by selecting the 37,369 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (the condition for which these drugs are most commonly prescribed) at some point during the nine-year study period. This long time period allows me to exploit changes in treatment patterns from a year when no schizophrenia patients were taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel until 2001, a year when nearly 70% were taking one of these drugs. There are two central challenges for reliable estima tion of the effect of these new drug treatments. The first is that drug treatments are not randomly assigned in the Medicaid program. Individuals who take a certain drug are likely to differ systematically from their counterparts who do not. While many of these differences are likely to be observable, some may not be, and this unobser ved heterogeneity could lead to biased estimates. To surmount this obstacle, I employ three strategies to estimate the effect of 5second-generation antipsychotics. None of these me thods is free from potential biases, but because each one has different limitations it can act as a check on the other two to gauge the robustness of the results. The second main challenge for this study is that the Medicaid data will provide an incomplete picture of health for individuals in the sample. Fo llowing previous studies, I focus on the prevalence of adverse side effects when investigating whether the new drugs have influenced health. Earlier research has found that second-generation antipsychotics im prove health by reducing the prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in cluding involuntary movements, tremors, and body restlessness (Kerwin, 1994; Leucht et al, 1999). A number of re cent studies suggest that the new drugs may reduce health by increasing the prevalence of diabetes and related illnesses (Sernyak et al, 2002; Lindenmayer et al, 2001). But both sets of results are controversial, with some finding no impact of second-generation antipsychotics on EPS (Rosenheck et al, 2003) and ot hers no effect on diabetes (Kabinoff et al, 2003). My first identification strategy examines changes statewide in outcome variables of interest as the new medications are used by an increasing fraction of individuals with schizophrenia. This analysis demonstrates that the diffusion of second-generation antip sychotics has been associ ated with a substantial increase in prescription drug spending but no apparent reduction in spending on other health care services. This also holds true in those periods when there is a sharp break in trend in the diffusion rate of the new drugs. The increase in the use of these drugs was assoc iated with a decline in the measured prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms but also with an in crease in the fraction diagnosed with diabetes. Of course, a trend analysis for just one geogra phic area suffers from the difficulty that factors other than antipsychotic treatments th at may influence the outcome variables of interest are changing over time. To control for these potential confounders, I ne xt exploit variation across geographic areas in the rate at which second-generation drugs diffuse. My findings using this strategy demonstrate that the areas in which the utilization of second-generation drugs incr eased relatively rapidly had substantially larger increases in Medicaid spending and a significantly greater increase in the measured prevalence of diabetes than those areas with relatively little use of the new treatments. On the plus side, my findings here 6suggest that increases in the use of these drugs have been associated with a modest reduction in the prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms, though the estimates are not statistically significant. An important limitation to this second strategy is that some of the variation across geographic areas in the rate at which the new treatments diffuse may be driven by changes in health or other factors that could lead to biased estimates of the effect of the new treatments. Thus my third method utilizes an instrumental variables strategy with individual-level da ta that exploits variation across psychiatrists in the propensity to prescribe second-gene ration antipsychotics. This method controls for differences across psychiatrists in the baseline characteristics of their pa tients and aims to estimate the effect of the new drug treatments for marginal patients - individuals who would take the drug when paired with certain psychiatrists but not with others. The findings here demonstrate that psychiat rists have a substantial effect on the probability that a schizophrenia patient takes a second-generation drug and that the new treatments significantly increase Medicaid spending for the marginal patient. Taken together, the findings presented in this pa per suggest that second-generation antipsychotics did not reduce spending on other types of medical ca re. This finding undermines the hypothesis that the new drugs - which are several times more expensive th an first-generation antipsychotics - to some extent paid for themselves. The findings for health outcom es are less clear-cut because there appear to be both positive and negative effects and because health is not perfectly measured in the Medicaid data. 2. Background and Previous Research Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating mental illness that afflicts nearly 2 million individuals in the U.S. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, cognitive impairments, and social withdrawal. While there is no known cure for schizophrenia, patient symptoms often improve in response to treatment with anti psychotic drugs. Until 1990 , physicians typically prescribed haloperidol or some other \"first-generati on\" antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia. While these drugs were often e ffective in treating th e symptoms of schizophrenia, one important disadvantage was their side effect profile. Patients taking the drugs frequently experienced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) that could incl ude tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements), 7Parkinsonism (tremors and rigidity), akathisia (rest lessness), acute dystonia (muscle contractions), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (cha nges in heart rate or breathing). Treatment patterns began to change in 1990 followi ng the FDA's approval of Clozaril, the first in a line of \"second-generation\" antipsychotics that app eared to reduce the prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms while treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (Lamberg, 1998; Keefe et al, 1999; Meltzer et al, 1999). Though Clozaril was found to have ser ious side effects of its own that limited its use to schizophrenia patients who could no t tolerate other drugs, the shift to second-generation antipsychotics accelerated following the introduction of Risperdal in 1994, Zyprexa in 1996, and Seroquel in 1997. These latter three drugs were several times more expe nsive than haloperidol a nd other first-generation drugs and quickly became the most commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. A. Previous Research A number of previous studies have investigat ed the relationship between the use of second- generation antipsychotics and total h ealth care spending. The findings from these studies are mixed, with some suggesting that the drugs reduce expenditures (Glazer and Johnstone, 1997) and others finding the opposite (Coley et al, 1999). As a recent review ar ticle notes (Hudson et al, 2003) the findings from most of the previous studies are not conclusive because of small sample sizes, short time periods, imputed data, or other design limitations. An even larger body of research has examined the effect of second-generation antipsychotics on the prevalence of adverse side eff ects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, diabetes, abnormal weight gain, et al, 2001; Meyer, 2001; Sernyak et al, 2002). Taken together, these studies suggest that second-generation drugs have fewer adverse extrapyramidal side effects than the earlier drugs but that they may increase the pr evalence of diabetes and related illnesses. 3 Both sets of results are controversial, however, with some finding no impact of second-generation antipsychotics on EPS (Rosenheck et al, 2003) and others no effect on diabetes (Kabinoff et al, 2003). 3 It is important to note that the magnitude of these estimates vary substantially across studies and across drugs. 8 One prominent recent study compared the eff ect on both health outcomes and health care spending of haloperidol and Zyprexa, the most commonly prescribed first and second-generation drugs, respectively (Rosenheck et al, 2003). The study enrolled 309 schizophrenia patients insured by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and randomized each person to haloperidol or Zyprexa for up to one year. A wide set of outcome measures were cons idered, including cognitive functioning, quality of life, adverse side effects, and health care spending. The findings from this study suggest that Zyprexa did not lower hospitalization rates or other types of hea lth care utilization. Because of this and given the substantial difference in the cost of these two dr ugs, spending for individuals taking Zyprexa was substantially higher than for those in the haloperido l group. The authors also found little evidence to suggest that Zyprexa increased compliance, reduced th e prevalence of adverse side effects, or improved quality of life. The findings did suggest that Zyprex a reduced the prevalence of akathasia (restlessness) and led to modest improvements in cognitive functioni ng but also found that individuals taking this drug were more likely to gain a substantial amount of weight, potentially increasing their risk for diabetes. While this study and pr evious ones using a randomized r esearch design have made important contributions to knowledge, there are a number of limitations that motivate the current study. First, randomized studies are well-suited to estimating the averag e effect of a drug but are unable to estimate its effect on the marginal patient. The distinction be tween these two causal parameters has been emphasized in economics4 but cannot be explored in the typical randomized study of alternative health care treatments. As previous authors have noted (McClellan et al, 1994), it is this marginal effect that may be more relevant when forecasting the eff ect of alternative policy interventions. Second, most randomized studies have small sample sizes with which it is difficult to obtain sufficient precision for a skewed outcome variable such as health care spending. The main reason for this is cost - randomized studies are very expensive to admi nister - and thus the ones that consider costs often have wide confidence intervals. A third limitation of most randomized studies is their focus on just two 4 See, for example, many of the studies that estimate the return to schooling summarized in Card (2003). 9drugs. Though the Rosenheck study does consider the most common first and second-generation drugs, these two currently account for less than one -third of antipsychotic prescriptions. An additional limitation of randomized studies is that they are often tightly controlled. Individuals may be much less likely to adhere to a treatment regimen in real-world settings. Similarly, randomized studies usually follow individuals for just a short time, with the maximum duration typically equal to one year. A sixth limitation is that they often focus on a small subset of individuals who are possible candidates for a drug. In the case of the Ro senheck study, only males in their forties who had recently been hospitalized were considered. And one final limitation of randomized studies is that individuals can choose not to participate. Wh ile the Rosenheck study successfully enrolled 309 individuals, there were 1530 who either refused to par ticipate or whose clinicians would not allow them to join the study. If the individuals who enroll in a study are substantially different from those who choose not to participate then the estim ates may not apply for this other group.5 B. Medicaid and the Market for Antipsychotic Drugs From 1996 to 2002, Medicaid spending in the U.S. on prescription drugs increased by 141% from $12.3 billion to $29.6 billion. This growth far outp aced Medicaid spending on other health care services, which increased by just 29% during this same period . In both years, spending for drugs used to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders was great er than for any other therapeutic category. Within the CNS therapeutic category, antipsyc hotic drugs accounted for 51% of the $7.34 billion in 2002 Medicaid spending. During the 1996-2002 pe riod, Medicaid spending on antipsychotic drugs grew at a 25% annual rate, with most of this e xpenditure growth explained by an increase from $61 to $171 in the average price of an tion. Zyprexa, Risperdal, and Seroquel accounted for 88% of U.S. Medicaid spending on antipsychotic drugs in 2002 and were ranked first, second, and fourth, respectively, in terms of total Medicaid spending among all prescription drugs in that same year. 5 An additional issue with previous studies (both randomized and other) in this area is that a large fraction of them were funded by one of the three ph armaceutical companies th at produce the new second-generation drugs. 10One interesting feature of this category of drugs is the importance of Medicaid. While this program paid for 18% of all prescriptions filled in the U.S. in 2002, the corresponding share for antipsychotic drugs was nearly 75% (Duggan, 2003). Given this high Medicaid market share, the current study's focus on beneficiaries of this program is not as limiting as it might otherwise be. 3. The Medicaid Sample and the Diffusion of Second-Generation Antipsychotic Drugs A. The Medicaid Claims and Eligibility Data To estimate the effect of second-generation an tipsychotic drugs on health care spending and health outcomes, I use an administrative data set constructed by the California Department of Health Services (DHS) that contains all Medicaid claims an d detailed eligibility data for a random 20% sample of California residents with at least one month of Medicaid eligibility between January of 1993 and December of 2001.6 There are 2.92 million individuals in the sample, implying that approximately 14.6 million Californians were eligible for the program in one or more months during this nine-year period. The annual Medicaid eligibility files contain demogr aphic information for each individual in the sample, including gender, month and year of birth, r ace/ethnicity, and zip code of residence. The file provides Medicaid eligibility information for each of the twelve months during the year and also contains month-by-month information on the individual's aid code , which reports whether th e person is eligible for Medicaid through welfare, Supplemental Security Inco me (SSI), or some other government program. Additionally, there are two variables in each month that indicate whether an individual is eligible for Part A or Part B of the Medicare program. Many Medicaid recipients are dually eligible for Medicare because of their receipt of social security benefits. Finally , the eligibility data indicate whether each recipient is enrolled in a managed care plan and if so provides the plan number. 7 In a typical year, the Medicaid claims data for the 20 percent sample contain more than 30 million claims. These include every fee-for-service payment ma de on behalf of individuals in the sample while they are eligible for Medicaid. Each claim include s the individual's Medicaid identifier, which can be 6 DHS sampled by individual rather than by eligibility spe ll when constructing these files. Thus if one person has multiple spells of eligibility during this nine-year period every spell would be included. 7 Though the utilization data will be incomplete for manage d care recipients, a file with capitation rates by aid code, plan number, and month can be used to calculate Medicaid managed care spending for them (Duggan, 2004). 11matched to the eligibility files. Ther e are three main types of claims in the data. Inpatient claims include detailed information about admissions to hospitals and long-term care facilities. Outpatient and other ambulatory claims have similar data about payments to physicians, c linics, hospital outpatient facilities, laboratories, and other health care providers. Fi nally, prescription drug claims provide a drug code - which can be linked to a companion file to determ ine the drug and dosage amount - as well as the number of units dispensed for each prescription. The claims data include all fee-for-service payments made in the ten-year period from January of 1993 until December of 2002, though because there is often a lag in processing the claims the current study will focus on th e nine-year period ending in December of 2001. B. The Analysis Sample and the Shift to Second-Generation Antipsychotics Following previous work (Frank et al, 2003), th e current study uses diagnosis codes from the Medicaid claims data to determine whether an individual has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.8 Selecting Medicaid recipients with one or more schi zophrenia claims during the nine-year study period yields a sample of 37,369 individuals from the full 20 percent sample. Individuals ever residing in one of the seven counties that moved to a county organized health system in this period are dropped because the claims data would be incomplete for them. The fi nal sample consists of 32,072 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia at least once between January of 1993 and December of 2001. There is substantial variation across individuals in the number of schizophren ia claims, with 9.1% of the sample having just one schizophrenia claim while 7.1% of the sample has 500 or more claims during the study period.9 From 1993 to 2001, there were substantial chang es in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic illness. Table 1 lists the ten most commonly prescrib ed antipsychotics in the full 20% Medicaid sample in 1993 and in 2001,10 with the table providing both the number of prescriptions and the average amount spent per prescription. As the table shows, the firs t-generation drugs haloperidol and thioridazine were the most commonly prescribed antipsychotics in 1993. Eight years later the top selling drugs were 8 The data uses the ICD-9 coding system, and thus a diagnosis code that begins with 295 represents schizophrenia. Prescription drug claims do not have a diagnosis code though virtually all of the inpatient and outpatient claims do. 9 The results presented below are not sensitive to dropping individuals with just one claim. 10 In 1993 59% of these prescriptions are written for individuals in the schizophrenia sample while in 2001 that number is slightly higher at 62%. The most common prescription provides a one-month supply. 12Zyprexa and Risperdal, with Seroquel number three in terms of total spending and four with respect to total prescriptions. These three drugs were not availa ble in 1993 but accounted for more than 58% of all antipsychotic prescriptions and 86% of spe nding on antipsychotic drugs by 2001. C. The Causal Effect of Second-Generation Drugs Before proceeding to the empirical analyses, it is useful to define the structural parameters of interest for estimating the effect of second-generati on antipsychotics. Define for patient j a set of K potential outcomes for variable Y (e.g. Medicaid spending) in period t, with these outcomes representing the values of Y that would result in response to treatme nt with each of K possible drug treatments. For simplicity set K equal to 3, with the three possibl e treatments being a second-generation antipsychotic, a first-generation drug, or no drug treatment. This simplification captures the difference across these three categories rather than within each category.11 The effect of a second-generation drug relative to no drug treatment for individual j in period t is defined to equal j0t = Y j2t - Y j0t and the corresponding effect relative to a first generation drug is j1t = Y j2t - Y j1t. Both parameters are indexed by j and t to capture the fact that the effect may vary across individuals or within a person over time. Which of the two parameters is relevant for j will depend on whether he/she would otherw ise take a first-generation drug or no drug at all. The two parameters can be incorporated into the following equation for Y jt as follows: jt tj tj jt tj tj jt First Second Y Y *) ( * )1(1 0 0 0 + + = with First jt and Second jt equal to indicator variables that are set to one if individual j takes a first or second-generation drug in period t, respectively, and zero otherwise. The challenge for reliable identification is that only one of the three potential outcomes is ever observed for individual j in period t. If drug treat ment were randomly assigned then one could obtain an unbiased estimate for the average effect of the drug simply by calculating differences in the sample means. But with observational data one must account for the fact that treatment is not random and thus 11 It would be straightforward to expand the measures of potential outcomes to allow for variation within a drug category and for outcomes to depend on both current and past treatment decisions. 13may be correlated with both observable and unob servable determinants of the potential outcomes Y j0t, Yj1t, and Y j2t. If not properly accounted for, this could bias any estimate of the effect of the new drugs. 4. Time-Series Trends in Spending, Utilization, and Health Outcomes In this section, I investigate whether trends in average measures of Medicaid spending, utilization, and health appear to be affected by sh arp changes in the use of Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel, three drugs approved by the FDA in the mid-1990s.12 Each column of Table 2 includes average annual measures of more than 30 variables for Medicaid recipients with one or more schizophrenia claims in each year. One obvious concern with any examination of statewide trends is that the characteristics of individuals in the sample may change over time. Th e first six rows provide average characteristics for Medicaid recipients diagnosed with schizophrenia in each year to explore this issue. As is clear from the table, these averages remain fairly stab le and to the extent that there ar e changes, they are gradual. For example, the percentage of schizophrenia patients who are male increases by an almost equal amount from 1993 to 1997 (53.4% to 54.9%) as from 1997 to 2001 (54.9% to 56.5%).13 Additionally the number diagnosed with schizophrenia at least once during the year does not change much from one year to the next, ranging from a low of 12,114 in 1994 to a high of 14,083 in 2001. It is therefore unlikely that there are any substantial changes in the characteristics of schizophrenia patient s that coincide with the sharp changes in the use of Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel summarized in the next section. A. A Discontinuous Change in the U se of Second-Generation Antipsychotics Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1 provide information on the number of individuals taking any of the three major second-generation antipsychotics for the first time in each quarter.14 The first prescription for Risperdal in the sample was filled in late January of 1994. In the first quarter of 1994, there are 584 individuals in the sample who take Risperdal for the first time, with this number increasing to 878 in the second quarter. The number of new patients declines substa ntially in the next quarter, and is close to200 12 I do not consider the second-generation drug Clozaril because it is recommended only for treatment-resistant patients and because it was first used more than two years before the beginning of my study period. 13 The trends summarized in this section are almost identical if I exclude the 15% of schizophrenia patients with one or more months in a managed care plan during the nine-year study period. 14 A person can appear in this table only once - thus if he/she takes Risperdal in 1994, Zyprexa in 1996, and Seroquel in 1997, only the first Risperdal pr escription would count in this table. 14per quarter for the next two years. Thus the numbe r of individuals in the sample with one or more Risperdal prescriptions in each quarter increases only gradually during this period (Figure 2) after the initial increase in early 1994. The first Zyprexa pr escription appears in the Medicaid data in early October of 1996, shortly after the FDA approval in September of that same year. As a result of this, there is a significant increase in the number of individuals taking either drug for the first time, which grows to 457 by the third quarter of 1997. And as Figure 2 dem onstrates, there is a slight acceleration in trend in the number of individuals with a current prescription for a second-generation drug. A much sharper break in trend occurs in the fourth quarter of 1997. As Figure 1 and Appendix Table 1 demonstrate, the number of Medicaid recipi ents in the sample taking a second-generation drug for the first time increases from 457 to 1513, with the num ber of new entrants remaining above 1000 for the next three quarters. This increase was mainly caused by a state regulation that eased restrictions on prescribing second-generation antipsychotics. This increase in the number newly taking a second-generation antipsychotic translated into a sharp break in trend in the number of people taking one of the three drugs in each quarter, which more than dou bled from 2849 to 5950 in just three quarters. B. Did Other Health Care Spending Decline? This sharp and substantial break in trend in the use of these three second-generation drugs provides an excellent opportunity to gauge their short-te rm effect on several outcome variables of interest. If second-generation drugs reduced the demand for hospita l care and other health care services, one would expect to detect a decline in spending on schizophren ia-related services in the fourth quarter of 1997 or shortly thereafter. Figure 3 compares quarterly data for spending on antipsychotic drugs in the Medicaid sample with total (non-drug) spending for all car e with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. As this figure shows, there is no apparent dec line in spending on schizophrenia-related services, which continued on a gradual upwar d trend following the sharp increase in spending on antipsychotic drugs. Because the number of individuals diagnosed w ith schizophrenia is not changing much during the study period, this trend looks almost identical if one instead summarizes costs on a per-patient rather than an aggregate basis. It is of course possible that othe r factors were changing in this same quarter, but the 15fact that there is no detectable decline in sp ending on schizophrenia-relate d services undermines the hypothesis that the new treatments s ubstantially lowered other spending. An alternative way to examine this issue is to compare the change in spending on antipsychotic drugs with the initial level of sp ending on schizophrenia-relate d inpatient and outpatient care. From the first quarter of 1993 until the final quarter of 2001, sp ending on antipsychotic drugs for individuals in the sample increased by 610% - from $1.9 million to $13.4 million,15 with this growth almost entirely driven by the shift to the three new antip sychotic drugs. The $11.5 million increase is just slightly smaller than the $12.7 million in total (non-drug) schizophrenia spending in the first quarter of 1993. Thus to a first approximation the new drugs would have needed to lower inpatient and outpatient schizophrenia spending by more than 90% of the initial leve l to have reduced total health care spending. A wider set of outcome variables is summarized in Table 2. Rows (7) through (12) provide annual averages for two categories of drug spending (antipsychotic and all other), three categories of non-drug spending (schizophrenia, other mental health , and all other diagnoses) , and total spending for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in each year . Consistent with the quarterly data described above, there is no decline in average spending on inpatie nt or outpatient care in the latter half of the study period. If anything, it appears that there is a trend increase in average inpatient and outpatient spending, which actually declined by 3.1% from 1993 to 1997 but then increased by 21.7% during the subsequent four years. As a result of this increase and the accompanying growth in pharmaceutical expenditures, the growth rate of Medicaid spending fo r individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia increased from just 1.6% per year from 1993 to 1997 to a 9.3% annual rate dur ing the 1997 to 2001 period. This strongly suggests that the diffusion of second-generati on antipsychotics, which accelerated beginning in the last quarter of 1997, has substantially increased health care spendi ng for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Rows (13) through (18) summarize changes in the utilization of antipsychotic drugs in the sample of schizophrenia patients. As row (17) demonstrates , nearly 70% were taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or 15 This increase is larger than the one implied by Table 2 because it considers spending for those diagnosed with schizophrenia in any year while Table 2 only includes spending for individuals with a diagnosis in a particular year. 16Seroquel in 2001. This increase in the utilization of second-generation drugs coincided with a much smaller increase in the utilization of any antipsych otic treatment, with 77% of schizophrenia patients taking one or more antipsychotic prescriptions in 199 3 and this number increasing to 87% by the end of the study period. It therefore appears that most of the individuals taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel would otherwise be taking a fi rst-generation antipsychotic rather than no drug treatment. Rows (19) through (24) list average measures of inpatient utilization among individuals in the schizophrenia sample. The first two variables summa rize hospital utilization while the next two describe the use of intermediate or long-term care facilities. As the final two rows demonstrate, the use of inpatient care did not change substantially during th e study period. In 1993, approximately 37% of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spent one or more days in a hospital or long-term care facility and this fraction increased slightly to 38% by 2001. Similarly, the average number of inpatient days remained virtually unchanged, declining from 26.7 to 26.5. Similar trends emerge if one examines inpatient care for schizophrenia separ ately, with very little change during the nine-year study period. Rows (25) through (30) examine changes in th e prevalence of two sets of side effects that previous studies suggest may be affected by the use of second-generation antipsychotics. To estimate the prevalence of each condition, I simply calculate the frac tion of individuals with one or more inpatient or outpatient claims with a primary diagnosis of each illness. 16 This approach is admittedly imperfect, as some individuals may have a certain illness but it may not be coded on a claim. The trends summarized in Table 2 suggest that the prevalence of diabetes and related illnesses have increased substantially during the study period. As rows (28) through (30) show , the measured prevalence of tardive dyskenesia and other extrapyramidal symptoms declines substan tially beginning from 1997 to 1998. These trends are consistent with the findings from earlier studies - that second-generation drugs reduce the prevalence of EPS but may actually increase the prevalence of diabetes and related illnesses. 17 16 The diagnosis codes used for each of these side effect s are as follows: diabetes ( 250, 362, 3572 , parkinsonian symptoms (332), and other EPS (333 excluding 33382). 17 It is worth noting that the prevalence of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal weight gain did increase among other Medicaid recipients as well. But a comparison of changes in the schizophrenia sample with other Medicaid 17The final three rows summarize exit rates from the Medicaid program for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. The first two rows summari ze the fraction of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia during the year who died during the current year or in the subsequent year. There is no obvious change in this mortality rate from 1997 forward. Interestingly, the rate at which individuals exit the program for other reasons does appear to decline substantially following the sharp increase in the use of second-generation drugs. If these drugs increased the rate at which individuals returned to the workforce and increased their earnings, one w ould actually expect the opposite effect. The statewide trends summarized in this section shed some light on the effect of second- generation antipsychotic drugs. Most strikingly, the absence of a decline in spending on other types of medical care following the sharp increase in the fraction taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel undermines the hypothesis that the new drugs to some extent paid for themselves. 5. Variation across Geographic Areas in the Di ffusion of Second-Generation Antipsychotics One limitation of the analysis from the preceding section is that other factors may have been changing at the same time that the utilization of sec ond-generation drugs exhibite d a sharp increase. If these other factors also influence outcome variables of interest then an examination of trends could provide a misleading picture of the effect of the new tr eatments. In an effort to control for this potential source of bias, the current section exploits variation acr oss areas in the rate at which Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel diffused. As previous researchers have noted, there exist substantial differences across geographic areas in the use of health care treatments that cannot be explained by health differences alone (Skinner and Wennberg, 2000). If similar variati on exists for second-generation drugs, one can investigate whether areas in which the new treatment s penetrated relatively quickly had significantly different changes in outcomes variables of interest by estimating specifications of the following type: zt t z zt zt zt AnyRZS X Y \u00b5 ++ + + += )2( recipients that controls for age, gend er, race, and other factors demonstrates that the increase has been significantly greater for schizophrenia patients. Because of space limitations these results are not reported here. 18In this equation, z indexes geographic areas and t indexes time periods, while Yzt, Xzt, and AnyRZS zt represent changes in the outcome variable, other expl anatory variables, and th e use of the three new drugs, respectively, from period t-1 to period t in area z. The parameter captures the average change in Y that is associated with a one-unit change in the use of Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel. If the variation in the use of the new treatment s is not systematically related with unobserved factors that influence the outcome variable of interest and if the effect of second-generation drugs does not vary across individuals, then the parameter would provide an unbiased estimate for the effect of this treatment on the outcome variable Y. It is of c ourse plausible that the variation across areas in the diffusion of the drugs is not strictly exogenous. For example, certain areas may exhibit a larger increase in the use of second-generation drugs simply because a larger fraction of their schizophrenia patients experience a decline or an improvement in health. If true and if these changes are not adequately captured in the Xzt variables, then the parameter estimate for would be biased. Recognizing that there is no way to rule out this type of endogeneity, I aim to minimize its potential effect by focusing on market areas with a large number of patients. This reduces the likelihood that random changes in individual-level health would l ead to substantial variation in the utilization of drug treatments. I consider the four-digit zip code rather than the county b ecause these areas are much more similar in population within the state of Califor nia and more likely to approximate a health care market. I include the 70 four-digit zipcodes with 50 or more Medicaid schizophr enia patients in 1993 and then follow these same patients fo r the subsequent eight years.18 The average distance from one Medicaid recipient to another within these four-digit zipcodes is 5.8 miles and the median distance is 4.1 miles.19 I focus only on those diagnosed in 1993 to obtain a b aseline of spending and utilization for each individual and thus reduce the likelihood of composition bias. A dditionally, I pair each individual with their 1993 zip code because future residential decisions could be influenced by changes in treatment or in health. 18A similar analysis at the county level would include just 24 counties with Los Angeles and San Diego together accounting for more than 50% of the observations. The maximum share for any four-digit zipcode is just 5.9%. 19 I calculate these distances using the exact longitu de and latitude of the center of each zipcode. 19And finally, I drop the 16% of Medicaid recipients in the sample with one or more months in a managed care plan during the nine-year study period because th e utilization data will be incomplete for them. In the first year that Risperdal was available, there was substantial variation across geographic areas in the probability that Medicaid- eligible schizophrenia patients used this drug. For example, 29% of the 149 patients in one four-digit zip code were using this drug, while less than 0.6% of the 180 patients in three low-utilization areas had one or more prescrip tions filled for it. Of the 70 selected market areas with more than 50 schizophrenia patients, 18 had l ess than 5% utilization of this new drug while 11 had more than 15%. It is indeed implausible that this heterogeneity is entirely driven by differential health shocks. Much of it may be driven by differences in the level of health across areas, but by taking first- differences in the regressions I control for time-invarian t differences across areas. Additionally, I include zip code-specific effects in one-half of the first-di fference specifications, which controls for differential trends in spending, utilization, or health across areas. In Table 3 I summarize the results from specificati ons analogous to (2) with variables defined at the four-digit zipcode-year level. Each regression cont rols for changes in the fr action of patients who are dually eligible for Medicare, the average number of e ligible months, and the fraction of the initial 1993 sample that is still eligible for Medicaid. These speci fications also include year fixed effects and control for changes in the age, gender, and race of schizophrenia patients.20 The explanatory variable of interest is Any RZS , which is equal to the change in the fraction of individuals in the fou r-digit zipcode with one or more prescriptions for Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel. As the results in the first column demonstrate, increases in the use of second-generation drugs are significantly positively related with changes in expenditur es. In this column the dependent variable is the change in the log of average Medicaid spending. Th e results suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in the use of antipsychotic drugs is associated with a 4.7% increase in average Medicaid spending. 21 The estimate is virtually identical when I include zipc ode-specific fixed effects. The next two columns 20 Each regression includes 12 age-gender interactions (with age groups 0-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, and 65 plus) and four race variables (wh ite, black, Hispanic, missing race). 21 The analogous estimate from a county-le vel regression is quite similar at .500 with a standard error of .234. 20summarize the relationship with average Medicaid spe nding, and suggest that this increases by $487 in response to a ten percentage point increase in the use of Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel. This would translate into an effect of approximately $5000 pe r patient shifted to one of the three second-generation drugs, which is within the range of estimates from the randomized study cited above (Rosenheck, 2003). In the next two specifications I investigate the re lationship between changes in the use of second- generation drugs and the probability that an individu al is hospitalized or admitted to a long-term care facility. If the new drugs reduce the use of inpatient care, one would expect to find a negative coefficient on the parameter of interest. Instead one finds th e opposite - changes in the use of second-generation drugs are positively related with cha nges in the probability of staying one or more nights in a health care facility. Specifically, a 10% increase in the use of second-generation drugs is associated with a 0.87% increase in the fraction of schizophrenia patients who ar e hospitalized and this first estimate is significant at the ten percent level. One concern with this estimate is that it may be driven by an omitted variable. For example, individuals may switch to a new drug after a hospitalization, which was itself caused by a change in their demand for medical care. To gauge the importance of this possible source of bias, I determine the date that each individual first took Risp erdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel (if ever) and explore how individuals' health care utilization changes in the days leading up to their first prescription by estimating specifications of the following type: jt =+ += 11)3( In this regression, ANYIP jt is an indicator variable that is equal to one if individual j stayed overnight in a hospital or other health care facility on day t and zero otherwise. The variable FIRST jt is equal to one if individual j's first prescription for a second-generatio n drug occurs on day t and zero otherwise. The PRE and POST variables are simply leads and lags for this day of the first treatment. This regression also includes individual fixed effects to control for diffe rences across patients in the use of inpatient care. In the specifications summarized in Table 4, the unit of observation is the person-day. I use utilization data for the fifty days before and the fift y days after each individual's first prescription for a 21second-generation drug and thus have 101 observations for each individual. There are 22,613 individuals in the schizophrenia sample who take Zyprexa, Ri sperdal, or Seroquel at least once on or before November 11, 2001 (with this end date selected so that I would have 50 or more post days) and thus there are 2,283,913 person-day observations in each regressi on. The results summarized in column (1) suggest that there is a significant increase in the use of inpatie nt care in the days leading up to an individual's first prescription for one of these new drugs. Specifically, an individual is 9.2 percentage points more likely to be in the hospital two to five days before the fi rst prescription than they were 40 days earlier. The magnitude of the coefficient estimates declines quick ly from just before to just following the first prescriptions, suggesting that individuals often fill their first prescription upon leaving the hospital. The coefficient estimate of .092 from the person-day regression suggests that the two estimates of .087 from the zip code-year regressions are primarily driven by the increase in inpatient care preceding the first prescription for a second-generation drug. But th e fact that the estimates are almost identical also suggests that - for the remaining 90% of individuals w ho were not hospitalized just days before their first prescription - there was not a substantial declin e in the likelihood of being hospitalized. In the next two columns of Table 3, I inves tigate whether the increase in the use of second- generation drugs was associated with a change in the me asured prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects. In this regression, the dependent vari able is equal to the fraction of pa tients in the four-digit zipcode with one or more Medicaid claims that has a primary diagnosis of one or more extrapyramidal side effects. In both cases the coefficient estimate for the Any RZS variable is negative, though neither is statistically significant. In the final two columns I summarize th e results from analogous specifications for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal wei ght gain. The estimates for the Any RZS coefficient suggest that areas in which the drugs were taken up relatively rapidly di d have greater increases in the fraction of schizophrenia patients with one or more of these illne sses, and in both cases the estimates are significant at the ten percent level. It therefore appears that, while the new antipsychotic drugs may have reduced the prevalence of certain adverse side effects, thei r effects on health were not uniformly positive. 6. Individual-Level Estimates of the Effect of Second-Generation Antipsychotics 22One limitation with the results from the previous sec tion that use aggregate zip code-level data is that some of the differential use of these drugs acro ss geographic areas appears to be driven by a change in individuals' health and thus in their demand for me dical care. Specifically, almost 10% of individuals who initiate treatment for a second-generation drug ar e hospitalized just a few days before their prescription but were not in the hospital several week s earlier. Thus the coefficient estimates for the Any RZS variable will confound the actual causal effect of these drugs on the outcome variables of interest with the effect of this change in the demand for medical care. In this section, I attempt to surmount this obstacl e to identification with individual-level analyses that exploit variation across psychiatrists in their propensity to prescribe second-generation drugs. I use this variation to estimate the effect of second-genera tion drugs for the marginal patient and divide the sample into two distinct periods. The first consis ts of the period up through and including the third quarter of 1997. Until this time, the penetration of second-generation drugs was fairly gradual, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. But beginning in the fourth qua rter of 1997, the diffusion of second-generation drugs accelerated, with more individuals taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel for the first time in the subsequent nine months than in th e preceding forty-five. This increase was likely driven by legislation enacted in 1997 that made it easier for psychiatrist s and other physicians to prescribe the new drugs. A. OLS Estimates of the Effect of Second-Generation Antipsychotics on Medicaid Spending I begin by estimating OLS specifications that examine the relationship between Medicaid spending for individual j in period t+ as a function of her spending and utilization in period t and an indicator for whether she takes a second-generation antipsychotic in period t+ tj N UTILIZATIO RZS SPEND SPEND + + + + +=+ + , , )4( In this equation, the variable RZS jt is defined to equal one if indivi dual j has one or more Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel claims in period t and zero otherwise. Following previous work (Manning et al, 1987) I take the log of Medicaid spending because health care expenditures are quite skewed to the right and this produces a distribution that is much closer to the standard normal. The parameter of interest in 23this equation is , which represents the average effect of the new treatments on the log of Medicaid spending. As emphasized above, the challenge for relia ble estimation of this pa rameter is the endogeneity of treatment - individuals who take the drug may differ in unobservable ways from those who do not. The twelve specifications summarized in Table 5 examine the relationship between the use of the new drug treatments and the log of Medicaid spending in the four years from 1994 to 1997. The sample includes the 9664 individuals from the 20% Medicaid sa mple who are at least 18 years old in 1993, have one or more schizophrenia claims (two or more if only outpatient) and twelve months of Medicaid eligibility in that year, and who have no months in a managed care plan from 1993 to 1997. Because I take the log of Medicaid spending, individuals with no spending in a year will not be included in the regressions. 22 Additionally, those who die or become ineligible for Medicaid will also not be included. The first column summarizes results from a regres sion that controls for each individual's age, gender, race,23 the number of Medicaid-eligible months in 1994, and the fraction of those months also covered by Medicare. The statistically significant estimate of .926 on the Any RZS coefficient suggests that the use of Risperdal increased Medicaid spending in 1994, the first year that this drug was available. In transforming this into the implied dollar effect for each person, I account for heteroscedasticity and for deviations from the assumption of a normally dist ributed error term by using the smearing estimate developed by Duan (1983). Using th is retransformation method, I estimat e the median effect of Risperdal on Medicaid spending in 1994 to be $5396 with the mean slightly lower at $5244. In the next column I summarize the results fro m a specification that controls for the log of Medicaid spending in 1993. The addition of this one variable substantially increases the explanatory power of the regression, with the R-squared increasing from .094 to .524. The coefficient estimate of interest declines to 0.596 with the median effect on Medicaid spending fallin g by 46% to $2921. The magnitude of this change suggests that failing to co ntrol for baseline spending , which to some extent 22 Given that just 2-3% of the sample has zero spending in each subsequent year while eligible for Medicaid, excluding these observations should not be too problematic, though by dropping low-spenders from the \"no treatment\" group it will bias down the estimate for the effect of the new drugs on spending. 23 The regressions include 12 age-gender interactions (with age groups 0-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, and 65 plus) and four race variables (wh ite, black, Hispanic, missing race). 24captures the variation across indivi duals in illness severity, would bias the estimates. The inclusion of 15 measures of health care utilization24 in 1993 in the third column reduces the point estimate further to .550, with the implied median effect falling to $2769. Given the small standard errors on the estimate for Any RZS this parameter is quite precisely estimated, with the 95 percent confidence interval for the median effect ranging from $2626 to $2921. This first set of results suggests that the inclus ion of detailed pre-treatment information on both Medicaid spending and health care utilization for each individual reduces the bias that is present in specifications analogous to the one summarized in colu mn (1). The next several columns replicate these first analyses for 1995, 1996, and the first three quart ers of 1997. In every case I use Medicaid spending and utilization data from 1993, a period when individua ls could not have take n one of the three new second-generation drugs. Consistent with the results for 1994, the inclusion of 1993 Medicaid spending and utilization substantially lowers the point estimate for in each year. The implied median effect in the specification with all of the control variables remains fairly stable over time, ranging from a low of $2435 in 1995 to a high of $3230 in 1996. 25 In Table 6 I estimate a similar set of specifications for the second half of the nine-year study period. I focus on the period from the fourth quarter of 1997 forward, a time when the diffusion of second-generation drugs accelerated rapidly. I include individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia at some point during the twelve months prior to this break in trend and exclude indivi duals with one or more prescriptions for a second-generation drug during that time period. Using the fourth quarter of 1996 through the third quarter of 1997 as my baseline year, I estimate a set of specifications analogous to those presented in Table 5 for the four years from 1998 thr ough 2001. Because it includes expenditure data for the last quarter of 1997, the spending data fo r 1998 include five quarters of information. 24 These measures include an indicator variable for whet her or not an individual was hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, the number of days that the person spent in the hospital with this diagnosis, and the number of days squared. Analogous measures are constructed for four other types of claims - antipsychotic drug claims, other drug claims, outpatient claims, and days sp ent in long-term care with a schizophrenia diagnosis. 25 Given that the 1997 specifications include just three quarters of spending, the estimate of $2953 for that nine- month period suggests that the effects were largest in this year. 25Consistent with the results from the previous tabl e, the findings here sugg est that the use of the new treatments was associated with a substantial in crease in Medicaid spending, with the estimates for declining in every case when pre-treatment spending and utilization data are included. The estimated effects are substantially larger during this period and increase over time. For example, the estimate for the median effect of the new treatments on Medicaid spending in the third and final column for each year increases from a low of $5055 in 1998 to a high of $7011 by 2001. This trend could be partially driven by changes in the characteristics of patients taking th e drug, as the effect of the new treatments may vary across individuals. Additionally, average spendi ng on antipsychotic drugs for individuals taking Risperdal, Zyprexa, or Seroquel is in creasing during this period. Given that Any RZS is an indicator variable and thus does not capture increases in the in tensity of treatment, one would expect an increase from one year to the next if the effect on other health care spending remained constant. Even with detailed information on spending and he alth in a pre-treatment year, however, it is possible that treatment decisions are correlated with unobservable factors that also influence the outcome variable of interest. This motivates a search for a source of variation in treatment decisions that is unlikely to be driven by a cha nge in an individual's health. B. Variation across Psychiatrists in th e Use of Second-Generation Antipsychotics As previous researchers have noted, there is subs tantial variation across physicians in prescribing patterns even after controlling for differences in patient mix (Hellerstein, 1998). In this section I aim to exploit this variation when estimating the effect of Risperdal, Zyprexa, and Seroquel on Medicaid spending. I begin by pairing each Medicaid-eligible individual diagnosed with schizophrenia during the 1993 calendar year with the psychiatrist they visited during that year. 26 By constructing the sample in this way, I exclude schizophrenia patients who did not visit a psychiatrist in 1993 or who visited a psychiatrist 26 I choose the psychiatrist that individuals visited before they could have taken one of the three drugs to reduce a potential source of bias. Specifically, it is plausible that a patient would, in response to a change in health, seek out a certain psychiatrist because of his willingness to prescribe a cer tain treatment. I pair individuals who visited multiple psychiatrists with the one they consulted closest to the last day of 1993. 26without an identifier in 1993. Of the 9664 individual s diagnosed with schizophrenia and used in the Table 5 specifications, more than 47% have a paid claim to a psychiatrist with a provider ID.27 Using utilization data from 1993 for the sample of schizophrenia patients who visited a psychiatrist at least once, I start by predicting the probability that each individual would take a second-generation drug by estimating linear prob ability models of the following type: 94, 93, 93, 94, 94, )5(j j j j j N UTILIZATIO SPEND X RZS + + + += In this specification, the dependent variable is equal to one if the individual has one or more prescriptions for a second-generation antipsychotic in the year and zer o otherwise. This specification includes the same demographic, spending, and utilizatio n controls defined above. Using the results from this regression, I predict the probability that each individual took a second-generation drug in 1994 . For each patient- psychiatrist pair, I then calculate the difference be tween the actual fraction of the psychiatrist's other patients who take the drug and the fraction one would have predicted based on their baseline characteristics. Specifically, I calculate the psychiatrist effect Z jk for patient j as follows: 1 )6(194,, 94,, 194,, 94,, = = = kN ikj kiN ikj ki jkNS S S S Zk k with k indexing the psychiatrist for patient j and N k equal to the total number of patients for psychiatrist k. In this equation, S i,k,94 is set equal to one if patient i of doc tor k takes a second generation drug in 1994 and zero otherwise. The variable 94,,kiS represents patient i's predicted probability from regressions similar to (5) above. I exclude patient j's realized a nd predicted treatment from this calculation to avoid a mechanical relationship between j's treatment variab le and the psychiatrist effect. This index is constructed so that psychiatrists with relatively high values for this vari able are intensive users of the new 27 These individuals do systematically differ from those patients without a visit, with average spending and utilization that is substantially higher. For example, more than 28% of the Medicaid recipients who visited a psychiatrist were hospitalized in 1993 with a primar y diagnosis of schizophrenia while just 10% of their counterparts were hospitalized with a schizophrenia diag nosis during the same period. A large fraction of the remaining 53% did visit a psychiatrist but their provider did not have an identifier in the claims data. The reason for this is administrative - psychiatrists paid with Medicai d Short-Doyle funds are not id entified - only the provider county is listed for these psychiatrists. 27drug treatments while their counterparts with low values tend not to use the new drug. It is important to emphasize that this psychiatrist effect controls for differences in patient characteristics, as much of the variation in the actual fraction taking the drug may si mply be driven by differences across physicians in patient severity. I next use this psychiatrist effect as an instru mental variable to predict treatment decisions for schizophrenia patients in 1994 and th e subsequent three years. The identifying assumption of this approach is that - conditional on each patient's Medi caid spending, utilization, and other characteristics in 1993 - psychiatrists only influence Medicaid spending in subsequent years through an effect on the use of second-generation drugs. Though some psychiatrists may be more intensive users of other types of medical care and this may be corre lated with their propensity to u se second-generation drugs, the pre- treatment controls for spending and utilization should at least to some extent control for this. The main advantage of using predicted rather th an actual treatment as an explanatory variable is that it is unlikely to be driven by a change in an individual's own health. If psychiatrists did not differ in their prescribing patterns, then Z jk should not be significantly related with individual treatment decisions. But as th e results presented in the first-stage row of the first four columns of Table 7 demonstrate, this psychiat rist effect is significantly positively related with individual-level treatment decisions, w ith t-statistics ranging from 7.3 to 14.0.28 In these regressions I include only the 77 psychiatrists with 15 or more patients in 1993.29 Patients with psychiatrists who are intensive users of second-generation drugs - after controlling for the char acteristics of the other patients - are significantly more likely to take Risperdal, Zypr exa, or Seroquel than their counterparts with low- intensity psychiatrists. Not surprisingly, the predic tive power of this psychiatrist effect declines over time, with its coefficient falling from .822 in 1994 to .566 by 1997. 28 Standard errors are corrected to accoun t for correlation in the error term within psychiatrist groups given that Z jk is essentially varying at the psychiatrist level rather than at the individual patient level. 29 This is actually a strong restriction because I am using a 20% sample and this essentially requires a psychiatrist to have 75 Medicaid patients in 1993 to be included in the estimation. More precision could no doubt be obtained with a 100% sample though the Department of Health Services unfortunately only makes a 20% sample available. 28In the preceding rows of the same four columns of this table, I summarize the instrumental variable results from specifications that explain the lo g of Medicaid spending in each year as a function of predicted treatment and the 1993 spending and utilizati on measures. In every case, the estimated effects are positive, and these estimates are statistically si gnificant in 1995 and 1996. The magnitude of the estimates and the implied median effects are similar to the ones from the corresponding OLS specifications though the standard errors us ing this method are substantially higher. I replicate these results in the next four columns for the second part of the study period. Here I take the last quarter of 1996 and the first three qua rters of 1997 as the base period and pair patients with one of the 61 psychiatrists that has more than 15 pa tients during that period. Consistent with the OLS results, the estimated effects on Medicaid spending ar e larger during this high-diffusion period than the ones for the early period. Additionally the es timates increase over time, perhaps because the characteristics of the marginal patient or the intensity with which he/she is tr eated are changing over time. This seems plausible given that just 15% of th e sample was taking a second-generation drug in 1996 whereas nearly 70% were by 2001. Once again the IV estimates are similar to, but typically larger than, the corresponding OLS estimates. Taken together, the OLS and IV specifications summarized in this section consistently demonstrate that the shift to second-generation antipsychotic drugs increased Medicaid spending.30 The magnitude of the estimates increases over time, suggesti ng that the effect for the marginal patient varies as the drugs diffuse to a larger fraction of schizophrenia patients. Additional work is clearly needed to explore how the effect of second-generation antip sychotics on health care spending varies across individuals and across drugs at a particular point in time. 7. Conclusion During the last decade, government spending through the Medicaid program and in the U.S. generally on prescription drugs has increased at more th an a 15% annual rate. Much of this increase was 30 In a companion set of results not summarized here becaus e of space limitations, IV estim ates of the effect of the drugs on the prevalence of adverse side effects were imprecisely estimated and typically insignificant. 29driven by a shift to new drugs, which tend to be mo re expensive than earlier drugs within the same therapeutic category. Previous research has suggest ed that new drugs may to some extent pay for themselves by reducing the need for other health care services. The findings presented in this paper - which uses three different identification strategies and a data set with more than 30,000 Medicaid-eligible schizophrenia patients - undermine this hypothesis for the one category of prescription drugs that accounts for more government spending than any other. Because of data limitations the results for health outcomes are necessarily more speculative but sugg est that while the drugs may have reduced the prevalence of extrapyramidal symptoms they have also increased the fraction of schizophrenia patients with diabetes. It is therefore not obvious that the net effect of the new treatments on health was sufficiently positive to justify the 610% increase in antipsychotic drug spending from 1993 to 2001. If second-generation antipsychotics are not substantia lly better than the first-generation drugs that preceded them, what explains their much greater cost? Part of the explanation may stem from Medicaid's reimbursement formula, which essentially sets the price of a drug close to the non-Medicaid price. As the Medicaid market share increases, a profit-maximizing firm with patent protection would find it optimal to increase its price for non-Medicaid custom ers (Duggan-Scott-Morton, 2004). This is simply because the Medicaid program has a zer o co-pay and thus a Medicaid recipient or the physician acting on the patient's behalf has little incentive to c onsider cost when choosing a treatment. Whether the results presented here generalize to other categories of prescription drugs or to individuals with other types of health insurance is of course not obvious. The incentives for Medicaid recipients are not much different from those that exist in many private insurance plans, which often have a small co-pay that may differ slightly between brand and generic drugs. On the other hand, antipsychotics are very different from the typical drug category given that Medicaid accounts for the vast majority of spending on the drugs. But with the recent passage of a Medicare prescription drug benefit, the share of pharmaceutical spending accounted for by governme nt programs will increase substantially in the upcoming years. Though drugs will be paid for di fferently under Medicare, Medicaid's experience with 30antipsychotics during the last d ecade may shed some light on what can occur when the government becomes the dominant purchaser for one category of prescription drugs. 31References Card, D.
