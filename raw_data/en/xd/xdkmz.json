The [study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/effectiveness-of-ultravioletc-disinfection-systems-for-reduction-of-multidrug-resistant-organism-infections-in-healthcare-settings-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/9C7CCA63EDE0E44715C9BEA54CF632A7), conducted by Chinese researchers, analyzed nine previously studies that examined the impact of UV-C devices on the incidence of Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. While healthcare settings typically use a wide range of chemical disinfectants to prevent and control the spread of these organisms on surfaces in patients' rooms, which are highly susceptible to MDRO contamination, additional cleaning with no-touch technologies like ultraviolet light has shown some potential to further reduce incidence. The nine studies all examined use of UV-C disinfection systems. We found no advantages for the use of UV-C in healthcare settings as an adjunct to conventional infection prevention modalities. Pooled analysis indicated no statistically significant reduction in C difficile (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.90; 95% confidence (IRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.78) infection rates with the use of UV-C disinfection systems. The risk of gram-negative rod infection was reduced (IRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99), but the studies reporting this outcome were few. \"We found no advantages for the use of UV-C in healthcare settings as an adjunct to conventional infection prevention modalities to reduce the incidence of MDRO,\" the study authors wrote.
