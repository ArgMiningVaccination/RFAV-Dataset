In the most consequential year of its existence, however, the agency\u2014and its rookie director\u2014was besieged and almost swallowed by all manner of Trump cronies pushing pet projects, according to new interviews and previously undisclosed documents. A special report.", "sitename": "Vanity Fair", "date": "2021-01-19", "cleaned_text": "As Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, stepped to the White House lectern on March 19, for his first star turn in the Trump administration's pandemic response, he seemed alert to the risks of serving as the president's \"miracle cure\" consigliere. That day President Trump was touting an old malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for showing \"tremendous promise\" against COVID-19, lavishing praise on Hahn as \"fantastic\" for moving swiftly and slashing red tape to make the drug more widely available. Beaming from the acclaim, and introducing himself to a panicked nation, the affable former oncologist spoke of his own medical background. \"One thing that was really important is to provide hope,\" he said. \"What's also important is not to provide false hope.... And as a doctor, that's the way I come to this.\" He then made a point that he'd repeat throughout the coming months: The FDA would rigorously follow data in approving only safe and effective treatments. In other words, despite the frantic search for COVID-19 remedies, there would be no back door to FDA approval: Every product would get the same scrupulous scientific vetting, regardless of who was pushing it. In the moment Hahn received plaudits for appearing to straddle the perilous divide between hype and science. In retrospect, however, that press conference now seems like an upmarket hostage video, with Hahn not yet fully understanding that he was sharing the stage with his captors. For the former chief medical executive of the MD Anderson Cancer Center and a political neophyte, his one-year stint at the FDA's helm during a catastrophic public health crisis would be a dark journey into the heart of a science-eviscerating political machinery that he would come to confidentially describe as \"evil\" to colleagues. Vanity Fair's reporting, based on interviews with 30 current and former FDA officials, as well as those familiar with the agency's inner workings, and a review of dozens of internal FDA emails, text messages, and calendar entries, provides the most detailed look yet at an agency on the brink of surrender to Trump's political priorities. It is hard to say exactly when the rookie FDA commissioner lost his footing. But on March 18, the day before the press conference, he joined an Oval Office meeting with Trump, his son-in-law and special adviser, Jared Kushner, and a number of other top White House and health officials. As they discussed how to quickly greenlight hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, to whom Hahn reported, arrived late, breathless and sweaty, according to five people familiar with the meeting. \"I can get this done, Mr. President,\" Azar offered, proposing that he could short-circuit FDA review and unilaterally approve the drugs. \"I was shocked,\" one participant recounted. But in the meeting Hahn remained mute. It fell to former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joining the meeting by phone, to defend the FDA's authority and argue that approving a drug without the agency's review would erode public confidence. As the group debated, Trump held a finger to his own lips, directing Azar to be silent, a signal that he was prepared to subjugate his health officials to his will. (A senior administration official said that Azar had not been invited to the meeting and learned of it from a White House ally, which was why he was late, but wanted to apprise the president of his options. Fauci did not respond to a request for comment. Gottlieb declined to comment.) At the next day's press conference, Trump made his desired plan clear. He announced that hydroxychloroquine would be \"given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places,\" even while it was still being studied. In less than two weeks, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization, approving hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients in certain limited circumstances. With that partial greenlight, the Trump administration had wedged open a side door to the agency. Though Hahn likely did not realize it then, the White House was about to bulldoze in the agency's back door and crash through the windows too. Just hours after Hahn's Oval Office meeting, a special White House email address, intended to route VIP COVID-19 proposals and pitches to the FDA and other agencies, was being launched. The email address, set up by the White House chief of staff's office, and approved by White House lawyers, would get its first beta test on March 18 at 3:22 p.m., when Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger wrote to it: \"Team, A first test case from me for our new 'concierge service' on these offers and requests. Please let me know how it flows through our flow chart. Best, Matt.\" (Pottinger later told Vanity Fair that the email and flowchart were intended to \"remove the effect of VIPs getting special treatment,\" and to direct the plugs for COVID products bombarding the White House to experts who could appropriately vet them, without their being either fast-tracked or ignored. \"'Traffic cop' would've been a more accurate description of the system than 'concierge,'\" he said.) Whatever the intent, that portal would come to give high-level hawkers of dubious COVID-19 nostrums and tests a direct line to the agency in the coming months, and unleash \"a tsunami of randoms\" onto the FDA's career staff, according to one senior official with the Department of Health and Human Services familiar with the FDA's efforts. There was President Trump's ex-wife Marla Maples pushing an eight-minute antibody test on behalf of a North Carolina doctor. Jill Kelley, the infamous Tampa socialite best known for a bit part in the sex scandal that felled CIA director General David Petraeus, sought to advance a COVID-19 saliva test. People identifying themselves as friends of current House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and former Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan proposed pet projects. A ventilator company with ties to Ivanka Trump was \"willing and WANTS to help produce ventilators for adults ASAP but needs FDA-expedited assistance,\" according to an email from a White House special assistant. (Through her talent agent, Maples declined to comment. Kelley did not comment on the record. The White House did not comment on Ivanka's possible intercession for a ventilator company.) In some instances the products with VIP entr\u00e9e leapfrogged the FDA's jam-packed queue. The geyser of requests, often followed by phone calls directly to career staff, also drained scarce time and attention from more critical reviews. Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a former associate FDA commissioner, called the White House's funneling of VIP requests an \"outrage\" that allowed influencers \"people with potentially limited scientific knowledge to distort the priorities of the [FDA's] overworked line staff.\" He added, \"That means some potentially more deserving product is pushed back in the queue because you're forced to deal with the latest whim of someone who has the president's ear.\" By early fall the FDA's credibility was in tatters; Hahn had found himself in the White House's crosshairs; and public confidence in the ultimate therapeutic, a COVID-19 vaccine, had cratered. \"There is a way to manage that White House,\" said a former HHS official. \"Once Hahn crossed the line and started to be their deliveryman and open the door to their every whim, all bets were off.\" In several wide-ranging interviews conducted last week as the Trump administration was coming to its disastrous conclusion, Hahn described his time at the agency as war. There was ceaseless work and a \"ton of incoming,\" including the president's Twitter feed, which only served to make an exhausted staff more anxious. As the FDA sought to preserve public confidence by following a well-honed review system, the administration \"equated process with bureaucracy.\" He also found himself frequently navigating a minefield of politically motivated lies. \"I came from a world of hospital medicine [with] good communication,\" he said. \"It is very unusual in hospital medicine that someone lies, because people die.\" He added, \"What we decided to do as a team was try to ignore the externalities and do the right thing based on science and data.\" In many countries people have little guarantee that their medicine is safe and effective. As both [China](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-vaccine-china/different-efficacy-data-for-chinese-covid-19-vaccine-real-and-valid-media-idUSKBN297035) and [India](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/scientists-criticize-rushed-approval-indian-covid-19-vaccine-without-efficacy-data) plan mass COVID-19 vaccinations, their respective drug regulators have released scant reliable data\u2014or none at all\u2014from Phase III clinical trials. By contrast the FDA required drug companies to monitor clinical trial patients for two months beyond their last injection of COVID vaccine, and its advisory committee has made critical data public. But even in the best of times, the FDA's status as the world's top drug regulator, vigilant in protecting Americans against snake oil, is buffeted by behind-the-scenes lobbying of well-connected pharmaceutical companies, the demands of Congress for certain approvals, and the chronic underfunding of the short-staffed agency. In 1960 an astute FDA reviewer named Frances Oldham Kelsey famously refused to approve a sleeping pill being widely used in Europe to treat morning sickness in pregnant women, despite pressure from the drugmaker Richardson-Merrell. That decision largely spared American women from the tragedy of thalidomide, a drug later linked to devastating birth defects, with over 10,000 children worldwide born with flippers in lieu of limbs. That triumph of regulation has been matched by terrible lapses, such as the FDA's move in 2001 to permit opioid makers to market their drugs as safe for long-term use in treating moderate pain, a decision that helped to fuel the opioid epidemic. Facing a once-in-a-century pandemic, a well-run FDA could have guided the private sector early on in developing lifesaving products, made fast but careful approval decisions, and retained its political independence\u2014not linking arms with the president in touting specific products\u2014to preserve a critical firewall between the regulator and the regulated. \"The FDA commissioner should be like the head of the CIA,\" said the senior HHS official. \"You stay in the shadows.\" But interviews with various insiders and those familiar with the FDA's pandemic response reveal an agency stumbling through the pandemic, buffeted by mercurial demands from the White House, political sabotage from its parent agency, Health and Human Services, and an inexperienced commissioner unsure of whom to trust, and so eager to be liked that it amounted to a \"Shakespearean flaw,\" according to the senior HHS official. The result was a \"catastrophic failure of leadership...that has manifested in unforced error after unforced error,\" that official said. The FDA's actions likely slowed industry testing, sowed public distrust, led to the seesaw approval and revocation of an ineffective remedy, and might have even delayed the approval of a vaccine, in an effort to compensate for the perception that it had been co-opted by Trump. Morale plunged inside the agency as political appointees filtered in and bullied career staff. On a conference call one of those new arrivals threatened colleagues, \"Either you get on Trump time or you get out.\" Meanwhile, lower-level reviewers were crushed by work. Two staffers have committed suicide in recent months. Dr. Michael Waters, a lead reviewer of COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, took his own life in September. His widow, Hang Waters, told Vanity Fair that he was working around the clock and had gone five nights without sleep. She said he told his children that \"he had to work harder to save a lot of people, and if you don't work hard, then many people will die.\" In a statement an FDA spokesperson said, \"From day one of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA's flexibility, outreach, and thorough but rapid reviews significantly contributed to a year of unparalleled scientific achievement. The agency's around-the-clock work to ensure the development and availability of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines has consistently been guided by the best available scientific data and made by career experts with the urgency of the public health emergency in mind.\" Hahn said, \"I would never sacrifice public health in order to be liked.\" On December 17, 2019, not long after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan, China, Hahn took up his post at the FDA's White Oak campus in Silver Spring, Maryland, to lead the $5.9 billion agency and its 17,000-plus employees. His lack of experience in the nation's capital would soon earn him a derisive nickname among some of the agency's political appointees: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. While navigating the West Wing on one front, Mr. Smith would soon be battling hostilities on another. Azar, the secretary of health and human services and Hahn's boss, was laser-focused on winning Trump's support and not being overshadowed. One senior HHS official described Azar as possessing a \"triple black belt\" in bureaucratic infighting. Inside the administration some officials had also given Azar his own nickname: Purple Rage, a nod to the violet hue he seemed to turn when he was pissed off. Looming in the background for both Hahn and Azar was President Trump's first FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, a savvy political operator with almost half a million Twitter followers, so ready for a TV camera that he would sometimes arrive at the agency's headquarters wearing translucent powder. (Gottlieb declined to comment on that characterization.) Eager to put a stop to any similar showboating, Azar attempted to keep Hahn on a very short leash, said one former White House official, restricting his tweets and communications, and even blocking him from reaching out to the White House directly. (An HHS spokesperson called this \"unequivocally false.\") Azar had another way to tether Hahn, according to agency insiders: insisting that Hahn retain as chief of staff Keagan Lenihan, a former McKesson lobbyist who had helped Azar in his own Senate nomination and had served as his counselor at HHS. Though Lenihan had extensive Capitol Hill experience, she had no significant public health or science background, unlike the FDA's previous chiefs of staff. \"She ended up being a spy,\" said one senior HHS official. \"At the end of the day, she was working for Azar.\" (Lenihan declined to comment.) As Hahn spent his first month getting basic briefings on how the FDA worked\u2014a kind of color-by-numbers guide to the agency\u2014SARS-CoV-2 was spreading silently and mercilessly. By January 29, Azar had been tapped by the White House to lead the administration's coronavirus task force. He delegated day-to-day authority to his chief of staff, Brian Harrison, [a former Labradoodle breeder from Dallas](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-hhschief-speci/special-report-former-labradoodle-breeder-was-tapped-to-lead-u-s-pandemic-task-force-idUSKCN2243CE). Hahn was excluded from the initial task force, an absence that bewildered the public health community, since his agency was the front line for approving any COVID-19 treatment. (An HHS spokesperson said, \"The White House determined who was on the task force, not Secretary Azar nor Brian Harrison.\") By February 5, Hahn had formed an executive committee within the FDA to respond to the growing pandemic. But inside the White House, concern was mounting that Hahn had not yet alerted the private sector\u2014including drug, diagnostic test, and mask makers\u2014to the critical need for its submissions. As Hahn and his team scrambled to compile a list of key CEOs for him to contact, Azar, learning of the effort, moved to stop him, Vanity Fair has learned, despite the evident need for an all-hands-on-deck response. On February 10, Hahn's chief of staff, Lenihan, relayed this news in an email to FDA senior officials, writing, \"HHS is not going to let us be proactive on the comms for CEO touches, only reactive. With that in mind, is it worth reconsidering the effort going in to this?\" Remarkably, Hahn accepted the edict to essentially lead from behind. That same day a dangerous slowdown became a full-blown catastrophe. [The FDA learned that 10 laboratories](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year) that had attempted to use the first diagnostic testing kit for COVID-19 designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reporting failures. The CDC, so certain that it could design a world-class diagnostic test, chose not to use a more basic and effective one already created by the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, laboratory contamination had marred its own test. In short, Azar had put the brakes on a critical process\u2014the FDA notifying private partners of the need to roll out tests\u2014even as a second agency under his control was bungling its own testing rollout, said the senior HHS official, adding, \"Hahn was a \"deer in headlights.\" According to the FDA's public calendar, Hahn did not formally speak with an industry trade group about diagnostic testing until March 17, five weeks later. (An HHS spokesperson said, \"There is not a shred of truth to this,\" adding that Azar \"immediately prioritized the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.\") As the evident absence of tests cascaded into a full-blown crisis, the White House ran through possible spin with FDA officials. It came up with a potential one on March 6, when a communications official with the Office of Management and Budget, within the White House, sent talking points to an FDA lawyer, asking, \"Is Obama to blame for testing kit delays?\" The answer they arrived at was: \"partially.\" Meanwhile, the administration was vetting Hahn's predecessor Gottlieb to come on as a senior adviser to the White House, to serve as a possible coordinator of the coronavirus task force. (Dr. Deborah Birx ultimately took that role.) Within the FDA's leadership there was palpable fear that his stint as commissioner would end almost before it began. \"Scott would be empowered to run the FDA, sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\" said a senior HHS official. As confidence in Hahn cratered, Joe Grogan, then Trump's domestic policy adviser, instituted a daily 7:30 a.m. phone call with the FDA director, seven days a week, to spoon-feed him directives and move the FDA onto a war footing. (Hahn said he found the calls \"very helpful.... They wanted to make sure we were on track, given that I was new to government.\") Inside the agency, as errors accumulated, political pressure intensified, and Hahn failed to shield career staff from crackpot VIP demands, the agency's senior leadership splintered into warring fiefdoms. The vibe, as one senior HHS official put it, [was Mogadishu 1993.](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2008/12/somalia200812) On March 17, two days before Trump first announced hydroxychloroquine from the White House, a strange request landed in the inboxes of senior health officials at three agencies. Sent by FDA attorney Stacy Amin, the subject line read: \"WH request on Rx Drugs.\" The email contained no small ask: that the federal government should try to supersede state laws regulating how prescription drugs are delivered. \"They want us to issue an order telling states not to require signature upon delivery of prescription drugs and to use that order to preempt conflicting state law,\" Amin wrote. Even stranger was the source of the appeal: \"The request is coming from Ivanka,\" Amin wrote. The email went on to say that several officials were \"still socializing it in the WH but asked us to start working on it.\" The request, said a White House official, was not related to the delivery of hydroxychloroquine, but rather to COVID-19 safety: \"During a time when most were afraid to leave their homes or couldn't risk driving to pharmacies to pick up their essential drugs, Ivanka suggested the concept of contactless deliveries for needed prescriptions.\" Though the idea did not get traction, it's clear that intervening at the FDA in the midst of a pandemic had become an all-first-family affair. The same day that Ivanka's request hit health officials' email boxes, the president had spoken with Safra Catz, the CEO of the computer software company Oracle, according to a person familiar with the discussions. She and Oracle's billionaire cofounder Larry Ellison were deep in discussion with the West Wing about designing a database that could accompany the malaria drug's launch. As proposed, it would have allowed doctors seeing COVID patients to automatically prescribe the drug, by choosing it from an order set available to the physicians, and the federal government would cover the costs, Vanity Fair has learned. (An Oracle spokesperson said that in the early days of the pandemic, the database it had donated \"served to provide medical communities a secure way to collect, store, and manage data on the virus spread and patient symptoms and responses to treatments.\") As word of the hydroxychloroquine-promoting database spread among federal health officials, the plan sparked alarm. U.S. law prohibits drugmakers from marketing their products beyond approved uses. (Doctors can use their discretion to prescribe drugs to their patients for so-called off-label use) On March 21, Dr. Janet Woodcock, the longtime leader of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, warned her colleagues by email: \"We must be really carefully [sic] not to be seen as endorsing an off-label use. We prosecute companies for this.\" Inside the agency a debate was raging as to how, or even whether, to approve hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, given the sparse data and the drug's known risks of sparking irregular heart rhythms, one senior agency official recalled. But the pressure for approval was intense. \"The president was killing people over this,\" said the official. \"His minions believed that we were withholding something precious.\" On March 27, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, but with an important restriction: It could only be used in hospitalized patients or in a controlled clinical trial. Nonetheless, Trump's top health officials, including Hahn, got behind a plan for much broader use: to \"flood Ny and NJ with treatment courses,\" according to an email sent by Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human Services. The emails indicate that Hahn had also greenlighted mass distribution of hydroxychloroquine to drugstores. (In a statement Giroir said, \"Health care providers may prescribe a drug for an off-label use when they judge that it is medically appropriate for their patient, and [that is] why I supported these drugs going to out-patient pharmacies.\") The following day, [as Vanity Fair previously reported,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/documents-expose-fda-commissioners-interventions-on-behalf-of-trump) Hahn even reached out directly to an obscure family physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, in Monroe, New York, who'd become a West Wing darling for his claims that he'd had great success treating his COVID patients with the malaria drug. Hahn asked the doctor via text how he, the commissioner, could be of help. (Hahn said that the White House had asked him to reach out to Zelenko.) Even as data rolled in from clinical trials around the world, showing that the malaria drug worsened outcomes for COVID patients and increased their risk of cardiac events, hydroxychloroquine remained an article of faith in the West Wing, championed not just by the president but by his combative trade adviser Peter Navarro, whose office authored a 24-page treatise titled (all caps theirs) \"HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE VERSUS THE CHINA VIRUS AND THE HIGH COSTS OF HYDROXY HYSTERIA.\" On June 15, the FDA followed the emerging data and revoked its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine. Furious, Navarro emailed Hahn: \"The latest proposed action is OUTRAGEOUS.\" At a subsequent White House task force meeting, Navarro was so threatening to Hahn, accusing his agency of being \"fucking Deep State,\" that the vice president's chief of staff, Marc Short, stepped in to protect Hahn and separate the men, according to someone familiar with the exchange. Neither Short nor Navarro responded to messages seeking comment. Meanwhile, the flood of proposed cure-alls kept coming, in part because of Trump's own drive to market a miracle. \"The president is prone to magical thinking about science and therapeutics and wants to believe in the cure,\" said a former HHS official. \"It's not that hard to sell him a story about a technological innovation.\" One such story involved a product called oleandrin, which was the extract of a poisonous shrub. On March 21, six skeptical FDA officials exchanged emails about a company, Phoenix Biotechnology, that was lobbying to have oleandrin approved as a COVID-19 treatment. Mike Lindell, a former crack cocaine addict turned direct-to-consumer pillow mogul and devoted Trump donor, was on the company's board. (In the weeks following the January 6 Capitol riot, Lindell [was photographed entering the West Wing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/15/pillow-salesman-apparently-has-some-ideas-about-declaring-martial-law/) with a document that seemed to propose that the president institute martial law.) \"I think the only reason this is being passed around is because at some point it was forwarded by Congressman (chief of staff now?) Mark Meadows,\" the FDA's deputy director in the division of antivirals wrote to colleagues. \"Also forwarded through Debbie Birx's assistant. So apparently there is some connections at that level. But in my opinion, this sounds really sketchy. I doubt there is scientific merit.\" The next day one of those officials forwarded the request to a new group inside the FDA, writing, \"I am reluctant to bother you with this, but the company (which claims to have a drug that was used to successfully treat a child in Mexico) has made a number of political contacts and suggests that the President of Mexico may contact our President about the drug.\" Four months later in July, as the oleandrin pitch bumped through the FDA's review, the voluble director of Phoenix Biotechnology, Andrew Whitney, was ushered into the Oval Office by the secretary of housing and urban development, Dr. Ben Carson, accompanied by Lindell. They were there to discuss promising results from laboratory tests at the University of Texas. Whitney said, \"It is President Trump's job to find a solution to the problems the country is beset by.... It's their job to leave no stone unturned. Secretary Carson did that. He looked at the data; he spoke to the professionals. That's how we wound up in front of the president.\" Shortly after that Oval Office meeting, the FDA sent an inspector to a Houston, Texas, company called HealthQuilt, whose president, Dr. Kimberly Dunn, had used oleander extract supplied by Phoenix Biotechnology on 81 patients. There, the inspector made an alarming discovery. The patients\u2014drawn from a nursing home and a meatpacking plant where the doctor saw patients\u2014had not properly consented to the treatment under FDA regulations. Nor had HealthQuilt obtained permission for the study from the FDA. The lapses, captured in an FDA inspection record called a 483, raised the specter of human-subject violations, said one FDA official familiar with the case. (Dunn defended her study, telling Vanity Fair that she had every \"T crossed and I dotted. From a medical standpoint we went beyond the standard of care.\" In a statement to Vanity Fair, Phoenix Biotechnology's president and acting CEO, Lou Kost Jr., said that the company had not been aware of the details of the FDA's findings at HealthQuilt.) Compared to strict FDA standards, this was Trump-style science, from a president who'd even floated the idea of ingesting household disinfectant to fight COVID-19. \"There's a process for everything to be evaluated fairly,\" said one former FDA official. \"People around Hahn had to spend time responding to a lot of crazy ideas that were not going through a very robust process of evaluation.\" (An FDA spokesperson said the agency has \"strongly advised against using any product containing oleandrin...and warned [Phoenix Biotechnology] to cease the sale of this unapproved new drug claiming to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure serious and/or life-threatening conditions such as COVID-19.\") On the morning of July 28, John \"Wolf\" Wagner, the FDA's associate commissioner of external affairs, stumbled out of the agency's suite at HHS headquarters, weaved down the hallway, and collapsed in cardiac arrest. Dr. Anand Shah, the FDA deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs and a radiation oncologist, came to his aid before an ambulance arrived, according to several people familiar with the event. (Shah declined to comment.) Wagner's collapse in late July seemed a fitting portent of what was about to befall the agency. Within weeks the FDA would undergo its worst public relations crisis in a generation. Wagner had arrived at the agency a month earlier to run communications as part of an escalating White House effort to control COVID-19 messaging in the nation's public health agencies. He had little background in science or public health. Nor did the man to whom he now reported, Michael R. Caputo, who in April became assistant secretary of public affairs in the Department of Health and Human Services. The two men had previously worked together on Trump's 2016 campaign, Wagner said. (Caputo took a leave from his post in November, after claiming in an unhinged Facebook rant that left-wing scientist hit squads were in training to assassinate him.) On August 17, roughly two weeks after Wagner's heart attack, Emily Miller, also installed by the White House, would arrive at the FDA to run the Office of Media Affairs. She had previously worked as a correspondent at a far-right news network, One America News. And she had authored a book, Emily Gets Her Gun: But Obama Wants to Take Yours. On starting the job, one official recounted, Wagner told Miller, \"I'll take care of the Deep State, and you focus on fighting the media.\" (Wagner denied making this statement.) The far-right duo of Wagner and Miller was a poor fit for a science-based agency already struggling to communicate during a deadly pandemic. \"Wolf had no understanding of simple health care issues,\" said one HHS official. Miller was \"flippant, disorganized\" that official said, and interacted with colleagues on a \"high school level.\" On Sunday, August 23, Hahn joined President Trump and Azar in a White House press conference to announce an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19. After Trump touted the \"historic breakthrough,\" first Azar and then Hahn stated that the treatment, which infused a portion of blood from previously infected patients, had been shown to reduce mortality by 35%. Hahn then doubled down on that: \"What that means is\u2014and if the data continue to pan out\u2014100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.\" The remarks, wildly incorrect, stunned even some FDA officials. He had made a hash of the available data, which researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, had picked out retrospectively, without a randomized clinical trial. He had confused a relative reduction in death with an absolute increase in survival, making the plasma treatment sound like nothing short of a miracle. The agency had done extensive work to clamp down on fraudulent COVID-19 treatment claims throughout the pandemic. And there was its own commissioner appearing to spew some. \"I had to leave the room,\" said one staffer who had been watching the televised press conference from home. Outrage in the medical community was almost instantaneous. Hahn's statements were \"statistical malpractice,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, a prominent cardiologist who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. \"You can't make assertions about survival to the public based on retrospective data dredging.\" Topol and others called for Hahn to retract the statement or resign. It was \"do or die\" for Hahn, said a senior HHS official. \"This was a nationally embarrassing moment.\" In full damage control mode, Hahn publicly apologized for his misstatements the next day, drawing the fury of the White House. \"They were very upset and angry with me,\" Hahn confirmed. \"Apologizing is seen in some quarters as weakness. In medicine it's seen as a strength. In my opinion that's what leaders do.\" The press circled: Where had the 35% number originated, and was this more Trumpian snake oil, to which Hahn had loaned the agency's credibility? Within a week Hahn had relieved Wagner and Miller of their responsibilities, making it appear that Hahn was reclaiming his agency from West Wing infiltration. But that was only partly true. Miller and Wagner, though evidently unqualified, were nonetheless scapegoated, according to several people familiar with the events. \"He threw Miller under the bus,\" one senior HHS official told Vanity Fair. Hahn said of the staff shake-up, \"Once we discovered that it wasn't the right fit, my obligation was to make those changes.\" But he added that he continues to view Miller as \"really good at what she does.\" In fact the 35% number had been supplied to Hahn by Dr. Peter Marks, the agency's director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, who was also overseeing the approval of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to records reviewed by Vanity Fair. The issue of approving convalescent plasma had already sparked so much conflict between the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, whose director, Dr. Francis Collins, felt the data was inadequate, that a Mayo clinic researcher described it as a \"range war\" in an email to Marks. Jared Kushner's allies, including his former college roommate Adam Boehler, who had been assisting with the pandemic response, had been railing for the FDA to announce the approval, which could then be timed with the upcoming Republican National Convention on August 24. Into this cauldron walked Emily Miller. She arrived at the FDA on August 17 to find her boss, Wagner, still recovering from his heart attack. Three days later she still had no laptop or office phone, internal records indicate. On the morning of August 22, the president was publicly blasting the FDA. \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,\" the president tweeted. \"Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd.\" That afternoon, from his Colorado vacation home, Hahn called the president to say the approval was in the works. \"'He said he's proud of me,'\" Hahn reported back to one FDA official, who observed that Hahn seemed \"desperate for the president's approval.\" With a White House press conference being planned for the following day, Marks sent Hahn several emails that evening that mentioned a 35% improvement in survival and enthusiastically endorsed the authorization. But Marks did not spell out that the 35% number was a relative and comparative number, in a subset of a subset of patients, and not an absolute improvement. Nor did Hahn ask. On Sunday, Hahn landed at Dulles Airport several hours before the press conference, without a suit in hand or clear talking points. On a preparatory conference call of close to a dozen FDA officials, while he was still at the airport, Hahn asked Marks, according to a participant, \"Peter, did you just say one third more people are not dying?\" Marks responded, \"Yeah, one third.\" Marks referred questions to the FDA press office, which stated, \"We decline to comment on internal deliberative discussions.\" The disaster that ensued at the White House press conference was bad enough. But the announcement was widely viewed as the prelude to a far more consequential one: the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. Would the FDA capitulate to President Trump and approve a vaccine before the presidential election, possibly before it was proven safe? Fighting for his reputation, Hahn reached out to one of his most ardent critics. Just after 6 a.m. on September 3, he cold-called Eric Topol, described the pressure he was under, and admitted that he was facing an \"existential crisis.\" (Hahn denied using those words.) Some four months earlier, on April 29, Marks had headed to the White House to pitch his idea for what would become, arguably, the Trump administration's only pandemic success: the breakneck development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Though Trump shunted responsibility for diagnostic testing and shortages of protective equipment to the states, with dire consequences, he embraced the moonshot vaccine effort. As drug companies raced through clinical trials, delivering that win would all come down to the FDA's say-so. Marks, a brilliant though prickly hematologist-oncologist, had envisioned a sweeping partnership between the federal government and private drug companies to develop a number of vaccine candidates simultaneously. A longtime Star Trek fan, he had dubbed the concept Operation Warp Speed. Inside the White House that early spring day, as the administration's top health officials, including Hahn, crowded into a secure room, Marks sat against the wall until someone gave him their chair. As he briefed the group, Deborah Birx aggressively questioned him, not seeming to understand that he was an FDA official outlining an idea, rather than an operational director unprepared to implement a plan. As Hahn remained silent, Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, came to Marks's defense, saying, \"Deb, you're out of line. Leave him alone.\" Hahn, who still did not join her in defending Marks, leaned over to Verma and said approvingly, \"You're a really good egg.\" Even Azar chimed in, asking Hahn, \"Aren't you going to stick up for your guy?\" (Birx did not respond to a request for comment.) Though Marks emerged shaken from the meeting, his idea was a go. Operation Warp Speed soon got underway, a vast\u2014and secretive\u2014 [$15 billion program](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/17/crash-landing-of-operation-warp-speed-459892) run jointly by the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services, with a management structure that seemed intended to deliver political, and not just pharmaceutical, wins. Jared Kushner and his pandemic wingman Adam Boehler were among the five members of a coordinating committee that oversaw the sprawling effort. Even with Trump intent on a pre-election vaccine approval, Hahn continued his trips to the White House, as dazzled as a \"kid in the candy store,\" said a senior HHS official. At the time the FDA was weighing a plan to preliminarily authorize a COVID vaccine for high-risk groups, such as nursing home residents, before the completion of Phase III clinical trials, Vanity Fair has learned. Using a staged approach, the FDA could have balanced risk against benefit: a less-than-thoroughly vetted vaccine, but one more likely than not to protect the most vulnerable Americans. Then, as more data came in, the FDA could have expanded its authorization to include younger, healthier Americans. But the plan had a paradoxical liability: It might meet Trump's desired timeline, thereby spooking a public already skeptical about the FDA's independence. (Though an FDA spokesperson denied that a \"staged\" approach was ever considered, the agency had initially conveyed to drug companies that it could consider authorization based on interim data, a source familiar with the discussions said.) As it happened, the convalescent plasma disaster derailed any such plan. On August 31, in an open letter to Hahn in the journal Medscape, where he served as editor in chief, Topol called Hahn \"subservient to President Trump's whims\" and wrote, \"Tell us...that you will not, under any condition, authorize a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approval before the full Phase 3 completion and read-out of a program. Otherwise, you need to resign.\" Meanwhile, the crisis was widening inside the FDA. On September 10, the agency's eight top career officials, who directed its scientific centers, published an op-ed in USA Today, attempting to reclaim their independence and reaffirm that science guided their decisions. \"If the agency's credibility is lost because of real or perceived interference,\" they wrote, \"people will not rely on the agency's safety warnings.\" Though Hahn said the officials gave him a heads-up and had his blessing, the piece was a \"fuck-you\" to the commissioner, said a source familiar with its publication. The FDA was officially at war with itself. Hahn was forced to take a side. He ultimately joined with the agency's career officials in their call to fully vet a vaccine, regardless of the political fallout. On September 21, the FDA sent the White House's Office of Management and Budget new vaccine guidance, calling for drug developers to monitor patients enrolled in their clinical trials for roughly two months after their last shot. It would push any vaccine approval beyond the November election. Inside the White House, Azar worked to have Hahn fired, repeatedly bringing his case to Trump and Meadows, according to several officials aware of Azar's campaign. An HHS spokesperson said, \"We do not comment on personnel matters in the press.\" As Hahn told Vanity Fair, \"I certainly don't think I'm well liked now.\" Hahn moved his staff out of HHS headquarters and returned to the FDA's White Oak campus. \"'We're leaving HHS. They're all evil,'\" an official recounted him saying. As the Office of Management and Budget sat on the FDA's new guidance, refusing to approve it, the FDA defied the White House. On October 22, it released the guidance, inside a briefing document for an upcoming public vaccine-advisory committee meeting. Though Hahn had been \"subjugated to Trump,\" said someone in frequent contact with the commissioner, \"he became block and tackle for this to be done right.\" Within hours the White House folded and approved the FDA's new guidance, but not before Trump took a shot at his newly disobedient FDA commissioner. \"New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day,\" he tweeted that day. \"Just another political hit job! @SteveFDA.\" On December 8, the White House staged a vaccine summit, to give the president a much-needed victory lap after he'd lost the election and Britain's drug regulator had beaten the FDA in approving Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Hahn was invited and expected to come. But he sidestepped the invitation, sending Keagan Lenihan, his chief of staff, instead. The summit's organizers were livid at Hahn's absence, one HHS official said. But it appeared that the commissioner had finally learned his lesson: He could either stand next to Trump or stand with his agency.
