Many naturopathic doctors aim to use the least invasive therapies that are still effective. This way, the body has the support it needs to heal, but doesn't have to manage anything extra, leading to fewer side effects and long-lasting results. Blending the Best of Modern and Traditional Medicine The tools that are often used by naturopathic doctors include diet and lifestyle counseling, medicinal herbs, homeopathic remedies, bodywork, hydrotherapy, and occasionally, prescription medication. From the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians: \"Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self-healing process. The practice of naturopathic medicine includes modern and traditional, scientific, and empirical methods.\" Collaborative Care Naturopathic doctors work together with other medical providers, and are trained to recognize when referrals are appropriate.
