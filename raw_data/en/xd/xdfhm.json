MILLMAN, Special Master DECISION1 1 Vaccine Rule 18(b) states that all decisions of the special masters will be made available to the public unless they contain trade secrets or commercial or financial informationthat is privileged and confidential, or medical or similar information whose disclosure wouldconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. When such a decision is filed, petitionerhas 14 days to identify and move to delete such information prior to the document's disclosure. If the special master, upon review, agrees that the identified material fits within the banned categories listed above, the special master shall delete such material from public access. Because of the personal nature of the material discussed as well as petitioners' prior motion toredact the transcript, the undersigned sua sponte redacts this decision as of this date.Petitioners filed a petition on January 8, 2008, under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-10 et seq., Doe (hereinafter, \"Baby Doe\") suffered multiple seizures and paralysis in her lower extremities within one hour ofreceiving acellular DTP, HiB, and hepatitis B vaccines. Petition, p. 1. During a July 2, 2008telephonic status conference, petitioners' counsel stated that petitioners were allegingencephalopathy, but not a Table encephalopathy. A hearing was held on November 20, 2008. Testifying for petitioners were Mrs. Doe, treating pediatrician Dr. Marc A. Hultquist, registered nurse Blanche D. Coleman, expert pediatric neurologist Dr. G. Steven Miller, expe rt internist Dr. Richard Hastings, and Mr. Doe. Testifying for respondent was expert pedi atric neurologist Dr. Michael E. Cohen. The issue here is sequelae and whether there is a logical sequence of cause and effect between a transient encephalopathy due to fever and pain from four vaccinations, and failure tothrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems. Respondent admits thatBaby Doe had a reaction to her vaccinations, but asserts it was brief. Petitioners allege a muchmore serious reaction with permanent sequelae. Petitioners changed their allegation fromvaccine-caused seizures to causation in fact encephalopathy with permanent sequelae. FACTS Baby Doe was born on August 17, 2004.

Although Baby Doe was prescribedAugmentin for tonsillar erythema the day before, Mrs. Doe felt Baby Doe did not do any better. Her tongue had gotten worse and she refused to drink. Baby Doe's temperature was 98.3\u00b0 andher weight was 13.35 kg or 29.4 pounds. She had decreased urine output but cried with tears. She was active, alert, responsive and not in distress. She had no systemic symptoms and herfever was low grade. Id. Baby Doe had multiple lesions on the sides of her tongue consistent with Vincent's stomatitis. 15 The back of her throat and posterior pharynx were erythematous. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 184. Dr. Apost's diagnosis was stomatitis - multiple lesions on the side ofthe tongue consistent with enteroviral infection and dehydration. He admitted Baby Doe to the 15 Vincent's stomatitis is \"acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.\" 1765. \"Gingivae\" are the gums. Id. at 768. 31hospital for fluids. They would do a blood culture, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, and x-ray of the neck. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 185. On November 1, 2007, Dr. Mark S. Craig noted that Baby Doe had an oral intake of 150 ml over 14 hours and a small amount of jello. She received 260 ml of intravenous fluid. Med.recs. at Ex. 5, p. 188. Her temperature ranged from 96.9\u00b0-98\u00b0 and her weight was 13 kg or 28.6 pounds. Baby Doe had had two weeks of diarrhea, one week of vomiting and fever, and fourdays of glossitis. 16 She had been seen in clinic with no tears to crying. (This note conflicts with Dr. Apost's records that Baby Doe did have tear s with crying, which would mean that when she was in the clinic, she was not dehydrated.) Mrs. Doe gave Dr. Craig the history. Id. Baby Doe handled her secretions well and could swallow. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 189. Dr. Craig concluded Baby Doe's glossitis was most likely of viral origin. She appeared clinically dehydrated oninitial exam. Intravenous fluids would continue. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 190. Also on November 1, 2007, the nutritionist Andr ea E. Fleenor set up a new diet for which she was educating Mrs. Doe. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 192. Baby Doe weighed 13.35 kg or 29.4pounds and was 39 inches in height. Id. Baby Doe was three years two months old, screened as a high nutritional risk, and was in the 5 th percentile for BMI/age. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 193. She had had a decreased appetite for six days. Nutritionist Fleenor spoke to Mrs. Doe who toldher Baby Doe had lost four pounds in the last two weeks due to decreased intake. She haddecreased appetite and diarrhea. She had difficulty swallowing secondary to glossitis. Mrs. Doestated that Baby Doe usually liked all foods. Nutritionist Fleenor stated that Baby Doe's 16 Glossitis is \"inflammation of the tongue.\" Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , 30th ed. (2003) at 781. 32weight/age and height/age were within normal limits. The goal of the therapy was to meet 75% of Baby Doe's nutritional needs to prevent furthe r weight loss and promote normal growth. She recommended boosting milk shakes and/or pudding with all trays. Id. On November 1, 2007, Dr. Craig returned and the Does told him Baby Doe was doing very well and they would like to take her home. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 197. Baby Doe lookedwell-hydrated and had improved \"drastically.\" Sh e was discharged home. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 198. On November 7, 2007, Baby Doe saw Dr. Apost for a follow-up. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 200. Baby Doe was doing well. The plaques on the sides of her mouth had resolved. She wasafebrile, active, alert, well-hydrated, not in dist ress, and doing well at home. Med. recs. at Ex. 5, p. 201. Forms were completed and returned to Mrs. Doe about immunization exemptions. Med.recs. at Ex. 5, p. 202. On January 10, 2008, Baby Doe saw Dr. Hultquist. Med. recs. at p. 213. There was concern about developmental delay due to an i mmunization she received at four months. Med. recs. at p. 214. The day she had the immunization, she developed a fever of 104.5.\u00b0 (Obviously, Dr. Hultquist's notation is based on Mrs. Doe's history to him and not on the medical records he and others wrote at the time.) She was not spontaneously moving her legs,but she would withdraw from pain. She was not seen again until one year of age. At that visit,the clinic learned that she was not growing well. She was breastfed up to 13 months. Shestarted baby foods at about five to six months a nd solid foods near a year. Mrs. Doe described Baby Doe as a good eater. She used formula after 13 months because Baby Doe was notgrowing well. Id. Baby Doe was a year behind in her gross development. Mrs. Doe's main 33concern was speech. Head Start had some concerns about Baby Doe's ability to complete simple puzzles. Id. Baby Doe was three years and four months old. She could ride a tricycle but not sing a song. She could use pronouns appropriately. Id. Baby Doe's receptive skills seemed normal, but her speech was unintelligible in a lot of situations. Med. recs. at p. 216. On March 14, 2008, petitioners took Baby Doe at the age of three years, six months, for speech evaluation. Med. recs. at Ex. 12, p. 319. Baby Doe had moderate phonologicalimpairment. The recommendation was once a week therapy. Id. Mrs. Doe told speech pathologist Sarah Kay that there had not been any significant medical problems and Baby Doe did not have any specific medical diagnoses. She has seen a pediatrician but no other specialists. Id. Mrs. Doe had no concerns about vision or hearing. Id. Her developmental history was that Baby Doe was a fussy baby who liked to be held. Mrs. Doe stated that Baby Doe was able toroll over at five months, crawl at 9 months, sit alone at 12 months, and walk at 15 months. Med.recs. at Ex. 12, p. 320. She did not speak her first word until she was two years old. Mrs. Doeregarded Baby Doe's development as slow. Baby Doe could attend to one activity for 10-15minutes. She did not show frequent re-changes. She was easily frustrated. She played with toys appropriately and was able to share toys. Id. Mrs. Doe stated there was a family history of speech difficulty. Baby Doe physically pointed to make her wants and needs known. She couldmake many different sounds and use gestures. She said many words but only one word at a time. When someone could not figure out what she wa s asking for, Baby Doe would typically cry and then cry again. Mrs. Doe felt that Baby Doe understood almost everything said to her. Mrs. Doedid not feel that speech and language development stopped for any period of time. She had noconcerns about feeding or swallowing. Mrs. Doe told Ms. Kay that Baby Doe had failure to 34thrive as an infant when she had her five-m onth vaccinations. Baby Doe ate soft foods, pureed foods, crunchy foods, and meat. She could use a regular cup, spoon, and straw. She likedvegetables. She could self-feed. Id. Ms. Kay felt that Baby Doe's language skills were at age appropriate levels at that time, but she should continued to be monitored secondary to aphonologic impairment. Med. recs. at Ex. 12, p. 321. Baby Doe had a total occurrence of majorphonological deviations, placing her in the high- moderate range for phonological impairment. She had difficulty producing consonant sequences . If untreated, this phonological impairment could further impact her language skills. Id. Baby Doe's voice, fluency, and oral motor control appeared within functional limits for conversation. There were no concerns for feeding orswallowing, according to Mrs. Doe. Id. On March 20, 2008, Baby Doe received an occupational therapy pediatric initial evaluation from occupational therapist Chandra Landers. Med. recs. at Ex. 13, p. 323. Mrs. Doegave a history that within 10 minutes of Baby Doe's four-month immunizations, she becamelimp and unresponsive. Mrs. Doe reported she rushed her to the emergency room where she hada temperature of 105 degrees and suffered two seizures. Mrs. Doe reported that for at least threeweeks, Baby Doe was not responsive but had to have a feeding tube placed. After about threeweeks, Baby Doe apparently began to nurse again but had still very limited responsiveness. Mrs.Doe reported that the doctors ran a lot of tests on her and ruled out Guillain-Barr\u00e9, which theythought initially possible. Initially diagnosed with failure to thrive, Baby Doe had caught upwith her size and no longer had that diagnosis. She is a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Mrs. Doe wasin contact with the Vaccinations and Immuniza tions Compensation Program. Mrs. Doe reported that some speech, sensory, and fine motor problems began to show up recently. Mrs. Doe 35reported that Baby Doe's teachers at Head Start are concerned that she did not complete activities on the same level as other children. Currently, Baby Doe was diagnosed only withdevelopmental delay and took only daily vitamins. Id. Baby Doe was attending a half-day of Head Start and had some difficulty communicating with the other children there because of herspeech problem, but she played a lot with one little girl there. Id. Baby Doe walked independently and sat in a chair at the table for the entire evaluation. She attempted all activitiesalthough, on a few occasions, she said, \"I can't.\" Toward the end of the session, she requestedmany times to leave. She followed directions well for her age. Id. Baby Doe had normal tone and functional range of motion in her upper extremities. Med. recs. at Ex. 13, p. 324. Mrs. Doe stated Baby Doe could use utensils appropriately andfeed herself. She cannot do buttons, snaps, and zippers. She will not hold a bagel with creamcheese or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich because they will get on her hands, but she will eatthem if someone else holds them. She will not play with water and sand at Head Start and willnot get into a bathtub with bubbles. She covers her ears in public places except for the grocerystore. She will not let her mother touch her ears even to change her earrings. Id. Therapist Landers assessed Baby Doe with some delays in fine motor skills, including visual, motor, andgrasping skills. Med. recs. at Ex. 13, p. 325. Some grasping limitations might be due partially tosensory tactile defensiveness. She could benefit from occupational therapy once a week. Id. On July 28, 2008, Baby Doe saw Dr. Laurie A. Kukas, an osteopath specializing in developmental pediatrics. Ex. 23, p. 406. Baby Doe was three years and 11 months old. Mrs. Doe gave Dr. Kukas a history that Baby Doe ha d a 104-105\u00b0 temperature within one hour of her immunizations and developed an encephalopathy with flaccid paralysis of her legs and loss of 36body control, including her ability to suck and breast feed. Mrs. Doe said Baby Doe required tube feedings during her three-day hospitali zation. Baby Doe gradually improved but was irritable, oversensitive to sounds, touch, and taste, and difficult to console until 13-18 monthsold. Id. By 13 months of age, Baby Doe had regained most of her gross motor skills but had limited speech. She was diagnosed with failure to thrive because her weight dropped from the50 th percentile to the 5th percentile. Mrs. Doe wondered to Dr. Kukas if Baby Doe had signs of possible autistic disorder because of obsessi ve-compulsive behaviors including handwashing 15- 20 times a day, putting bears in a certain place at bedtime, freaking out if a cut bleeds, difficultywith professional photos, difficulty with certain food textures, hearing subtle sounds no one else hears, covering her ears and crying when ther e are loud sounds, preferring soft easy foods to chew or easy crunch foods, pocketing food in her cheeks, and waking during the night to sleep with her parents. Id. Mrs. Doe said that after the immunizations, there was a time when Baby Doe would no longer interact with her family, was lethargic, and looked as if she were in a daze. Ex. 23, p. 407. Baby Doe crawled on her hands and knees after 12-13 months. She did not walkalone until 15-16 months. Her problem-solving and following directions were very good. Id. Baby Doe's brothers are 6, 8, and 10 years old. The six-year-old brother is enrolled in T- 1 for immaturity in adaptive and emotional skills. He frequently fights with Baby Doe over toys. Id. Baby Doe's father was often away when Baby Doe was 3-25 months old. Another deployment was expected in May 2009. Mr. Doe was a straight A, Honor Roll student. Mrs.Doe was a B-C student. She is attending college classes and will be doing phlebotomy. Id. Baby Doe weighed 33.2 pounds and was 39 inches tall. Ex. 23, p. 408. Her physical andneurological examinations did not identify speci fic abnormalities that explain her developmental 37delays. Oral motor control of her tongue and lips were delayed for her age. Her resting muscle tone was low normal to mildly hypotonic. Id. Dr. Kukas received petitioners' expert pediatric neurologist Dr. Miller's report diagnosing Baby Doe with encephalopathy from a severe reaction to her second set of immunizations. Ex. 23, p. 407. Dr. Kukas diagnosed Baby Doewith residual developmental delays and encephalopathy-related adverse reactions to her secondset of vaccinations, developmental delays (communication, social, adaptive, fine motor, and selfhelp), possible hyperacusis (over-sensitive hearing) which could be due to abnormal centralauditory processing, mild generalized hypotonia and poor body awareness, sensory processingdysfunction, developmental coordination disorder, sleep disturbance, mood swings, mild temper tantrums, social and separation anxiety, and obs essive-compulsive traits. Ex. 23, p. 408. Dr. Kukas opined that Baby Doe does not seem to have autistic disorder. Ex. 23, p. 409. Sherecommended that Baby Doe receive an intense multidisciplinary treatment plan combiningprivate and public school services. Id. She suggested that Baby Doe's primary pediatrician conduct tests to rule out anemia, thyroid, genetic , and other conditions if Baby Doe did not start to improve. She also suggested a brain MRI or PET scan or SPECT scan when Baby Doe isolder to define better \"the areas of her brain that were affected during the vaccine adversereaction.\" Id. To get Baby Doe to sleep better, Dr. Kukas suggested to Mrs. Doe that the television be turned off one hour before bedtime and Baby Doe stop taking a sippy cup to bed. She suggested low doses of melatonin with a protein or complex carbohydrate snack 30 minutesbefore bedtime. She suggested soft music and/or white noise to be used the entire night ifneeded. Mrs. Doe should continue to monitor Baby Doe's sleep for awakenings, nightmares,and/or restlessness and snoring with pauses a nd/or gasps. She should discuss her observations 38with her pediatrician to see if Baby Doe needed a sleep study or ENT consultation to see if her enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids needed to be removed. Id. Dr. Kukas suggested Mrs. Doe add Omega 3, 6, and 9 and vitamin B complex to Baby Doe's diet. She suggested the Coromegabrand. Dr. Kukas suggested oral motor strategi es to wake up Baby Doe's mouth before meals. She gave Mrs. Doe a sheet of mouth/tongue movement games to do in the mirror with Baby Doe. She suggested occupational therapy services with emphasis on sensory and vestibular strategies. She also suggested speech-language therapy, and formal vision examination. Id. Even though Baby Doe has normal hearing, Dr. Kukas suggested additional audiology evaluations. Ex. 23, p. 410. She also suggested gradually reducing el ectronics (television, video games, computer games) to one hour per day and preferably only 30 minutes at a time followed by an active breakand other play or chores. Id. On September 25, 2008, Baby Doe at the age of four years, one month, saw occupational therapist Aileen Sadler for an initial evaluation. Med. recs. at Ex. 22, p. 400. The history Ms.Sadler wrote was that an hour and one-half af ter receiving her immunizations, Baby Doe had a temperature of 105.\u00b0 She was lethargic and her legs did not appear to be moving. Mrs. Doerushed Baby Doe to the emergency room where she was admitted to the hospital and developedfeeding difficulties. Mrs. Doe said Baby Doe was given breast milk by NG tube. She told Ms.Sadler that Baby Doe had had a seizure during the first night. Mrs. Doe told Ms. Sadler that in the following months, Baby Doe cried and was like a colicky baby all the time. Id. Ms. Sadler tested Baby Doe's fine motor skills and found her able to manipulate a variety of materials. She could not button large buttons. Id. She was able to walk and run without difficulty. Ex. 22, p. 401. She disliked tactile input. Ex. 22, p. 402. Baby Doe displayed 39excellent attention for a child her age. She engaged easily in activities and followed directions without difficulty. Ex. 22, p. 403. Overall, her fine motor skills were developing well for a childher age. Her grasp appeared weak for her age. She had difficulties in social situations,becoming anxious in new and unfamiliar situations. Id. Ms. Sadler recommended occupational therapy to address Baby Doe's grasping skills and pre-writing skills. She also needed a sensorydiet. Id. On October 1, 2008, Baby Doe saw Dr. Kukas again. Ex. 23, p. 412. Dr. Kukas gave a teacher packet to Mrs. Doe for Baby Doe's teach er to fill out after six weeks of the new school year. Baby Doe's current Head Start teacher, Ms. Anderson, completed the forms and returnedthem on October 12, 2007. Ms. Anderson reported that Baby Doe had difficulties with speech,fine motor, and following directions, but was good at learning songs. After a few days, Baby Doe made friends easily and got along well with others. Id. Additional Submitted Material Filed as Ex. A for petitioners (this is petitioners's second Ex. A) and given page number 212, is a statement dated August 28, 2007 from Mrs. Doe with the heading \"VICP Claim\" andaddressed \"To Whom It May Concern.\" Mrs. Doe states that within 25 minutes of her four-month vaccinations, Baby Doe was not respondi ng neurologically, was running a very high fever, and her lower extremities were paralyzed. She was in the emergency room within onehour of her vaccinations where was she evaluated and admitted to the hospital. She was givenmedication to control her fever and anaphylaxis. Mrs. Doe states Baby Doe \"had some kind ofdisorder of her brain and body.\" Id. After her release from the hospital, Baby Doe could no 40longer sit up on her own, make eye contact, or respond to voices or touch, according to Mrs. Doe. She had constant irritability and failure to thrive. Mrs. Doe submitted an affidavit dated January 3, 2008, filed as exhibit 1. She states that Baby Doe at birth was in the 95th percentile for length and the 90th percentile for weight. Ex. 1, p. 1. Mrs. Doe also states that one hour after her four-month vaccinations, Baby Doe \"had a highfever and stopped responding neurologically.\" Ex. 1, p. 2. She continues, \"Baby Doe was experiencing paralysis in her lower extremities, and suffered a seizure.\" Id. She took Baby Doe to the emergency room at Reynolds Army Hospital. Mrs. Doe continues in her affidavit that for her three days in the hospital, Baby Doe continued to have fever, lethargy, paralysis of her legs, additional seizures, and incessant crying. Id. She states, \"She also continued to display a decreased level of consciousness.\" Id. Mrs. Doe states that after her discharge from the hospital, Baby Doe could no longer sit up on her own,make eye contact, or respond to voices, touch, or other stimuli. She also went from the 90 th percentile in weight to below the fifth percentile in weight in just a few months. She wasdiagnosed with failure to thrive and has had continual diarrhea and developmental delays. Id. Mrs. Doe states that when Baby Doe was one year old, she was still wearing clothing for a three-month old and weighed only 18 pounds. She still did not make facial gestures or verbal noises other than to express a constant irritability. Id. Petitioners filed as exhibit 15 the 20-page expert report dated March 28, 2008 of Dr. Richard A. Hastings, an internist. He also examined Baby Doe on March 28, 2008. Ex. 15, pp.337, 338. Mrs. Doe told Dr. Hastings that 10-15 minutes after her vaccinations, Baby Doe wasfeverish, lethargic, with limp extremities, her eyes were partially closed, and she was not 41responding normally. Ex. 15, p. 340. Mrs. Doe told Dr. Hastings that Baby Doe had fever up to 105.\u00b0 Ex. 15, p. 341. She said Baby Doe appeared to be in substantial pain as touching her armsor legs caused her to cry and withdraw. Id. X-rays of Baby Doe's brain and legs, and ultrasound of her hips were normal. Mrs. Doe told Dr. Hastings that Baby Doe had some overtly abnormalmovement disorders the first night in the hospital which resembled a seizure. Id. On the third day, Baby Doe was discharged from the hospital with increasing movement of her lowerextremities. Dr. Hultquist evaluated her on January 18, 2005. In a subsequent note, Dr.Hultquist wrote that Baby Doe had 104.5 fever and flaccid paralysis. Examinations on July 20, 2005 confirmed that Baby Doe was in the 5 th percentile for weight and the 50th percentile for height. Id. Dr. Hultquist recommended nutritional c onsultation. Ex. 15, p. 342. Dr. Hultquist's opinion was that \"the clinical demise\" of Baby Doe was a direct result of her adverseimmunization reaction. Id. Since then, Baby Doe has regained her physical growth development in height and weight by use of an aggressi ve nutritional support program. Ex. 15, p. 343. On examination, Baby Doe was reluctant to use speech. Ex. 15, p. 346. Dr. Hastings concludes thatBaby Doe \"experienced a generalized muscular injury in the form of upper and lower extremitymotor flaccidity with paralysis within the first 24 hours\" after vaccination. Ex. 15, p. 347. Heopines she had a change in mental status with decreased levels of consciousness and cognitivefunction within the first 12-24 hours after vaccination. Id. He also opines that Baby Doe had a seizure within the first 24 hours after vaccination in conjunction with her \"high fever.\" Id. Dr. Hastings attributes Baby Doe's failure to thrive to her vaccine injury as well as herdevelopmental delays in physical function milestones and in speech, cognition, and fine motormovement function. Ex. 15, p. 348. Dr. Hastings concludes that Baby Doe's vaccine injury 42involved her \"central nervous system, brain and neurological systems.\" Id. He states Baby Doe had an encephalopathy with rapid onset after her vaccinations. Ex. 15, p. 350. He opines thatthe vaccines injured Baby Doe's brain and nervous system. Ex. 15, p. 351. He states that thecombination of decreased level of consciousness with cognitive decline and seizures inassociation with flaccid paralysis confirms th at her central nervous system and brain were adversely impacted by her vaccine reaction. Ex. 15, p. 352. Dr. Hastings states thatencephalopathy involves altered levels of consciousness and focal or generalized seizures anddepression of motor (muscle) units. Id. He states that Baby Doe's reduction in her level of consciousness and her paralysis demonstrate that \"her central nervous system and brain werebeing traumatized by an encephalopathic process.\" Id. As for sequelae, Dr. Hastings says that individuals can completely recover or can have persistent adverse clinical features. Id. He opines that Baby Doe suffered neurologic injury as a direct result of her adverse reaction,resulting in failure to thrive, developmental delays physically and in speech and fine motorskills. Ex. 15, p. 353. However, he notes that Baby Doe had substantial clinical improvement inher growth delays and physical milestone delays with the exception of fine motor movement andspeech. Id. He opines that Baby Doe had an immune-stimulated inflammatory encephalopathy and/or an allergic-mediated inflammatory encephalopathy. Id. Baby Doe is too young to assess the extent of her level of learning impairment. Ex. 15, p. 354. Dr. Hastings is an osteopath. Ex.16, p. 1. His Ph.D. thesis was on preimplantation development in the rabbit embryo and he haswritten three articles on this topic. Ex. 16, p. 361. He has also written about placentas ofmyomorph rodents and thrombolysis in myocardial infection. Id. Dr. Hastings has published seven articles. Id. 43Petitioners filed the affidavit dated July 23, 2008 of Sheela McKenney, MSW, LCSW, as exhibit 17. Ms. McKenney is Mrs. Doe's mother. Ex. 17, p. 1. Ms. McKenney is a licensedclinical social worker with a Masters in social work. She works for Sterling Medical to provide mental health services at Ft. Sill. She states Baby Doe was suffering from a clear neurologicalimpairment after her vaccine reaction. Id. (Ms. McKeeney was in Colorado at the time.) Petitioners filed the affidavit dated July 23, 2008 of Dr. Marc A. Hultquist, who was chief of pediatrics at Reynolds Army Community Hospital on January 13, 2005 when Baby Doewas brought into the emergency room with a fever and reduced movement in her legs. Ex. 18, p.1. He ordered a feeding tube to ensure adequate hydration. Multiple tests were ordered todetermine why Baby Doe had reduced movement in her legs. Baby Doe's condition stabilizedand she was discharged from the hospital January 15, 2005. Id. He saw Baby Doe on January 18, 2005 for a follow-up and noted her extremities moved better. Ex. 18, p. 2. When Baby Doewas next seen in the pediatric clinic on July 20, 2005, she had a marked reduction in growth,going from the 90 th % to 5th % in weight \"in just a few months.\" [This was actually six months later.] Id. He finds it medically plausible that Baby Doe's adverse vaccine reaction resulted in significant and sustained neurological injury. Id. Dr. Hultquist submitted an inquiry about Baby Doe to the Vaccine Healthcare Centers Network which is a military support group. Id. They responded that Baby Doe had an adverse reaction and should notify the Vaccine InjuryCompensation Fund. He notified the family about this. Ex. 18, p. 366. Petitioners filed as exhibit 19 the expert report of Dr. G. Steve Miller, a pediatric neurologist. He also examined Baby Doe. Ex. 19, p. 1. Baby Doe had an encephalopathy as aresult of her vaccine reaction. Id. He opines that Baby Doe had a high fever, loss of motor tone, 44especially in the lower extremities, a diminished level of consciousness, and seizure. Id. He obtained the history from Baby Doe's parents in his clinic note. Ex. 19, p. 368. Baby Doe was breastfed until 15 months of age. Id. An hour after Baby Doe's vaccinations, she had 105\u00b0 fever. Baby Doe's legs were not moving and she was lethargic. Her arms seemed fine. Shemoved her hands and arms normally. She did not make eye contact and stared straight ahead as if in a daydream. Baby Doe continued to be lethargic. She did not nurse or cry. Id. Her legs were extended and she would not hold anythi ng. Ex. 19, p. 369. The first night, Mrs. Doe reported that Baby Doe had what appeared to be a seizure with not shutting her eyes and her eyesrolling around involuntarily with eyelid twitching lasting a minute or so. Mrs. Doe told Dr.Miller that the nurse thought this might have been a seizure. During the second and third days,Baby Doe began moving her legs, beginning with her right toes, then right leg, her left toes, andleft leg. Mrs. Doe said Baby Doe was not cooing or smiling. Mrs. Doe said Baby Doe was notfeeding in the hospital so breast milk was given by NG tube. Id. After her discharge, Baby Doe was spacey as if she were not there. The parents felt this was not the same baby. She would notfocus. She just cried. For four to six months, Baby Doe was like a colicky baby all the time. At13 months of age, she was brought back to the pediatric clinic, but she had no interest in eatingor trying new foods. She began sitting alone at 14 to 15 months and walked at 15 to 16 months. She had two words by two years of age. The parents described Baby Doe as anti-social andwithdrawn. Id. Neurological examination showed Baby Doe to be alert and oriented to person, place, and situation. Ex. 19, p. 370. Muscle mass, strength, and tone were normal. Reflexeswere normal and symmetric. Gross and fine motor coordination were intact. Sensoryexamination was grossly intact. Id. Baby Doe passed all gross motor skills tasks up to the six- 45year level. She had only one failure in the personal/social skills test. In the fine motor adaptive skills, she had only one failure. In language skills, she had three failures. Only 40% of herspeech was understandable. Her failures were in defining opposites, five words, andunderstanding four prepositions. Baby Doe's results suggest normal development. However,Dr. Miller said the Denver Developmental Screening Test does not measure expressive speech orarticulation very well. Id. Dr. Miller also wrote a Record Review, dated August 4, 2008. Ex. 19, p. 371. He writes (although this is not written in any contemporaneous record) that Baby Doe had a fever of 105\u00b0within one hour of her four-month vaccinations. She was lethargic, unresponsive, and herextremities, particularly her legs, were limp. He states, \"It is reported that Baby Doe suffered aseizure. However, there is no actual description.\" (There is also no actual record until Mrs. Doemuch later added a seizure to the history of Baby Doe's symptomatology and in other historiesshe gave to providers, added a seizure before she went to Reynolds Army Community Hospitaland stated she had multiple seizures in the hospital. There is no contemporaneous record of anyseizure.) Id. In the emergency room, the upper extremities were normal with free range of motion with the lower extremities mostly lying in a normal anatomical position. Ex. 19, p. 372. Dr. Miller states that after discharge from the hospital, Baby Doe would not make eye contact orrespond to voices or touch. (This is not in a ny contemporaneous medical record, not in Dr. Hultquist's record of January 18, 2005, and not in Dr. Gibbons' record of July 20, 2005 afterBaby Doe spent six months without adequate nut rition.) Mrs. Doe had nutritional consultation. Id. Dr. Miller's professional focus is on seizures and anticonvulsants. Ex. 20, pp. 377-78. He 46has written two published articles, one on epilepsy and the other on pediatric migraine. Ex. 20, p. 378. Petitioners filed the GlaxoSmithKline Prescribing Information for Infanrix (Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed). Ex. 21, pp. 379, 399. Included in contraindications to administ ration of pertussis-containing vaccine is: Encephalopathy (e.g., coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) within 7 days of administration of a previousdose of a pertussis-containing vaccine that is not attributable toanother cause.... Ex. 21, p. 383. Under the heading \"Warnings\" is advice to consider carefully vaccination with Infanrix if a prior vaccination containing acellular pertussis was followed by a temperature of 105\u00b0 F within48 hours not due to another identifiable cause. Ex. 21, p. 383. The information states thatoccurrence of fever increases with successive doses of Infanrix. Ex. 21, p. 386. Under Table 1.

Under Table 7, which reflected a double blind study of severe adverse events occurring within 48 hours after Infanrix vaccination in Italian infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, 5 children (for a rate of 0.36/1000 doses) had a fever up to 104\u00b0 F . Ex. 21, p. 393. In an ongoing U.S. coadministration safety study, Infanrix was given together with 7- valent pneumococcal and HiB conjugate vaccines, hepatitis B recombinant vaccine, andinactivated poliovirus vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Following the first dose at 2 months of age, fever up to 100.4\u00b0 F, 101.3\u00b0 F, 102.2\u00b0 F, and 103.1\u00b0 F occurring within four days was reported in 19.8%, 4.5%, 0.3%, and 0.0% respectively of 333 infants. The frequency ofirritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite was 61.5%, 54%, and 27.8%, respectively. Ex. 21, pp. 393-94. Fewer than 20 reports of encephalopathy were received in worldwide voluntary reports of adverse events si nce market introduction of Infanrix. Ex. 19, p. 394. Respondent filed the expert opinion of Dr. Mi chael Cohen, a pediatric neurologist. Ex. A (this is not petitioners' two exhibits marked A). Dr. Cohen states that Baby Doe's current 49overall developmental delay seems quite minimal. She has no evidence of a static or progressive encephalopathy. Ex. A, p. 2. Rather than an encephalopathy, Baby Doe developed transient fever because of the immunization. Her failure to move her legs resulted from a local reaction toher vaccinations and not from damage to her central or peripheral nervous system. She hadquick resolution of the problem and no chronic or long standing neurologic residua. Baby Doe's overall intelligence seems normal. Dr. Cohen was unaware of any vaccination-induced injurythat specifically targets speech. Speech disorders are commonly seen in children. He believedthat Baby Doe had neither an acute nor chroni c encephalopathy and did not have any residual deficit from her immunizations. She had a local reaction without adverse long-termconsequences. He does not attribute failure to thrive to vaccinations. Ex. A, p. 3. Dr. Cohen isChairman of the Department of Neurology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Ex. B, p. 1. He has written 79 articles, co-authored three books, and written 17 book chapters. Ex.B, pp. 16-24. TESTIMONY Petitioners had seven witnesses. Their first was Mrs. Doe. Tr. at 36.

Id. Mrs. Doe thought it odd that she was still sleeping after an hour. Id. When she tried to rouse Baby Doe, she was still asleep. Tr. at 44. Baby Doe had high heat coming out of her. Her legs were flaccid. She was whiney, irritable, and lethargic. Id. Her legs were just hanging instead of retracting. Id. Whenever she touched Baby Doe, Baby Doe would whine, moan, and arch her back. Id. Baby Doe did not focus on her mother. Tr. at 45. Mrs. Doe called the hospital which informed her that fevers were normal. Id. Baby Doe's temperature was 103 degrees under her arm. Tr. at 46. Mrs. Doe gave Baby Doe Motrinbut it did not lower her fever completely, just to 101 degrees. Tr. at 47. It then went back up. Id. The injections sites were not red or swollen. Tr. at 48. Baby Doe whined all night and did not feed. Id. Mrs. Doe took her to the emergency room on January 13 th. Id. She told Dr. Hultquist in the emergency room that Baby Doe's temperature was 103 degrees at home,although the record states 100.3 degrees. Tr. at 49-50. In the emergency room, Baby Doe'stemperature was 101 degrees after four doses of Motrin. Tr. at 50. Baby Doe was admitted to the hospital on January 13, 2005 and stayed three days. Tr. at 52. Mrs. Doe testified Baby Doe had no movement of her legs and was not responding to hermother normally. Mrs. Doe testified that Baby Doe did not want to nurse. The hospital placedan NG tube in her nose to feed her. Id. At night, while Mrs. Doe was holding Baby Doe, Baby Doe looked the opposite direction of where her mother was. Tr. at 53. Her mother looked downand her eyes were twitching rapidly. Mrs. Doe laid her in her crib and got the nurse. This 51seemed to Mrs. Doe to be a seizure. Id.

Tr. at 61. She did not have any more fever. Id. The reason Mrs. Doe did not take her back to the hospital is that Baby Doe was not having a life threatening problem. She was breat hing, eating, and did not have a temperature. There was no medically emergent reason for her to take Baby Doe back in. She was not in acoma. \"She was just not the same child that I had taken to the hospital that day in January.\" Tr.at 62. Mrs. Doe did not want to take her back to the doctor for months because she did not want 52Baby Doe to receive any more vaccinations. Id. She thought the law required Baby Doe to have immunizations and she did not want to bring Ba by Doe back to have her receive immunizations again. Id. Immunizations would be standard procedure. Id. Three days after Baby Doe was discharged from the hospital, she did see Dr. Hultquist on January 18, 2005. Id. Dr. Hultquist examined Baby Doe. Tr. at 65. Mrs. Doe stated that physically Baby Doe was healthy, but mentally she was not. Tr. at 66. Baby Doe next saw the pediatrician six months later on July 20, 2005. Id. Baby Doe was 11 months old and still breast feeding, but had di fficulty gaining weight. Tr. at 67. Baby Doe was also eating baby cereal. Her mother does not understand why Baby Doe did not gainweight. Id. Baby Doe was in the fifth percentile in weight but she was healthy. Id. Mrs. Doe testified that Baby Doe was not neurologically th e same or normal developmentally. Tr. at 68. Although the record states Baby Doe was pulling hers elf up to standing, Mrs. Doe stated this was not true. Id. She was not sitting up on her own at 11 months. Tr. at 70. Over approximately a year, the failure to thrive aspect of Baby Doe's condition began to resolve. Tr. at 71. At 20months of age, she had gotten to the 50 th to 75th percentile in weight. Tr. at 72. Baby Doe was very immature in speaking. Tr. at 73. By 20 months, Baby Doe was walking. Tr. at 74. Shewas physically healthy. Id. The doctors recommended a developmental pediatric referral for Baby Doe's delayed speaking. Tr. at 74-75. But Mrs. Doe did not get the referral to thedevelopmental pediatrician until July 2008. Tr. at 75. Mrs. Doe described Baby Doe's problems. Baby Doe is understandable only in about 40- 50% of her speech. Tr. at 76. She has been diagnosed with an oral muscle control issue andarticulation disorder. Id. She also has fine motor skill problems such as holding a pencil, 53crayons, and scissors. Tr. at 77. Her hands get tired very quickly. Id. Baby Doe's peers treat her differently. Id. Baby Doe attaches herself to her teachers and to an adult for security. Tr. at 78. Baby Doe's muscle tone is normal. Id. She is very active and keeps up with her brothers. Id. Baby Doe has sensory difficulties in that she does not like any marker on her hand or the commotion at field trips or the zoo. Tr. at 79. Mrs. Doe stated that she considered Baby Doe's not moving her legs in the hospital to be paralysis. Tr. at 91. Baby Doe slowly regained movement by the third day. Id. Mrs. Doe had basic training as an emergency medical technician (EMT). Tr. at 93. She was a certified nursing assistant. Tr. at 94. When Baby Doe was examined on the day after admission, on January 14th, the record states she was moving her lower extremities without difficulty, but Mrs. Doe deniedthat she was completely normal and back to the point she had been pre-vaccination. Tr. at 95,96. The record states that Baby Doe smiled at her mother, but Mrs. Doe denied that this wastrue. Tr. at 96. Mrs. Doe stated that Baby Doe was awake and had her eyes open, but she wasnot moving around. Id. Although the record states that Baby Doe was cooing, her mother stated that this was incorrect. Baby Doe was whining. Id. Mrs. Doe said it was a whine, a sign, a moan and Baby Doe was not blowing bubbles or ba bbling or cooing. Tr. at 97. On the evening of admission, January 13 th, the record states Baby Doe was awake and active. Id. However, Mrs. Doe denied this. She stated that Baby Doe's only activity was arching her back andirritability. Mrs. Doe testified that Baby Doe would not even nurse and was not moving about. Id. The record for January 13 th states that Baby Doe had good suck reflex and good tone in her upper extremities. Tr. at 98-99. Mrs. Doe denied that Baby Doe had good suck on the night 54of her hospital admission. Mrs. Doe stated Baby Doe had an NG tube inserted because she was not breast feeding enough. Tr. at 99. Mrs. Doe testified that by January 14th, Baby Doe would latch on with the NG tube, but the hospital still had to feed her. She stated that Baby Doe wasusing her mother's breast as a pacifier. Id. The hospital records state for January 14 th and 15th that Baby Doe tolerated breast feeding well. Tr. at 100. But Mrs. Doe said when she mentioned Baby Doe breastfed well, she meantthat Baby Doe latched on. Mrs. Doe testified that since Baby Doe was getting her nourishmentthrough an NG tube, she was not nursing to eat. Id. The January 13 th Medical Record Pediatric Admission Assessment states Baby Doe's behavior was appropriate, she was calm with her mother and father, and she cried in thetreatment room during venipunctures and insertion of the feeding tube. Tr. at 101. Mrs. Doe denied that Baby Doe's behavior was appropriate that day: She [Baby Doe] appeared calm to the person who made these reports because when I was holding her she was either probablysleeping is my guess. ... She did cry for her venipuncture, and shedid-but she did not act on a normal level to the child that I broughtin and I knew. Tr. at 101-02. Baby Doe is not followed today by a neurol ogist. Tr. at 102. Dr. Kukas is her developmental pediatrician. Id. When Mrs. Doe brought Baby Doe to see Dr. Hultquist three days after discharge from the hospital for a follow-up, she did not tell him that she had concerns about Baby Doe'sbehavior. Id. Her explanation for not telling Dr. Hultquist her concerns was: I did not because it was obvious to us both that she was recovering, and I wouldn't have expected a child who had had an adverse 55reaction, who had been hospitalized for three days, who had been battling these fevers, to come home and be 100 percent herself. Ihad expected there to be some recovering time, so three days later Iwas just following up on his orders to come back. Tr. at 102-03. The appointment lasted only 15 minutes and Dr . Hultquist did not express any concerns. Tr. at 103. He did examine Baby Doe. Id. Dr. Hultquist told her if there were any concerns with Baby Doe's feeding or fevers to bring her back. Tr. at 104. Mrs. Doe did not bring her back to the doctor because Baby Doe was healthy, had a blood pressure, was breathing, and didnot have a fever. Id. Mrs. Doe stated Baby Doe was healthy. Id. Mrs. Doe stated she did not know that she could bring Baby Doe back for check-ups even if she was not going to beimmunized. She just assumed she did not even need to go to well-baby check-ups if Baby Doewere not going to be immunized any more. Id. Mrs. Doe listed the activities Baby Doe could not do after vaccination that she could do before vaccination: sit up with her Boppy pillow; grab her toes and chew on them; and reach forher toys. Id. Baby Doe was just a ball of personality before the vaccination. Tr. at 104-05. \"The baby that I brought home did recover. She di d start to move. She did gain, but she was not mentally the same child that she was before.\" Tr. at 105. Mrs. Doe's sole reason for bringingBaby Doe to a doctor when Baby Doe was 11 months old was that she was concerned. Id. Mrs. Doe took Baby Doe to Dr. Gibbons on July 20, 2005 complaining of failure to gain weight,failure to thrive, and poor growth. Tr. at 106. Dr. Marc A. Hultquist testified next for petiti oners. Tr. at 113. He is in the Fire Center Brigade, a combined troop medical clinic, taking care of soldiers at Reynolds Army CommunityHospital. Tr. at 113-14. In January 2005, he was ch ief of the pediatric clinic at Reynolds. Tr. at 56114. He was on duty at the emergency room on January 13, 2005 when Baby Doe was brought in with a documented fever. Id. She had reduced movement in her lower extremities. Tr. at 115. She had recently received her four-month immunizations. Id. Mrs. Doe told him that Baby Doe had changed within several hours after she received her immunizations, including a fever. She described Baby Doe as not acting like herself, not moving her lower extremities, and noteating as well. Id. Dr. Hultquist and the ER staff noticed on January 13, 2005 that Baby Doe's intake was down and on his physical examination of Baby Doe, he noticed she was not spontaneouslymoving her lower extremities. Baby Doe would withdraw to pain stimuli in her lowerextremities. Tr. at 116. They did some standard blood tests and a urinalysis as well as anultrasound of her hips. Id. The urine culture was negative. The ultrasound was normal. Id. The nursing staff could not obtain a blood sample so no blood culture was done. Tr. at 117. Dr. Hultquist does not believe that Baby Doe had a localized reaction to the vaccinations in her lower extremities because there was no sign of an infection or significant redness outsidethe normal response to a vaccination. Id. He believes Baby Doe's reaction was systemic which, to him, means both lower extremities symmetrically were involved. Id. He would have expected that if it were a simple localized reaction at the vaccination sites, Baby Doe would havehad more spontaneous movement than she displayed. Tr. at 118. He did not try to elicit pain ather thighs but at the bottom of her feet. Id. He thought Baby Doe might have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome or some neurological problem. Id. The leading diagnosis was that Baby Doe had an adverse reaction to her vaccinations. Tr. at 118-19. It affected her systemically. \"To say whether or not there was an infection 57specifically in the brain, we can't really say that for sure. The CAT scan came back normal.\" Tr. at 119. But, Baby Doe's cognition and alertness were affected. Her ability to eat wasdiminished. Id. A few days after Baby Doe's discharge from the hospital, Dr. Hultquist submitted a VAERS report. Id. He decided on August 9, 2006 to suspend Baby Doe's immunizations because of her adverse reaction. Tr. at 120. Mrs. Doe told him when she brought Baby Doe tothe ER on January 13, 2005 that Baby Doe had had 103 degree fever. Tr. at 122. The note in thehospital record of 100.3 degree temperature was a typographical error. Id. She had 101 degrees in the emergency room. Tr. at 123. During Baby Doe's hospitalization, he entertained a diagnosis of possible viral illness or bacteremia. Tr. at 124. No specific testing was done for a viral illness. They could not culturethe blood for bacteria because they could not obtain a blood sample. Id. The urine culture came back negative. Id. On January 18, 2005, Dr. Hultquist saw Baby Doe for a follow-up three days after her hospital discharge. Tr. at 126. Baby Doe was regaining some of the motion that her mother hadwitnessed prior to her vaccinations but was not at baseline yet. Tr. at 127-28. That was BabyDoe's last visit until July 20, 2005 when she saw Dr. Gibbons. Tr. at 128. In January, Baby Doehad weighed 7.08 kilograms. In July, her wei ght was 7.7 kilograms. A kilogram is 2.2 pounds. On the growth chart, they noted she had not maintained the same normal curve. She was in thefifth percentile in weight in July but she had been a larger baby than that. Id. 58Mrs. Doe told him that the reason she did not bring Baby Doe in for six months was that she was concerned that doctors would try to pressure her to continue Baby Doe's immunizationsand she was scared. Tr. at 129-30. Baby Doe has shown developmental delay over the years. Tr. at 130. She has not reached her normal potential for age. Id. She can walk and run like most children her age, but her speech and fine motor skills are affected. Id. Dr. Hultquist thinks \"it's reasonable to deduce that the event that she had in January is the nidus for the reason why we see the delay that we have at her age now or at the presenttime.\" Tr. at 131. He reported Baby Doe's case and some other case to the Vaccine HealthcareCenters Network, an organization created by the Department of Defense to answer questions regarding immunizations. Tr. at 131. They recommended that he report this for the family forcompensation as the case was consistent with an adverse reaction. Tr. at 132. When Dr.Hultquist submitted the VAERS report, he thought that was what he was doing. Id. Dr. Hultquist never recommended to Mrs. Doe that she take Baby Doe to a pediatric neurologist. Tr. at 133. He did not see her and did not know Baby Doe's progress was delayed until Dr. Gibbons saw her later and then the focus was on her failure to thrive since she was notgaining weight. Id. Dr. Gibbons is another pediatrician. Tr. at 134. I In subsequent medical visits, when the box next to neurological system is checked \"normal,\" that may be true for the problem focused on that visit, but it was not true for Baby Doeoverall since she had speech problems. Tr. at 143. When Baby Doe was one year and sevenmonths, she was noted to have delayed milestones with language and speech and a 59recommendation was made for her to see a developmental pediatrician. Tr. at 145. She saw a pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Jones, for her failure to thrive. Tr. at 145-46. Dr. Hultquist's impression is that Mrs. Doe was always concerned about Baby Doe. Tr. at 148. He felt that Mrs. Doe recognized changes in Baby Doe although he said that, sometimes,he could not validate the extent of what Mrs. Doe saw. Id. He did not always have the same degree of concern that she had. Id. The undersigned asked: THE COURT: What was it that you couldn't validate that [Mrs. Doe] complained to you about in Baby Doe?THE WITNESS: For instance, when she first reported when thechild came in in the emergency room, and I've seen through thechart people have documented flaccid paralysis. Well, in my mindthere was not flaccid paralysis. She was able to generate aresponse to pain stimuli. Not a reflect [reflex], but a response, so itwas something that she actually pulled away from. That would bean example of a discrepancy [between what Mrs. Doe says andmedical opinion in the records]. I wouldn't necessarily - it hasn'tbothered me, that difference, because the mother is a layperson. She's not a doctor. So I felt like her reporting has been veryconsistent. I just wouldn't report necessarily the same degree ofconcern that mothers always display. Tr. at 148-49. Dr. Hultquist did not recall whether Mrs. Do e ever told him that Baby Doe's eyes had moved horizontally rapidly for a few seconds the first night she was in the hospital. Tr. at 149-50. Dr. Hultquist is board-certified in pediatrics. Tr. at 152. He has had a change in status since the time he saw Baby Doe and now sees 19- and 20-year-olds as well as soldiers in their fortiesand fifties. Tr. at 152-53. He became the chief of the Reynolds pediatric clinic in May 2005and served in that capacity until August 2008. Tr. at 153-54. They had 3,000 patients impaneledto them and saw 18 to 23 patients a day. Tr. at 154. There were about 45 to 65 babies deliveredeach month that they were caring for. Id. 60Dr. Hultquist remembers Baby Doe because making a diagnosis of adverse reaction to an immunization is not something he does very often. Tr. at 156. In fact, Baby Doe is probably the only patient he saw who had an adverse vaccine reaction. Id. He has submitted two or three vaccine immunization adverse reports when he was at Reynolds, \"and none are more significant as what Baby Doe had gone through.\" Id. He did not take any viral samples and does not believe Baby Doe had a viral infection. Tr. at 156-57. Dr. Hultquist stated: In this case I couldn't come up with a good explanation for why she had the event that she did other than the immunization. Shehad a response within just a few hours, a coincidental viralinfection which is sometimes an explanation for other children, butjust doesn't seem to have played out with her. She had a dramatic,like I said, response, and her recovery was quite quick. I don'tmean that she recovered completely, but she went to the pointwhere she wasn't eating and we helped her sustain her fluids withan oral gastric tube to being discharged and being able to maintainherself on her own in just a few days. ... Her drop and her recoveryjust seemed to be a lot more dramatic than the normal course of aninfection. Tr. at 156-57. Dr. Hultquist saw Baby Doe in the emergency room and had her admitted to the hospital where he handed her care to Dr. Davis, his part ner and another pediatrician. Tr. at 159. Baby Doe was in the hospital for three days. Dr. Hult quist read a note from Dr. Davis's handwriting: \"Child did well overnight. No fever. Child fed well. Mother reports improved activity. Noacute distress. Vital signs stable. General assessment: awake and alert, nontoxic. She had arash on her trunk and neck. He suspected a viral syndrome, normal reaction to immunizations. Muscle soreness. Discharge to home.\" Tr. at 160-61. He and Dr. Davis never discussed Baby 61Doe after he handed her care to Dr. Davis. Tr . at 162. Dr. Hultquist ended up seeing Baby Doe during the three-day follow-up. Id. Dr. Davis stated in his notes under \"Assessment\" that Baby Doe had full range of motion and he noticed responses in her upper and lower extremities. Tr. at 162-63. His suspicion thatBaby Doe had a normal reaction to her immunizati ons disagrees with Dr. Hultquist's diagnosis. Tr. at 163. Dr. Hultquist believes th at Baby Doe had an encephalopathy: Well, I believe - at the time I did not feel like she was having an encephalopathic event or brain swelling, but I think that herdecreased awareness or the global effect that she had could beconsistently interpreted as an encephalopathy. Id. When asked to define \"encephalopathy,\" Dr. Hultquist said: Well, I would be looking for brain swelling, but just because we didn't see brain swelling on that CAT scan doesn't mean that anevent wasn't having an impact on her globally on her brain. Id. An EEG was not done. Tr. at 164. Dr. Hultquist based his diagnosis on Baby Doe's symptoms such as alertness and ability to eat being affected. Tr. at 166-67. He also th inks the effect on her lower legs was a sign of a systemic event. Tr. at 167. He did not have enough testing to know if that happened fromsomething going on in the brain. Id. Baby Doe was given a nasogastric tube for rehydration when attempts to use an IV failed. Tr. at 168. He would have expected her to have a lower levelof fluids due to her temperature and reduced f eeding but they were not seeing that lower fluid effect at that point. Id. He thinks Baby Doe was behind in fl uids but did not have clinical signs of it. Tr. at 169. Dr. Hultquist is not saying that Baby Doe's inability to move her legs was due to brain swelling or pressure. Tr. at 174. He continued: 62I'm trying to say I think there was an adverse reaction in the sense that maybe antibodies - you know, you can't have an allergicreaction if you've never been exposed to something before, so ifthis was the first time she had received the immunizations at twomonths of life I couldn't even really entertain an adverse reactionbecause she wouldn't have been exposed to these things before. But in this case she had been exposed to these immunizations ather two month period, and now you've got antibodies that canmake a response. They can make a violent and very quickresponse. Tr. at 174-75. He continued: I'm saying that the antibody response may have somehow affected the brain. Again, I'm not trying to say you had brain swelling,encephalopathy. I'm just saying that are these symptoms similar toencephalopathy in that globally she's somehow affected? Yes, butnot in the sense that you would have every system affected. Tr. at 175. Dr. Hultquist said that whatever effect happened occurred immediately. Tr. at 176. He called it some type of allergic reaction. Id. He said: Again, I don't want to mislead you and try to tell you that she had an encephalopathic event in which you might see a bacterialmeningitis because I don't think that she had an infection going on. I think she has an internal response, and through that internalresponse you were seeing the manifestations. And that's why Ithink she got better so quickly because it was the body turning onand turning off its reaction more so than - it wasn't the chemicalattacking her body. ... From the immunization. But it was herbody's response to the chemical that was introduced that wasproducing the global effect. Tr. at 176-77. Dr. Hultquist felt that because both of Baby Doe's legs responded, she was having more of a systemic reaction. Tr. at 178. Dr. Hultquist read from the inpatient note in the medical records that Baby Doe turned her head both left and right toward the directi on of noises without difficulty and reached out to 63grasp objects without difficulty. She had equal st rength bilaterally to grasp and moved her left leg without difficulty. She moved her right leg le ss than her left leg. Tr. at 180. She had equal palmar grasp bilaterally to her feet and moved her toes bilaterally without difficulty. Her rightleg was relaxed. She smiled at her mother and made cooing sounds. Id. He called these reassuring signs that they would use as supporting evidence to send the child home from thehospital. Tr. at 181. The medical records for January 14 th note that Baby Doe breastfed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then that she tolerated breast feeding well, but do not say how much milk she got. Tr. at 182. Baby Doe was discharged on January 15 th. Tr. at 183. What impressed Dr. Hultquist was how quickly things occurred and how quickly things got better. Tr. at 183-84. He admittedthat the nursing note stated Baby Doe was awake and active. Tr. at 184. The next day, BabyDoe is noted to be awake, alert, with her eyes open bilaterally. Id. Mrs. Doe said Baby Doe was moving her legs in spurts, although Dr. Hultquist te stified that she was not moving her legs. Tr. at 184-85. The notes also say that Baby Doe moved her lower extremities without difficulty. Dr. Hultquist took issue with the qualifications of the nurses because they were not pediatric- trained. Tr. at 185. Dr. Hultquist does not know what was the cause of the rash on Baby Doe's neck and chest, but he thinks the rash was the reason that his partner Dr. Davis concluded that Baby Doehad a viral syndrome. Tr. at 186. It was a valid reason at the time. Tr. at 187. Because the nurses' notes are handwritten, Dr. Hultquist does not have any doubt that this is what the nurses saw, unlike the computer-generated notes. Id. Dr. Hultquist has the same training in neurology as any other pediatrician. Id. 64Dr. Hultquist stated that when he was admitting Baby Doe into the hospital from the emergency room, he did not believe she was having a vaccine reaction although Mrs. Doe did. Tr. at 188. He did not think Baby Doe had flaccid paralysis. There was still tone in the way Baby Doe held her legs although she was not moving them spontaneously. She did have strengthto withdraw to pain. Tr. at 189. Baby Doe's decreased leg motion could have been due to amuscular reason or a neurological one. Tr . at 189-90. He was more concerned about bacteremia, i.e., a septic hip. Tr. at 190. He was also considering whether Baby Doe hadGuillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Tr. at 191. He was also considering a urinary tract infection. Id. Dr. Hultquist continued regarding his later opinion that the vaccination was responsible for BabyDoe's later speech delay and fine motor difficulties: You know, you're asking me today can I prove a cause and effect. No, I can't, but in my opinion I have no better explanation, and themost probable cause of her deficits today go back to a child whohad a significant event that affected her in a couple ways globallywith a systemic reaction validated by the fever that it's veryprobable. I don't have any other evidence to be able to show youthat it's other. When you have to use a diagnosis of exclusion, youknow, at some point you have to draw a line in how many moretests you're going to run on a child. When she starts to improveover the course of 24 hours, you're not going to order more tests. You're going to let the child get better and quit poking andprodding and everything. Tr. at 192. Dr. Hultquist saw Baby Doe three days after her hospital discharge. Tr. at 192-93. Baby Doe had full range of motion without swelling or induration. Tr. at 193. Dr. Hultquist clicked on the boxes stated Baby Doe was awake, alert, oriented, in no acute distress, and appearedhealthy and well-hydrated. Id. On January 18 th, Dr. Hultquist believed that Baby Doe had an adverse reaction to her vaccination but no neurological symptoms. Tr. at 194. 65Any time someone injects a needle into tissue, there is obviously incurring damage. But he never had to admit a child for a localized reaction to a vaccine. Tr. at 196. Dr. Hultquist doesnot know which of Baby Doe's multiple vaccines caused her injury. However, the polio or thepertussis historically caused a lot of fevers. Id. He would pick the pertussis as the cause. Id. He had very little contact with Baby Doe after January 18 th. Tr. at 198. Blanche D. Coleman testified next for petitioner. Tr. at 201. She is a licensed practical nurse at Reynolds Army Community Hospital. Id. She has worked at the immunization and allergy clinic at Reynolds for 27 years. Tr. at 202-03. The procedure at Reynolds for immunization is that: (1) children under the age of two have to be seen by the Reynolds doctorfor a well baby appointment, (2) the doctor orders the vaccinations, and then (3) the childrencome to the immunization clinic to get their shot. Tr. at 203. At the immunization clinic, theylook at the doctor's orders and then they go through the sheets for particular vaccines with themother to make sure that the baby has not had any problems with any previous vaccinations orother medications or has any allergies. Id. Nurse Coleman administered the vaccinations to Baby Doe on January 12, 2005. Tr. at 204. Baby Doe received her second acellular DPT, her second Comvax (HiB and hepatitis B),and inactivated polio vaccines. Tr. at 204-05. Mrs. Doe contacted Nurse Coleman when BabyDoe was in the emergency room. Tr. at 205. Nurse Coleman had checked Baby Doe during the15-20 minutes post-vaccination before she left the immunization clinic after receiving thevaccines and there was no localized reaction at the injection sites. Tr. at 206, 208. Dr. G. Steven Miller testified next for petitioners. Tr. at 209. He is a pediatric neurologist. Tr. at 210. He performed an eval uation of Baby Doe. Tr. at 211. His opinion is 66that Baby Doe had an adverse reaction to her January 12, 2005 vaccinations. Tr. at 213. He would select the pertussis vaccine as the most likely cause of her encephalopathy. Id. The basis for his opinion is Baby Doe had fever within hours of her immunization. Id. In addition, the physicians in the hospital did a number of tests which displays their concern. Tr. at 214. Mrs.Doe noted that Baby Doe was lethargic, without ey e contact, and stared straight ahead, as if she were in a daydream state. Id. He believes that Baby Doe's acute encephalopathy was followed by a chronic encephalopathy, whose residua is her speech delay, fine motor delay, and sensoryintegration problems. Tr. at 215. Dr. Miller thinks a fever of 103\u00b0 is significant. Tr. at 216. She was able to sit up with side support before vaccination, but after the vaccination, could not. Id. Dr. Miller stated that encephalopathy was injury or damage to the brain. Tr. at 217. The vaccines induced BabyDoe's encephalopathy leading to her residua. Tr. at 217-18. He does not agree withrespondent's expert Dr. Cohen's opinion that Baby Doe had a transient fever in reaction to her vaccinations and her failure to move her legs was due to a localized reaction at the site of theinjections. Tr. at 218. Dr. Miller does not th ink there are any facts to support Dr. Cohen's opinion. Id. There was no mention in the hospital records of any swelling or induration of Baby Doe's legs. Tr. at 219. Someone can have a vaccine-induced encephalopathy without a local reaction at the vaccine site. Id. Dr. Miller believes that Baby Doe's neurological impairment continues. Id. Dr. Miller obtained a history of what happene d to Baby Doe from the parents and looked at some of the medical records prior to seeing Baby Doe. Tr. at 221. His notation that Baby Doe had 105\u00b0 temperature came from the parents and not from the medical records. Tr. at 222. Some 67of the information that the parents gave him is corroborated in the medical records and some of it is not corroborated in the medical records. Id. What was not corroborated in the medical records was how Baby Doe was subsequent to the immunizations, such as when they returnedhome, on the fifth day, she cried constantly and arched her back, that this was not the same baby,that she had no focus and just cried, and that from four to six months, she cried all the time like acolicky baby. Id. This information was not documented in the medical records. Tr. at 223. He explained Baby Doe's parents not seeking medical assistance for Baby Doe by their fear of her having more vaccinations. Id. Dr. Miller believes that Baby Doe became encephalopathic within one hour of being vaccinated. Tr. at 224. He thinks a significantly decreased level of consciousness is indicated by one of three things, including decreased eye contact, inconsistent response to external stimuli,or decreased response to the environment. Tr. at 225. From Mrs. Doe's history, Baby Doe lostdevelopment and was not fully responsive in that she stared straight ahead and did not make eyecontact. Tr. at 225-26. Based on Baby Doe's decreas ed or absent eye contact, he thinks she had an encephalopathy. Tr. at 227. He did not s ee anything in the medical records that would support that Baby Doe had absent eye contact and did not look at her family members or others. Tr. at 228. Dr. Miller said that if Baby Doe was not lethargic, did have eye contact, was not in a daydream state, and was not staring straight ah ead, then she would not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of encephalopathy. Tr. at 231-32. Dr. Miller said that electronic medical records do not provide the same information as the old written information. Tr. at 236. The information 68pointed out to him was in longhand and is probably more valid than the electronic medical records. He thinks it is good documentation. Id. Sheela McKenney, Baby Doe's maternal grandmother, testified next for petitioners. Tr. at 238. Before petitioners moved to Oklahoma, both Ms. McKenney and they were in Colorado. Tr. at 239. She moved to Oklahoma in June 2005. Id. Mrs. Doe called Ms. McKenney from the emergency room close to hysteria, saying Baby Doe had not been able to move her legs and hada high fever. Tr. at 240. Mrs. Doe was in a panic. Id. The hospital staff initially questioned the parents to find out if any abuse had occurred. Tr. at 242. Ms. McKenney kept in touch. Eventually, Baby Doe's fever decreased and she started moving one of her legs and then theother one. Id. During the next five or six months, Mrs. Doe said that Baby Doe did not get back the energy she had and was not progressing. She was not the same bouncy, happy child she hadbeen before. Tr. at 243. She could move both her legs and did not have fevers, seizures, or medical concerns requiring medical attention. It was just a slow recovery. Id. Ms. McKenney moved back to Oklahoma in June 2005 and saw Baby Doe. Tr. at 239. She was surprised to see how tiny she was. She was not very active, but was quiet and reserved. Tr. at 243. Baby Doe did not engage with her over time and seemed to have a differentpersonality than when Ms. McKenney remembered from before. Id. Baby Doe was not growing as she should have. Her mother took her back to the doctor with Ms. McKenney'sencouragement. Tr. at 244. Baby Doe had a diagnosis of failure to thrive. Id. Mrs. Doe had a fear of Army hospitals and of medical doctors. Id. They thought that Baby Doe had almost died. 69Tr. at 245. Mrs. Doe had not established a good relationship with the physicians at Fort Sill and did not know if she could trust them. Id. During those months, Baby Doe was never sick enough to warrant a visit to the doctor again because of anything significant such as diarrhea or vomiting so, combined with Mrs. Doe'sfear, she chose not to return. Tr. at 245. They did not realize what the diagnosis of failure to thrive meant until a few months later. Tr. at 246. When Ms. McKenney worked at a hospital in Lawton, she realized that childprotective services usually got involved most times when children were diagnosed with failure tothrive. Id. In addition, \"we weren't sure that people were believing us that we were feeding Baby Doe, you know, we were taking care of her and she still wasn't growing caused a lot ofalarm.\" Id. Ms. McKenney went with her daughter and Ba by Doe to Dr. Hultquist's office. Tr. at 247. She was concerned that because of the failure to thrive diagnosis, Baby Doe might betemporarily removed from her home as she had seen in her work as a social worker. Id. Ms. McKenney wanted to know if Dr. Hultquist t hought that Mrs. Doe was neglecting Baby Doe in not giving her the proper food. Tr. at 248. Dr. Hultquist reassured them. Id. Dr. Richard Hastings, an internist, testified next for petitioners. Tr. at 251. His original specialty was anatomy. Tr. at 251-52. He then became an osteopath. Tr. at 252. His practice as an internist does not involve the routine care and treatment of pediatric patients. Tr. at 254. He does not routinely see children. Tr. at 256. Dr. Hastings did an examination on Baby Doebefore Dr. Miller did. Tr. at 261. He described \"encephalopathy\" as any diffuse injury, disease, or damage to a brain structure or brain functi on. Tr. at 263-64. The National Institutes of Health 70have listed some factors to consider for a diagnosis of encephalopathy, including an alteration in mental status. Someone might have memory loss or cognitive loss, subtle personality changes,inability to concentrate, lethargy, a progressive loss of consciousness, myoclonus, involuntarytwitching of muscle groups, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements), tremors, muscleatrophy, muscle weakness, dementia, seizures, or loss of the ability to swallow or the ability tospeak. Tr. at 264. Dr. Hastings considers Baby Doe to have had an encephalopathy because she had an alteration of mental status or lethargy. Tr. at 265. Mrs. Doe noticed brief horizontal rapid eye movement which is nystagmus. Tr. at 266. The kind of neurological deficits that Baby Doe has can result from an encephalopathic event. Tr. at 269. Someone can have an encephalopathicevent without having a localized reaction at the injection sites. Id. Someone could have soreness in the legs if someone had injections in the legs. Tr. at 271. Dr. Hastings said that encephalopathy can aff ect very focal areas of the brain. Tr. at 278. He did not think someone had \"to have 24 hours a day, seven days a week of it.\" Id. His opinion is that the vaccinations of January 12, 2005 caused encephalopathy in Baby Doe. Tr. at280. He does not find any alternate cause. Tr. at 281. Dr. Hastings has never taken any formal classwork in developmental abnormalities in children other than medical school and independent reading. Tr. at 283. He testifies \"quite a bit in the area of injury.\" Id. He has \"a pretty sizeable practice with the U.S. military people.\" Id. He would say that litigation matters have evolved over the last eight or nine years to includeprobably 75 or 80 percent of what he does. Tr. at 284. He has testified 10 to 15 times in courtover the last eight years. Id. 71Dr. Hastings considers any temperature over 100.5\u00b0 to be a high fever. Tr. at 289. In the hospital, Baby Doe's fever was documented on several occasions as 101\u00b0 which he considers tobe a high fever. Tr. at 289-90. Dr. Hastings based his conclusion that Baby Doe had upper and lower extremity neuromuscular motor flaccidity with temporary near paralysis on the way Mrs.Doe explained Baby Doe to him. Tr. at 290. The records indicate that Baby Doe had some lessthan normal functional activities in her lower extremities. Tr. at 290-91. Dr. Hastings said thathe could understand why a lay person would think this was paralysis, but he did not believe thatit was permanency of a loss of function in the lower extremities. Tr. at 291. Dr. Hastings based his conclusion that Baby Doe had a decrease in her level of consciousness with cognitive decline from the notation in the record that she was lethargic andthe mother's history that Baby Doe did not seem to be as conscious in terms of interacting withher as she had been. Id. He connects cognitive change to the lethargy and concedes \"[m]aybe that's not the correct term,\" but Baby Doe was not interacting normally with her mother. Id. Dr. Hastings based his conclusion that Baby Doe had a seizure on the mother's history to him that Baby Doe had rapid eye motion, although no one diagnosed Baby Doe as having aseizure while she was hospitalized. Tr. at 291-92. Baby Doe did not have upper extremityflaccidity. Tr. at 292. If he had been Baby Doe' s treating doctor, he would have thought it was a case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Id. He believes there is an autoimmune attack of some manner or immunological attack upon the myelin of Baby Doe's lower extremity nerve groupsthat was causing her problems. Tr. at 293. It di d not turn out to be GBS, but it looked like a neurological attack or injury. Tr. at 294. Dr. Hastings' opinion is that Baby Doe had an 72encephalopathic event. Id. Her CT scan was normal. Id. Baby Doe was not diagnosed with GBS or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis because she did not have it. Tr. at 295. Dr. Hastings had no opinion about what Mrs. Doe was talking about when she said that Baby Doe would arch her back. Tr. at 296-97. Baby Doe was not in a coma. Tr. at 297. Hethinks that Baby Doe's problems later with speech are due to the initiating event. Tr. at 298. Shawn Andrew Brewer, Baby Doe's father, tes tified next for petitioner. Tr. at 306. He basically said that all his wife had said was what he would describe. Tr. at 307. Dr. Michael E. Cohen, a pediatric neurologist , testified for respondent. Tr. at 308. He was board-certified in 1969 with recertification in 2004. Tr. at 310. He has served as a seniorexaminer of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology for over 20 years. Id. The Board is the certifying agency for all neurologists and child neurologists in the United States who seekrecognition. Id. Dr. Cohen has developed questions for those boards and also examined doctors wishing to be certified. Tr. at 311. He is al so board-certified in clinical neurophysiology. Id. Dr. Cohen thinks it a difficult question whet her or not Baby Doe had an encephalopathy. Tr. at 312. She did have a reaction to her vaccination which was both local and systemic. Thesystemic reaction was characterized by fever and lethargy. The local reaction was characterizedby her refusing to use her legs. Tr. at 312. The whole reaction was very short-lived and resolvedover a period of 48 or less hours. Id. When the undersigned asked to what he attributed Baby Doe's deficits, such as speech and fine motor, Dr. Cohen responded that was a difficult question to answer with any conviction or firmness because many children have language problems. Id. Baby Doe has normal intelligence and seems to have normal understanding. Id. She seems to have normal 73development and has no really defined motoric abnormalities, although her fine motor control is arguably abnormal. Tr. at 313. What Baby Doe cannot do is form her words correctly. This iscalled phonologic abnormality. It happens to every child as they learn to speak. Id. It is not clear to Dr. Cohen if Baby Doe was delayed in babbling. Id. He does not know what the fine motor movement problems mean. Tr. at 314. He does not think that Baby Doe's holding apencil awkwardly is indicative of an abnormal nervous system. Id. Dr. Cohen does not know what a sensory problem means. Id. A child's tendency not to want to be touched or to avoid sensation is more behavioral than indicative of an abnormal nervous system. Tr. at 315. That is not the way our nervous system develops. Id. Dr. Cohen does not know what the developmen tal pediatrician Dr. Kukas's notation of hypotonia of Baby Doe's oral motor muscles means. Id. Baby Doe is not hypotonic by any measure of the imagination and she was never flaccid. Id. She did have trouble moving her legs, but she was never flaccid as that term implies, i.e., an abnormality, a paralysis. Id. Dr. Cohen stated that when someone examines a child neurologically, he tries to determine what part of the nervous system is involved. Tr. at 316. In Baby Doe's situation, thatis very difficult to know. Her arms were okay, she was awake, and she was feeding normally. Id. Certainly, there was nothing wrong with her br ain. Maybe there was something wrong in her spinal cord. Id. GBS was unlikely. Id. Dr. Cohen testified that no one did a good neurological examination of Baby Doe when she was admitted to the hospital. Tr. at 317. No one tested her deep tendon reflexes. Id. GBS would not occur where the arms are spared and only the legs are involved. Id. Baby Doe might have had a transverse myelitis. Id. Dr. Cohen could not localize Baby Doe's abnormality to a 74specific part of her nervous system based on the record and the various doctors who examined her. Id. He does not think that Baby Doe's failure to move her legs reflected damage to her nervous system. Id. On the other hand, her lethargy, fever, maybe the irritability, and her not being as responsive as she was previously probably was a neurologic reaction. Id. Dr. Cohen stated that he had no doubt that the parents were correct in saying something happened to Baby Doe. Tr. at 317-18. Dr. Cohe n testified that the systemic reaction was neurologic. Baby Doe had fever, lethargy, and less responsiveness to her mother. That is aneurologic reaction. Tr. at 318. But that does not mean it left a permanent sequelae. Id. Dr. Cohen pinpointed the reticular activating system, the part of the nervous system that keeps usawake, as the place where Baby Doe's nervous system problem resided. Tr. at 319. It is locatedin the middle of the brain. Tr. at 320. Dr. C ohen thought her problem could be there or Baby Doe had a diffuse problem that involved the entir e substance of the whole brain. Tr. at 321. He agreed that encephalopathy means some kind of disease process in the brain. Id. Someone with either a reticular activating system in the middle of the brain or a whole brain problem can havean encephalopathy. Id. Dr. Cohen agrees that Baby Doe had an encephalopathy, but he would say it was probably a transient encephalopathy. Tr. at 322. If someone had a high fever with analteration in the level of awareness, or some one got drunk and did not know what he was doing, those could be an encephalopathy. Id. Dr. Cohen testified that an encephalopathy that led to sequelae would have a continuous line. Id. You would see a continuous line and not a patient looking bad one minute and perfectly normal the next minute, but six months later, looking bad again. Id. If there were permanent sequelae, the child would not awaken, would not be alert, would not walk 75appropriately, would not use her hands appropr iately, would not be aware, and would have decreased cognition. Tr. at 323. Dr. Cohen stated that Baby Doe had her series of vaccinations and had pain in her legs where she had two vaccinations in each leg. Tr. at 327. The vaccinations are commonlyassociated with a systemic reaction of fever. Sometimes the white count rises and the childbecame lethargic and irritable. Id. The child does not have to get inflammation to have a lot of pain and soreness in her legs. Tr. at 328. There is no evidence that Baby Doe's nervous systemwas compromised based on her examination. A child with a 101\u00b0 fever does not usually get a lotof attention. When the temperature goes up to 103,\u00b0 104,\u00b0 or 105,\u00b0 that is when you payattention. Id. Baby Doe's fever in the hospital was very low grade. It would not have concerned anyone that she was infected. Id. Mrs. Doe was able to breast feed her. A child does not breast feed unless she is hungry and can bond with the mother. Id. The hospital put in the nasogastric tube to keep Baby Doe hydrated, but it does not have enough calories in thePedialyte. Tr. at 329. Dr. Cohen could not an swer why breast feeding Baby Doe would not have kept Baby Doe hydrated. Id. The next day after Baby Doe went to the hospital, she was doing better and, two days later, she was home. Tr. at 329-30. The doctors did not tell Mrs. Doe that Baby Doe had aproblem or may be developmentally delayed. Tr. at 332. When Baby Doe walked at 15 or 16 months, that was a normal milestone. Tr. at 333. When Baby Doe went to the clinic on July 20, 2005 and they identified her milestones, she wasfunctioning at a normal level. Tr. at 334. At 11 m onths of age, she could feed herself with her fingers, respond to her name, sit independently, crawl, creep, pull to a standing position, and 76play patty cake. Id. She was starting to prehend, i.e., pick up small objects. Tr. at 334-35. She started to prehend between nine and 15 months. Tr. at 335. Dr. Cohen stated that speech problems are very common and, for most children, we do not have a focus in the nervous system allowing us to say where that speech problem is or how itdeveloped. Id. He does not know of any disease that causes those problems. Tr. at 335-36. His opinion is that Baby Doe's encephalopathy was minimal. Tr. at 336. She came into the hospitalwith fever, lethargy, and some staring. By the time she left the hospital, she was normal. Shewas alert, active, playful, smiling, and feeding. That is not encephalopathy. Id. He does not know what caused her speech problem or if she will have it in the future. Tr. at 337. He doesnot know of any encephalopathic problem that will end this way. Id. Dr. Cohen testified that \"the problem of a language delay in a child who was cognitively normal does not make any sense to me in terms of a sequelae of an adverse reaction....\" Tr. at348. Baby Doe's main problems are her socialization and her language. Tr. at 349. She mayhave some motor skills impairment but they are minor and will resolve at some point. Id. Dr. Cohen said, in reference to the comparison of Mrs. Doe's testimony and the records, \"I can'tlook at this record with all the people that have seen [Baby Doe] subsequently and say in factthat [her mother is] right and everybody else is wrong. I mean, I just don't know how I can dothat.\" Tr. at 352. Dr. Cohen knows that Baby Doe has an expr essive language disorder (the phonologic aspect), but does not know that she has an expressi ve disorder as Dr. Kukas states in her report. Tr. at 357. It is not clear to him that Baby Do e has an oral dysphagia. Tr. at 358. He does not know how Dr. Kukas thinks Baby Doe has possible hyperacusis (abnormal central auditory 77processing). Id. He does not believe for one moment that Baby Doe has hypotonia or poor body awareness in space. Id. Baby Doe does have behavioral problems such as separation anxiety, temper tantrums, and social abnormalities, which are all behavioral in nature and relateto the family situation. Id. This is a military family with four children and lots of stress. Id. Dr. Kukas prescribes things that are out of the main stream of medical thinking in terms of eating and foods. Id. Dr. Kukas recommended giving Baby Doe vitamins. Tr. at 368. Dr. Cohen is unaware of how vitamins will help attention deficit disorder. Id. Dr. Kukas seems to think that a high carbohydrate load would alter Baby Doe's behavior and recommended she increase proteinand reduce carbohydrates. Id. Pediatricians have a very difficult time de fining what \"hypotonia\" means. Tr. at 359. The word \"hypotonia\" means abnormal resistance to movement. Id. A child who is walking, has normal reflexes, can climb on a chair, can get out of chair, and can climb stairs is nothypotonic. Tr. at 359-60. Dr. Kukas also talk s about hypotonia in oral motor ability and Dr. Cohen has no idea what she is talking about. Tr. at 360. If Baby Doe had paralysis of her facialmusculature, then yes, she has hypotonia. Id. Hypotonia does not just mean muscle weakness. It means decreased tone, not weakness. Tr. at 361. Dr. Kukas has no factual evidence to supporther diagnosis of Baby Doe with residual developmental delays and encephalopathy related to heradverse reaction to her four-month vaccinations. Id. Dr. Cohen admits that Baby Doe had a neurological injury to her central nervous system. Tr. at 364. Baby Doe had a neurologic event from which she had a complete recovery. Theevent lasted a short period of time. She went home from the hospital and was perfectly normal. Tr. at 365. Some time later, Baby Doe went to the doctor and had some difficulty with language. 78Id. Baby Doe does not have any specific insult to he r brain that would suggest in fact that her nervous system is damaged. Tr. at 366. Baby Doe may have some developmental defects thatcause her to have poor language, but he also thinks that her language will improve. He thinksshe has developmental language delay independent of the vaccination. Id. On July 20, 2005, Baby Doe's overall intelligence seemed to be normal. Her cognition was normal. Dr. Cohen thought that if she had major neurological problems, her cognitionwould be decreased. Tr. at 370. DISCUSSION To satisfy their burden of proving causation in fact, petitioners must prove by preponderant evidence \"(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury;(2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for theinjury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.\" Althen v. Secretary of HHS , 418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In Althen , the Federal Circuit quoted its opinion in Grant v. Secretary of HHS , 956 F.2d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1992): A persuasive medical theory is demonstrated by \"proof of a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was thereason for the injury[,]\" the logical sequence being supported by\"reputable medical or scientific explanation[,]\" i.e., \"evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medical testimony[.]\" The first and third prongs of Althen are not in dispute here. Respondent accepts that pertussis vaccine can cause serious encephalopathy with permanent sequelae and that an adversereaction to pertussis vaccine can occur the same day as vaccination. The issue in this case is the second prong of Althen , i.e., is there a logical sequence of cause and effect between (1) (a) pain from two vaccinations in each thigh causing a five-month-old baby not to move her legs for a 79couple of days and (b) fever causing a transient encephalopathy consisting of brief lethargy, anorexia, and fussiness, and (2) failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration issues in a child not provided suffici ent nutrition from the ages of five to 11 months who also has a family history of speech delay and of immaturity in adaptive and emotionalskills? Without more, \"evidence showing an absence of other causes does not meet petitioners' affirmative duty to show actual or legal causation.\" Grant , 956 F.2d at 1149. Mere temporal association is not sufficient to prove causation in fact. Id. at 1148. Doctors such as Dr. Hultquist in the instant action stating that Baby Doe's failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motordelay, and social integration issues had to be caused by her transient encephalopathy becausethere is no other cause do not assist petitioners in proving their case since the Federal Circuitrequires petitioners to fulfill an affirmative duty to show actual or legal causation. Petitioners must show not only that but fo r the vaccine, Baby Doe would not have had failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems, but also that thevaccine was a substantial factor in bringing about her failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motordelay, and social integration problems. Shyface v. Secretary of HHS , 165 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Petitioners do not allege a Table injury of encephalopathy in this case because Baby Doe cannot meet the requirements for a Table injury of encephalopathy as listed in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7100.3(b)(2)(i)(A), which include \"a significantly decreased level of consciousness lasting for atleast 24 hours.\" \"A significantly decreased level of consciousness\" is defined as requiring one ofthe following three clinical signs for at least 24 hours or greater under subsection (D)(1), (2), and 80(3): decreased or absent response to environment, decreased or absent eye contact, or inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli. Subsection (E) states that the followingclinical features alone, or in combination, do not demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of consciousness: irritability (fussiness), andsleepiness. A causation in fact encephalopathy is less serious than a Table encephalopathy because any petitioner who could assert a Table encephalopathy would do so in order to benefit from thepresumption of causation attached to a Table injury. Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary , 30th ed. (2003) at p. 610 defines \"encephalopathy\" as \"any degenerative disease of the brain.\" Stedman's Medical Dictionary , 27th ed. (2000) at p. 588 defines \"encephalopathy\" as \"Any disorder of the brain.\" Based on the evidence before the undersigned, unless fever causing lethargy and fussiness is considered adegenerative disease or disorder of the brai n, the undersigned would hold that Baby Doe did not have an encephalopathy. No treating doctor at the time Baby Doe was in Reynolds ArmyCommunity Hospital for her adverse reaction to pertussis vaccine (and possible viral illness)diagnosed her with encephalopathy. She was never referred to a neurologist and she never saw aneurologist until her parents filed a petition under this Program and their attorney directed themand Baby Doe to Dr. Miller who wrote an expert report and testified for petitioners. Respondent's expert Dr. Cohen provided testimony that conflicted with his expert report in which he opined that Baby Doe did not have an encephalopathy. Dr. Cohen inched his way into the diagnosis of encephalopathy by first te stifying that he thought Baby Doe's reaction was neurologic. The following colloquy occurred: 81THE COURT: you say there was a neurologic reaction? THE WITNESS: I think the systemic reaction was neurologic, yes.THE COURT: Could you explain what that means?THE WITNESS. Well, yes. I mean, I think that the child hadfever. I think the child was lethargic and the child probably wasnot as responsive to the mother as she had been even - I don'tknow - the previous day or several hours before.Well, that's a neurologic reaction, but that doesn't mean it wasgoing to leave itself any permanent sequelae, and that's the thingthat I think you're looking at.I mean, the easiest thing, for instance, is if a football player knockshimself out on the football field and has a concussion and doesn'trespond you take him out of the field of play. You leave himthere, depending how bad it is, for a week or a month, and he goesback and he plays again.He had technically an encephalopathy. That's what knocked himout. That's what the concussion was, but he's normal. Tr. at 318-19. Then Dr. Cohen proceeded to diagnose \"encephalopathy:\" THE COURT: So encephalopathy means you have some kind of disease process in the brain. Encephalopathy.THE WITNESS: That's absolutely correct. The word encephalorefers to brain. The word pathology or pathos refers to disease. There's an abnormality of the nervous system, and that's all itmeans. ...THE COURT: So you agree that Baby Doe had anencephalopathy?THE WITNESS: Yes, I would say she had a transientencephalopathy. I would say that's probably correct.But a fever, a high fever to anybody if they have an alteration inlevel of awareness, if they become confused is an encephalopathy. If I get drunk and not know what I'm doing, that's anencephalopathy. If I get confused and see things, which youcommonly do when you get drunk, that's an encephalopathy.THE COURT: But there are encephalopathies which do lead tosequela. Is that correct?THE WITNESS: Yes, they do. There are encephalopathies that dolead to sequela, but those encephalopathies I think that you'rereferring to are continuous line. You don't see something where infact the patient looks bad one minute, looks perfectly normal thenext minute and six months later looks bad again. 82Tr. at 321-22. Because of Dr. Cohen's testimony, the undersigned holds that Baby Doe had an encephalopathy as part of her adverse reaction to her vaccinations. The issue remaining iswhether that encephalopathy was merely transient because Baby Doe's fever was gone in thehospital, her fussiness and lethargy ended, she became awake, alert, responsive to her mother,smiling, cooing, wetting and soiling her diapers, and breast feeding so that when she left thehospital on January 15, 2005, she weighed more and was in the 90 th percentile for weight than when she was admitted to the hospital on January 13, 2005 and was in the 55th percentile for weight. Three days later, she saw Dr. Hult quist for a follow-up and she was neurologically normal, moving her extremities, awake, alert, and weighed even more than she had when shewas discharged three days earlier. Petitioners allege that Baby Doe's encephalopathy was damaging. Mrs. Doe denies the truth of all the medical notations that Baby Doe was awake, alert, breast feeding, cooing, smiling, reaching for toys, and gaining weight. As far as she is concerned, Baby Doe becamecomatose for weeks, regardless of the notes of Dr. Davis in the hospital and Dr. Hultquist threedays after discharge that she was awake and alert. Mrs. Doe never took Baby Doe to see adoctor for six months after her discharge from the hospital. Mrs. Doe's mother came back fromher school studies in Colorado to Oklahoma in June 2005 and, when she saw how tiny Baby Doehad become, she encouraged Mrs. Doe to take her to the doctor. Mrs. Doe took Baby Doe to thepediatric clinic at Reynolds on July 20, 2005, and saw Dr. Janice Gibbons to whom she told thatBaby Doe was a good eater. Baby Doe went from the 90 th percentile in weight at five months when she was discharged from the hospital to below the fifth percentile in weight on July 20, 832005. Dr. Gibbons diagnosed Baby Doe with failure to thrive and directed Mrs. Doe to return in one week. Mrs. Doe did not return for seven weeks. The next time Mrs. Doe brought Baby Doe in to see the doctor at the pediatric clinic, she brought her mother with her. Mrs. Doe directlyasked Dr. Hultquist if he was accusing her of neglect and he denied it. He said he was trying to cover all bases. And he did try. He attempted to find out if the reason that Baby Doe wasmalnourished for those six months from January to July 2005 was due to a bowel obstruction. He did not find a bowel problem. Dr. Jones, the pediatric gastroenterologist, tried to find out if Baby Doe had a hyperthyroid condition to e xplain why Baby Doe was malnourished from January to July 2005, but there is nothing in the records to show that anyone reached thatconclusion although Baby Doe did have two abnormal TSH readings. If Baby Doe had been malnourished because she refused to eat, petitioners might succeed in trying to show causal connection to a serious brain injury. But Mrs. Doe told Dr. Gibbons atthe July 20, 2005 visit that Baby Doe was a good eater. Mrs. Doe and her mother reiterated thatBaby Doe was a good eater when they saw Dr. Hultquist seven weeks later with Baby Doe. When Mrs. Doe finally gave Baby Doe enough food to eat, Baby Doe began to gain weight andresumed normalcy in weight and height. Petitioners' assertion that Baby Doe's failure to thrivewas due to her vaccine reaction is not credible. Mrs. Doe's credibility is non-existent in this casebecause of her constant dramatization, embellishment, and invention of symptoms Baby Doe didnot have. Whereas the medical records show that Baby Doe was awake, alert, smiling at hermother, cooing, reaching for toys, responding to noi se by turning her head right and left, breast feeding, urinating and defecating, Mrs. Doe says all these records are wrong. In later visits to 84doctors, Mrs. Doe paints a picture of a child that is not Baby Doe. She said Baby Doe never breast fed in the hospital and that the nasogastric tube had breast milk in it which is what fedBaby Doe. That is untrue. The nasogastric tube had Pedialyte in it, not breast milk. The nursing staff timed Mrs. Doe's breast feeding sessions with Baby Doe.. Mrs. Doe stated that Baby Doe lay there staring into space. But Baby Doe's lethargy was solely transient. Mrs. Doe told providers that Baby Doe almost died. This is untrue. She toldproviders that Baby Doe had flaccid paralysis and her experts Dr. Hastings and Dr. Miller reliedon this in forming their opinions that Baby Doe had permanent sequelae from herencephalopathy. But Dr. Hultquist, her treating pediatrician, testified that Baby Doe did not have flaccid paralysis. He was there. Appare ntly, Dr. Hultquist's statement at trial and the contents of the contemporaneous medical reco rds made no impression on Dr. Hastings or Dr. Miller, who testified in accordance with their expe rt reports. They must think that Mrs. Doe is more credible than the doctor who took care of Baby Doe when her parents brought her intoReynolds. There is no treating doctor, Hultquist or Davis, who diagnosed Baby Doe with flaccid paralysis and the medical records note Baby Doe had no flaccidity. Dr. Hultquist was not disturbed by Mrs. Doe's \"diagnosis\" because she is a lay person and basically, you do not expecta lay person to be accurate. But Mrs. Doe's \"diagnosis\" forms the basis of Dr. Miller's and Dr.Hastings's expert opinions. Dr. Cohen also testified Baby Doe did not have flaccid paralysis. With the lack of truth- telling that Mrs. Doe has manifested throughout these records as well as in her testimony, theundersigned does not accept her contrary versions of Baby Doe's behavior during the six months Mrs. Doe kept her at home between her hospital discharge and her trip back to the pediatrician 85Dr. Gibbons. These two versions are either Baby Doe was subdued and not herself (to Dr. Hastings) or that she was screaming and crying like a colicky baby (to Dr. Miller). If she weresubdued, it would be from lack of adequate nut rition, not from the effects of encephalopathy. The special master's \"assessments of the credibility of the witnesses\" are \"virtually unchallengeable on appeal.\" , 219 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (quoting Sec'y of HHS , 940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). Mrs. Doe informed speech pathologist Sarah Kay on March 14, 2008 that speech delay runs in her family. Mrs. Doe informed devel opmental pediatrician Dr. Laurie Kukas on July 28, 2008 that her youngest son Aidan had early intervention for immaturity in adaptive andemotional skills. There are sound reasons to link a logical sequence of cause and effect betweenthe family history of speech delay and of immaturity in adaptive and emotional skills with BabyDoe's speech delay and social integration problems. There are sound reasons as well to querywhether a baby not fed appropriately from the age of five to 11 months will have resultant failureto thrive not only physically, but neurologically, if indeed Baby Doe has fine motor skill delay. Dr. Cohen questioned whether Baby Doe has fine motor delay. Petitioners have made two statements throughout this hearing that are untrue. The first is that the mother knows best. Mrs. Doe has dramatized and embellished Baby Doe's symptoms toevery treater subsequent to her January 18, 2005 visit to Dr. Hultquist. She has tolddiametrically opposite stories about Baby Doe's behavior during the six months Baby Doe was at home and not receiving adequate nutrition. Either Baby Doe was lying subdued for six months without any normal activity or she was screaming and crying like a colicky baby. Shetold Dr. Hastings, her expert internist, as well as the court the first version, and she told Dr. 86Miller, her expert pediatric neurologist, the second version. She told every doctor that Baby Doe had flaccid paralysis in the hospital, but her treati ng pediatrician Dr. Hultquist testified that Baby Doe did not have flaccid paralysis. So, for th at matter did Dr. Cohen. The medical records themselves state \"no flaccidity.\" She denied that Baby Doe could eat in the hospital and saidthat the staff had to put breast milk in the nasogastric tube that Baby Doe had. This is untrue. The NG tube had Pedialyte to prevent dehydration. The nurses timed Baby Doe's breast feedingwhich lasted 86 minutes. She soiled her diapers. She had wet diapers. She put on weight. Mrs.Doe denied all the hospital records stating that Baby Doe was awake, alert, smiling at hermother, cooing, turning to right and left in response to sounds, moving her legs, and reaching fortoys. Dr. Hultquist attempted to come to Mrs. Doe's aid by saying that they were not pediatric nurses. One could argue that a nurse does not ha ve to be trained in pediatrics to recognize if someone was awake, alert, etc. But the fact is th at Dr. Davis, who is Dr. Hultquist's partner, also noted that Baby Doe was awake and alert. Dr. Hultquist did not mention Dr. Davis's notes that are consonant with the notes of those non-pediat ric nurses. Dr. Davis diagnosed Baby Doe with a normal immunization reaction and questioned whether she also had a virus because of her rash. Interestingly, all the symptoms that Baby Doe had during her transient encephalopathy are listed as adverse reactions in the GlaxoSmithKline informational material that petitionersfiled as Exhibit 21. These are, however, not neurologic symptoms. The drug manufacturer's listof symptoms and Baby Doe's symptoms were transient vomiting, diarrhea, fever, irritability,drowsiness, pain, restlessness, and anorexia. GlaxoSmithKline would not have listed Baby Doeas having an encephalopathy based on their defi nition of \"encephalopathy\" as including coma, decreased level of consciousness, and prolonged seizures. The Vaccine Act requires the 87manufacturer to report adverse reactions to the respondent with a VAERS report. Ex. 21, p. 395. GlaxoSmithKline would not have reported Baby Doe to VAERS as having an encephalopathy. In fact, Dr. Hultquist did file a VAERS re port on January 21, 2005 and he did not report that Baby Doe had an encephalopathy. He did say she had recovered from her reaction. Mrs. Doe told providers that Baby Doe almost died in the hospital. This is untrue. She told subsequent providers that Baby Doe had had a seizure in the hospital. Then she changedthat story to one where Baby Doe had had a seizure before she and her husband took Baby Doeto the emergency room and then Baby Doe had other seizures (in the plural) in the hospital. Petitioners' petition states that Baby Doe had a seizure before coming to the ER and multipleseizures in the hospital. There is no contemporaneous record of Baby Doe's ever having had aseizure. Even Dr. Miller, petitioners' expert pediatric neurologist, was skeptical because Mrs.Doe did not describe what this supposed seizure looked like. In the courtroom, Mrs. Doedescribed eyelids fluttering and eyes moving back and forth. The nurses were in Baby Doe'sroom constantly, making sure that Mrs. Doe knew where the call button was. When Mrs. Doewas particularly aggravated, the nurse called Dr. Hultquist who talked to Mrs. Doe for 40minutes. Everyone knew to watch and keep close tabs on Baby Doe which they did and to makesure Mrs. Doe was all right because of Mrs. Doe' s panic. If Mrs. Doe had seen anything unusual in Baby Doe, she would have called in the nurse and the nurse would have noted it in the recordsand told Dr. Davis or Dr. Hultquist. This ne ver occurred (although Mrs. Doe testified that she did speak with a nurse who saw the supposed seizure). Because Mrs. Doe has embellished BabyDoe's symptoms continually, insisting that she was paralyzed, near death, not feeding even forweeks (when the records reflect Baby Doe was awake, alert, and gaining weight), the 88undersigned does not believe Mrs. Doe's stor ies about Baby Doe having had one or many seizures. Mrs. Doe also thought Baby Doe might be autistic (she was not), that she might havelead or mercury poisoning (nothing in the record re flects that), or that she was at risk of toxic shock and dying as supposedly another infant did (Dr. Apost questioned whether this were true)when Baby Doe had white lesions on her tongue. The Vaccine Act does not allow the undersigned to give credence to Mrs. Doe's various and conflicting accounts of Baby Doe's symptoms when they are unsupported by medicalrecords or medical opinion: \"The special master or court may not make such a finding [that petitioner is entitled to compensation] based on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiatedby medical records or by medical opinion.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1). Any doctor whosubsequently relied upon Mrs. Doe's history of flaccid paralysis, seizures, 105\u00b0 fever, refusal tosuck, and continuing unresponsiveness would reach a conclusion that is erroneous, and thedoctors who testified for petitioners did reach erroneous conclusions in this case. An expertopinion is no better than the soundness of the reasons supporting it. Gurr v. Sec'y of HHS , 37 Fed. Cl. 314, 320 (Fed. Cl. 1997) (petitioners' claims conflicted with the contents of the medicalrecords; petitioners' medical expert opinion \"p lagued by gaps in his logic and was unsupported by the totality of evidence on record;\" petition dismissed; dismissal affirmed); Raley at *7 (Fed. Cl. Spec. Mstr.1998). When Mrs. Doe told Dr. Hastings and Dr. Miller that Baby Doe had a significantly decreased level of consciousness,105\u00b0 fever, seizures, and flaccid paralysis, their conclusions were as faulty as the information shegave them. The mother does not know best when she denies the accuracy of the reports ofnumerous nurses and her treating pediatricians, Dr. Davis and Dr. Hultquist, that Baby Doe was 89awake, active, alert, breast feeding, gaining weight, responding to sound by turning her head left and right, cooing, smiling at her mother, reaching for toys, wetting and soiling her diapers, andbeing normal neurologically on discharge. Dr. Da vis, her treating pediatrician, was correct when he diagnosed Baby Doe as having a normal imm unization reaction. Dr. Hultquist was correct three days later in the follow-up examination when he wrote that Baby Doe was normalneurologically, and, three days after that, when he filed the VAERS report, that Baby Doe had recovered from her vaccine reaction. An examination of Song v. Sec'y of HHS , 31 Fed. Cl. 61 (1994), aff'd without opinion , 41 F.3d 1520 (Fed. Cir. 1994) is instructive. In Song , the Honorable Robert J. Yock affirmed the dismissal of a mother's petition which alleged that her child Nicholas's learning and speechdisabilities were due to his reaction to DPT vaccine. The ground of Judge Yock's affirmance ofthe dismissal was that the mother failed to establish a causal connection between Nicholas'sdisabilities and the then-Table injury of residual seizure disorder. Nicholas developed a slightfever of 101 degrees on the day of his second DPT vaccination. Two days later, he appeared tohave two seizures and was taken to the ER. In the hospital, he had two more seizures. Afterward, he was found to be alert and all his hospital tests proved normal. He was dischargedon anti-convulsants. 31 Fed. Cl. at *63. Five months later, he had reached appropriate milestones. Subsequently, he was noted to have delay in his expressive and receptive languagefunctions. Id. Petitioner alleged that Nicholas's Table reaction to DPT resulted in learning disability, expressive language delay, and hypotonia. Id. Respondent defended, stating that Nicholas did not have an injury lasting more than six months after onset and that his current problems were unrelated to his seizure episodes. Id. The 90chief special master dismissed from the benc h, stating that although Nicholas had the Table injuries of encephalopathy and residual seizure disorder, petitioner failed to establish a causallink between those injuries and his subsequent language deficits. 31 Fed. Cl. at *63-64, 65. As Judge Yock noted, Nicholas did not have to mani fest the speech delay within six months of his injury, but petitioner had to prove that there was a causal connection between Nicholas's Tableinjuries and his speech delay. 31 Fed. Cl. at *66. Petitioner's expert offered only conclusorystatements that Nicholas's current speech delays were a result of his Table injuries. 31 Fed. Cl.at *67. Petitioner's expert stated merely, \"This child had a DTP shot, followed by a series ofseizures. The seizures indicated to me that he suffered encephalopathy, and as a result of that, henow has the speech and language problem.\" Id. The expert admitted there were many other factors that can cause speech delay. 31 Fed. Cl. at *68. Respondent's expert denied that Nicholas's encephalopathy and residual seizure disorder caused his speech problems based on the fact that Nicholas suffered no loss of clinicallysignificant milestones between the date of his seizures and six months later. Id. In addition, respondent's expert gave as a basis for no causation between the Table injuries and Nicholas'sspeech problems the fact that there were no laboratory data or clinical presentation showing thatNicholas's brain was injured. Id. In the instant action, Baby Doe made her nine-month milestones, and there were no laboratory data or clinical presentation when she was hospitalized from January 13-15, 2005 that indicated her brain was injured, regardless of the many histories Mrs. Doe subsequently gavewhich indicated otherwise, and the conclusory statements of her medical witnesses that the 91encephalopathy had to be the cause of her failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems because what else could be the cause. These witnesses's testimony that the encephalopathy had to have been the cause because what else could be is the second untrue statement in this hearing. As respondent's expert Dr.Cohen stated during the hearing, encephalopathy does not disappear and come back. If a child has an encephalopathy serious enough to cause developmental delay, you will see a differentchild, not a child who is awake, alert, with normal muscle tone and strength, feeding normally,urinating and defecating normally, reaching for toys, responding to sound, smiling at her mother, and cooing. The undersigned accepts Dr. Cohen's testimony as more persuasive than that of Dr.Miller and Dr. Hastings. The undersigned focuses more on Dr. Miller's testimony because Dr.Miller is a pediatric neurologist, rather than Dr. Hastings's testimony, because he is just aninternist. Dr. Cohen is the Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He has authored 79 ar ticles, co-authored three books, and written 17 book chapters. Dr. Miller has written two published articles, one on epilepsy and the other onpediatric migraine. Dr. Miller's conclusions about Baby Doe's condition (encephalopathyleading to developmental delay) were based exclusively on Mrs. Doe's history which was filledwith embellishments and untruths. One might ask, since Dr. Miller also did a record review,how he ignored the discrepancy between the contents of the contemporaneous medical recordsand Mrs. Doe's subsequent embellishments in order to reach his conclusion. The undersignedfinds persuasive Dr. Cohen's opinion that a tran sient encephalopathy does not lead to permanent sequelae, and holds that Baby Doe's speech delay, fine motor skill delay (if it exists), and social 92integration issues were not caused by her vaccine reaction. Petitioners in this case have the same legal problem as in Song : they have failed to prove more than six months sequelae of Baby Doe's vaccine injury, as the Vaccine Act requires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-11(c)(1)(D)(i). As the Federal Circuit stated in Hines v. Sec'y of HHS , 940 F.2d 1518, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1991), \"If the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision, reversible error [is] extremely difficultto demonstrate.\" The Federal Circuit in Hodges v. Sec'y of HHS , 9 F3d 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 1993), also stated that the court is \"not to s econd guess the Special Master[']s fact-intensive conclusions; the standard of review is uniquely deferential for what is essentially a judicialprocess.\" The Federal Circuit stated, \"That level of deference is especially apt in a case in whichthe medical evidence of causation is in dispute.\" 9 F.3d at 961. Hodges dealt with the parents' failure to prove sequelae of an alleged Table injury or, in the alternative, causation in fact. Petitioners' statement that Baby Doe's encephalopathy had to have caused her failure to thrive could only be true if Baby Doe had refused to eat. But, as Mrs. Doe told Dr. JaniceGibbons on July 20, 2005, when she finally brought Baby Doe to see a doctor, Baby Doe was agood eater. There was nothing wrong with her brain to keep her from eating. She did not have a bowel obstruction (Dr. Hultquist investigated) or a hyperthyroid condition (Dr. Jonesinvestigated). When finally Mrs. Doe saw the nutritionist Walmsley and could be persuaded toincrease Baby Doe's nutrition beyond breast milk and cereal and fruit (if she was giving BabyDoe the latter), Baby Doe grew and developed. She was ultimately diagnosed as no longerhaving failure to thrive. Then nutritionist Walm sley tried to steer Mrs. Doe into giving Baby Doe more quality food than cheeseburgers, ice cream, and candy. Nutritionist Walmsley 93inserted in her notes the only reasonable conclusion, i.e., when given enough to eat, Baby Doe gained weight. On clinical evaluation, Baby Doe was always normal neurologically. Dr. Cohen made it clear that he did not know if Baby Doe's sp eech delay had any neurologic reason since speech delay is a common childhood problem. Since Baby Doe's family has a history of speech delay,Dr. Cohen's opinion is a reasonable one. Moreover, considering the family history ofimmaturity in adaptive and emotional skills (Baby Doe's brother Aidan was receiving earlyintervention for these problems), Dr. Cohen's opinion that Baby Doe's social integrationproblems have a behavioral, not a neurological, basi s also is a reasonable one. He is unsure that Baby Doe even has fine motor skill delay since she can hold a pencil and other objects. Dr. Cohen took issue with the developmental pediatrician Dr. Kukas's examination of and recommendations (including vitamins) for Baby Doe. Mrs. Doe gave Dr. Kukas a copy ofher neurological expert Dr. Miller's report which was based on the misinformation that Mrs. Doegave Dr. Miller before Dr. Kukas ever reached her conclusions. Dr. Cohen could not understand how Dr. Kukas could find that Baby Doe has hypotonia and low tone orally (whatever that means). No one who examined Baby Doe, even Dr. Miller, her expert pediatric neurologist, found anything abnormal about Baby Doe's muscle tone. It may even be that Baby Doe has no neurologic problems. Baby Doe weighed less than the fifth percentile when she saw Dr. Gibbons on July 20, 2005 at 11 months of age and yet shemade her nine-month milestones, according to Mrs. Doe: feeding herself with her fingers,responding to her name, sitting independently, crawling and creeping, pulling to a standingposition, and playing patty cake. One might note that this description hardly comports with a 94child who is just lying in her crib, subdued in affect, just having a blood pressure and breathing, as Mrs. Doe testified. It also does not comport with Mrs. Doe's occasional history that BabyDoe spent those cloistered six months screaming and crying like a colicky baby. Petitioners have failed to prove the second Althen prong because there is no logical sequence of cause and effect between a transient encephalopathy and permanent sequelae. BabyDoe had two days of fever, lethargy, and fu ssiness, followed by normal behavior, including being awake, alert, responding to noise, cooi ng, smiling, reaching for toys, breast feeding, soiling and wetting her diapers, and gaining weight. Petitioners have failed to make a primafacie case of causation. The Federal Circuit in Grant stated that petitioners have the affirmative burden of proving causation in fact. That means petitioners cannot prevail with the statement that BabyDoe's failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems must bedue to her adverse reaction because what else could have caused them. In order for petitioners to prevail, the Vaccine Act, \u00a713(a)(1), requires petitioners to prove (a) by a preponderance of the evidence that the vaccine in question caused Baby Doe'scurrent condition, and, in addition, (b) there must not be preponderant evidence that a knownfactor unrelated to the vaccine caused Baby Doe's current condition. Over the years, thequestion has arisen over which party has the burden of proving there is no factor unrelated to the vaccine that is the cause of the vaccinee's injury and/or sequelae. The Federal Circuit answeredthat question precedent, [petitioner] must prove by preponderant evidence both that her vaccinations were a substantial factor in causing the illness, disability, injury or condition and that the harm 95would not have occurred in the absence of the vaccination\"). The Pafford Court quoted the language of its decision in Shyface v. Sec'y of HHS , 165 Cir. 1999): \"We adopt the Restatement rule for purposes of determining vaccine injury, that an action is the 'legalcause' of harm if that action is a 'substantial factor' in bringing about the harm, and that theharm would not have occurred but for the action.\" 451 F.3d at 1255. Petitioners herein did not prove by preponderant evidence that Mrs. Doe's failure to provide adequate nutrition to Baby Doe for six months (when Baby Doe was five to 11 months of age), plus Baby Doe's family history of speech delay and of immaturity in adaptive andemotional skills were not factors unrelated to the vaccination which caused in fact her speechdelay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems. In other words, petitioners did notprove that \"but for\" the vaccination, Baby Doe would not have had failure to thrive, speechdelay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems. Shyface , 165 F.3d at polio caused their child's systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or Still's disease. Petitioners failed to prove amedically appropriate time interval between the vaccinations and the onset of the Still's diseaseor the third Althen prong. 451 F.3d at 1357. also never established that the vaccinations were a but-for cause of the child's Still's disease. Id. In Walther v. Sec'y of HHS , 485 F.3d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal Circuit repeated its holding in Pafford that when petitioners do not make a prima facie case, the requirement of showing no other factor unrelated to the vaccine caused the injury or sequelae is petitioners'burden, stating that in Pafford , it held \"that a petitioner as a practical matter may be required to eliminate potential alternative causes where the petitioner's other evidence on causation is 96insufficient....\" 485 F.3d at 1150-51. The Federal Circuit repeated the \"but-for\" standard adopted in Shyface , stating \"if the petitioner did not successfully eliminate other causes, then the petition would fail and the second prong would not be reached.\" 485 F.3d at 1151. The FederalCircuit continued by stating that \"the petitioner may find it necessary to [use evidenceeliminating other potential causes of the harm] when the other evidence on causation [from thevaccine] is insufficient to make out a prima facie case, as was true in Pafford . In such instances, clearly the special master must evaluate what evidence a claimant presents as part of determiningwhether the claimant makes a prima facie case.\" Id. In footnote 4, the Federal Circuit states, \"Where multiple causes act in concert to cause the injury, proof that the particular vaccine was asubstantial cause may require the petitioner to establish that the other causes did not overwhelmthe causative effect of the vaccine.\" Id. 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit stated that petitioners's failure in Pafford to eliminate other potential causes was fatal to the petition when they had not provided evidence of a proximate temporal relationship betweenthe vaccine and the injury. In the instant action, petitioners have failed to satisfy the second Althen prong. The undersigned finds respondent's expert neurologi st Dr. Cohen's testimony persuasive that a transient encephalopathy caused by a fever, resulting in a day or so of lethargy and fussiness (towhich pain from the four injections also contributed), does not have permanent sequelae, andthere is no logical sequence of cause and effect between the transient encephalopathy and BabyDoe's failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, and social integration problems. 97The factors unrelated to vaccination here in clude insufficient nutrition during the ages of five to 11 months, and a family history of speech delay and of immaturity in adaptive andemotional skills. Petitioners never proved these other factors (insufficient nutrition and familyhistory) were not the cause of Baby Doe's failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay, andsensory integration problems. In the absence of petitioners's making a prima facie case becausethey failed to satisfy the second prong of Althen , they had the burden to prove these other factors were not the cause of Baby Doe's problems. They never satisfied this burden. Petitioners's experts Dr. Hastings and Dr. Miller based their opinions on histories that were untrue (flaccid paralysis, 105\u00b0 fever, inability to respond, failure to suck in the hospital,seizures) and Dr. Hultquist, a treating pediat rician, based his opinion on causation on his view that what else could have caused Baby Doe's failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motor delay,and social integration but her vaccine reaction. Dr. Hultquist is not a neurologist and may never have familiarized himself with Baby Doe's subsequent records to realize that speech delay andimmaturity in adaptive and emotional skills run in Baby Doe's family. But even if there were noalternative causes for Baby Doe's current problems, \"the absence of alternative causes does notalone suffice to ascribe causation to the vaccine.\" Lampe , 219 F.3d at Grant , 956 F.2d at 1149. The undersigned finds Dr. Hastings 's, Dr. Miller's, and Dr. Hultquist's opinions on sequelae unpersuasive. The probative value of the evidence and credibility of the witnessesare matters within the purview of the fact finder. Lampe , 219 F.3d at 1360. Petitioners have failed to make a prima facie case that a logical sequence of cause and effect exists between a transient encephalopathy and failure to thrive, speech delay, fine motordelay, and social integration problems. Since they have not made a prima facie case of 98causation, they have failed to satisfy their burden of proving that factors unrelated to the vaccinations (insufficient nutrition and family hist ory) are not the cause in fact of Baby Doe's current problems. CONCLUSION This petition is dismissed. The Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment in accordance with this decision. IT IS SO ORDERED. October 23, 2009 s/Laura D. Millman DATE Laura D.
