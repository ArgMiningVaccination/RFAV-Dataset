Since the establishment of the university's Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences division in 2013, through the excellence of its students and postdoctoral and clinical trainees, the dedication of its staff, the brilliance and innovation of its faculty, and the leadership of its administrators and unit directors, RBHS has become a pillar of the university across its essential functions: research, education and training, clinical care, and community outreach. RBHS has distinguished itself as a leading academic health center committed to excellence. Its scientists and practitioners are making discoveries in the causes and treatments of cancer, heart disease, obesity, brain function and injury, and other medical conditions, and translating those findings into the clinical and preventive care they provide. Its outstanding faculty is training the researchers and practitioners of the coming decades not only to be expert nurses, dentists, physicians, pharmacists, scientists, and health care professionals but also to be compassionate, collaborative, and committed to eliminating health disparities and serving as role models to those who will follow them. On the clinical practice front, Rutgers Health has rapidly developed a reputation for high-quality, patient-focused care across the State of New Jersey. My introduction to RBHS came in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic, before I even arrived at Rutgers, when I learned about its intensive involvement in the battle against this deadly virus and the worldwide pandemic. At a time when schools, universities, and businesses were closing their doors to protect against trans- mission, RBHS researchers were seeking answers and serving patients: conducting clinical trials for the vaccines in use today; developing a new way to test rapidly for COVID; providing front-line care; and graduating medical, nursing, and pharmacy students early so they could join the cause as soon as possible. Like everyone at Rutgers, I take great pride in the success of RBHS over the past nine years since its incep - tion. Y et I know from my conversations with Chancellor Brian Strom and other leaders during my presidency that more hard work, building on these accomplishments, is needed for RBHS to reach the level of excellence our state, our university, and our patients deserve. This document is further proof of the RBHS community's commitment to an ambitious vision of national prominence and leadership as a model academic health center. Situated in one of the most diverse states in the country, RBHS boldly seeks to define excellence in expanding health care access, in increasing the diversity and inclusiveness of its own community, in training the next generation of health providers, scientists, and innovators, and in forging a culture of collaboration, respect, and accountability. Having witnessed the quality and dedica - tion of this community over the past two years, I am confident that in carrying out this plan, RBHS will not only enhance its visibility and standing, but also inspire other academic health centers to follow a similar path. Jonathan S. Holloway, PhD President and University Professor | Rutgers University 3 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Message | From the Chancellor Created by a historic 2013 merger, with its first five-year strategic plan released in November 2014, RBHS has rapidly developed into one of the nation's premier academic health care centers, committed to a mission of excellence in biomedical and health sciences education, research, and patient care. In February 2020, a newly formed Strategic Planning Steering Committee (SPSC) held its kickoff retreat to begin developing a revised and refreshed RBHS strategic plan that builds and expands upon the many accomplishments of the first plan. As we began planning for the next five years, the nation was faced with a period of unprecedented disruption: a global COVID-19 pandemic, a contentious national presidential election cycle, and civil unrest as the country confronted widespread concerns about racial and social inequities. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the disproportionate impact on the health and well-being of disenfranchised and underserved individuals and communities. It has been an enormously challenging time for all of us, but I am so proud and privileged to be a member of the RBHS community, which came together to confront the pandemic with resilience, perseverance, volunteerism, and as a critical partner to the State of New Jersey to implement recommended safety measures. I am extremely grateful for the exceptional work carried out by the SPSC and the very broad and active engagement and input by the entire RBHS community, including many committees and subcommittees, multiple town hall meetings, broad survey responses, and the many meetings with key stakeholders and leaders from Rutgers University, the four chancellor-led units, RWJBarnabas Health, University Hospital, and the state. Several committees will now be established to develop and fulfill an implementation plan that includes defining criteria for assessment of the strategic plan, monitoring its progress, and adjusting its goals as needed, since the plan is intended to be a living document. The 2022-2027 strategic plan provides an innovative blueprint for One RBHS as we work together to define and shape The W ay Forward. I thank President Holloway for his support of our strategic plan and the introductory comments he has provided. I look forward to working with the RBHS community and our collaborators, and assisting in every way, to succeed in meeting the goals of \"One RBHS: The W ay Forward\" 2022-2027 strategic plan. Brian L. Strom, MD, MPH Inaugural Chancellor, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Executive Vice President, Health Affairs | Rutgers University 4 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Executive Summary R utgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) is one of the largest and most comprehensive academic health centers in the nation, encompassing eight schools, eleven major centers and institutes, and a vast statewide behavioral health network. RBHS was created by a historic merger in July 2013, in accordance with the 2012 New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Education Restructuring Act. The creation of RBHS within Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, established it as one of the largest academic institutions in the U .S. providing clinical care, education and training, research and innovation, and service to a state with a population of more than 9 million. As reaffirmed in this strategic plan, RBHS is a leading academic health center, known for its interprofessional model of health care education, commitment to improving access to high quality clinical services, innovative research, and deep engagement with the community. W e will pursue these four core missions according to our fundamental values of respect, collaboration, inclusion, excellence, innovation, and accountability. 5 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027The first eight years of RBHS represented a transformational period of tremendous expansion and growth. The inaugural RBHS 2014-2019 strategic plan provided a bold vision for the integration and assimilation of much of the former University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) within Rutgers University. This restructuring was foundational, representing the largest higher education merger in U .S. history, and created a new, forward-looking organization. The restructuring created opportunities for collaboration and synergy and positioned RBHS as a consolidated unit, to respond to the health priorities of the time. Great progress was made in the inaugural plan with the transformative clinical affiliations with RWJBarnabas Health, the implementation of a new faculty practice model, and substantial gains in research funding in many areas, including four signature programs, one emerging signature program, and four complementary programs. Opportunities also were identified in other areas, such as interprofessional education, health care innovation, and population health. There were predictable challenges of such a large integration\u2014chief among them was clarifying the RBHS identity and brand, both internally and externally, particularly considering the affiliation with RWJBarnabas Health. Additionally, there were challenges that were not as easily predicted, such as the almost immediate pivot of operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which Rutgers emerged as a national leader in its response. 6 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Early in his presidency, Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway outlined his commitment to three core value propositions that will be the cornerstones of his presidency: 1) the relentless pursuit of academic excellence; 2) the need to develop strategic institu - tional clarity; and 3) the achievement of a beloved community. President Holloway envisions a culture that emphasizes diversity, inclusion, and respect. His stated goals include reducing the narrative complex - ity of Rutgers and bringing coherence to a university strategy that will strengthen Rutgers' position in New Jersey and in higher education nationally\u2014all values and goals very much shared by the administra - tion, faculty, and staff of RBHS. For its part, the new 2022-2027 strategic plan focuses on moving beyond the Rutgers-UMDNJ integration by advancing the vision of One RBHS through four mission-based and five unifying theme-based goals. The plan defines a path for continuing efforts over the next five years to bring to fruition the ideal of One RBHS to position Rutgers to be a state, national, and international leader in the biomed - ical and health sciences. An integrative approach will enable RBHS to advance clinical care, education, re - search, and community engagement in important new directions; facilitate a population-based, value-driven health care infrastructure by building on its recognized strengths; engage with local and global communities; and leverage the interprofessional synergies among its schools, centers, and institutes. Further, RBHS will strengthen its many ties with the state and federal governments and foster new public-private collabora - tions with industries vital to New Jersey's economy. RBHS is poised to take advantage of, and excel in, this new environment, with its uniquely diverse workforce, systems-aligned model for clinical care and community service, interprofessional health care education using team-based care models, and a full spectrum of research and innovation. The Aim is Clear: To realize our collective vision of a multidisciplinary, multidimensional, and multifaceted organization\u2014in which the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts\u2014and to embody this concept as the fundamental expression of the One RBHS identity. 7 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Background | Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey is the eighth oldest higher education institution in the U .S. and the nation's only university that is a colonial college, land-grant institution, and public research university. Rutgers was founded in 1766 as the all-male Queen's College in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and renamed Rutgers College in 1825. The New Jersey College for W omen, now Douglass Residential College, was founded in 1918 and, in 1955, became part of what is now Rutgers University-New Brunswick. State legislative acts in 1945 and 1956 designated Rutgers as The State University of New Jersey. The University of Newark, now Rutgers University-Newark, joined Rutgers in 1946. The College of South Jersey, now Rutgers University-Camden, joined Rutgers in 1950. A state legislative act in 2013 transferred much of what was the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) to Rutgers, leading to the formation of what today is Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) and adding the most recent piece to the institution. 8 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027T oday, Rutgers is a leading national research university system comprised of four chancellor-led units (CLUs): three geographically distinct that include Rutgers University-Camden, Rutgers University- Newark, Rutgers University-New Brunswick, and RBHS, the fourth CLU that spans multiple loca - tions, including Newark, New Brunswick, and satellite locations throughout the state. Rutgers is the only public institution in New Jersey holding membership in the Association of American Universities and one of only 62 members in the nation. Rutgers joined the Big T en Division I collegiate athletic conference in July 2014, and, in doing so, joined the Big T en Academic Alliance\u2014formerly named the Committee on Institutional Cooperation\u2014a consortium of 14 world-class research universities. Rutgers' mission is to provide for the instructional needs of New Jersey's citizens through its under - graduate, graduate, postgraduate, and continuing education and training programs, and to conduct cutting-edge research that contributes to the health, basic science, environmental, social, and cultural well-being of the state. Rutgers also aids the economy and the state's businesses and industries and per - forms public service in support of the citizens of the state and its local, county, and state govern - ments. Rutgers is the fourth-largest non- governmental employer in New Jersey, directly and indirectly supporting more than 58,000 jobs in the state. Rutgers provides almost $7 to the New Jersey economy for every $1 invested by the state. As one of the nation's most diverse universities (according to U.S. News and W orld Report), Rutgers is committed to diversity and inclusion as a key foundational element of its strategic plan. Rutgers draws strength from the rich variety of perspectives and life experiences of our students, faculty, staff, and members of surrounding communities. More than 70,000 students\u2014from all 50 states and more than 130 countries\u2014attend Rutgers, across its 33 schools and colleges. Approximately 50,000 are undergraduates and 21,000 are graduate students across the Rutgers campuses: Camden (7,200); Newark (13,600); New Brunswick (43,400); and the nearly 6,800 students who are enrolled in an RBHS degree program. Rutgers offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and more than 200 graduate degree programs. There are 8,700 full- and part-time faculty and nearly 15,000 full- and part-time staff members. More than 530,000 alumni reside throughout the world, including all 50 states and six continents. 9 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027NEW PRESIDENT AND NEW VISION |In July 2020, Jonathan Holloway, PhD, a renowned histo - rian and scholar, took office as the 21st president of Rutgers. As Rutgers refines its mission of becoming the very best public research university, President Holloway envisions a culture that emphasizes diversity, inclusion, and respect. In his opening message, President Holloway shared his belief that a university should aspire to be a beloved community. He pointed out that a beloved community is not a place where everyone agrees with one another, but rather a true marketplace of ideas and opinions that engages in authentic listening and dialogue\u2014a place where members acknowledge that, while they may disagree at times, they have something valuable in common, belong to the same community, and share an obligation to take care of it. In his September 2020 address to the University Senate, comprising faculty, students, staff, and alumni, President Holloway highlighted three value propositions that will be the touchstones of his presidency: 1) the relentless pursuit of academic excellence; 2) the need to develop strategic institutional clarity; and 3) the achievement of a beloved community. His stated goals include reducing the narrative complex - ity of Rutgers and bringing coherence to a university strategy that will strengthen Rutgers' position in New Jersey and in higher education nationally. Rutgers is known for being an incredibly diverse univer - sity and the new university administration is committed to delivering on the principles of equity and inclusion, which require constant attention to operationalize. In \"doing its part in repairing the world, \" 10 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Rutgers will take concrete and measurable actions to address social, economic, and racial inequities. This work will grow out of community conversations and engagement as well as presidential and other CLU initiatives that reflect institutional best practices in the broader world of higher education. The president has defined five priorities that en - capsulate areas where the university needs to make progress: 1) recruit, retain, and develop a diverse community, 2) promote inclusive scholarship and teaching, 3) define sustainable and substantive com - munity engagements, 4) build the capacity of leaders to create inclusive climates, and 5) develop an insti-tutional infrastructure to drive change. These priorities reflect shared objectives that enable us to define benchmarks for achievement and structural mechanisms for accountability to be a beloved community. Building on the University's Equity Audit in the fall of 2020, the University Diversity Strategic Plan - ning process is assessing and aligning efforts across the CLUs and the central administration to institu - tionally embrace diversity, inclusion, and equity as core values. Each organizational unit across Rutgers University is using the diversity strategic planning process to describe their current state, envision their ideal state, and define measurable goals, identifying actionable steps to create a more inclusive future. Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences The 2012 New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences Education Restructuring Act (N.J.P.L. 2012, c.45) established Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) in July 2013, as the health care, education, research, and clinical division at Rutgers. In December 2013, Brian L. Strom, MD, MPH, became the inaugural chancellor of RBHS, which comprises a broad spectrum of health professions schools, research centers and institutes, and clinical practices, including a statewide behavioral health care network. Since its creation, RBHS has provided new models for clinical care and community service, educated sever - al generations of health care providers utilizing team approaches to care, and conducted basic science, clinical, health services, population-based, and translational research. The RBHS schools, centers, and institutes are geographically located on the New Brunswick campus, both in New Brunswick and Pisca - taway; at the Rutgers Health Sciences campus at Newark; and at affiliated clinical and practice locations throughout New Jersey. RBHS, now an integral component of Rutgers University, works synergistically with many other academic, research, and clinical units throughout Rutgers and the region. 11 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027The integration of the former UMDNJ and Rutgers created considerable opportunities for collaboration and synergy. In July 2014, Rutgers College of Nursing (Newark and New Brunswick) and Rutgers School of Nursing (previously part of UMDNJ) merged to form Rutgers School of Nursing. RBHS is also home to two allopathic medical schools located approximately 30 miles apart: New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) in Newark and Robert W ood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) in New Brunswick. Originally affiliated with different parent universities, the two medical schools were combined by statute in 1970 under the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (later UMDNJ). As geographically distinct entities, the two medical schools developed separate and, at times, complementary clinical practices, patient bases, and research strengths. T o create academic strength and greater efficiency within RBHS and across Rutgers, the two medical schools now share a growing number of joint department chairs and other related joint initiatives. Additionally, graduate biomedical training programs, previously existing as distinct entities at Rutgers-New Brunswick and UMDNJ, were integrated under Rutgers School of Graduate Studies. Additional integration occurred with the expansion of Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey to Newark, and the establishment of the new Brain Health Institute, which brings together faculty from across the university. $528.0M Total Awards1,954 Degrees Agreements Patents Issued Invention Filed17 61 6197 18 49 161FY2112 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027With the establishment of RBHS, Rutgers now stands as one of the nation's largest, most compre - hensive university-based centers for studying and improving human health and health care (Miller & Golembeski 2019a; 2019b). The eight RBHS schools (Appendix A) collectively comprise New Jersey's largest and most influential constellation of academic institutions devoted to medicine, dentistry, bio - medical sciences, pharmacy, public health, nursing, and the full spectrum of allied health careers. RBHS major research centers and institutes (Appendix A) focus on five signature programs (cancer, environmental and occupational health, infection and inflammation, neuroscience, and community health and health systems) and four complementary programs (clinical research, drug discovery and development, informatics, and public health, including global health). A commitment to clinical and community service is integral to the missions of all RBHS schools, centers, institutes, and its behavioral health center. There are more than 2.1 million patient visits to Rutgers Health practices annually, more than 1,300 clinical providers working to advance top-quality health care, more than 450 clinical trials in progress at any given time, and $450 million spent annually on life sciences research and development. RBHS health care providers deliver a wide range of high-quality patient care services across the New Jersey. Faculty practices currently operate at New Jersey Medical School (NJMS), Robert W ood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS), Rutgers School of Dental Medicine (RSDM), School of Health Professions (SHP), and the School of Nursing (SN). University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC) is one of the nation's largest behavioral health care networks. RBHS and RWJBarnabas Health have collaborat - ed to create the largest academic health system in New Jersey, comprising a broad network of hospitals and health care facilities to deliver patient care, provide educational experiences for students, and conduct clinical research. The legislation also made University Hospital in Newark an academic medical center with its own board of directors as of July 1, 2013. University Hospital is now a principal teaching hospital of NJMS, RSDM, and other Newark-based health professional education programs, home to a Level 1 T rauma Center, and a regional resource for specialized services and critical care. Given its focus on biomedical and health care education, research, clinical care, improving access to health care, and reducing health disparities, there are specific characteristics that distinguish RBHS from the other Rutgers units, including: postgraduate training for clinical residents and specialty fellows, continuing medical education, hospital and clinical affiliations, and the provision of health care services to the community. For Rutgers and the region, there are many advantages to having a highly 13 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027regarded integrated health care division attached to New Jersey's state university. Rutgers attracts top- flight faculty and students, optimizing health care for New Jersey residents and beyond. Rutgers is also conducting more cutting-edge health care research and discovery than ever before. These contributions accelerate New Jersey's economic growth while attracting public and private collaborations and support. The inaugural RBHS strategic plan, finalized in November 2014, consisted largely of specific initiatives focusing on clinical, research, educational, and community service programs, as well as administrative and financial strategies designed to support these specific initiatives. RBHS strategic initiatives in the first five years focused on translating the aspiration and key areas of the universitywide strategic plan into the proper context for RBHS, capitalizing on its unique niches and operationalizing the integration of the former UMDNJ with Rutgers. (For more information on highlights of accomplishments from the 2014 -2019 strategic plan, see Appendix B.) RBHS's achievements were put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. RBHS leaders, faculty, staff, and students were confronted by numerous challenges, meeting them with creativity, determination, and stamina during a dynamic and unpredictable period. Despite the challenges posed by this unprec-edented global pandemic, RBHS has made significant progress as the leading academic health center in New Jersey, and is also making significant national contributions to combat this pandemic. Rutgers alumni and friends of RBHS also came together to provide gifts and philanthropic support. (For more information on selected highlights of the RBHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Appendix C.) Additionally, a comparison of 40 health sciences universities was conducted to provide context for identifying RBHS's competitive advantages and potential challenges to inform strategies for the five-year strategic plan. (For more information on the comparative analysis, see Appendix D.) 14 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Strategic Plan | Strategic Planning Process The chancellor initiated the strategic planning process by appointing a Strategic Planning Steering Committee (SPSC), aided by a Coordinating Committee (T able 1). A planning retreat held in February 2020 included a wide range of RBHS leadership and internal stakeholders. Eight major themes and subcommittees were formed and co-chairs identified (Appendix E). This was the first in an extensive series of activities designed to elicit the broadest possible participation by the RBHS community (faculty, staff, students, and trainees), Rutgers University at large, the two major teaching hospitals (University Hospital and Robert W ood Johnson University Hospital), RWJBarnabas Health, and the New Jersey Department of Health. Soon after the launch of the strategic planning process, the world was brought to a halt with the unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 in March of 2020. 15 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027STRATEGIC PLANNING STEERING COMMITTEE (SPSC) MEMBERS Andy Anderson, MD President and Chief Executive Officer, RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group Joseph Barone, PharmD Dean and Professor, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy Sylvia Christakos, PhD (SPSC co-chair) Distinguished Professor, New Jersey Medical School Karen D'Alonzo, PhD Associate Professor, Division of Nursing Science, School of Nursing Cecile Feldman, DMD, MBA Dean and Professor, Rutgers School of Dental Medicine Bruce Haffty, MD, MS Chair of Radiation Oncology and Associate Vice Chancellor for Cancer Programs, Cancer Institute of New Jersey Zach Hosseini, BA Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communications, RBHSShawna Hudson, PhD Research Division Chief and Professor, Family Medicine and Community Health, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Teri Lassiter, PhD, MPH Assistant Dean for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, School of Public Health; Assistant Professor, Department of Urban-Global Public Health, School of Public Health (RBHS Faculty Council representative)Gwendolyn Mahon, MSc, PhD (SPSC co-chair) Dean and Professor, School of Health Professions Reynold A.

Strategic Planning Committee Members 16 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027The strategic planning process paused for four months as the university and RBHS focused on the immediate needs of our patients, students, faculty, and staff. By July 2020, the process resumed and the RBHS strategic plan was developed according to the timeline shown (Figure 1). A website was de - veloped to promote remote participation and provide ongoing updates to the RBHS community. An environmental scan provided a framework for identifying RBHS's competitive advantages and potential challenges, as well as short- and long-term opportunities. Participation in the subcommittees by RBHS community members\u2014including faculty, staff, students, and trainees\u2014was solicited through email, a website, and a community-wide survey (see Appendix E for list of subcommittee membership). Par - ticipation was not limited to the strategic plan committees; a wide range of approaches was utilized to engage all members of the RBHS community in the strategic planning process. Additional input was solicited through email, phone calls, a website portal, two phases of community-wide virtual town hall meetings, and two community-wide surveys. Utilizing the recent advances and popularity of web-based conferencing, the town halls had very strong attendance and active participation. Figure 1.

T o illustrate, one of the important interactive questions asked during the town halls was: \"What are three words that come to mind to describe the culture you would like to see at RBHS?\" The word clouds generated by this question (Figure 2) and the data collected from other questions greatly influ - enced the direction of the plan and refinement of our vision and values. From September 2020 to March 2021, the subcommittees met regularly to engage internal and external stakeholders, review data, and develop measurable objectives. A second SPSC retreat was held in De - cember 2020 to review progress and provide further direction to the subcommittees. In March 2021, the subcommittees produced reports with details of strategic activities and initiatives to be considered. Meetings with leadership and stakeholders continued through July 2021 (Appendix F), followed by compilation of the subcommittee reports into an initial draft of the plan (see Appendix G for a list of references). The initial draft of the plan was shared with the RBHS community in November 2021, coupled with three additional community-wide town halls and an online survey to seek a final round of input. All the feedback from the activities described above was thoroughly reviewed and considered in the final iteration of the new strategic plan. The bold vision of One RBHS presented in this strategic plan would not have been possible without the collective and essential involvement and input by the RBHS community, Rutgers University leadership, affiliates, and stakeholders. Figure 2. Word clouds generated in real-time during three virtual town halls with RBHS community in 2020.18 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion A commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion at Rutgers University has been highlighted as a distinct and major pillar of the strategic direction and plan. The overall framework for the \"University Diversity Strategic Plan\" has five priorities (inset). These priorities are woven into the RBHS strategic plan. RBHS is deeply committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and is actively engaged in a pro - cess of institutional transformation to create a culture of belonging for all. In 2019, the chancellor appointed an inaugural vice chancellor for diversity and inclusion (VCDI) to champion, lead, and implement a fully inte - grated DEI strategy and enhance initiatives that foster an inclusive culture at RBHS. The creation of the VCDI position was one of the primary recommendations of the report titled Best Practices for the Recruitment and Re - tention of Minority Faculty (2017), authored by RBHS faculty members. The VCDI established and works closely with a Diversity Leadership Council comprised of diversity leaders from across RBHS to implement multiple initiatives, such as an aspirational RBHS DEI Statement, and promote affinity groups to build community and foster deeper dialogue around DEI issues. \"One RBHS: The W ay Forward\" reflects the RBHS commitment to make DEI a priority, integrated into all aspects of the new strategic plan.University Diversity Strategic Plan Priorities 1 R ecruit, retain, and develop a div erse community 2 Pr omote inclusive scholarship and t eaching 3 De fine sustainable and substantive c ommunity engagement 4 Build the capacity of leaders to cr eate inclusive climates 5 De velop an institutional in frastructure to drive change 19 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Foundation At the foundation of \"One RBHS: The W ay Forward\" are the RBHS mission, vision, and values (above). The mission and vision statements from the 2014 strategic plan were updated to reflect the values and strategic priorities in relation to the university's structure within the state of New Jersey. The six fundamental values (respect, collaboration, inclusion, excellence, innovation, and accountability) emerged directly from the feedback of the RBHS community and stakeholders during the strategic planning process.Mission Provide exceptional health care, education and training, research, and discovery for the people of New Jersey and beyond Values Dedicated to respect, collaboration, inclusion, excellence, innovation, and accountability in all that we doVision To be a distinguished national model for health care access and quality, research and innovation, interprofessional education and health care, and community service and engagement 20 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Strategy Central to achieving the vision of One RBHS as a unified entity is strengthening our collective identity, building connections across disciplines and mission areas, and promoting a culture of respect and inclusion. This was reiterated by leaders and representa - tives from internal and external stakeholder groups and the RBHS community. Consistent with these aspirations, \"One RBHS: The W ay Forward\" includes nine strategic goals: five unifying theme (U) goals and four mission-based (M) goals. The five unifying themes described within this plan are: 1) people and workforce; 2) inclusive, respectful, and accountable culture; 3) team-based approaches; 4) enabling systems and structures; and 5) connections and identity. These themes are integrative and cross-cutting because of their span across the four traditional core RBHS mission areas\u2014clinical care, education and training, research and inno - vation, and community engagement. The objectives identified for each of the four traditional mission goals link the inaugural RBHS 2014-2019 strategic plan to 'the way forward' toward our aspirational One RBHS. Collectively, these goals are consistent with, and reinforce, President Holloway's three value propositions\u2014becoming a beloved community, advancing academic excellence, and achieving greater strategic clarity. Importantly, implementation of the objectives and initiatives for each of the nine goals, while adhering to our values and mission, is foundational to the success of the strategic plan (see Implementation, Monitoring, and Assessment). Each of the nine overarching strategic goals is focused on leverag - ing strengths and opportunities, creating greater unity and coher - ence, achieving optimal organizational alignment and structural clarity, and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of adminis- trative processes and technology to achieve excellence at RBHS. 21 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Implementation, Monitoring, and Assessment T o achieve the strategic goals articulated in this plan, an Implementation, Monitoring, and Assessment T eam (IMA T) will be assembled and charged shortly after the final strategic plan is released (Figure 3). This is an opportune moment in RBHS's history to develop a comprehensive set of outcome measures and key performance indicators that reflect impact across our broad range of disciplines and mission areas. The IMA T will develop expanded performance, outcome, and impact metrics, drawing on lead - ing practices nationally, to help to monitor and evaluate individual and collective progress and success across mission areas and unifying themes. T raditional benchmarks include such well known metrics as: sponsored research award dollars, total enrollment numbers, student success, scientific awards, national rankings, and financial stability. While necessary and useful, these metrics do not fully capture all the aspirations articulated in the plan that touch upon the broad and multi-dimensional impact of RBHS on the state, nation, and globe. The portfolio of potential impact measures should also showcase the many activities, accomplishments, and outcomes with which members of our community identify, and that many of our community and affiliates consider as distinguishing features and elements of pride for RBHS as an institution. The additional metrics would focus on impacts such as culture change, process improvements, innovation and entrepreneurship, connections and identity, workforce development, wellness, feedback from RBHS community surveys, and team-based approaches and collaborations. 22 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Outlining such an inclusive approach to defining excellence, in addition to traditional measures of suc- cess, is another way that RBHS can be a national leader as a premier academic health center. The IMA T will be charged with the development of milestones and timelines, identification of responsible parties and deliverables, and resources needed to implement the goals' objectives. The IMA T will coordinate the iterative process of tracking progress, assessing outcomes based on new and existing metrics, and making refinements as needed for each of the goals, objectives, and specific initiatives or activities as indicated in the examples below. Each year, a progress report will be developed by the IMA T and disseminated to the RBHS community, and the individual units that comprise RBHS will coordinate via the chancellor's office to align their unit plans with the overarching RBHS plan in both time and approach. The intent is that individual units within RBHS will incorporate the vision and goals advanced in the RBHS plan, and Rutgers University overall, within their own planning and implementation efforts.

In 1971 the Rutgers College of Pharmacy moved to William Levine Hall on the developing Busch Campus in Piscataway. Programs expanded as an emphasis on clinical care and pharmaceutical research transformed the educational experiences for our students. In 2002, the school was renamed the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy (EMSOP). In the early years of the 21st century, the Susan Lehman Cullman Lab for Cancer Research was built to support expanding research programs. The latest building project, the 2017 addition to the Levine building (24,882 ft 2), provides strong support for the educational programs, with significant new space for classrooms, simulation labs, and student study spaces. The new EMSOP addition includes state-of-the-art classrooms, hospital simulation spaces, a mock intravenous admixture lab, telepharmacy suite, patient assessment rooms, and administrative space. These new facilities support state-of-the-art high fidelity/immersive simulations for PharmD students and pharmacy residents, RBHS schools and centers, and, increasingly, education and training for clinicians across RWJBarnabas Health. RBHS Schools47 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AT oday, EMSOP is a leading institution dedicated to excellence in pharmacotherapeutic health care and biomedical education, innovative and visionary research, scholarship in the pharmaceutical sciences, clinical practice affiliations with health care institutions and industry, and outreach and community services that address the needs of the citizens of New Jersey and society at large. The school continues to build on its four pillars of excellence: teaching, research, clinical practice, and service. More than 100 full-time faculty are housed across five departments: chemical biology, pharmacy practice and administration, pharmacology and toxicology, pharmaceutics, and medicinal chemistry. Key areas of research include cancer prevention, anti-viral drug development, environmental and viral toxicology, drug metabolism and drug transporters, novel antibiotics and anticancer drugs, drug delivery and nanotechnology, and medical countermeasures against chemical threats. Pharmacy school faculty actively collaborate in major research programs, primarily with faculty at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI). In FY 2020, EMSOP faculty received more than $13 million in com - petitive research funding ($10.5 million from NIH) and ranked sixth for NIH awards among pharmacy schools in the Big T en Academic Alliance. EMSOP offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program, which provides a strong foundation in basic and clinical sciences coupled with an emphasis on patient-centered care. The program offers diverse opportunities and experience in clinical practice, the biopharmaceutical industry, public health agencies, managed care, and laboratory and computational research. Approximately 200 students complete the doctorate program each year. In 2021, the school graduated its first class of PharmD students who benefited from a major curricular transformation, with integrated coursework in systems and therapeutics, greater emphasis on professional development, structured interprofessional opportunities, and enhanced focus on the pharmacy patient care process. PharmD students at EMSOP may augment their education with dual-degree programs: PharmD/PhD; PharmD/MBA; PharmD/MS in health outcomes, policy, and economics; and PharmD/MD (the first such program in the U .S.). In addition to the doctoral degree, the school offers 48 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Aa master's program jointly with the School of Public Health: the MS in health outcomes, policy, and economics. Forty-five students are currently enrolled in this program. Also, EMSOP faculty direct three PhD/MS programs for approximately 50 students, in toxicology (offered jointly with Robert W ood Johnson Medical School), medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceutics; they also contribute to other gradu - ate programs throughout the university. Pharmacy practice clinical faculty maintain practices at 20 key hospital and health care sites in northern and central New Jersey, including Robert W ood Johnson University Hospital, an RWJBarnabas Health facility, as well as Hackensack University Medical Center, Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center, Henry J. Austin Clinic, and the Eric B. Chandler Health Center. Clinical practice areas include internal medicine, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, pediatrics, oncology, neuropsychiatric pharmacotherapy, and community-based ambulatory care. With a focus on interprofessional practice for the improvement of therapeutic outcomes, the faculty practice expands the role of the pharmacist on the health care team. Postdoctoral research associates have opportunities in comprehensive clinical residency and fellowship programs in diverse fields, including pharmacy practice, the pharmaceutical industry, and health out - comes research. Continuing education programs promote achievement, retention, and strengthening of professional competencies, support lifelong learning opportunities, and serve the varied educational needs of the pharmacy practitioners of New Jersey. The Rutgers Pharmaceutical Industry Fellowship program, launched more than 30 years ago, is today the largest such program in the U .S., training more than 200 fellows each year. Participants are primarily recent PharmD graduates, and now also include several physicians who seek training for careers in the pharmaceutical industry. In FY 2021, the school received $31 million, primarily from industry collaborators, to support this highly regarded program. 49 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ANew Jersey Medical School Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) is an academic, biomedical research, and health care enterprise whose mission is to prepare humanistic leaders in global health care and pioneering science by building upon strengths in diversity, educational innovation, immersive clinical training, and transformative research. Founded in 1954 and based in Newark, NJMS educates students and trains physicians and scientists to meet society's current and future health care needs. At NJMS, the number of applicants has increased annually from 2017 to 2021, with 6,728 applications for 2021. The entering class of 2021 includes students from 54 colleges, 22 states, and 18 countries, speaking 19 languages. Some 28% are students from communities that are underrepresented in medicine, and 51% are women. NJMS provides medical education to 750 medical students, who comprise one of the most diverse student bodies in the U .S. The curricular competencies include mastery and integration of clinical, basic, and health system sciences; excellence in clinical skills; excellence in professionalism and humanism; commitment to the health of the community and appreciation of social and cultural diversity; dedication to lifelong learning and personal wellness; and development of effective skills in education and communication. In addition to the MD degree, NJMS, either with other RBHS schools or with affiliated institutions, offers joint baccalaureate-MD (BA/MD, BS/MD), an advanced standing program in oral and surgery (OMFS/MD), MD/MBA, MD/MPH, and MD/PhD degrees. 50 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AThe NJMS curriculum is divided into three phases, where each segment is taught with an integrated organ systems approach and/or a clinically focused component. Key features are dedicated integration/assessment weeks and capstone courses to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills through clinical case-based discussion, ample time for career exploration through electives and selectives, and specialty-specific skills preparation for transition to residency. In July 2019, NJMS enrolled its first cohort into the accelerated three-year primary care MD program, addressing the national and state shortage of primary care physicians. This parallel curriculum builds upon the strengths of the four-year curriculum with clinical experienc-es and community activities. NJMS's curriculum has unique strengths, with a special commitment to the health of underserved communities. For example, a service-learning requirement teaches students to identify and reflect upon community needs and assets, fostering an enhanced sense of civic responsibility. Distinction tracks in the ar - eas of entrepreneurship and innovation in med - icine, global health, medical education, service, research, and urban health provide enhanced professional development for select students. Medical students receive clinical training through rotations at multiple hospitals, including caring for under-resourced and underinsured populations as well as predominantly suburban populations. Hospitals include University Hospital, NJMS's principal teaching hospital and New Jersey's busiest level 1 trauma center, V eterans Administration (VA) New Jersey Health Care System in East Orange, Cooperman Barn - abas Medical Center, Morristown Memorial Hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, and Jersey City Medical Center. NJMS students consistently match at a rate higher than the national average in the National Resident Matching Program and, in recent years, have averaged between 98-100%. Through affiliations with RWJBarnabas Health, University Hospital, and several other hospital affil - iates, NJMS has focused on promoting health equity by addressing the social determinants of health. NJMS and University Hospital are continuing to transition the ambulatory practices to University Hospital, with the goal of having one unified, high-functioning, and high-quality practice on the NJMS/University Hospital campus. NJMS and University Hospital have also directed significant resources toward a state-of-the-art liver transplant and future simultaneous liver-kidney transplant and electrophysiology programs at University Hospital, which will ultimately benefit the local community. 51 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AIn addition, through affiliations with RWJBarnabas Health, NJMS has expanded cardiothoracic sur - gery, ENT, gynecology/oncology, general surgery, orthopedics, pathology, pediatric pulmonology, pain management, vascular surgery, physical medicine & rehabilitation, hepatology, and neurology pro - grams. The Rutgers Center for T ransgender Health (RCTH) is a collaborative center providing the full spectrum of medical, psychiatric, and surgical care for the transgender person. This program celebrates diversity and inclusion by delivering world-class, person-centered care for patients with an emphasis on access to care, reducing LGBTQ health care disparities. There are 560 full-time, 87 part-time, and nearly 1,700 volunteer faculty in NJMS basic science and clinical departments. Faculty represent a diverse population. Annually, an average of 50 NJMS faculty members receive Castle Connolly T op Docs distinction. In FY 2021, 407 full-time clinical faculty members covered more than 239,000 ambulatory patient visits, including 40,000 telehealth visits. NJMS clinical faculty provide services through their academic departments, at 14 patient care off-site locations, and within world-class centers and institutes, including the Global T uberculosis Institute, the North Jersey Orthopedic Institute, the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), NJMS Autism Center, Hispanic Center of Excellence, and the Rutgers Center for T ransgender Health. NJPIES provides approximately 50,000 poison and drug consultations annually to New Jersey residents and clinicians. In FY 2021, NJMS faculty received a total of $127 million in extramural awards. Of this total, $80.5 million was NIH funding. Areas of research excellence include inflammation and infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, pain and addiction, and neurodegenerative diseases. NJMS faculty conducting research in these elds frequently publish in high-impact journals, and work from these groups has led to the development and commercialization of novel products for clinical use. Researchers' specic interests range from developing new therapies for autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis, to the development of state-of-the-art methods to diagnose infectious agents. NJMS occupies approximately 1,145,300 ft 2 across six facilities in Newark. Education, research, clinical care, and administrative operations are located in the Medical Science Building (which opened in 1976), the Cancer Center (opened in 2009), the International Center for Public Health and Regional Biocontain - ment Laboratory, the Doctors Ofce Center, and the Behavioral Health Sciences Building, with limited occupancy of the administrative complex buildings. 52 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ARobert Wood Johnson Medical School Originally founded in 1961 as the two-year Rutgers Medical School, Rutgers Robert W ood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) conferred its first medical degrees in June 1974. It now counts nearly 6,500 graduates among its alumni and has 649 full-time, 199 part-time, and 1,961 volunteer faculty members. For more than 60 years, RWJMS has maintained a commitment to excellence and innovation that is reflected in its core missions of education, research, patient care, and community health. T oday, RWJMS encompasses 20 basic science and clinical departments and nearly a half-dozen major institutes, including the Cardiovascular Institute, the Child Health Institute of New Jersey, and the Institute for Neurological Therapeutics. RWJMS and Robert W ood Johnson University Hospital, RWJMS's principal teaching hospital, com - prise New Jersey's premier academic medical center. In addition, the medical school has more than 45 additional hospital affiliates and ambulatory care sites throughout the region. In FY 2021, RWJMS faculty physicians, who deliver care through Rutgers Health, part of the RWJBarnabas Health system's combined medical group, provided 507,983 patient visits. The practice has implemented EPIC as the new electronic medical record system and is focused on patient safety and the provision of quality clin - ical programs that deliver optimal outcomes. Signature programs include cardiovascular care, trauma, transplantation, and women's and children's health. 53 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ARWJMS's student population includes more than 749 medical students, 46 of which are MD/PhD students in programs offered jointly with Rutgers School of Graduate Studies or Princeton University. In addition, the medical school offers several dual-degree programs: MD/MPH, jointly with the School of Public Health; MD/MBA, in conjunction with Rutgers Business School-Newark and New Brunswick; and MD/MSCTS with Rutgers School of Graduate Studies. A PharmD/MD program, the first of its kind in the nation, is available jointly with Rutgers Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy. The RWJMS Office of Global Health offers opportunities for medical students to participate in international rotations, providing learning opportunities and advocacy for medically underserved patient populations. The school is also responsible for the education of more than 450 residents and fellows in more than 50 programs, 40 accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, including unique programs in: cardiothoracic anesthesia, colorectal surgery, developmental behavioral pediatrics, forensic radiology, complex general surgical oncolo - gy, radiation oncology and pediatric endocrinology. RWJMS has been highly successful in the National Resident Matching Program, averaging a 96.6% match rate over the past decade. A new \"5 Cs\" curricu - lum was adopted in 2021, with a focus on curiosity, critical thinking, clinical skills, competency-based education, and compassion. It further integrates foundational and clinical science, with curricular threads in evidence-based medicine, health systems science, and health equity, and helps to ground professional identity formation in a longitudinal physicianship course. RWJMS receives extramural support for research from federal and nonfederal sources and has achieved national and international recognition. In FY 2021, RWJMS faculty received a total of $188.2 million in extramural awards. Of this total, $72 million in grants and subcontracts was received from NIH. Substantial strength exists within cancer, child health, neuroscience, and cell biology research programs. Among the significant external grant funders, the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation has supported programs in child health and population health. The Clinical Research Center at the medical school, a core resource across the university to conduct clinical trials, was instrumental in the swift pivot and launch of multiple therapeutic studies to treat COVID-19. It also supported the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial (ENSEMBLE) for which the school's site had the second highest number of participants worldwide, as well as Pfizer's pediatric vaccine clinical trial. In addition to a significant increase in NIH and extramural research funding, RWJMS has earned several accolades during the past five years. T wo of its investigators discovered and patented the enzyme replacement therapy for Batten disease. Within education, the school earned a full, eight-year LCME accreditation with the next survey visit in 2026. A new curriculum was planned during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and implemented at the start of the 2021-2022 academic year. The school's clinical operations earned its inaugural Comprehensive Accreditation for Ambulatory Health Care by The Joint Commission in 2017 and the ambulatory practice was reaccredited in 2020. 54 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AThe medical school's Eric B. Chandler Health Center is one of the few federally qualified health centers to be owned and operated jointly by a medical school and community board. The center strives to elimi-nate barriers to obtaining quality, family-oriented primary and dental health for its diverse, multicultural population by providing comprehensive acute and chronic care to patients of all ages. The center receives 57,000 annual patient visits at its two locations in New Brunswick and a satellite location in New Brunswick High School. The health center received $4.3 million in funding from the U .S. Human Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to respond to the COVID-19 pan - demic and expand access to needed care. As part of the public health response to the pandemic, the health center has administered more than 17,000 COVID vaccines. RWJMS also facil - itates student involvement in the greater New Brunswick community through programs such as the student-led Homeless and Indigent Popu - lation Health Outreach Project (HIPHOP). The HIPHOP-Promise Clinic provides student-run, faculty supervised health care to homeless and uninsured members of our community. The HIPHOP-Community Health Initiatives, which seek to provide students with service-learning opportunities, has undergone expansion by increased integration into the medical school curriculum. For example, Rutgers' Project ECHO, part of the Office of Community Health, provides collaborative, case-based online med - ical education on specialty subjects through live video conferencing. Throughout the pandemic, Project ECHO worked with the state to disseminate real-time COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccine best practice information to providers statewide. The Chandler Health Center once again was designated a Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), signifying that Chandler has exceeded national benchmarks. The health center also received the HRSA Quality Improvement Award, given to the highest-performing health centers nationwide. RWJMS conducts educational, research, and clinical activities in facilities space totaling more than 1.2 million ft 2 in 14 Rutgers-owned buildings, including the 221,000 ft2 Clinical Academic Building in New Brunswick, home to outpatient care, research and service laboratories, academic offices, and support programs; the 125,000 ft 2 Research Building in Piscataway, which features 27 scientific labs; and the 166,000 ft2 Child Health Institute of New Jersey. The medical school also operates out of nine leased spaces, including clinical centers in central New Jersey. The medical school's education program will be relocated to the $665 million New Jersey Innovation and T echnology Hub in New Brunswick, physical - ly aligning the pre-clinical and clerkship training programs in adjacent facilities. 55 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ARutgers School of Dental Medicine Rutgers School of Dental Medicine (RSDM), established in 1954, is the state's only dental school. It operates New Jersey's largest oral health care system, accommodating more than 150,000 patient visits annually. Its nine academic departments include community health, endodontics, oral biology, oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS), orthodontics, periodontics, pediatric dentistry, orthodontics, and restorative dentistry. More than 250 full- and part-time faculty members hold appointments at RSDM, along with more than 100 volunteer faculty members. RSDM's mission is to improve health and quality of life by preparing the next generation of oral health care professionals and scientists, providing the highest quality, evidence-based oral health care serving our state and com - munities worldwide, and advancing health through discovery and innovation. RSDM offers a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree as well as numerous postdoctoral programs, and has an active continuing dental education program. More than 400 students are enrolled in the four-year DMD program or the 27-month DMD program for qualified dentists trained outside the U .S. or Canada, and more than 70 students are pursuing postdoctoral education. The school offers both a master's in dental science (MDS) and master of science in dentistry (MSD). Students can earn postgrad - uate certificates in endodontics, pediatric dentistry, orthodontics, periodontics, and prosthodontics and orofacial pain. Continuing education and preceptorship programs are offered in infectious disease, oral medicine, oral and maxillofacial radiology, and orthodontics. RSDM also hosts general practice and oral surgery residencies. A master's and a PhD in oral biology are jointly offered with the School of Graduate Studies (SGS). In addition, seven- and eight-year joint-degree programs are offered: DMD/MPH with 56 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Athe School of Public Health, DMD/MS biomedical informatics with the School of Health Professions, DMD/MS oral biology and DMD/PhD with SGS, and OMFS/MD with NJMS. The school is the largest provider of care to New Jersey's special needs patient population, who are treat - ed at the Delta Dental of NJ Special Care Center at RBHS in Newark. It is also the largest New Jersey provider of Medicaid dental services, drawing patients from all 21 counties and surrounding states. Several thousand state residents also benefit from the school's community service activities, including oral cancer screenings, patient education, and programs for Newark school children, who are treated at the Brunsden-Villa Pediatric Center. In addition to student clinics in Newark, the dental school operates a faculty practice, emergency service, and the University Hospital dental service. The school serves patients with complex medical histories, including infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS. RSDM is the largest of only twelve programs nationwide to receive Part F Ryan White Community-Based Dental Partnership Program funding for patients with HIV/AIDS. It also operates a maxillofacial prosthodontics pro - gram that develops facial prostheses for patients disfigured by trauma or cancer treatment. Additional clinical services are provided through the school's statewide network for oral health, which provides services to low-income patients at facilities in southern New Jersey. The network houses the school's community-based dental education program (CODE), a service-learning program for fourth-year students, which is regarded as a national model. In addition, the school has three centers of excellence: the Center for T emporomandibular Disorders and Orofacial Pain, the Ina and Howard Drew Maxillofacial Imaging Center, and the Delta Dental of NJ Special Care Center. Fac-ulty also collaborate with University Hospital at the University Craniofacial Center of New Jersey. In terms of research funding, RSDM faculty received $4.2 million during FY 2021, ranking 18 out of 66 schools in funding from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). The RSDM research programs involve oral infectious diseases, neurophysiology of pain, and genomics. There are three core centers of research: the Dental Research Center and the Center for Oral Infectious Disease, both housed in the Department of Oral Biology, and the Center for Orofacial Pain, housed in the Department of Diagnostic Sciences. 57 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ASchool of Graduate Studies The integration of the RBHS schools into Rutgers promised the possibility of an infrastructure that supports the education and training of biomedical and health sciences research teams of the future, breaks down traditional silos, and enhances opportunities for interdisciplinary and translational research training. Following four years of planning, and based on the input of faculty, stu - dents and administrators across Rutgers-New Brunswick and RBHS, this possibility was realized with the 2017 merger of the New Brunswick-based Graduate School and the RBHS-based Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) into the new School of Graduate Studies (SGS). The graduate programs previously held within GSBS, as well as additional health-related RBHS-based PhD programs, coalesced to form a new unit: SGS-Biomedical and Health Sciences (SGS-BHS). In this new model, the unit dean of SGS-BHS, who reports to the RBHS chancellor, also serves as the vice dean of SGS, who reports to the SGS dean, facilitating collaboration across campuses as well as within and among disciplines. The mission of SGS-BHS is to develop scientists who will contribute new knowledge in the biomedical and health disciplines through creative research and scholarship, and become the future scientific leaders in academics, industry, and government. It is enabled by the coordination of biomedical and health science programs across RBHS and Rutgers-New Brunswick, together with the wealth of educational opportunities offered by the humanities and social and physical science disciplines on the New Brunswick campus. SGS-BHS is poised to play a leading national role in the development of new 58 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Acurriculum and broader opportunities for the biomedical and health scientists of the future, encourage and facilitate research collaborations among biomedical and health scientists across Rutgers, and raise the visibility of graduate education at Rutgers, attracting top students from premier colleges worldwide. With programs based on the Newark and New Brunswick/Piscataway campuses, SGS-BHS offers doctoral and master's degrees, as well as certificates and concentrations in many biomedical and health disciplines. Currently hosting 1,000 students across RBHS, SGS-BHS draws its more than 600 educa - tors from the research SPH, EMSOP, SN), schools based Rutgers-New Brunswick (primarily School of Arts and Sciences [SAS], School of Engineering [SOE], School of Environmental and Biological Sciences [SEBS]), other New Jersey research-intensive universities (New Jersey Institute of T echnology, Princeton University) as well as industry. Doctoral programs offered include biochemistry, biomedical engineering, cell and developmental biology, cell and molecular pharmacology, immunology and infectious disease, integrative biology, environmental and exposure science, molecu - lar biology, molecular genetics, neuroscience, nursing, physiology, public health, and tox - icology. Several dual degree doctoral pro - grams are also available, including MD/PhD training is offered through three programs. The master of science (MS) is a thesis-based program that can concentrate on any of the biomedical disciplines repre - sented by our PhD programs. The master of biomedical sciences (MBS) program is an intense program designed to meet the diverse needs of students intending to pursue an advanced degree program (MD, DMD, PhD) and/or industry-based careers. This program offers opportunities to partic-ipate in medical school-level courses and specialized mentoring from faculty in our professional schools. Approximately 70% of our MBS students are accepted into advanced degree programs (including those at RWJMS, NJMS and RSDM). The master of science in clinical translational science (MSCTS) pro - gram is designed to train future leaders in clinical and translational research. Students are expected to hold advanced degrees and can choose to concentrate in either the translational research or the clinical research track, depending on their career goals. Dual master's degree programs are also available, includ - 59 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Aing the MS/MBA degree (offered with Rutgers Business School), the MS/MPH degree (offered with SPH) and the MSCTS/MD degree offered with RWJMS. SGS-BHS also offers certificate programs in pharmacological science, stem cell biology and clinical/translational science. A plethora of studies over recent years has exposed a gap in our traditional training of biomedical and health scientists \u2014 the lack of formalized training in the complementary skills needed for a successful career. In response to this need, SGS-BHS has developed several opportunities to further the career development of our trainees. The largest of these programs, initially funded by the NIH, is iJOBS (inter - disciplinary Job Opportunities for Biomedical Scientists), a career development program that maintains research as the primary trainee focus while offering programming to broaden trainees' perspectives, experiences, and knowledge regarding academic and non-academic careers. Covering a wide spectrum of career tracks in academics, industry, government, and nonprofits, as well as essential skills in commu - nication, financial management, and business management, iJOBS has allowed us to expand the tradi-tional doctoral training more broadly for success in life sciences careers. This program, initially begun on the New Brunswick campus, has expanded to all research-intensive universities in New Jersey, providing career enhancement to more than 1,000 pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Several outreach programs focus on teaching science and research methods to local high school and community college students; some of these programs have been recognized at the national level. SGS-BHS also participates in state and national educational programs for high school and undergraduate students, including the New Jersey Science Olym - piad, the national Brain Bee, and the NJ SEEDS program, to prepare academically talented, financially limited youth for success at competitive schools. Finally, a long history of NIH-funded grant support has allowed us to develop unique training opportunities for underrepre - sented graduate students. 60 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ASchool of Health Professions Rutgers School of Health Professions (SHP), established in 1976, is the largest and most diverse health professions school in the nation.

SPH also offers high school students an opportunity to learn more about public health through its immersive summer camp. The signa - ture initiative of SPH, the Urban Public Health Paradigm (Big Cities Program), convenes repre - sentatives from government, community-based organizations, businesses, and communities to collaboratively develop new approaches to better support health through research, and to offer hands-on learning, and community-embedded service delivery. 66 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AOriginal RBHS Centers and Institutes Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey As New Jersey's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, together with RWJBarnabas Health, is dedi- cated to improving the prevention, detection, treatment, and care of patients with cancer through the transformation of laboratory discoveries into clinical practice. In collaboration with RWJBarnabas Health, Rutgers Cancer Institute delivers advanced comprehensive cancer care to adults and children, including access to clinical trials; conducts cutting-edge cancer research; and provides outreach and education regarding can - cer prevention, detection, and treatment. Rutgers Cancer Institute's research program members had a total of $107.7 million in peer-reviewed funding in FY 2021, of which $100.1 million was received from NIH. The coveted NCI comprehensive designa - tion is granted competitively to institutions characterized by scientific excellence and the ability to bring research discoveries to patients. T o gain a comprehensive desig - nation, NCI's highest ranking, a center must meet rigorous criteria in cancer care, research, prevention, education, and ser - vice to its catchment area. NCI-designated centers, such as Rutgers Cancer Institute, are the centerpiece of the nation's effort to reduce disability and death from cancer and are heralded as providing great value to any state committed enough to obtain and maintain such an institution. An NCI-designated center brings value to the state and its citizens through opportunities, prestige, resources, and funding not otherwise available. The institute manages more than 100,000 patient visits per year and approximately 250 clinical trials at its 225,000 ft 2 facility in New Brunswick and, along with RWJBarnabas Health, cares for more than one-third of New Jersey's cancer patients. A dedicated team of nationally renowned specialists, including medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, social workers, and nurses, identify and meet the needs of the individual patient. 67 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX AThe institute's research programs and shared resource core facilities enhance and support the cancer research of more than 300 members from multiple schools throughout Rutgers University, Princeton University, and collaborating institutions. Current research programs and initiatives include: cancer metabolism and immunology; metabolic interactions between the tumor and the rest of the body, focusing on how the body supports tumor growth and metastasis, and how tumors induce cachexia; dietary strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer; the interplay of host metabolism, the gut microbiome and the anti-cancer immune response; pharmacology; genomic instability and cancer ge - netics; precision medicine; cellular therapies; community outreach and engagement and reducing can - cer health disparities throughout New Jersey; biomedical informatics; and systems biology. The institute also has a multi-pronged effort to ensure diversity within its faculty, scientific members, trainees, and staff. Basic scientists, clinical researchers, and population scientists meet regularly to exchange informa - tion and ensure that laboratory discoveries are refined and applied to clinical care as quickly as possible, that clinical observations reach laboratory researchers on a continuing basis, and that prevention strate - gies are interwoven into all research programs. Educational efforts include formal training programs, seminars, and educational events targeted to faculty, postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows, high school science teachers, and undergraduate and high school students. The institute offers a residency training program in radiation oncology, as well as fellowship training in hematology/oncology and surgical treatment for breast cancer. The institute's oncology nursing education program provides a wide variety of continuing education for cancer-focused nurses throughout New Jersey. The institute hosts a statewide Annual Retreat on Cancer Research in collaboration with the New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research (NJCCR) and a joint Annual Research Symposium with Princeton University. The institute's Rutgers Y outh Enjoy Science initiative aims to address cancer disparities in our catchment area by reducing educational inequities, and provides cancer research training and professional development support to high school science teachers and high school and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. In collaboration with the New Brunswick Development Corporation, RWJBarnabas Health and the in - stitute broke ground in 2021 on the Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center, the state's first freestanding cancer hospital. Scheduled to open in 2024, this $750 million, 510,000 ft 2, state-of-the-art structure will house inpatient, outpatient, and ancillary services all under one roof. This is in addition to laboratories where critical scientific investigation will be amplified, enabling physician-scientists to translate find - ings directly to patients. With the help of a key $25 million investment in the project from Middlesex County, workforce training and education will be offered to job applicants through an affiliation with Middlesex College and others to foster innovation and discovery, and provide an environment filled with robust educational prospects for county residents.68 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ACenter for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine The Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine (CABM) was founded in 1985 and designated by the New Jersey Commission on Science and T echnology as a New Jersey Advanced T echnology Center. CABM is located on the Busch Campus in Piscataway in a 100,000 ft 2 building completed in 1990. Its mission is to make fundamental discoveries in biomedical research, develop new technologies, translate these to improve human health, and educate a next generation of scholars in the biomedical sciences. CABM has nineteen faculty members who hold academic appointments in departments within RWJMS, EMSOP, and the Rutgers-New Brunswick School of Arts and Sciences. Several CABM faculty members are also members of Rutgers Cancer Institute or are non-resident members of the Rutgers Center for Integrative Proteomics Research. Several CABM faculty members hold administrative leadership positions. Interdisciplinary research at CABM is aimed at discovery and characterization of potential ther - apeutic targets with projects focused in the areas of infectious disease, neurodevelopmental/neu - rodegenerative disorders, the microbiome, rare diseases, and cancer. Infectious disease programs advance development of new drugs to combat drug-resistance in HIV , characterize new targets for SARS-CoV-2 drugs, and explore antibiotics effective against drug-resistant pathogenic bac-teria. Programs in neurodevelopment, neurode - generation, and disease focus on a newly discov - ered autism susceptibility gene, genetic loci for schizophrenia, and an enzyme replacement treatment for Batten disease, a fatal hereditary childhood neurodegenerative disorder. They also examine key steps in retinal development, mechanisms of regulation of circadian clocks, and neuronal circuit mechanisms of deficits in learning and memory. Programs in genetics highlight RNA metabolism pathways, as well as coupling functional genomics techniques with computational modeling to understand gene regulation in human health and disease. Microbiome programs are focused on obesity and other metabolic process-es, type 1 diabetes and other immunological disorders, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disor - ders, as well as malignancy. The rare disease focus involves studies of porphyrias and diseases caused by mutation in the intermediate filament cytoskeletal proteins, and drug development for these disorders. Cancer programs focus on identifying and exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities, regulatory mechanisms and metastasis in breast cancer, and combination therapies for lymphoma. Advanced technologies are central to these projects. 69 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ACABM faculty established and manages core facilities with shared equipment, including a biological mass spectrometry facility, an X-ray crystallography laboratory, and a bioinformatics core. Many proj - ects are conducted collaboratively between CABM investigators and investigators throughout Rutgers. CABM faculty received a total of nearly $5.4 million in extramural awards in FY 2021, of which $4 mil - lion was received from NIH. CABM faculty members are active in classroom and laboratory teaching. T rainees include undergraduate and graduate students from many different programs, medical students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting faculty scholars. The NIH-funded Biotechnology T raining Program for doctoral students, co-established and co-directed with the Rutgers School of Engineering's Depart - ment of Biomedical Engineering, is now in its 32nd year of support and is Rutgers' longest running NIH training program. CABM also hosts a summer undergraduate research experience. CABM initia - tives with biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry collaborators are central to its mission. CABM has spawned two biotechnology companies: Prodaptics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., established in 2011, and Nexomics Biosciences, established in 2008. A collaboration with BioMarin Pharmaceuticals resulted in the first approved therapy to treat Batten disease. CABM is one of the centers of the Rutgers University Microbiome Program, and its related New Jersey Kids Study. Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute The Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) was established in 1986 in recognition of the environmental and occupational challenges facing residents of New Jersey, the nation, and the world. EOHSI's major objectives are to identify and measure environmental and occupational chemicals and stressors to which humans are exposed at work, home, and play; and to advance understanding of mechanisms by which these exposures impact human health. Researchers apply the knowledge to develop risk assessments, prevention, intervention, and mitigation strategies to reduce exposures and their adverse human health impacts, and develop and deliver treatments to exposed patients. EOHSI members also respond to emerging environmental issues, threats and disasters, whether natural or man-made, to assess exposures and risk to communities, first responders and clean-up crews. The institute's educational mission includes the development of programs that engage high school, undergraduate, graduate, postgraduate and professional students in environmental research to train the next generation of environmental health professionals. In addition, EOHSI educates and empowers 70 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Aaffected populations through community-engaged research and citizen science. The institute's mem - bers contribute to the development of public policies related to environmental and occupational risks by serving as advisers to international, national, state, and local governments as well as organizations, including advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations, and community corporations. EOHSI's 78,000 ft 2 building on the Busch Campus houses research laboratories for approximately twenty resident faculty scientists. T o accomplish its transdisciplinary mission, the institute collaborates with more than 60 non-resident members representing more than twenty departments and schools across Rutgers. Institute members are affiliated with five highly interactive divisions organized around specific research affinities and approaches: environmental and population health biosciences; global environmental health; toxicology; clinical research and occupational medicine; and community and government engagement. The goal of the institute is to provide a physical and intellectual hub that integrates environmental health related research and fosters long-term multidisciplinary collaborative research within RBHS and across all of Rutgers. T o accomplish its integrative research mission and goals, EOHSI is home to multiple externally fund - ed centers, including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (CEED) presently in its 35th year of NIH funding; the EOHSI Clinical Center; the CounterACT Research Center of Excellence, currently in its 15th year of funding and renewed for another five years; the Ozone Research Center; and the Center for Exposure and Risk Modeling.

UCHC has a budget of $205 million and has achieved national recognition as a model for the advancement of physical and mental health services delivery within a criminal justice system. UBHC provides training to medical students, residents, fellows, social work and nursing students, and psychology interns. Annually, UBHC supports the education of nineteen psychiatric residents and fellows, including two forensic fellows, and thirteen psychology interns, including four forensic place - ments, all sponsored by American Psychological Association-accredited programs, and dozens of social work interns. In FY21, UBHC received $5.5 million in federal grant funds, $19.2 million in state grant funds and an additional $2.2 million in non-governmental grant funds. UBHC's total indirect cost recoveries were $6.6 million in FY21. UBHC received a generous donation of $30 million in 2019 from alumna Marlene Brandt that has led to the development of the Brandt Behavioral Health T reatment Center and Residence, which opens its doors in 2022. In close collaboration with the Rutgers Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, this state-of-the-art residential treatment facility will also provide outpatient services, along with specialized behavioral health resources for the community. 74 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ANew RBHS Centers and Institutes Since the adoption of the strategic plan in 2014, RBHS has launched six new centers and institutes to advance signature priorities of the plan in targeted biomedical, clinical, and translational research areas. Brain Health Institute The Brain Health Institute (BHI) was established in 2013 as a Rutgers-wide entity, as the 2014 strategic plan was being formed, with recruitment of its first director in 2014, to become an internationally recognized center for basic, translational, and clinical research into the biological bases of human brain function and dysfunction. By supporting and coordinating neuroscience across all campuses, BHI's mission is to unite Rutgers University's dynamic and diverse neuroscience community. BHI uses an institutional perspective to help realize the full potential of neuroscience research at Rutgers. It serves as a major hub for the Rutgers neuroscience community and is a growing interdisciplinary institute consisting of more than 300 principal investigators with neuroscience laboratories across 33 departments and seven schools of various campuses of Rutgers University and RBHS. BHI is a virtual institute with administrative offices located in the School of Public Health/RWJMS Research Building in Piscataway. Rutgers currently has more than 1,000 neuroscience investigators, trainees and staff spread over multiple campuses across the state, with expertise spanning the entire spectrum of neuroscience disciplines. One of the main goals of BHI is to facilitate communication and collaborations between these Rutgers neuroscientists. BHI identified four areas of strength in the newly integrated Rutgers, and created four corresponding focus areas as opportunities for further development of neuroscience at Rutgers: neurodevelopment (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, T ourette's); neurodegeneration and injury (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord and traumatic brain injury); cognitive and sensory neuroscience (e.g., age- related dementias, pain, auditory disorders); motivational and affective neuroscience (e.g., addiction, eating disorders, obesity, depression, anxiety). Since 2014, BHI has developed new research centers and initiatives within the four focus areas. As a component of the Rutgers Brain Health Institute, Rutgers University Addiction Research Center (RARC) engages faculty across all Rutgers schools and campuses with expertise in 75 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Aaddiction prevention, research, treatment, education, and public policy. In addition, BHI has recruited 21 high-caliber, extramurally funded, established and early career faculty, with expertise in the four focus areas, into various schools and departments at Rutgers. At their recruitment, these faculty had combined annual total grant awards exceeding $20 million. The total amount of NIH funding to Rutgers for brain, neuroscience, and mental health research is more than double that of all other New Jersey universities combined. Rutgers currently ranks fifth among the fourteen Big T en universities for total brain, neuroscience, and mental health research funding. Center for Population-Level Bioethics The Center for Population-Level Bioethics (CPLB) was founded in 2019. The center is dedicated to the study of macro-level bioethical dilemmas: those that arise outside the clinical encoun - ter, at the level of the population, the state, the country, or the globe. Examples include how to prioritize resources between disease areas, rural and urban patients, and age cohorts or generations; how to conceptualize, measure and evaluate health inequalities or disease severity; the acceptability of paternalistic health promotion measures; appropriate health system pandemic response; and distributive aspects of (action on) climate change. The CPLB approach emphasizes collaboration and interdisciplin - arity, seeking to inform and be informed by other fields of inquiry such as general ethics and philosophy, health policy, and health economics. CPLB publishes in high-impact venues on these questions, holds public events, and organizes CPLB Dilemmas, where ethicists, policymakers, and experts from a variety of disciplines weigh in on important and timely ethical issues in health policy, and train postdoctor - al fellows. CPLB stands out in research relating to the distribution of risks between persons, groups, countries, and generations, as well as to the environment, environmental justice, and long-term effects of policy on human and animal welfare. Rutgers Global Health Institute Rutgers Global Health Institute (RGHI) was established in 2017 as an outcome of the univer - sitywide and RBHS strategic plans. RGHI aims to promote health equity in New Jersey and around the world, with a focus on health care access and social determinants of health in under - served populations. The institute emphasizes team-based, interprofessional approaches that draw partic-ipation from across and beyond Rutgers. RGHI's members include more than 100 diverse faculty and professionals from across most of the university's schools and from all Rutgers locations. These members have generated award-winning research that has influenced fields such as infectious diseases, women's and gender studies, biomedical informatics, epidemiology, health systems, environmental and ecolog - ical science, and translational medicine. Faculty also are actively involved in mentoring diverse future 76 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Ascholars and practitioners at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Among these future scholars are the members and leaders of the 70-plus member student council, which also represents many Rutgers schools and programs. The institute's main office is in New Brunswick, with additional operations based in several of New Jersey's underserved communities, in - cluding Newark and T renton, as well as in the African country of Botswana. Program staff are involved in important on-the-ground efforts as part of two broad initiatives: Equitable Recovery for New Jersey's Small Businesses and the Botswana-Rutgers Partnership for Health. T o effectively en - gage communities and build trust, and to build a diverse, inclusive atmosphere, the institute has focused on hiring people who live in the communities we serve. The Equitable Recovery program provides cru - cial support to small businesses and nonprofit organizations in low-income and minority communities, which have suffered disproportionately because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program includes many services that meet the diverse needs of employers, employees, and their families, ultimately build - ing community resilience. The Botswana-Rutgers Partnership for Health, which involves Botswana's Ministry of Health and W ellness and the University of Botswana, is addressing the rising burden of can - cer in Botswana and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The affiliation relationship is helping to strengthen health systems through capacity-building initiatives in education, training, and research endeavors. The work of the institute begins with service\u2014identifying, collaborating, and creating long-term solutions together with communities in need of our help. Through these sustained relationships, RGHI also edu - cates future global health leaders and practitioners and answers key research questions to improve health in vulnerable populations and bring about lasting, transformational impact. Institute for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases The Institute for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases (i3D) is dedicated to fostering innova - tive, cross-disciplinary, basic, and translational research and education focused on diseases of infectious or inflammatory origin. i3D currently has strong programs ranging from fundamental laboratory research to clinical trials testing the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Community outreach is also an essential component of i3D, including patient enrollment in large clinical trials in Newark and new pipeline programs to involve community high school and college students in i3D immersive laboratory and learning research experiences. i3D was launched in 2016 and is a Rutgers-wide institute 77 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Athat currently includes 53 faculty members and 150 faculty associate members, receiving a total of $69.6 million in NIH funding in FY 2021. Most of these faculty are members of one of four distinct centers within the i3D umbrella: the Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Pathogens; the Center for Immunity and Inflammation; the Public Health Research Institute (PHRI); and the more recently established Center for COVID Response and Pandemic Preparedness (CCRP2) that was established in March 2020 as a prompt response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The i3D faculty members have ap - pointments in both clinical and basic science departments across NJMS. Overall, across these different centers, i3D has recruited 24 new faculty members on the tenure-track as full mem - bers of i3D since 2015. i3D has also recently recruited a senior faculty member who will direct a newly formed center focused on virology and named the Center for Virus-Host-Innate-Immunity (CVHII). In collaboration with the Brain Health Institute, i3D is also building a new program in neuro-inflammation, which bridges expertise across these two large institutes. Areas of current strength within i3D include pathogen diagnostics, immunology of infectious disease, inflammatory diseases including lupus and inflammatory bowel diseases, immunology of fungal infections, microbiome research, allergic inflammation, cancer immunology, pathogenic mechanisms, pain, struc-tural biology, and tuberculosis. A number of these studies are already being translated to new treatments for disease or novel diagnostics for identification of specific pathogens. For example, fundamental research in i3D has recently led to the development of a biotech company, NemaGen Discoveries, Inc., which is testing nov - el therapies targeting mast cells for treatment of asthma and allergies. Global NIH-funded research sites in India, Uganda, Brazil, and South Africa perform basic, translational, and clinical studies with high threat pathogens including SARS, tuberculosis, HIV , and Candida. Research cores provide essential equipment, facilities, and highly trained staff not typically available in laboratories of individual investi-gators. i3D faculty are scientific directors of many of our core facilities, including the new Rutgers-wide gnotobiotic germ-free core facility for microbiome research; facility; sequencing core; and the flow cytometry core. i3D in Newark also operates the NIH-funded Rutgers Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL), one of 12 in the U .S., where research on highly infectious select pathogens can be conducted in biosafety level 3 labo - ratory (BSL3) conditions. The RBL has a highly active BSL3 vivarium, for research with experimental models, as well as substantial in vitro culture facilities. 78 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX ACenter for Tobacco Studies One of the newest RBHS centers, the Rutgers Center for T obacco Studies (CTS), became a chancellor-level center in 2019 and engaged faculty across RBHS and Rutgers University in its mission to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. CTS is focused on research that informs tobacco interventions, including regulations and policies; the delivery of evidence-based treat - ment; dissemination of research findings to key stakeholders; and training of treatment providers and the next generation of tobacco control researchers. The CTS began in 2000 as the T obacco Surveillance and Evaluation Research Program (TSERP) at the School of Public Health. While its primary mission was to evaluate New Jersey's Comprehensive T obacco Control Program, the program later expanded its popu - lation focus beyond the state, secured grants from NIH and the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation, and became a recognized center. The T obacco Dependence Program delivered face-to-face, evidence-based tobacco treatment and provided continuing education in tobacco treatment for health care professionals. In 2009, Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and T obacco Control Act (TCA), giving the U .S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory authority over tobacco products, and the center once again expanded its research focus and included the emerging field of tobacco regulatory science. In 2018, in collaboration with investigators at the University of Pennsylvania, the CTS became one of only nine centers of excellence in tobacco regulatory science supported by the NIH and FDA. Globally, tobacco-caused diseases kill one in ten adults and such deaths are projected to exceed 8 million annually by 2030. T obacco use disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations. Accordingly, the mission of the center is to reduce and ultimately eliminate tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in New Jersey, the U .S., and globally. The center is comprised of eleven core faculty members in New Brunswick and seven additional associate faculty members. Center members hold faculty appointments in schools including SPH, RWJMS, and Rutgers-New Brunswick's Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology and the School of Arts and Science's Department of Psychology. Collectively, CTS members received a total of $4.6 million in extramural awards in FY 2021; of this funding, $4 million was received from NIH. CTS is a nationally recognized resource in the areas of tobacco policy, tobacco regulatory science, tobacco cessation, tobacco control programming and evaluation, and communication and marketing. Center 79 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX Amembers serve as advisers to national, state, and local organizations on these topics, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering & Medicine; the U .S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Cancer Institute; the FDA; and the New Jersey Department of Health. The center has a long-standing commitment to the state of New Jersey, and the Center's T obacco Dependence Clinic has treated more than 8,000 smokers and tobacco users since its inception. As a leader in tobacco treatment, the center also provides technical assistance to the eleven state-supported \"Quitcenters, \" and is actively engaged in increasing smoking cessation delivery in cancer centers throughout the state, via the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I), part of NCI's Moonshot Initiative, in collaboration with Rutgers Cancer Institute. CTI also offers cutting edge, nationally recognized, continuing education for clinicians. It is one of only a handful of programs accredited by the Council of T obacco T reatment T raining Programs. The training curriculum prepares clinicians to become certified tobacco treatment specialists and draws from the center members' treatment and research expertise. T o date, the Center has trained 3,200 health professionals from 48 states and eleven countries, impacting tobacco treatment delivery across the country and the globe. Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science The interdisciplinary Rutgers Institute for T ranslational Medicine and Science (RITMS) fo - cuses on therapeutic and diagnostic approaches to understanding the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis, susceptibility, and responses to therapy. Fostering a discovery to practice to policy approach, RITMS uses state-of-the-art \"omic\" approaches, informatics and high-throughput human cell and tissue models to enable the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutics to cure disease and to predict patients' responses to treatment. RITMS receives extramural support from the NIH and industry; members include faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students from the schools of medicine, public health, nursing, dentistry, and pharmacy. The RITMS manages the only NIH-supported Clinical and T ranslational Science Award (CTSA) hub in New Jersey, the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and T ranslational Science (NJ ACTS). NJ ACTS represents the largest statewide alliance devoted to translational science that boasts a membership of over 120 scientists across Rutgers, New Jersey Institute of T echnology, and Princeton University. Alliance institutional members are dedicated to translating discoveries into new therapeutics, devices, and software focused on improving health. Also, RITMS is the administrative home for Rutgers Optimizes Innovation, an NIH-sponsored program that supports commercialization of academic assets and fosters programmatic development of entrepreneurs. Located in the Children's Health Institute of New Jersey, the RITMS occupies 8,000 ft 2 of laboratory and office space equipped with state-of-the- art molecular imaging, biochemical instrumentation, vivarium, and exposure biology capabilities.80 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Accomplishments of the Inaugural Strategic Plan The inaugural RBHS strategic plan was released in November 2014 with the following key initiatives: Academic Initiatives Signature Research Programs Complementary Research Programs Educational Initiatives Clinical Initiatives Community Service Activities Integration Among Schools and Across Rutgers Other Enabling Structures Financial and Development Strategie s Selected highlights for each of the key initiatives appear below.

Cancer A new director of Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey was appointed in 2016. In 2018, NCI renewed the Rutgers Cancer Institute core center grant, along with its status as New Jersey's only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Rutgers Cancer Institute leveraged its relationship with its NCI Research Consortium partner, Princeton University, to establish the Ludwig Cancer Research Princeton Branch\u2014 a collaboration between Princeton, Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health\u2014 with several Rutgers Cancer Institute faculty named to lead the branch. Their work on cancer metabolism complements that of the recently launched Duncan and Nancy MacMillan Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence, which resulted in the recruitment of new immunology-focused faculty and working groups and the establishment of a new Good Manufacturing Production (GMP) facility. Rutgers Cancer Institute received an additional $10 million state appropriation in 2021 to support pediatric cancer research. Rutgers Cancer Institute received an NIH T32 training grant enabling investigators from Rutgers and Princeton University to mentor postdoctoral trainees in cancer metabolism and tumor-host interactions. The Center for Cancer Health Equity at Rutgers Cancer Institute and Rutgers School of Public Health has seen significant growth in the short time since its establishment. This includes establishment of the Cancer Community Action Board (CCAB). In collaboration with the CCAB, the first cohort of the Citizen Scientist Program was trained and new cohorts continue to be enrolled. T o further demonstrate the institute's commitment to embracing and reflecting the diver - sity within our state and nation, a new associate director of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) was recruited to establish a DEI office and various initiatives for Rutgers Cancer Institute over the next several years. Rutgers Cancer Institute's ScreenNJ initiative received a $2 million increase in its FY21 budget (total of $4 million) to expand services for all preventable cancers and hereditary risk assessment plus acquisition of a mobile unit.82 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Rutgers Cancer Institute and Rutgers Global Health Institute established a global oncology fellowship in Botswana as part of the hematology-oncology fellowship program at RWJMS and in collaboration with the University of Botswana and Botswana Ministry of Health and W ellness. Environmental and Occupational Health A new director of the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) was appointed in 2017. EOHSI played a significant role in the award of the NIH CTSA grant to RBHS. In 2018, the NIH NIEHS P01 Center Grant for Environmental Health Sciences was renewed; the Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (CEED) was established with funding from NIH in 1987 as one of 22 environmental health sciences core centers in the country. In 2021, Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence was renewed by NIH. CounterACT focuses on the development of new and improved medical counter - measures against high priority chemical threats. EOSHI has supported recruitments, in collaboration with EMSOP and SPH, of multiple outstanding faculty members with strong research programs in the areas of environmental epidemiology, maternal-child health, endocrine disruptors, nano-materials toxicology, expo - sure science and engineering. The institute has expanded its footprint in community-engaged research and environmental justice through both research and educational programs. The toxicology training grant and clinical residency grants were also renewed and expanded in the number of trainees supported. EOHSI researchers, in collaboration with Infinite Biologicals, Inc., developed the first robust and widely used saliva-based PCR test for Sars-CoV-2 infection and played a central role in modeling the spread of COVID-19 in communities across the New Jersey. In 2021, a new director of the Division of Environmental and Population Health Biosciences was recruited. Infectious Disease The new Institute for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases (i3D) is developing areas of strength, including pathogen diagnostics, immunology of infectious disease, inflammatory diseases including lupus and inflammatory bowel diseases, immunology of fungal infections, microbiome research, allergic inflammation, cancer immunology, pathogenic mechanisms, pain, structural biology, and tuberculosis. 83 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Institute faculty have published papers in high-impact journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Immunology, Science, Immunity, and Nature Immunology. These publications represent major contributions to these fields. In 2020, i3D established the Center for COVID Response and Pandemic Preparedness (CCRP2) as the Rutgers-wide institutional hub for COVID-19 research and innovation. Several studies carried out by i3D investigators are already being translated to new treat - ments for disease or novel diagnostics for identification of specific pathogens. For example, fundamental research in i3D has recently led to the development of a biotech company, NemaGen Discoveries, Inc., which is testing novel therapies targeting mast cells for treat - ment of asthma and allergies. Groundbreaking research in conjunction with the biotech company Cepheid has led to the development of new diagnostics for detection of tuberculosis and SARS-Cov-2, the caus- ative agent of COVID-19. Global NIH-funded research sites in India, Uganda, Brazil, and South Africa perform basic, translational, and clinical studies with high threat pathogens including SARS, tuberculosis, HIV , and Candida. Neuroscience In 2014, the inaugural director of the Brain Health Institute (BHI), a joint initiative of RBHS and Rutgers-New Brunswick, was appointed. BHI launched the Rutgers Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia Research Center (RUADRC) in 2017. RUADRC research focuses on identifying disease mechanisms using genetic, cellular, organismal, and behavioral approaches in animal and human model systems. Understanding disease mechanisms will help uncover pathways to drug development. The Rutgers-Princeton Center for Computational Cognitive Neuropsychiatry (CCNP) was formed by BHI in 2016 as a major collaborative effort to leverage the expertise in Princeton's Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Institute and multiple departments across Rutgers. In 2022, BHI recruited a director of the new Rutgers Addiction Research Center (RARC). RARC is the only comprehensive addiction center in New Jersey with the capacity to impact the addiction epidemic through cutting-edge approaches from precision medicine, preclinical research, treatment and care of individuals and families coping with addiction, public policy innovation and reform, and interprofessional education of clinical, research, and criminal justice workforces.84 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Over the past seven years, BHI has recruited 21 high-caliber, extramurally funded, senior and junior faculty. In 2014, just prior to the launch of BHI, the total FY NIH grant awards to Rutgers for brain, neuroscience, and mental health research was $33 million. In 2020, the total NIH grant awards to Rutgers for brain, neuroscience, and mental health research increased to nearly $84 million. Community Health and Health Systems (Emerging Signature Program) The program's goal is to promote evidence-based population health improvement by engaging diverse communities and advancing delivery system innovation. In 2016, an executive director of health systems and population health integration was recruited. Rutgers Cancer Institute's ScreenNJ collaborates with, connects, and supports health care provider agencies, public health agencies, and community organizations throughout the state to provide education, refer patients, or directly provide cancer screening services to reduce cancer mortality rates and disparities. ScreenNJ has provided education on screening guide - lines to more than 11,000 health care professionals. It has also connected more than 51,000 at-risk members of the public to cancer screening education and prevention, screened more than 40,000 uninsured/underinsured individuals at risk for colorectal cancer, screened more than 2,800 uninsured/underinsured individuals at risk for lung cancer, and linked more than 6,000 individuals with tobacco cessation support. The Cancer Institute launched the BEA T Platform (Bridging Divides, Education & Empowerment, Arts Expression, T ouching Lives), a web-based, interactive platform highlighting the arts as a mechanism for cancer-related messaging. RWJMS launched the Rutgers Center Advancing Research and Evaluation for Patient- Centered Care (CARE-PC) as a cross-disciplinary affiliation mobilizing resources across RBHS schools and institutes. The center serves as a hub for patient-centered research, connecting researchers with clinicians who are addressing health disparities and barriers to care among all patient populations. The goal is to better enable patients across health systems to make informed health decisions and play a role in their own care. In 2017, the Office of Health Affairs was established at Rutgers University. The office began implementing a structure and processes to improve health synergies across Rutgers by incor - porating leaders for student health and occupational health into a unified, universitywide clinical enterprise.85 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B SPH worked in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) to launch the NJ Community Contact T racing Corps program to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RBHS participated in the NJDOH Commissioner's Professional Advisory Council to sup - port the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and developed community education pro - grams through its \"On the Pandemic\" podcast (15 episodes), conducted 15 health briefings, and managed the state's COVID19 Call Center through the NJMS Poison Control Center. In 2021, a vice chancellor of population health for RBHS and a deputy chief population health officer at RWJBarnabas Health was appointed. COMPLEMENTARY RESEARCH PROGRAMS The complementary programs focus on research areas that are essential for the growth and development of RBHS and critical for the success of RBHS signature programs and the Rutgers mission. RBHS leads the complementary programs in clinical re - search and public health; the other two (informatics, and drug discovery and devel - opment) are led by the university's central administration with RBHS participation. Clinical Research (led by RBHS) In 2016, the Rutgers Institute for T ranslational Medicine and Science (RITMS) was estab - lished, and an inaugural director was recruited. In 2019, the NIH awarded the Clinical and T ranslational Science Award (CTSA) to RITMS and, with Princeton University and New Jersey Institute of T echnology, created the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and T ranslation Science (NJACTS). A clinical trials office was established in 2020 for the purposes of advancing and enhancing RBHS clinical research. Public Health, Including Global Health (led by RBHS) In 2015, SPH was reorganized, moving most faculty affiliations in the RWJMS Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine and NJMS Department of Preventive and Community Health to SPH. In 2016, a director was appointed to create the Rutgers Global Health Institute. The institute was formally established in 2017 with a Rutgers-wide membership, governance, and strategic plan. A new SPH dean was appointed in 2017.86 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Drug Discovery and Development (led by Rutgers) Rutgers joined the international Academic Drug Discovery Consortium as the first member in New Jersey. Rutgers T ranslational Science (RTS) was established, with capabilities in molecular design and synthesis (laboratories on the Busch Campus), a molecular imaging center (Gordon Road), research pathology (Gordon Road), and small molecular plating/screening (School of Environmental and Biological Sciences). Rutgers receives $4 million as a new hub under the NIH REACH program to accelerate development of biomedical technologies into commercially viable diagnostics, devices, therapeutics, and tools. Informatics (led by Rutgers, with RBHS accomplishments listed below) In 2021, an associate vice chancellor (AVC) for clinical innovation and data analytics was appointed to foster a culture of innovation across multiple medical and health disciplines and provide leadership on operational data analytics and clinical decision-making support systems. The AVC works closely with RBHS leadership, the combined clinical practice, and RWJBarnabas Health leadership to advance evidence-based practices for qualitative imple - mentation improvement to ensure robust, dynamic, and high-value clinical decision support. In 2021, a chief research informatics officer was appointed to address the challenges and oppor - tunities of conducting research in an increasingly complex, data-intensive health care environ - ment. The officer works closely with Rutgers Office of Information T echnology, the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and T ranslational Science, the RBHS Office of Research, and collabora - tors throughout RWJBarnabas Health to expand informatics and data analytics capacity. EPIC is being implemented as the electronic health record system. EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES Seven initiatives were undertaken to improve or enrich educational and training programs across RBHS. Novel Approaches to Teaching Several simulation laboratories are now being operated at SN, EMSOP, SHP, NJMS, and RWJMS to enhance the learning experience by creating a realistic clinical experience in a controlled environment.87 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Graduate Medical Education Established the Health Education Executive Council (HEEC) and a subcommittee, Inter - professional Programs Advisory Committee (IPAC), with membership from Rutgers and RWJBarnabas Health. Rutgers Health's sponsoring institution status was established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, becoming the largest graduate medical education (GME) program in New Jersey and one of the largest in the nation, representing more than 1,600 residents and fellows. An inaugural RBHS vice chancellor for graduate medical education and enterprise-wide designated institutional official was appointed to advance the training of the 1,600 GME residents and fellows across Rutgers Health and RWJBarnabas Health. Interprofessional Education A vice chancellor for interprofessional programs was appointed and named the Hunterdon Chair in Interprofessional Education at RWJMS. The Interprofessional Education Faculty Advisory Council (IPEFAC) was formed and meets monthly to oversee the development and implementation of RBHS interprofessional education activities. IPEFAC members represent EMSOP, the Graduate School of Applied and Psychology, RSDM, Interprofessional Programs website was developed and implemented. Undergraduate Health-Related Education Nearly 2,400 students enroll in RBHS undergraduate programs each year, ranging from bachelor's degrees in nursing, cardiovascular and diagnostic medical sonography, psychiatric rehabilitation counseling, occupational therapy assistant, health information management, and medical laboratory sciences, to the six-year doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) degree, the entry-level degree for pharmacists. Pipeline/Pathway Programs The NJMS Office for Diversity and Community Engagement and the RSDM Office for Student Affairs, Diversity, and Inclusion have established many federally and privately funded pipeline programs to build and strengthen affiliations. NJMS's SMART and RSDM's Decision for Dentistry are pre-college enrichment programs. The Hispanic Center of Excellence Summer Y outh Scholars Program, the Health Careers Opportunity 88 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Program, the Gateway to Dentistry Program, the Robert W ood Johnson Foundation/the American Association of Medical Colleges/the American Dental Education Association Summer Medical and Dental Education Program, and Mini-Medical School are college-level enrichment programs. RWJMS INSPIRE, sponsored by the NIH's Institutional Research and Career Devel - opment Award (IRACDA), is a postdoctoral program to train the next generation of scientists. This program also provides opportunities for undergraduates from diverse back - grounds to explore research careers in biomedical sciences. SHP's health science careers program, a partnership with 100 New Jersey high schools, provides 4,000 high school students a year with the opportunity to obtain credit towards a Rutgers undergraduate degree while in high school, as well as providing exposure to health professions career options at Rutgers. Leadership Training In collaboration with the Rutgers Center for Organizational Leadership, the Academic Leadership Program at RBHS was developed as a venue for faculty administrators to exam - ine and further develop their leadership, management, and organizational competencies. In 2018-19, the first cohort was enrolled in the one-year series of workshops, discussions, and projects, and the fourth cohort (2021-22) is currently ongoing.

Branding In conjunction with a systemic review of the overall structure of the clinical practices and an in-depth analysis of key functional components of patient care delivery at Rutgers, a new, consistent, overarching brand of Rutgers Health now identifies the health care delivery um - brella. This brand should be easily recognized and understood by the university community, patients, consumers, potential donors, and industry collaborators, such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Additional work is ongoing to further align and clarify the brand, following on the affiliation with RWJBarnabas Health. Clinical Affiliations In 2015, Robert W ood Johnson Health System and Barnabas Health signed the agreement which outlines the merger between these two leading health systems to form RWJBarnabas Health, a network of health care providers in New Jersey that includes academic centers, acute care facilities, and research hospitals, with the goals of increasing collaboration on educational and research programs. In July 2017, RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers signed a letter of intent to affiliate to enhance the relationship between the health care delivery system and academia, invest in re - search and education, expand access to high-quality care and make New Jersey communities healthier. Within 12 months, a transformative agreement was reached to invest more than $1 billion over two decades, establish the state's largest comprehensive medical group, and form an overarching integrated academic health system. In 2018, a new Master Affiliation Agreement was signed between Rutgers and RWJBarnabas Health forming the largest and most comprehensive academic health system in New Jersey. This swift approach to a major collaboration was driven by the strategic importance of the relationship and a desire to make the shared vision a reality. In 2019, the Clinical Management Operating Committee was formed to coordinate clinical activity across the Rutgers Health/RWJBarnabas Health alliance. The Integrated Practice Agreement for RWJBarnabas Health and RWJMS was signed on December 24, 2020, to create (effective July 1, 2020) the RWJBarnabas Health-Rutgers Medical Group, comprising 1,800 physicians in a fully integrated, multidisciplinary, physi- cian-led academic medical group that is a national model for health transformation.91 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B The Integrated Practice Agreement for RWJBarnabas Health and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, effective July 1, 2021, aligned the clinical enterprises. Accountable Care Organization In 2016, the Rutgers Health Network was structured as a clinically integrated network, having a corporate relationship with Rutgers, and meeting the legal and structural require - ments of a Medicare accountable care organization (ACO). In 2016, the Rutgers University Board of Governors authorized the creation of Rutgers Health as an innovative, statewide academic health care brand to revolutionize patient care across New Jersey. Rutgers Health brings together all the clinical activities that are provided through our medi- cal and health professions schools, centers, institutes, and practices under one umbrella. Patient Access Initiatives In 2015, the potential for an RBHS-wide multi-specialty, multi-professional faculty prac-tice plan was reviewed, and clinical operations were assessed across departments of multiple schools and campuses, clinical care units, and licensed providers. In 2015, additional practices were added to the patient call center. In 2016, Rutgers Health Group was established with its own board and annual budget. In 2016, University Dental Associates opened a new faculty practice in New Brunswick. Initiatives were funded by the New Jersey Medicaid Access to Physician Services (MAPS) program to increase access for Medicaid patients through Rutgers Health practices. Community Service Activities Several community service and community engagement activities emerged as components of many RBHS strategic plan signature programs, complementary programs, educational initiatives, and clinical initiatives. In 2017, RBHS participated in Newark 2020, an initiative to support economic growth and development. In 2019, the New Jersey Center on Gun Violence Research was launched publicly by Governor Phil Murphy.92 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B In 2019, a director of community engagement was appointed to enhance alliances with surrounding communities. The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and T ranslational Science (NJ ACTS) received a $5 million NIH grant to launch outreach campaigns and expand access to COVID-19 testing for underserved and vulnerable communities in New Jersey as part of the RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) program in the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initia - tive. The grant funds the New Jersey Healthcare Essential W oRker Outreach and Education Study-T esting Overlooked Occupations, or NJ HEROES TOO, focusing on the Black and Latinx communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in places where Rutgers aca - demic medical centers are deeply rooted. NJ ACTS collaborated with community and health care organizations in Essex, Middlesex, Passaic, and Union counties to co-design this study. The Rutgers Global Health Institute established Equitable Recovery for New Jersey's Small Businesses, a program offering crucial support to small businesses and local nonprofit orga - nizations in low-income and minority communities, which have suffered disproportionately because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program also has improved access to COVID-19 testing and vaccines for vulnerable groups across New Jersey. Integration Among Schools and Across Rutgers RBHS reorganized and integrated several programs to ensure academic strength and efficiency within RBHS and across Rutgers. Nursing Merger On July 1, 2014, the Rutgers College of Nursing (Newark and New Brunswick) and the Rutgers School of Nursing (legacy UMDNJ) merged to form the Rutgers School of Nursing (SN). For more information, see Appendix A. Joint Clinical Chairs The inaugural strategic plan proposed joint recruitment of highly regarded leaders as joint clinical department chairs when concurrent chair vacancies occur in the same department in both medical schools, or by filling a chair in one school by appointing the chair in the other school as chair of both departments. Currently, there are five joint clinical department chairs in neurology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, pathology, immunology and laboratory medicine, and psychiatry.93 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Designing the Multi-Professional Faculty Practice of the Future An agreement was reached in 2016 on a vision and specific set of design principles to guide the development of the integrated interprofessional practice and a three-component or - ganizational model to support the development of an integrated clinical enterprise across Rutgers. An Integrated Practice Agreement was signed that integrates RWJMS's clinical operations in New Brunswick with RWJBarnabas Health medical group practices. Key among the transformative efforts of the affiliation is the formation of a comprehensive medical group comprised of employed physicians and other health care professionals from RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Health. The new integrated practice group is one of the largest in the country, with a unified health mission that complements the high-quality standards of teaching and research excellence. Reorganizing and Strengthening Doctoral Programs in Biomedical Sciences In 2017, the Rutgers-New Brunswick-based Graduate School and the RBHS-based Grad - uate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) were merged into the new School of Graduate Studies (SGS). For more information, see Appendix A. Reorganizing the Basic Sciences Across Rutgers A task force was convened in January 2015 by the RBHS chancellor to examine the reorga - nization of basic sciences across Rutgers. The task force recommended that reorganization of basic sciences be put on hold. Roles of Centers and Institutes The RBHS research centers and institutes work with RBHS and other schools across Rutgers to serve as hubs for interdisciplinary research and collaboration in major theme areas. For more information, see Appendix A. Additional Integrative Activities In considering possible synergies between the two RBHS medical schools, the chancellor charged the Future of Academic Medicine Committee to examine the impact of remaining as two medical schools, continuing the collaborations and integration that are ongoing, or combining into a single medical school with two co-equal campuses. In 2020, the Commit - tee issued a report detailing the advantages and challenges of each model.94 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Other Enabling Structures Additional infrastructure needs were identified to support signature programs, complementary programs, educational initiatives, clinical initiatives, and community service activities. Selected highlights appear below: Advancing Institutional Stature Several key recruitments were completed to provide RBHS support more broadly, including a senior vice chancellor for academic affairs and research, serving as chief academic and sci- entific officer, to lead the education, faculty development, and research missions of RBHS. RBHS took advantage of the alignment of RBHS and Rutgers strategic initiatives to fund some of its priorities, including Henry Rutgers University Professors, Henry Rutgers T erm Chairs, and the Chancellor's Scholars. Chancellor's scholarships were also established to attract the highest quality faculty for interdisciplinary positions focused on research. The Chancellor's Rising Star Scholars Program was initiated to identify students of the medical schools, based on academic achievement; excellence in discovery, innovation and entrepreneurship; and a commitment to join Rutgers Health or RWJBarnabas Health as an employed clinical faculty member at the completion of their Rutgers Healthbased residency or fellowship. Awardees receive $20,000 for each year they remain employed by Rutgers or RWJBarnabas Health, up to ten years, with a potential total benefit of $200,000 to each Rising Star. RBHS-sponsored research funding increased from $218 million in FY14 to $528 million in FY21, representing a 142% increase over time; approximately 37% of FY21 awards are from federal sources. Rutgers medical schools have increased in the national rankings; the School of Nursing ranks in the top tenth percentile nationally among graduate schools of nursing; the School of Health Professions is highly ranked in physical therapy and rehabilitation sciences. RBHS faculty have been elected to several prestigious honorific organizations, including the Association of American Physicians (12); the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (7); the Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (35); the Ameri- can College of Dentists (21); the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine (8); and the National Academy of Sciences (5). Additionally, many RBHS faculty hold elected positions in several honorific associations and societies. 95 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Faculty Development T wo provosts were appointed for the New Brunswick and Newark campuses. A vice chancellor for faculty development was appointed to develop a formalized mentoring program. Additionally, several mentoring training workshops have been initiated, includ - ing the Academic Leadership Program, W omen in Leadership series, and an annual faculty development symposium. Since 2015, the chancellor's office has sponsored up to three out - standing candidates annually for participation in the Higher Education Resource Services (HERS) leadership development program for women in academia at Bryn Mawr College. An inaugural vice chancellor for diversity and inclusion was appointed in 2019 and RBHS adopted a statement on diversity, equity, and inclusion. An agreement was established with the VA New Jersey Health Care System that allows for the recruitment of joint faculty. Facilities University Facilities and Capital Planning worked closely with the RBHS chancellor on master planning efforts so that the university's board-approved physical master plan was updated to include RBHS in 2017. Efforts are underway in Newark to renovate and modernize the Medical Science Building which, together with University Hospital, anchors the academic health center in Newark. Major new investments are planned to create a state-of-the-art health care facility. Planning has also begun to develop new simulation and clinical space for RSDM. In June 2021, RWJBarnabas Health and Rutgers Cancer Institute, in col - laboration with the New Brunswick Development Corporation, broke ground on the Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center. In October 2021, work began on the New Jersey Innovation & T echnolo - gy HUB in New Brunswick that will be the site of a Rutgers translational research facility and RWJMS academic building. 96 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Financial and Development Strategies Several administrative and financial challenges were identified to be addressed as part of the inaugural strategic plan, including working toward more uniform and standardized administrative and financial policies, enhancing research administrative infrastructure, and improving financial performance. Selected highlights appear below: Administrative Challenges and Financial Improvement Strategies In FY2014, RBHS had a budgeted deficit of approximately $54 million, yet the faculty had not had a union contract and raises for six years. Beginning in FY2016 through FY2019, RBHS closed with an operating surplus of anywhere between $20 and $30 million. In FY2015, RBHS appointed a senior vice chancellor and chief financial and administrative officer. Since FY2015, revenue from clinical operations and hospital affiliates increased over 9% on average per year through FY2019. In FY2017, a director for the Office of RBHS Faculty Affairs was recruited. Policies and procedures were implemented to streamline faculty recruitment. During this same period, sponsored research awards increased just under 10% on average per year. A structured budgeting and variance analysis process was implemented and is utilized by all RBHS units. Instilled leadership accountability for financial performance with incentive programs. Rutgers shifted to a 'responsibility center management' model in which revenue-generating units are responsible for managing their own revenues and expenditures and covering their indirect cost allocations. Created mission-based income statements, including faculty effort by mission area. Implemented monthly financial closing and reporting processes. Developed financial models to incentivize the RBHS schools and major institutes and centers to recruit outstanding faculty, support and grow research cores, and retain faculty.97 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Strategic funds were created for one-time investments and key recruitments from operating funds. The RBHS entities turned their operations into positive margin-generating enterprises. Developed and funded a Rising Star Program designed to retain top medical students to complete residency/fellowships at Rutgers Health/RWJBarnabas Health. Successfully committed 26 students and designated another 80. Created an RBHS staff mentoring program to promote a culture of mentorship for staff to build networks across RBHS. Membership has reached 50 staff members across RBHS. In collaboration with the Rutgers Center for Organizational Leadership, developed a year-long development program for faculty administrators to examine and further develop their leadership, management, and organizational competencies with attention to current bio - medical and health sciences challenges and opportunities at the national and state level, and within Rutgers and RBHS. In its first three years, 66 faculty leaders completed the program. The program is currently in its fourth year with a cohort of 18 participants. Negotiated two successor collective negotiations agreements with the American Association of University Professors-Biomedical and Health Sciences of New Jersey (AAUP-BHSNJ) bargaining unit, with each contract providing new incentives for faculty productivity, including a multimillion-dollar clinical incentive plan and various research incentives. Negotiated a new component of compensation, called the fully variable supplement. Devel - oped an out-of-cycle process to reward faculty for exceptional performance. In each of the two consecutive contracts, negotiated increases to base compensation, independent of these other incentives. A Master Affiliation Agreement was executed between RWJMS and Robert W ood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) which included mission support for the research enterprise for the first time. A Master Affiliation Agreement was executed between RBHS and RWJBarnabas Health providing significant investment in the clinical, education, and research enterprise. A series of Clinical Services Agreements were executed between University Hospital, NJMS, and RSDM. Implemented Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to improve financial management and reporting systems across Rutgers. An online expense and travel management system was implemented along with a new procurement system.98 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX B Research administration and reporting systems were developed and implemented. An online, non-aligned performance management system was implemented and has been used successfully across RBHS. Existing debt was restructured for RBHS entities through 2036. New appointment and promotion procedures for faculty were implemented. Development Activities Recruited an RBHS vice president for development, and associate vice presidents for the Cancer Institute, the medical schools, and the RBHS professional schools. Launched fundraising program for Corporate/Foundation Relations to coordinate efforts throughout RBHS and recruited a senior director to lead the program. Created focus on leadership giving, major and principal gifts; restructured staff and changed job descriptions to focus fundraisers on individual giving and collaboration. Launched a Grateful Patient and Family fundraising program. With support from the chancellor's office, led a scholarship match campaign that raised more than $2 million in scholarship support for RWJMS, SN, and RSDM, while engaging more than 200 new donors. RBHS total philanthropic revenue increased 166% from FY14 to two transformational gifts for RBHS initiatives, including $25 million for the Duncan and Nancy MacMillan Cancer Immunology and Metabolism Center of Excellence and $30 million for the Brandt Behavioral Health T reatment Center and Residence. Began planning for a comprehensive fundraising campaign. Conducted a study and established a plan to launch a joint statewide campaign to fight cancer in conjunction with RWJBarnabas Health. Redirected fundraising focus in support of Rutgers' response to COVID-19, which permitted raising funds in support of research and clinical care and helped launch the donor-supported COVID-19 Student Emergency Fund. T otal philanthropic dollars increased by $65.1 million, representing an increase of 144% from FY2015 to FY2019.99 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Rutgers University has been at the forefront of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 11, 2020, when the W orld Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, RBHS has been actively engaged in the COVID-19 response. The RBHS and Rutgers-wide community pulled together and responded to meet the needs of the moment, lever - aging the strengths of all its mission areas. RBHS continues to provide leadership, innovative research, education, and clinical care as the COVID-19 response evolves. Nearly two years after the pandemic began, COVID-19 is still a public health problem and a cause of morbidity and mortality, adding new and challenging academic, clinical, and logistical hurdles we have had to overcome. Despite the chal - lenges posed by this unprecedented global pandemic, RBHS has made significant progress as the leading academic health center in New Jersey, making important national contributions to combat this disease. Rutgers University employs more than 8,000 individuals across its statewide clinical enterprise, includ - ing a wide range of licensed health professionals and support staff. Since the start, RBHS clinicians remain on the front lines caring for patients across our wide spectrum of clinical sites and providing essential mental and physical health care across New Jersey. APPENDIX C 100 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX C While the pandemic affected strategic planning efforts across Rutgers, it also highlighted the strengths and growth of RBHS as New Jersey's premier academic health center, built over the course of the past eight years. These areas include biomedical, clinical, and translational research\u2014accelerating the discovery and evaluation of novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for COVID-19; health professions education and clinical training; patient care; public health interventions, education, and outreach to our host communities; and expanded resources for mental health. The full breadth and depth of the contributions across RBHS are too numerous to catalogue in this appendix, but an abbreviated summary of the highlights is included below. Each of RBHS's schools and units served enormously important roles assisting the state and the world in its efforts to combat the pandemic. During the COVID-19 peak, our educational programs migrated to a primarily remote platform, with limited in-person simulation and clinical training with affiliates while ensuring trainee and student safety. In the spring of 2020, the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy (EMSOP), the School of Nursing (SN), the School of Health Professions (SHP), and the two medical schools graduated students early to support critical national and local health care workforce needs. New Jersey Medical School's (NSMS) New Jersey Poison Control Center, also known as the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), operates the state's COVID-19 hotline, providing medical information about COVID-19. NJPIES answered more than 100,000 calls since the start of the pandemic. SHP, as part of workforce development for New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and T ranslational Science (NJACTS), worked to cultivate and train the clinical research workforce when pharmaceutical companies faced an urgent need to expedite COVID-19 vaccine trials. During the initial surge, while personal protective equipment (PPE) was in short supply nationwide, Robert W ood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) students, working with the Rutgers Schools of Engineering, Arts and Sciences, and Environmental and Biological Sciences, manufactured some PPE items, such as face shields and intubation boxes, using 3D printing technology. University Behavioral Health Care and University Correctional Health Care served more than 36,000 clients, trained 65,000 behavioral health staff statewide, and handled more than 500,000 calls in their national call center, including those on new phone lines dedicated to providing COVID-19 and health care worker support. Rutgers School of Dental Medicine (RSDM) converted its facilities as overflow treatment space for University Hospital during the height of the pandemic and later adapted to social distancing and new PPE protocols to continue teaching and offering treatment as the state's largest 101 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX C provider of oral health care. The School of Public Health (SPH) also collaborated with the state to launch the Community Contact T racing Corps Program, which trained more than 2,000 contact tracers statewide, also helping to design an exhibit about contact tracing at the Liberty Science Center. The Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI) supported efforts to reduce viral load in homes and workplaces, inactivate the virus in public transportation, evaluate COVID infection risk in health care providers, and develop a publicly available app (NJ COVID-19 Project) to track multiple facets of the infection across the state. The Occupational Health Clinic at EOHSI provided significant support to keep the university operational, especially before vaccines were available. The clinic staff provided onsite testing to RBHS staff who believed they were exposed, administering the saliva test to employees in their cars, creating one of the first on-site, drive-by testing spots. The occupational health physicians and residents staffed the EOHSI helpline for any RBHS employee with questions about potential exposures, the isolation policy following such an exposure, the efficacy of the testing methods, the likelihood of transmission, and disinfection procedures. Rutgers' vaccination centers administered thousands of COVID-19 inoculations. RWJMS's Eric B. Chandler Health Center has administered more than 13,000 doses of vaccine to date, working with community organizations to ensure access to underserved populations. Rutgers Global Health Institute helped improve COVID-19 vaccine and testing access in low-income and minority communities by offering numerous pop-up clinics with on-site support in multiple languages, as well as a strong community engagement and boots-on-the-ground outreach. SPH also worked to provide testing and vaccination in underserved areas. Faculty members at EMSOP participated in immunization administration training programs for 90 pharmacists and 30 pharmacy technicians across the state and helped train more 400 student pharmacists to support vaccination efforts statewide. EMSOP also collaborated across RBHS and helped manage the interprofessional training of many members of our vaccination corps. Despite the \"rampdown\" of non-COVID-19-related research because of the need for social distancing measures that protected the research workforce (Omary et al. 2020), RBHS researchers led a wide range of scientific investigations including, but not limited to: SARS-CoV-2 testing, vaccines, treatment, 102 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX C and etiology, and fundamental biomedical, epidemiological, community-based, and social sciences research. As part of these efforts, RBHS launched the Center for COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness (CCRP2) within NJMS's Institute for Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases as the Rutgers-wide institutional hub for COVID-related scientific research and innovation. CCRP2 has served as a catalyst for building a highly prominent COVID-related research presence at Rutgers and fostering collaborations with industry. Scientific expertise and biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities have enabled CCRP2 to lead in the response to the COVID-19 threat in New Jersey, emerge as national leaders, and start work on preventing future pandemics. From February 2020 to January 2022, RBHS has surpassed $74.8 million in extramurally sponsored research activity related to COVID-19. T o date, RBHS has secured: 28 clinical trials (eight federally supported and 20 indus- try-sponsored), representing $23 million; 427 proposal submissions, representing total potential project costs of $1.2 billion; 164 awards, representing $74.8 million, with a projected multi-year total of over $200 million, that includes support for organized research and other equipment, service, and training grants; One NIH G20 grant to support modernization of the Regional Biocontainment Laboratories, $3.3 million; 403 IRB protocols generated for COVID-19 related research. Some of the research highlights involving national leadership in the fight against COVID-19 include: A Rutgers research team completed the first evaluation of a new rapid COVID-19 test given emergency approval by the FDA. The test, developed by CEPHEID, a U .S. molecular diag - nostics company, is fast and easy to perform without the need for a centralized laboratory. In April 2020, the FDA granted an EUA for the first approved saliva test to detect SARS-CoV-2, created by RBHS-affiliated faculty and RUCDR Infinite Biologics. Since then, a revised EUA for an at-home saliva sample collection was also approved and Rutgers/ RUCDR launched a $44 million spinoff company, Infinity BiologiX LLC. RBHS proudly served as a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial site for phase 3 testing of the Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer vaccines. The RWJMS site for Johnson & Johnson's vaccination trial was the second largest recruiter in the world, which helped facilitate FDA approval of the vaccine for public use. 103 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX C RBHS launched the nation's first prospective study of health care workers exposed to COVID-19, including more than 800 employees from Rutgers, Robert W ood Johnson University Hospital and University Hospital, to explore new drug treatments, antibody testing, and long-term health tracking in the hope of providing insight into the disease and prevent its spread. RBHS was also awarded $1.6 million in NIH funding to create a national collaborative network to identify risk and protective factors that may allow clinicians or public health professionals to predict which children are at the greatest risk for serious illness from COVID-19. RWJMS serves as a national hub for pediatric sites as part of the NIH's $470 million RECOVER research initiative to study long-term and delayed impacts of COVID-19 in children. The Collaborative Long-term Study of Outcomes of COVID-19 in Kids (CLOCK) consortium at Rutgers is recruiting children, adolescents, and young adults from across the U .S. into the NIH's RECOVER cohort study. RSDM spearheaded COVID-19 research in the NIH/NIDCR-supported National Dental Practice Based Research Network, examining the role of testing and the safety climate in community-based practice. In RBHS's role as key advisors and health practitioners, RBHS continued to work with the university's central administration to keep the Rutgers community healthy amidst surging cases across the state. RBHS has been an integral part of the Rutgers-wide recovery and repopulation efforts, providing guidance on testing protocols, safety and disinfection, epidemiological forecasting, travel policies, risk mitigation, and more. This was accomplished thanks in no small part to the tireless efforts of dedicated individuals who planned, managed, and supported tactical implementation of strategic testing, vaccination administration, and record verification and management. RBHS worked diligently to obtain, create, and deploy PPE. Many of our students played critical and selfless roles in these efforts, making test kits, staffing hotlines, scheduling appointments, and much more. Rutgers emerged as a national academic leader as the first university in the U .S. to announce a decision to require COV ID-19 vaccination of all students for fall 2021 (Calcado et al. 2022). RBHS also undertook multiple intentional strategies to help build a sense of community during the disruptions caused by the pandemic (Lamba et al. 2021). 104 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX C RBHS experts continue to regularly disseminate timely and accurate information to individuals, the media, community-based organizations, and local, state, and federal leaders. In a time of widespread confusion and deliberate misinformation, RBHS was a consistent presence in the media, with countless news stories acknowledging our expertise and work, with a potential reach of billions worldwide. RBHS faculty and leaders participated in online community forums, and initiated podcasts and live briefings, to share accurate information about the disease; the public health imperatives of lockdowns, mask-wearing, and \"flattening the curve;\" use of testing capacity; and vaccine safety. These stories were shared millions of times across social media platforms. With the breadth of expertise in infectious disease, public health, nursing, dental care, pharmacy services, health professions education, and a multitude of other related disciplines, RBHS became a resource for national, state, and local leaders during the pandemic. As envisioned by the 2014 strategic plan, RBHS has built a platform for conducting rigorous research within the laboratory, translating discoveries to direct clinical interventions, and informing public policy decisions with timely, scientifically rigorous, and consistent advice. Throughout these past two years, RBHS has demonstrated how much we have to offer our patients, students, host communities, home state, and beyond. The COV ID-19 pandemic brought these qualities into sharper focus: it revealed our breadth across many disciplines; rigor and depth in our research; the resilience, bravery, and compassion of our colleagues; and commitment to serve our community. 105 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX D Comparison of Selected Health Sciences Universities A total of 40 universities (T able A) were identified for comparison, including 31 from the Association of American Universities (AAU), 30 from the Association of Academic Health Centers (AAHC), and eight from the Big T en Academic Alliance (Figure A). Table A. Health Sciences Universities Included in the Comparison \u0015 W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027There were 32 public universities and eight private universities included either for their geographic proximity to Rutgers (e.g., Northeast region) and/or for their interest to RBHS as peer aspirants. All 40 universities included a medical school and at least one other health sciences school (e.g., dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, public health, and health professions). Among the 40 universities included in the comparisons, Rutgers is one of seven that include all six types of health sciences schools; the number of different types of health sciences schools ranged from two to six. (Figure B).APPENDIX D Figure A.

RBHS has a comprehensive health sciences port - folio and is unique in having two separate allopathic medical schools; this is among the most complete offering in the tristate area and rivals only a handful of universities nationally. Of the seven universities with comprehensive health sciences (Figure B), three (Ohio State University, University of Florida, University of Pittsburgh) have a clinical affiliate with a sig - nificant number of nationally ranked specialties, per U.S. News & W orld Report 2020-2021. Of note, cancer, diabetes and endocrinology, nephrology, pulmonology and lung surgery, and urology are specialties that are ranked in all three. Thirty-six percent of the universities reviewed have a high degree of integration within the clinical enterprise, i.e., between/among hospital(s) and faculty group practice(s). This considers five alignment classification models and Rutgers' pursuit of greater integration follows a trend of many academic health systems (AHS) redesigning their corporate, governance, leadership, and financial structures to deliver seamless and high-quality patient care and to become nimbler and more competitive in the health care market. Of the universities reviewed, Rutgers University ranks 24th in terms of research expenditures across all colleges and 23rd in terms of FY 2020 NIH awards to the university. Rutgers' aver - age NIH funding per principal investigator (PI), ($694,565 for 306 PIs), is in line with the average for all the reviewed universities ($692,090; 413 PIs) and exceeds that of Northeast region universities ($684,632; 466 PIs) and all public universities ($655,390; 369 PIs). Interdisciplinary centers and methods are well represented on separate Interprofessional Practice and Education Center (IPEC) websites for the health sciences universities profiled (e.g., Rutgers; Ohio State; University of Illinois-Chicago) and IPEC membership is clearly stated where applicable. Of the 40 universities, 26 have a single \"health sciences\" landing page, which eases naviga - tion and improves user experience. Of those 26 universities compared in most depth, all have a consistent visual identity among their health sciences colleges as measured by uni-formity of website design across health sciences; use of health sciences logos and university branding; stated mission, vision, or values; and an emphasis on services and offerings. The university and school brands are displayed in a uniform way due to the use of brand guides. A close review of each health sciences school's websites revealed distinguishing factors that can provide design lessons for RBHS.108 ONERBHS ONE RBHS: THE W AY FORWARD | STRATEGIC PLAN 2022-2027APPENDIX D When comparing the seven universities that include the six health sciences schools (T able B), or the six health sciences schools within those universities, NIH funding has steadily increased over time (FY18 to FY21) for Rutgers University and for RBHS.
