Unfortunately, many people don't realize the best way to restore balance in their bodies. An osteopath can offer a natural and gentle solution to help detox and cleanse the body to alleviate symptoms and to help you feel your best. What is a holistic detox? Most people think of detox and they think of a digestive cleanse. The only difference is that instead of just trying to cleanse and clean the GI tract, we are going to cleanse and detox the body as a whole, helping the body to expel toxins caused by: - Alcohol and recreational drug use - Prescription medications - Pollutants - Heavy metals - Pesticides It's believed that heavy metals and other pollutants in the body have the ability to cause: - Acne, rashes, and other skin problems - Extreme fatigue - Loss of energy - Muscle and joint aches - Anxiety - Depression - Headaches - Mood swings - Digestive problems - Unexplained weight gain While these cleanses won't actually improve the function of the liver (the liver is already designed to naturally eliminate toxins from the body), what a holistic detox will do is help to cleanse different pathways in the body to more swiftly and efficiently remove these toxins to improve how the body functions as a whole. What is involved in a holistic detox? Every doctor is different when it comes to how they perform a holistic detox. When you visit your osteopath, they will discuss with you the diet you'll follow, how long you'll need to follow that diet and whether you'll need supplements or other therapies such as sauna to improve the detoxification process. During your detox, it's important that you are drinking a lot of water to help the body flush out toxins and other harmful elements in the body. What are the benefits of holistic detox? Everyone experiences different relief and health benefits as a result of a holistic detox. Once the toxins have been eliminated you may find that your digestive tract works more smoothly and you're able to pass stools more easily. You may also see healthier and more radiant skin, improved energy, a boost to your immune system, a reduction in stress, and curbed cravings. Whether you're looking to nix sugar cravings, improve your metabolism, or just feel more energized, a holistic detox may be able to help.
