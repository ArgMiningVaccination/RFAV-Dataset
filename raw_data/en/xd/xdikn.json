Traditional children's vitamins can cause more problems than they solve. Most medicine and multivitamin brands use unnecessary artificial inactive ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, talc, artificial dyes, flavors, and preservatives. As a precaution, millions of parents give their kids vitamins. But look closely and you'll see these \"vitamins\" are filled with sugar, preservatives, chemicals, and other synthetic gummy junk kids should never eat. In a typical kid's multivitamins, they are 5 grams of added sugar. That's as much sugar as an Oreo cookie -- typically given by parents to kids every day as a way to be \"healthy.\" According to the numbers, 98% of kids eat too much sugar, which can lead to lifelong problems with childhood development, mental health, obesity, and more.* Sugar is the new cigarettes -- we are only now beginning to understand the negative effects of daily sugar intake, which is why our vitamins will never contain added sugar. They also contain common allergens like gluten and lactose. I listed on this the best organic Kids' Supplement Brands on the market with promo codes! Please shop with my links to support my research!
