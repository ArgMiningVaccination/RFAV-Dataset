[What is the Best way to Lower Blood Pressure?](#What-is-the-Best-way-to-Lower-Blood-Pressure?) [Forward can Help You Accomplish Your Heart Health Goals](#Forward-can-Help-You-Accomplish-Your-Heart-Health-Goals) Some people who receive a diagnosis of hypertension wish to take a natural approach to treatment, leading to an interest in herbal [supplements](https://goforward.com/blog/weight-loss/weight-loss-remedies-pills-supplements) for [high blood pressure](https://goforward.com/blog/general/what-causes-high-blood-pressure-and-are-you-at-risk). Many products claim to support [heart](https://goforward.com/blog/general/lower-your-blood-pressure-extend-your-life-the-results-of-our-heart-health-program) health in various ways, so it can be difficult to determine if supplements are beneficial for high [blood pressure](https://goforward.com/blog/general/blood-pressure-medications). In reality, there isn't enough evidence to support the use of most supplements for high blood pressure. Some may even increase blood pressure. Knowing what the science says about natural remedies for high blood pressure allows you to make an informed decision. Herbs & Supplements for High Blood Pressure Despite how many people search for answers to questions like \"what herbs are good for high blood pressure?\" very few herbal remedies for high blood pressure are actually shown to make a significant impact. That's why it's important to investigate claims about natural home remedies for blood pressure made on social media and elsewhere. Is sea Moss Good for High Blood Pressure? Sea moss is a variety of red algae. You'll sometimes see it called Irish moss or Chondrus crispus. The algae are [rich in many nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8232781/), including ones that play a role in heart health, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12 and vitamin K. However, there aren't any large clinical studies about the effects of sea moss and sea moss supplements on blood pressure. Rauwolfia Serpentina for High Blood Pressure Rauwolfia serpentina or Indian snakeroot is an herb that has been used in India to treat hypertension for centuries. This class of drugs is called rauwolfia alkaloids and includes the medication reserpine (Serpalan). At one time, compounds found in the herb were used in a prescription medication for hypertension known as reserpine, but it's [very rarely used in the U.S.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548348/) because of its high risk for side effects compared to other, safer blood pressure medications. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of taking Rauwolfia serpentina as a supplement to know if it is beneficial for people with hypertension. Because of potential side effects, it's not a good choice of herbal supplement for high blood pressure. Ashwagandha and High Blood Pressure Ashwagandha is a shrub native to Asia and Africa. In the natural healing tradition of Ayurveda, ashwagandha is a remedy for many conditions. Research indicates that ashwagandha [may be effective](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/953.html) at reducing the physical effects of stress on some people. Some speculate that the herb may lower elevated blood pressure-related stress, but there isn't enough scientific evidence to prove this theory. Cinnamon for High Blood Pressure In addition to using it to add flavor to foods, some people take cinnamon as a dietary supplement. Many people search for information on how to take cinnamon for high blood pressure and other conditions, but science has yet to verify that it actually has benefits. [One systematic review of clinical studies](https://clinicalnutritionespen.com/article/S2405-4577(20)30003-6/fulltext) found that cinnamon may lower blood pressure by a small amount but cautioned that more high-quality research was necessary to verify this finding. Garlic for High Blood Pressure Garlic is an edible bulb commonly used as an ingredient in many types of cuisine. People often tout garlic as a beneficial supplement for heart health, but studies investigating these claims produced mixed results. There is some evidence to suggest that garlic may lower blood pressure. However, more research is necessary. The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic) (NCCIH) states that garlic supplements that provide doses similar to the amounts used in food are likely safe for most people. If you wish to try the herb, you should talk to your primary care provider about which is the best garlic supplement for high blood pressure. What are the Best Supplements for High Blood Pressure? Herbs aren't the only key ingredients used in dietary supplements. People take a variety of other nutrients and substances in supplement form, and some supplements claim to benefit high blood pressure. In most cases, evidence proving the effectiveness of supplements for managing blood pressure is limited. Fish oil for High Blood Pressure Fish oil supplements contain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), two omega-3 fatty acids. Most people consume only small amounts of these omega-3 fatty acids, and doctors may recommend supplements for those who don't get enough from diet alone. Studies that took place during the 1980s and 90s suggested that omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be beneficial for heart health. However, [more recent studies show](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional) that diets rich in seafood and fish may decrease heart disease risk, but supplements don't seem to. There is a [limited amount of evidence](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-fish-oil/art-20364810) to suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplements may slightly lower blood pressure. The effects of supplements may be more pronounced in people with moderate to high blood pressure levels. CBD oil for High Blood Pressure Cannabidiol (CBD) oil comes from the cannabis plant. It doesn't cause intoxication, and many people take it to address symptoms of inflammatory conditions. At this time, there is not enough evidence to validate the use of CBD oil for high blood pressure. [A study conducted in the UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470879/) showed that blood pressure levels in men fell shortly after taking one dose of CBD oil and that blood pressure levels in these study participants didn't rise as much as expected in response to exercise-related stress. However, the study only involved nine participants and didn't investigate the long-term use of CBD oil for managing hypertension. Melatonin and High Blood Pressure Melatonin is a hormone made in the brain. It helps control the circadian rhythms that power your sleep-wake cycle. People commonly take melatonin for insomnia, and some also use it for anxiety and conditions that can be worsened by anxiety like high blood pressure. There are no good studies to prove that melatonin benefits individuals with high blood pressure. The [Mayo Clinic cautions](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-melatonin/art-20363071) that melatonin sometimes increases blood pressure in people taking blood pressure medications. R-alpha Lipoic Acid and High Blood Pressure Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant manufactured by the body and found in foods like lean cuts of red meat, carrots, beets, spinach, potatoes and broccoli. Because antioxidants protect the body from free radicals, some people speculate that alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial for supporting heart health and lowering blood pressure. A [systematic review of double-blind studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450615/) found no evidence that alpha-lipoic acid supplements lower blood pressure a significant amount. Vitamins and Minerals for High Blood Pressure Some vitamins and minerals absorbed from foods you eat support heart health and may aid in blood pressure regulation, including vitamin B12, vitamin K, magnesium and calcium. If you're deficient in one of these nutrients, a dietary supplement may be necessary. However, taking a supplement that contains one is unlikely to improve your blood pressure. Potassium and High Blood Pressure [Low potassium levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/) have been linked to hypertension, and can commonly occur when taking blood pressure medications. If you take a thiazide diuretic for blood pressure, you may be at an increased risk for potassium deficiency. These drugs can cause your body to release too much potassium in urine. Your doctor can help you determine which is the best potassium supplement for high blood pressure if you require one. Are fat Burner Pills Safe for High Blood Pressure? Generally, fat burner pills are not safe for people who take high blood pressure medication. Some herbs commonly used as key ingredients in these products like [ephedra (ma-huang)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20045245) can increase blood pressure. Fat burners may also contain caffeine or herbs that contain caffeine like green coffee beans. Caffeine is a stimulant and can temporarily increase blood pressure. Losing weight can help you lower your blood pressure. The most effective way to lose weight is to follow a healthy diet and exercise. What is the Best way to Lower Blood Pressure? The best way to lower blood pressure is to combine lifestyle changes with treatments recommended by your primary care provider, such as prescription blood pressure medications. Maintaining sodium intake of less than 1300mg and regular exercise are proven lifestyle methods to lower blood pressure. Some people may require vitamin and mineral supplements, but the decision to take one should be based on the results of blood work and an examination of overall health and diet. Taking any dietary supplement is unlikely to be enough to lower blood pressure without a complete treatment plan. Plus, all dietary supplements, including those derived from natural herbs, can pose a risk for side effects. They also may interact with some medications. As a result, you shouldn't try to treat blood pressure on your own with supplements. Instead, talk to your primary care provider about supplements you're considering. They can advise you on the safety and potential effectiveness of supplements and recommend the best dosage for any that may benefit you.
