You are a person-not just symptoms, a disorder, or labs. The doctors at NatureMedica recognize this. A personalized focus means that your individualized treatment considers every aspect of your health. In addition to treating your primary concern, our doctors will aim to improve your overall health including sleep, energy, digestion, and more Will insurance cover my visit? Insurance often can shape the treatment that you receive and the time you may spend with the doctor. Instead, here at NatureMedica we focus on providing the best care, without insurance influence. Our doctors do not contract with or bill insurance companies. However, we are happy to provide you with a service summary with the proper diagnostic coding so that you can seek reimbursement after your visit, and we encourage you to submit. If reimbursement is vital to you, we recommend that you call your insurance providers prior to the visit. We do send labs through companies that contract with insurance whenever possible. Nature Medica continuously does research into lab companies to get the best rates and options for our patients. We accept cash, checks, all major credit cards along with HSA and FSA credit cards. Is naturopathic medicine cost-effective? Absolutely! While the initial investment may seem like a lot, our doctors strive to resolve your illness and provide vibrant health, which is priceless. The long-term goal is to reduce your medical spending on chronic disease. This allows you to enjoy life and be more productive, without wasting time in a waiting room. If I am currently taking prescription medications, can I still take natural medicines? It depends on your specific condition, medication and natural medicine. Our doctors are trained extensively in pharmaceutical drugs and their interactions with herbs and nutrients. This includes potential adverse events that could occur with improperly combined drugs, herbs, and nutrients. It is extremely important that you bring a list of all of your medications and supplements to your appointment for the safest and most effective treatment. How are a naturopathic and conventional doctor similar? Naturopathic doctors, like allopathic or osteopathic physicians, hold a four-year undergraduate degree as well as an additional four-year doctorate degree. In addition to a standard medical curriculum (anatomy, physiology, pathology, microbiology, immunology, clinical and physical diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, cardiology, gastroenterology, gynecology, pharmacology, etc.), naturopathic doctors are required to complete extensive training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, botanical medicine, hydrotherapy, naturopathic manipulative therapy, psychology, and counseling. They must complete at least two years of hands-on clinical training and pass two sets of national boards (board certified). Naturopathic doctors are trained to diagnose, treat or refer to specialists when necessary, much like your conventional primary care provider. Why do I need to see a naturopathic doctor if my symptoms are being managed with prescription medication? Symptoms are an expression of a body's ill health. When you are hot, you don't take a medication so that you no longer feel the heat, but that is how many drugs work. Our doctors will investigate why you developed your illness and work to reverse the underlying cause. Our doctors will not simply mask the symptoms with a pill. If a medication is absolutely necessary in your health management, your prescribing physician should continue to manage the medication. Can you order labs? Yes, Naturopathic doctors are trained to draw blood, order lab work and interpret results in order to formulate an appropriate treatment. Naturopathic doctors can order many imaging studies such as X-rays, CT or MRI if they feel it is necessary to manage your condition. Medicare will not cover labs or imaging ordered by a naturopathic physician. If you have had any recent lab work done, please bring all results to your visit. How long will my visit take? The first visit will generally take about 60 minutes. After covering your intake forms and taking a complete medical history, your doctor will perform a targeted physical exam. The goal is to get to know you as a patient in order to uncover the source of your specific health concerns. After your initial intake visit, your doctor will develop a protocol specifically designed for your needs. This may include a personalized diet plan, recommended dietary supplements, acupuncture, specific lifestyle changes, lab tests, changes in medication (coordinated with your primary care physician, if necessary), and stress eradication counseling. Follow-up visits range from 30-60 minutes. Acupuncture visits generally take 30-45 minutes. If you have an urgent concern, such as a UTI, or a quick lab review, brief visits lasting 5-15 minutes can often be accommodated same day. Please call the office to schedule. What is your cancellation and reservation policy? Should you need to reschedule or cancel your appointment, we ask for 24 business hours' notice. All cancellations for appointments require 24 business hours' notice for office visits, including acupuncture. Appointments cancelled with less than 24 business hours notice or missed appointments will be charged a minimum $60 fee. Upon booking your first appointment, a deposit will be collected in order to hold your space. This deposit will go towards your visit fee. If you need to reschedule or cancel your appointment, your deposit can be returned to you if the changes were made greater than 24 business hours of your appointment. Thank you for your understanding in this matter - we will try to accommodate individual requests or emergency situations as they occur. What if I have a medical concern or a question for the doctor? In the case of any medical emergency, you should always dial 911 or visit an emergency room or urgent care facility. For non-urgent matters, you can call us during our business hours or send us a message through your Patient Portal and we will get back to you during our next two business days. Please note that as of May 1, 2021, fees will be assessed when medical advice, a prescription, or other similar request requiring a decision by a licensed physician is submitted outside of a scheduled visit. These fees will vary as to the requirements of each specific issue, but will apply whether the request for a decision is made by phone, text or any other electronic means, and whether it's addressed to your doctor directly or a member of NatureMedica staff.
