Will the U.S. step up? As Western countries pursue \"America First\" and \"Europe First\" Covid vaccination plans, other leading nations are looking outward in search of commercial and political gain. India has a 49-country vaccine \"friendship program,\" while China is shipping 1 million doses a week across Africa and has vaccinated 7 million Turks. Argentina was just one of 50 countries that turned to Russia for help when it was [unable to secure contracts with Western producers](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/01/15/957301807/argentina-takes-a-shot-with-russias-sputnik-vaccine#:~:text=Argentina%20is%20now%20vaccinating%20tens,health%2Dcare%20workers%20with%20Sputnik.&text=Serra%20for%20NPR-,Paola%20Osman%2C%20a%20second%20year%20resident%20at%20the%20Hospital%20San,Sputnik%20V%20vaccine%20from%20Russia.). But the lead enjoyed by India, China and Russia in so-called vaccine diplomacy is set to evaporate in the coming weeks. Several Western vaccines preordered by dozens of governments are now close to authorization, including from [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/24/fda-johnson-johnson-single-dose-shot-covid-471327), [Novavax](https://www.wsj.com/articles/novavax-nears-covid-19-vaccine-game-changerafter-years-of-failure-11614096579?mod=hp_lead_pos11) and [GSK-Curevac](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-curevac-to-develop-next-generation-mrna-covid-19-vaccines/) \u2014 tilting future global distribution of vaccines toward Western options. The COVAX vaccine facility \u2014 which pools financial resources and spreads its bets across vaccine candidates \u2014 has handed over the first of [337 million doses it has allocated to around 130 countries](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/covax-interim-distribution-forecast.pdf?sfvrsn=7889475d_5) for the first half of the year. [COVAX receives around 90 percent of its funds](https://www.statista.com/chart/24244/donations-to-covax-by-country/?utm_source=Statista+Global&utm_campaign=4c003d0666-All_InfographTicker_daily_COM_AM_KW05_2021_Fr_COPY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_afecd219f5-4c003d0666-313093530) from G-7 countries and the European Union, but none from China, India or Russia. Though the Biden administration has shot to the top of the COVAX donor list with a $2 billion commitment, the project is still $800 million short of what it needs to reach its goal of vaccinating 2 billion people in 2021. That financial reality, coupled with China, Russia and India winning the lion's share of early vaccinate donation headlines, means it could take months for U.S. stock to rise in the developing world. In the meantime, the race to outpace new variants of the virus continues. Over the coming weeks, COVAX must deliver vaccines to all participating economies to ensure that those most at risk are protected, wherever they live,\" said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, an alliance that works to vaccinate the world's children, and a key backer of COVAX. European countries and the U.S. are stuck managing both a health crisis and a political one: namely, the legitimate demand by their citizens that they be vaccinated first. Free from democratic pressures, Beijing is able to extend greater charity and ramp up its vaccine diplomacy. Russia, on the other hand, has freedom to do global deals for a different reason: [The Kremlin is struggling to persuade Russians to use its homegrown vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine.html). But today's leading donors \u2014 while reaping the early public relations win \u2014 are unlikely to be able to match COVAX's growth through 2021. China and Russia face domestic challenges For China, the barriers are the effectiveness of its vaccines ( [just 50 percent in some trials](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/18/957981946/data-challenges-efficacy-of-vaccine-made-by-chinese-company)), and Beijing's need to eventually vaccinate its own population of 1.4 billion \u2014 97 percent of whom haven't received a jab. While Russia's Sputnik vaccine has 95 percent effectiveness, [it is already running into production problems](https://www.ft.com/content/316b77c1-e640-4d53-8dec-547b1b5651d8) among 15 sites around the world. [The Indian government \u2014 echoing the EU \u2014 is worried it miscalculated with early generosity, and has blocked its main manufacturer](https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1363346341275967488?s=20), the Serum Institute from sticking to a plan to send 50 percent of its production overseas, according to Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla. Colombia's vaccine deals and timeline illustrate how the balance of global vaccine distribution is likely to change. Israel will be the first country with that choice: 90 percent of Israelis have received inoculations and the government is slowly shifting into donor mode. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, via a spokesperson, stressed his country's donations will remain at a \"symbolic quantity\" until every Israeli who wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated. Israel's donations so far include just 5,000 doses to the Palestinian National Authority, on Israel's doorstep. But Israel has more to offer: After serving as the Israeli government's vaccine distribution partner, [Teva Pharmaceutical is now in talks with vaccine-makers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/teva-is-in-discussions-to-help-make-covid-19-vaccines-ceo-says) about licensing their vaccines to increase overall global production. In the U.S., President Joe Biden confirmed on Feb. 18 that [the U.S. has enough doses to vaccinate every American resident by July](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/biden-200-million-vaccine-doses-468756). With the U.K following a similar timeline, a glut of excess doses will likely be available for poorer countries toward the end of summer. In the end, the real race may not be between vaccine donors for soft power but between all vaccines and variants of the virus. The dominant variant in South Africa wrecked the government's plan to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month, rendering the vaccine effective in only 10 percent of cases. The threat of new and more transmissible variants is a reminder that the political and financial costs of vaccine diplomacy are dwarfed by the costs of further lockdowns and additional economic rescue packages. A [recent paper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28395/w28395.pdf) estimated that if vaccination doesn't reach the developing world quickly in 2021 and 2022, further disruptions could cost the global economy $9 trillion dollars, dwarfing the extra $800 million COVAX is requesting from national governments. Mirroring statements from EU diplomats, State Department spokesperson [Ned Price tweeted Wednesday](https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1364691967880364039?s=20) that the Biden administration is proud to be the biggest COVAX donor, urging \"other partners to do their part.\" The political question looms: Is it better for the U.S. to pay more than its fair share now to avoid writing billion-dollar checks later? Or will domestic concerns require splitting the bill equally, even if that means higher costs in the "}
