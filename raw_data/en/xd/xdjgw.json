The ceremonies focus on sacred prayers of the sacred Amazonian plants which are called \"Mimawas\" in the Huni Kuin tradition, more commonly known as \"Icaros\". Each Icaro played by the Shaman emits a specific vibrational purpose, introducing you to different dimensions of our universe whilst serving to cleanse your energies, guiding you to the intimate focus of your healing process and creating your safe space for the sacred plant to do her work. Our groups are small and intimate allowing every individual to receive the attention needed. The environment is safe and non-judgmental, compassionately supporting you to work through your individual healing. The Huni Kawa Shamans typically offer ceremonies in sets of 3. In the ceremonies we will be working with the Sacred Healing Plants of the Amazon forest to open your heart so you can receive light and through that you can expand your consciousness. We will be journeying through the process of gently unlayering all the years of accumulated past energies, events and struggles that no longer serve us while reconnecting with our inner light. Each day, you will dive deeper into your intentions manifesting strength and clarity of your expansion. \"We intend that you have the most fascinating experience ever, opening portals to your spirit, where your truth resides.\" OUR RETREATS ARE SAFE - Our Shamans are masters who humbly transmit the knowledge and healing energies and who strive to uphold the highest integrity in everything they do to be a beacon for responsible, safe, and ethical practices. From the moment you contact us our Shamans as well as our team will be available for any questions and concerns you may have. Before, during and after the retreat you will be guided and held spritually, mentally and physially. INTIMATE - with 4 Shamans plus the Naturalma care & service team taking care of a maximum of 10 participants, we offer a very intimate experience that allows for deep connection, care and one on one attention for each individual by the Shamans. DEEP - our retreats are 6 days and 5 nights, to allow enough time to go into a deep process as well as for integration before, during and after the ceremonies. If you wish to extend and deepen your experience even more you will have the opportunity to stay for the Viv\u00eancia. AUTHENTIC - our Shamans are from the Huni Kuin tribe in the Brazilian Amazon where some of them have been trained to become Shamans from the moment they were born. They bring the ancestral knowledge of holding sacred ceremony with integrity, humility, and compassion. We currently offer a set of 3 Plant healing ceremonies within 2 formats: May 2-7 This format will allow you a deep guided integration of your experience with the sacred medicine and insight into the ancient traditions and practices of the Huni Kuin. April 21-24 | May 7-10 | May 12-15 This format will allow you to sit a full set of 3 ceremonies and do your guided pre- and post-integration from the comfort of your home via a zoom call with the Shamans. 6-DAY PLANT HEALING RETREAT CEREMONY ALIGNMENT Day 1: Arrival before 3 pm, pre-integration & opening ceremony Day 2: Integration & Plant Healing Ceremony 1: Learn the sacred medicine Day 3: Integration & Plant Healing Ceremony 2: Be guided to your truth & shifts Day 4: Integration & Plant Healing Ceremony 3: Journey to your bigger picture Day 5: Post-ceremony integration & closing ceremony Day 6: Breakfast & departure On the 3rd day of ceremony if you do decide that you want to continue and study in the school of Huni Kawa you will receive your shamanic name.
