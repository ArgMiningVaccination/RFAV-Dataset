Contents of the pack and other information 1. What is Vaxelis and what it is used for Vaxelis is a vaccine, which helps to protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b . Vaxelis is given to children from the age of six weeks. The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the bacteria and viruses that cause the following diseases : Diphtheria : a bacterial infection that usually first affects the throat , causing pain and swelling which can lead to suffocation. The bacteria also make a toxin (poison) that can damage the heart, kidneys and nerves. Tetanus (often called lock jaw) : caused by the tetanus bacteria entering a deep wound. The bacteria make a toxin (poison) that causes spasms of the muscles, leading to inability to breathe and the possibility of suffocation. Pertussis (often called whooping cough) : a highly infectious illness that affects the airways. It causes severe coughing that may lead to problems wit h breathing. The coughing often has a \"whooping\" sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also cause ear infections, chest infections (bronchitis) which may last a long time, lung infections (pneumonia), fits, brain dam age and even death. Hepatitis B : caused by the hepatitis B virus. It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed). In some people, the virus can stay in the body for a long time, and can eventually lead to serious liver problems, including liver cancer. Poliomyelitis (often just called polio) : caused by viruses that affect the nerves. It can lead to paralysis or muscle weakness most commonly of the legs. Paralysis of the muscles that control breathing and swallowing can be fatal. Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (often just called Hib infections) : serious bacterial infections causing meningitis (inflammation of the outer covering of the brain), which can lead to brain damage, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness. Infection can also cause inflamm ation and swelling of the throat, leading to difficulties in swallowing and breathing, and infection can affect other parts of the body such as the blood, lungs, skin, bones, and joints. 2 Important information about the protection provided Vaxelis will only help to prevent these diseases caused by the bacteria and viruses targeted by the vaccine. Vaxelis does not protect your child against diseases caused by other bacteria and viruses that may cause similar symptoms . The vaccine does not contain any live bacteria or viruses and it cannot cause any of the infectious diseases against which it protects. As with any vaccine, Vaxelis may not protect 100% of children who receive the vaccine . 2.
