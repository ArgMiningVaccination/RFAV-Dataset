Have they studied the Pfizer vaccine adequately? 43,931 persons participated in the Pfizer vaccine trials, making it the 4th largest vaccine efficacy study ever. Is the vaccine safe? This vaccine has no preservatives, the concerns some have about vaccine additives are not relevant to this vaccine. This vaccine is manufactured directly, not grown in eggs (like the Influenza and many other vaccines), which is one reason the production process is faster. It also means (because no other biological material) that there are no allergen contaminants. Vaccines in general are the safest medical interventions employed by modern medicine. With respect to this particular vaccine, the rate of severe adverse events in the trials and among the several million Americans that have at this point received the vaccine has been extremely low, even compared to other vaccines. The only significant contraindication to this vaccine is a history of allergic reaction to other vaccines. What about this mRNA technology? The medical research community has ten years of experience with mRNA vaccines, including prior clinical trials of candidate vaccines for CMV, Influenza, and other diseases. Post-trial monitoring of participants in those trials has not revealed any long term or late appearing side effects. Can the vaccine give me COVID-19? There is no COVID-19 virus used in the manufacturing process. The Pfizer vaccine teaches your body to recognize a subcomponent of the Coronavirus and attack it. This vaccine is not weakened or degraded virus and cannot even theoretically infect a recipient with COVID-19. COVID Testing Protocol MACH will still offer evaluation and COVID testing to those beneficiaries with high risk medical conditions who are exhibiting severe signs and symptoms consistent with COVID, or those requiring a test for official DoD travel. Beneficiaries meeting the above testing criteria must make an appointment through their assigned primary care clinic by calling (762) 408-2273. Active duty service members enrolled to a TMC should seek COVID testing at their respective TMC. In order to protect the ability of the Emergency Department to safely and effectively treat emergencies, the ED will not conduct routine outpatient COVID testing. Please do not use the Emergency Department for COVID testing. The ED should be reserved for individuals who require medical attention and treatment. Beneficiaries who have questions about COVID-19 symptoms and would like to speak to someone may call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 1-800-TRICARE (1-800-874-2273) and select option 1 to talk to a registered nurse 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Nursing staff who support the NAL phone lines can assist beneficiaries with non-life threatening medical concerns and provide further guidance. Beneficiaries experiencing a medical emergency, such a severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing should visit the nearest emergency center or call 911. If you are symptomatic but do not meet the above testing criteria, per CDC guidelines, we advise isolating at home for five days. After five days, if you are asymptomatic or your symptoms are resolving, we recommend an additional five days of strict mask use to minimize the risk of infecting others. Outpatient COVID testing is always available at off post urgent care centers (cost associated) as well as the Georgia Department of Public Health (free testing) sites. Did you know every home in the U.S. is eligible to order four free at-home COVID-19 tests? The tests are completely free. Orders will usually ship in 7-12 days.
