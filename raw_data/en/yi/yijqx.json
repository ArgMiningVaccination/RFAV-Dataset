Thus far, the evidence on vaccine safety has exclusively been obtained from the manufacturer-sponsored studies; therefore, this study was designed to provide independent evidence on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine side effects. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between January and February 2021 to collect data on the side effects following the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers in the Czech Republic. The study used a validated questionnaire with twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering the participants' demographic data, medical anamneses, COVID-19-related anamneses, general, oral, and skin-related side effects. Results: Injection site pain (89.8%), fatigue (62.2%), headache (45.6%), muscle pain (37.1%), and chills (33.9%) were the most commonly reported side effects. All the general side effects were more prevalent among the 43-year-old group, and their duration was mainly one day (45.1%) or three days (35.8%) following the vaccine. Antihistamines were the most common drugs associated with side effects, thus requiring further investigation. The people with two doses were generally associated with a higher frequency of side effects. Conclusions: The distribution of side effects among Czech healthcare workers was highly consistent with the manufacturer's data, especially in terms of their association with the younger age group and the second dose. The overall prevalence of some local and systemic side effects was higher than the manufacturer's report. Further independent studies on vaccine safety are strongly required to strengthen public confidence in the vaccine.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-01", "cleaned_text": "Prevalence of COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects among Healthcare Workers in the Czech Republic [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071428](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10071428) [Impact of COVID-19 on the Introduction [1](#B1-jcm-10-01428), recent nation-wide study, aversion to vaccines' potential side effects was the most frequent cause for VH among population groups in the United Kingdom (U.K.) [ [4](#B4-jcm-10-01428)]. This finding was supported in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, because a fear of side effects was the most prominent reason to decrease the readiness of healthcare workers and students in Poland to accept the vaccination [ [5](#B5-jcm-10-01428), [6](#B6-jcm-10-01428)]. Consequently, a systematic review of the strategies of tackling VH revealed that raising public awareness of vaccines' effectiveness and honesty regarding their side effects is vital for improving vaccine uptake [ [7](#B7-jcm-10-01428)]. The launch of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in December 2020 was a landmark for overcoming this pandemic crisis; therefore, it had been recommended to split the pandemic history to pre-vaccination (B.V.; before vaccine) and post-vaccination (A.V.; after vaccine) eras. COVID-19-related literature should be defined in relation to this parameter either as B.V. or A.V. [ [8](#B8-jcm-10-01428)]. [9](#B9-jcm-10-01428)]. The short-term side effects of vaccines vary in their clinical presentation; however, they are commonly related to prophylactic vaccines' humoral immune response [ [10](#B10-jcm-10-01428)]. The oral cavity has been a locus for the adverse events of an array of vaccines, e.g., diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and polio vaccines [ [9](#B9-jcm-10-01428)]. The COVID-19-related oral symptoms were attributed to the high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the independent studies on vaccines' safety may adversely impact the vaccine uptake, which has to be accelerated in the next few months in order to escape this viscous circle of the virus and its variants [ [7](#B7-jcm-10-01428)]. Therefore, this study's primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine side effects among the early vaccinated healthcare workers in the Czech Republic. - To identify the potential risk factors of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine side effects; - To evaluate the correlation of general side effects, oral side effects, and skin-related side effects. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design [20](#B20-jcm-10-01428), [21](#B21-jcm-10-01428)]. [22](#B22-jcm-10-01428)]. The awareness of the study was also raised by promotion on the websites and social media profiles of CZECRIN and the Faculty of Medicine [ [23](#B23-jcm-10-01428)]. The collected data are controlled by Masaryk University, and data acquisition and processing are in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [ [24](#B24-jcm-10-01428)]. 2.2. Participants [25](#B25-jcm-10-01428)]. The eligible participants should have received the latest dose of the vaccine, either the first or the second dose, no more than thirty days before filling in the questionnaire. Non-healthcare workers who were vaccinated during Phase 1A and the healthcare workers who were vaccinated in February 2021 by Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine were excluded from this report. Participation in this study was not compensated financially or by any other incentives. 2.3. Instrument [9](#B9-jcm-10-01428), [26](#B26-jcm-10-01428)]. A panel of four experts in oral medicine, maxillofacial surgery, and infectious diseases were formed to review the questionnaire draft and to assess its content validity. We used an iterative discussion to finalize the questionnaire. Later, the reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated by a group of eighteen recently vaccinated healthcare workers, who filled in the questionnaire twice with a minimum interval of two weeks. The result of the test re-test of the provisional instrument yielded substantial reliability, with a mean Cohen's kappa Table S1](#app1-jcm-10-01428)). 2.4. Ethical Considerations 2.5. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Demographic Characteristics [28](#B28-jcm-10-01428), [29](#B29-jcm-10-01428)] ( [Table 2](#jcm-10-01428-t002)). [30](#B30-jcm-10-01428)]. The highest density was in the South-Moravian region with 9.86 response per 1000 healthcare workers; the lowest was in the South Bohemian region with 1.51 response per 1000 healthcare Vaccine Reported Side Effects 3.4.1. Prevalence of General Side Effects [Table 6](#jcm-10-01428-t006)). 3.4.2. Prevalence of Reported Oral Side Effects Prevalence of Skin-Related Side Effects [Table Side Effects and Medical Anamneses [Table 9](#jcm-10-01428-t009)). 3.4.5. Risk Factors of COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects 3.4.6. Number of Doses and Side Effects' Prevalence [Table 10](#jcm-10-01428-t010)). 3.4.7. Oral and General Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine 4. Discussion [19](#B19-jcm-10-01428)]. The vaccine's side effects could be categorized as either local or systemic reactions, and their severity varied from mild to moderate [ [31](#B31-jcm-10-01428)]. [19](#B19-jcm-10-01428)]. [19](#B19-jcm-10-01428)]. In contrast, the overall frequency of headache was quite consistent between the Czech sample and the FDA's report (45.6% vs. 40.06%, respectively). [19](#B19-jcm-10-01428)]. The Czech data confirmed this trend in all the reported side effects except for injection site redness, which was more frequent among the people with one dose only. [32](#B32-jcm-10-01428)]. Moreover, injection in a relaxed muscle leads to less pain compared to a tensed one; therefore, it is recommended to lower the patient's arm which will be injected. Vaccines in situ are preserved in very low temperature, including the BNT162b2 vaccine which requires 70 \u00b0C, and if injected without optimal warming up, this may increase the probability of post-vaccination pain of the injection site [ [33](#B33-jcm-10-01428)]. Additionally, muscle mass might play a role in pain perception following the injection. The healthcare workers involved in the vaccination process are highly recommended to receive appropriate training on optimal injection techniques to reduce inequalities in patients' experience of pain after vaccination [ [34](#B34-jcm-10-01428)]. [31](#B31-jcm-10-01428)]. Although people with allergies to oral medications, food, pets, insects, venom, latex, and other environmental insults and family histories are recommended to proceed with receiving the vaccine normally, it is worth noting that antihistamine consumption increases considerably in spring in Europe; therefore, special attention should be given to the prescription of these drugs during this season in the context of vaccination. This result will be further explored in our upcoming study phase. [35](#B35-jcm-10-01428), [36](#B36-jcm-10-01428), [37](#B37-jcm-10-01428)] Therefore, in this study, lymphadenopathy was among the general side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and its overall prevalence was 16.2%, with a higher frequency among females compared to males (16.8% vs. 10.6%), young adults compared to old adults (17.3% vs. 15.1%), and people with allergies (21.4% vs. 14.5%), asthma (17.6% vs. 14.1%), bowel (30% vs. 14.2%). The majority of participants with lymphadenopathy reported that its duration was either one day (18.9%), three days (43.9%), or five days (18.2%). This finding is slightly in agreement with the FDA's report, where lymphadenopathy emerged 2-4 days post-vaccination and lasted for approximately 10 days. [38](#B38-jcm-10-01428)]. The median patency period between the recovery date and the first vaccine dose was 65 days, which fulfills the recommendation of the Czech MOH for a patency period of seven days between the positive test and the vaccination [ [39](#B39-jcm-10-01428)]. [40](#B40-jcm-10-01428), [41](#B41-jcm-10-01428)]. Cardiac disease and chronic hypertension had prevalence around 4.3% and 23.7%, respectively (2019), which were two-fold higher than the prevalence values of our sample, which were 1.83% and 11.44%, respectively [ [42](#B42-jcm-10-01428), [43](#B43-jcm-10-01428)]. In contrast, asthma had a prevalence in the Czech Republic 4.5% (2018), while in our sample it was 6.75% [ [44](#B44-jcm-10-01428)]. Thyroid disease had a prevalence in the Czech Republic in 7.5% (2015) which was similar to our sample (7.89%) [ [45](#B45-jcm-10-01428)]. 4.1. Strengths and Limitations 4.2. Study Implications - Further independent (non-sponsored) epidemiological studies for COVID-19 vaccine side effects should be carried out by academic institutions in the upcoming months to increase public confidence in the vaccines' safety and accelerate its uptake process. - The upcoming studies will benefit from comparing data of different vaccines from other manufacturers. - The upcoming studies of vaccine side effects should distinguish between the side effects that emerged after the first dose, the second dose, and both doses. - Healthcare workers and healthcare students are among the ideal population groups to participate in this type of studies due to their high level of health literacy and scientific motivation. - The potential association between antihistamine drugs and the vaccine side effects' frequency should be further explored. 5.
