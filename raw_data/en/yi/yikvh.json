SPECIAL SECTION2018 INTRODUCTORY PRICE U.S. and Canada $5.99 THE MAGAZINE FOR SCIENCE AND REASON Vol. 43 No. 2 | March/April 2019 Respectful Skepticism Assault on Materialism What We Skeptics DoMind of Leonardo | Fake News | Crater Discovery | Not Knowing | Science of Yoga | Replication Crisis REVIEWS: Skeptics' Guide to the Universe At Least Know This Transcendental Deception Vitamin Megatherapy and Respectful Skepticism My father was a small-town pharmacist, and he always told us that vitamins beyond what our bodies need are excreted out of our systems. So why now, many decades later, is that commonsense lesson so little known and heed - ed? Billons of dollars are spent on unneeded and worthless megavitamin therapy, and the craze continues. In our cover story, medical researcher Reynold Spector examines this situation, especially regarding irrational use of megavitamins C and E. A noted clinical pharmacologist and former research scientist into the inner workings of the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers, Spector is in a good position to judge the m isinformation and misrepresentations about mega - vitamin therapy. He acknowledges that there are certain rare cases where extra doses of vitamins C and E are needed, but in general the mass use of taking megavitamin doses for those who don't require them is an \"unwise and wasteful\" practice. It has much in common with other forms of so-called alternative medicine. Spector didn't tell us this, but I discovered that there is a Reynold Spector Award in Clinical Pharmacology named for him, \"recognizing Dr. Spector's dedication and contributions in clinical pharmacology.\" In retirement, Spector has combined his distinguished biomedical background with explorations of superstitions and misconceptions. This is now, by my count, his seventh article for the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER . * * * What tone should scientific skeptics take? We skeptics deal, on one extreme, with all sorts of utter nonsense and bilge and, on the other, with widespread subtle mis - understandings and understandable misconceptions\u2014plus everything in between. In \"Respectful Skepticism\" in this issue, psychologist Craig A. Foster argues for behaving respectfully and even sympathetically toward pseudoscience supporters if we are to have any hope of changing minds. He was pleased to find that a lot of our colleagues at our recent CSICon conference also made this point. It is good advice. It can be difficult to put aside our frustrations seeing people fall for unverified or clearly debunked claims, but we have to put aside those feelings and address the claims themselves and the reasons for their popularity. There success lies. This is not new advice. We're hardly perfect here at SI and CSI (back to when we were CSICOP), but I think we do fairly well in this regard. We have always been guided by our colleague Ray Hyman's classic document \"Proper Criticism\" (it's on our website, csicop.org), which offers eight valuable suggestions, including \"use the principle of charity.\" Our founder, philosopher Paul Kurtz, constantly spoke of not judging people and claims prior to investigation. Our famous late colleague Carl Sagan likewise called on his fellow skeptics to guard against \"making fun of all those other people who don't see things as clearly as you do\" (see his \"The Burden of Skepticism,\" SI, Fall 1987, Sagan's Pasadena CSICOP conference keynote). Our own Guide for Authors, which I wrote, calls for maintaining \"a factual, professional, and restrained tone.\" But it's a lesson we must all keep reemphasizing. Speaking of CSICon, in this issue we present pages of lively reports and as many photos as we can to convey some of the fun, excitement, and insights from our CSI - Con 2018 conference in Las Vegas. This year's is October 17-20. See you there. \u2014KENDRICK FRAZIER[ FROM THE EDITOR[ NEWS AND COMMENT Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 5Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full? Latest Results in the Replication Crisis in Psychology T OMASZ WITKOWSKI For years a chorus of voices has spo - ken of a replication crisis in psychol - ogy, particularly social psychology. In November 2018, the results of another large replication project called Many Labs 2 were published, which demon - strated that in half of known psycho - logical experiments it is possible to generate results that are similar to\u2014 but slightly lower than\u2014the original results. Over a period of several years, 186 researchers from sixty different laboratories on six different conti - nents representing thirty-six different nationalities conducted replications of twenty-eight well-known studies. Over 7,000 participants from diverse cultures took part in each of them. By compari - son, the average number of participants in the original studies was 112. The results demonstrated clearly that rep - licability of experiments is not depen - dent on cultural context. Brian Nosek from the Center for Open Science, who helped to coordinate the study, claims that their results could prove even more significant than those of the 2015 Reproducibility Project, in which a mere 36 percent of experiments were successfully reproduced. Studies were selected for replication based on a wide range of criteria, in - cluding frequency of citations, demon - strating the impact of a given study on the whole of psychology. Another, more technical criterion was the possibility to conduct the study online via the inter - net, using a platform accessible to re - searchers from all sixty laboratories. Among the experiments whose re - sults could not be confirmed was one demonstrating the Lady Macbeth ef - fect: like the character from the Shake - spearean drama, haunted by memories of her own crimes and convinced that she could see traces of blood on her hands, participants asked to recall some behavior associated with a violation of moral norms would have a strong ten - dency to engage in behaviors involving restoration and maintenance of physical cleanliness. Confirmation was also not achieved of results showing that people growing up with siblings are more al - truistic than only children. There was no success in confirming the results of experiments showing that participants performing tasks involving the use of words describing heat are more likely to believe in global warming than those who performed tasks linked with the use of words describing cold. Replica - tion was also not achieved of the famous 2009 experiment by Yoel Inbar showing that people who had first experienced a feeling of aversion were later more ho - mophobic than those from the control group. However, there was successful repli - cation of the results of a study by the Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, who together with Amos Tversky dis - covered the \"framing effect,\" in which people who are in possession of the same information make different de - cisions depending on the context in which that data is presented to them. Many Labs 2 replicated the results of a study from 2007 on the so-called trolley dilemma. As in the original experiment, here the majority of participants con - sidered it impermissible to shove one person onto the tracks in order to halt a wagon that could potentially kill five people. The trials of replication were also successfully handled by experi - ments on the primary attribution effect, the tendency to explain behaviors of ob - served persons in terms of internal and fixed categories (e.g., personality traits), while simultaneously discounting exter - nal situational factors. As always when we achieve a 50/50 result, the trite question comes to mind of whether the glass is half full or half empty. The answer depends not only on our reserves of optimism or pessimism but also on the perspective we have adopted. If we remove our rose-tinted glasses and look at psychology, particu - larly social psychology, as a science that has for years struggled with method - ological problems, beset by scandals sur - rounding numerous scientific fraudsters, our answer would, perhaps paradoxi - cally, be positive. From this perspective 50 percent is quite a lot, as it means that a significant portion of the general rules discovered by psychology do not depend on cultural context (which is not to say that cultural context has no meaning in psychological experiments). Psycholo - gists until quite recently have not had this certainty, for the majority of study results came from the WEIRDest (W estern, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) populations and mainly from American psychology students. Another piece of good information coming from the results of Many Labs 2 is that a significant portion of our knowledge on human behavior is in - dependent of the passage of time\u2014the variable that is the bugaboo of so many Over 7,000 participants from diverse cultures took part in each repli - cation study. The results demonstrated clearly that replicability of ex - periments is not depen - dent on cultural context.6 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirersocial scientists, whose work frequently turns out to be a snapshot of something ethereal. Perhaps this is the case of the study of altruism of only children and those raised with siblings, whose results were not confirmed by Many Labs 2. During the time from which the original study was conducted to the moment the replication was done, there were most certainly changes in the manner in which children are raised and changes in many cultures. Perhaps some functions that the home and family pre - viously performed have been assumed by various institutions. This, in turn, could have led to contacts between only children and their peers being more extensive than in previous times, thus substituting for siblings. However, to determine whether these suspicions are accurate, it would be necessary to con - duct a well-designed longitudinal study. The mere replication does not tell us. The results of Many Labs 2 also reinforce convictions about the impor - tance for study replicability of the effect size uncovered in the original study. In - deed, as it turned out, other factors such as the place of the study, order of tasks, or culture did not exert the same impact on replication results as did effect size. Either something could be repeated everywhere or not at all. We can draw clear conclusions for future research and publication work. The discoveries of the Many Labs 2 team, supplying invaluable pointers to contemporary researchers, give hope that the knowledge referred to by the nineteenth-century mathema - tician William Clifford as \"safe truth\" will expand in psychology, while we will learn about the replication crisis during classes on the history of psychology. Before this happens, however, we should keep in mind that in the field of psychology almost 150,000 reviewed studies are published annually in En - glish alone (144,291 in 2017 according to PsycINFO), making twenty-eight replicated studies over a period of sev - eral years a mere drop in the bucket. The perspective of scientists is also not the only one we should take into ac - count when answering the question of how full our glass is. Entirely different is the perspective adopted by the aver - age user of psychological knowledge\u2014 practitioners applying knowledge from social psychology in management or in the shaping of social attitudes through advertisements or education. They will ask questions similar to those posed by users of other goods accessible to us. How many forged banknotes in circu - lation make a currency worthless? What percentage of false entries in Wikipedia would lead to its total uselessness as a source of information? What proportion of defective products will lead people to stop buying goods from a particular company? How much false information can be published by a newspaper before it loses the trust of its readers? Unfortu - nately, the results of Many Labs 2 mean that half of the pages in textbooks and other volumes used by researchers may contain false information. The problem is, we don't know which half. Perhaps the inauthenticity of half of the banknotes in circulation is a prob - lem for a currency, just as false infor - mation is a problem for the reliability of sources of information. That said, it does not appear that this applies to psychology. In 2018, the American Psy - chological Association reported that psychology presently enjoys greater popularity than in any other time in history. Every year around 1.6 million first-year students in America take an introduction to psychology course, and this number is growing. Forecasts for employment among psychologists pre - dict a 19 percent increase in the need for psychologists by 2024. There is a similar level of interest in the study of psychology and services offered by psy - chologists in Europe. Is this growth in interest happening despite the replica - tion crisis or perhaps because of it? Or perhaps both suppositions are true. Tomasz Witkowski is a psychologist and writer. He is author of Psychology Led Astray a n d c o a u t h o r o f Psychology Gone Wrong . He is the founder of the Polish Skeptics Club and specializes in debunking pseudoscience, particularly in the field of psychology and psychotherapy.Crater Discovery Story Flawed by Premature Link to Speculative Impact Hypothesis MARK BOSLOUGH On November 14, 2018, science jour - nalist Paul Voosen reported in the elite journal Science on the discovery of a possible impact crater under Greenland's ice sheet . The next day on Twitter he described his effort to break the story after learning about it more than a year earlier. But the scientists had chosen to remain silent until they got a paper through peer review and published in the AAAS journal Science Advances , which has very strict embargo rules. The secret wasn't all that well kept. I'd been hearing rumors about it for the better part of a year. In July, a down - loadable paper about the \"Hiawatha meteorite crater\"\u2014written by many of the same scientists\u2014was published in the journal Energy Procedia. It de - scribed the crater as \"the youngest and undoubtedly best-preserved\" impact crater on Earth, citing K.H. Kj\u00e6r, et al., \"in revision, \" that was finally published in Science Advances in November. By the time the second paper came out, the first one had been retracted because it \"contained partially redun - dant material [that] was still under consideration at Science Advances .\" But the new paper made no claims Supporters of the controversial \"Clovis Comet\" hypothesis were primed to claim the Hiawatha Crater as their smoking gun.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 7[ NEWS AND COMMENT about a remarkably young age. According to the abstract: \"The age of this impact crater is presently unknown ... . \" The detailed dis - cussion of its age makes it clear that the tentative age constraints only suggest that it formed during the Pleistocene, adding, \"we emphasize that even this broad age estimate remains uncertain ... . \" In other words, \"we don't really know, but we think it's younger than about 2.6 million years. \" Supporters of the controversial \"Clovis Comet\" hypothesis (see David Morrison's skeptical special report, \"Did a Cosmic Im - pact Kill the Mammoths?, \" SI, May/June 2010) were primed to claim the Hiawatha Crater as their smoking gun. This hypothesis was first suggested in the 2006 book Cycles of Cosmic Catastrophes and reappeared in modified form when authors Richard Fires - tone and Allen West teamed up with other researchers the following year to publish \"Ev - idence for an extraterrestrial impact 12,900 years ago that contributed to the megafaunal extinctions and the Younger Dryas cooling. \" They argued that a comet (or broken comet) exploded in outer space over North America exactly 12.9 thousand years ago, destabi - lizing the Laurentide ice sheet. This started a chain reaction that led to an abrupt cli - mate change to a cold period known as the Younger Dryas. But that's not all. The explo - sions over North America also created a swarm of descending fireballs that engulfed the entire continent, burning it to a crisp. The combination of incineration followed by freezing led to unfavorable environmental conditions that caused the collapse of the Clovis culture and the extinction of myriad megabeasts, including woolly mammoths, giant sloths, and saber-toothed cats. This impact hypothesis contradicted mainstream science in virtually every field it touched, including astronomy, impact physics, archaeology, paleontology, geol - ogy, paleoecology, paleoclimatology, and even crystallography. As someone whose research has focused on experimental and computational impact physics since I was a graduate student in the 1970s, my skepti - cism was immediate\u2014especially after learn -ing that the swarm-of-descending-fireballs idea was based on a less-than-accurate TV documentary animation of a simulation I had done to test an idea that I had long since rejected. Experts in the other relevant fields were equally skeptical, but each for their own reasons. After a dozen years and scores of pa - pers, the skeptical consensus hasn't changed. Neither the retracted paper nor the Science Advances paper mentioned the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, let alone tried to link it to the putative Hiawatha Cra - ter. Therefore, I was surprised that Voosen's article about it in Science focused on this aspect with the headline \"Massive Crater under Greenland's Ice Points to Climate-Al - tering Impact in the Time of Humans\" and was topped by a sensational illustration la - beled \"A 1.5-kilometer asteroid, intact or in pieces, may have smashed into an ice sheet just 13,000 years ago. \" Voosen explained on Twitter that \"... this paper spent a long time gestating, pass - ing through more than a dozen reviewers, I believe, who skimmed away the informed speculation. Was that partly due to the possible Younger Dryas tie? Probably. As a coauthor put it, they faced an unfairly high bar. \" So he added the speculative part back into the first breaking news story that set the tone for virtually all the media reporting to follow. I will not be surprised if Hiawatha is con - firmed as an impact crater. It will eventually be drilled and dated. Based on the evidence and statistical probability, I'm willing to bet that it will turn out to be much older. Re - gardless of its age, it's unfortunate that such a spectacular story of scientific discovery was tainted by connections to a widely dis - credited hypothesis and speculations that did not make it through peer review.

FC, a technique used primarily on people with mini - mal spoken language abilities, requires a facilitator to support the person's wrist, arm, shoulder, or other body part while typing out words on a keyboard. Reliable testing demonstrates that mes - sages obtained using FC are authored by the facilitator and are not the words of the person with disabilities. While a select number of profoundly impaired individuals may start out needing close instruction by an educator, specialist, or caregiver in the initial stages of learn - ing to use a communication device, evidence-based communication systems and technologies exist that allow those individuals to move toward independent functioning without long-term depen - dence on a facilitator. Most major health and education organizations have policies against FC's use, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Association on Intellectual and Devel - opmental Disabilities, and the American Psychological Association. In 2014, the International Society for Augmenta - tive and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) stated that the use of FC ap -pears to be in violation of several arti - cles of the United Nations Convention Rights of Persons with Disabilities. And, in August 2018, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) renewed its position statement against the use of FC. Despite this, the University of North - ern Iowa (UNI) held its fifth Midwest Summer Institute in June 2018, which featured keynote speakers claiming to be \"Master Trainers\" in FC (though no formal licensing is required for this title), two sessions on facilitated commu - nication (an introduction and a \"getting started\"/hands on work session), typing to communicate (FC by another name), and discussions by people with disabili - ties accompanied by a facilitator typing messages. UNI offered one undergrad - uate or graduate credit to students for participating in the conference, overseen by the UNI Department of Teaching. In May 2018, a group of more than thirty educators, researchers, health care providers, communication specialists, science writers, and concerned citizens sent UNI officials a letter expressing their concern over the continued use of FC, along with a resource list of arti - cles and policy statements, in the hope of stopping the conference. University officials ignored the letter, planning to continue the conference in 2019, until the media picked up the story ( The Ga - zette , Forbes , Consumer Health Digest , and The Daily Orange , among others). In response to the initial news report, a Cedar Rapids citizen also wrote to the UNI administration, disclosing that he had suffered, first hand, the harms of FC when he and his wife were falsely accused of abusing their child shortly after their son started working with a facilitator. The couple was not allowed to see their son for a period of time. No charges were ever brought against the couple, and, eventually, the family was reunited. After the conference was held in June, UNI officials decided to form a commit - tee to study the issue. In October 2018, Provost James Wohlpart responded to the group, indicating that the leadership had met to discuss conference practices and agreed to no longer host the confer - ence. According to Wohlpart, the con - ference was hosted by an outside agency that is not affiliated with the university. While the group is pleased with this result, UNI has failed to acknowledge that there are current staff members who trained with Douglas Biklen and others at Syracuse University's Institute on Communication and Inclusion, ground zero for FC in the United States. UNI is also where D.J. Savarese, a young man with autism who is featured in the movie Deej, was introduced to FC in 2007. This brings into doubt the claim that UNI's affiliation with FC was incidentally lim - ited to the conference. When FC comes under close scru - tiny, its proponents often change the name to supported typing, hand-over- hand, rapid prompting method, typing/ spelling to communicate, or other inven - tive terms to mask their continued use of the discredited technique. Hopefully, the administration and staff at UNI will stay true to their word to stop using FC and stand as a model for other universities in demonstrating to people with disabil - ities and their families a commitment to evidence-based practices within their classrooms.Reliable testing demonstrates that messages obtained using FC are authored by the facilitator and are not the words of the person with disabilities.In October 2018, UNI Provost James Wohlpart responded to the group, indicating that the lead - ership had met to discuss conference practices and agreed to no longer host the FC conference.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 9[ NEWS AND COMMENT Interstellar Visitor Continues to Behave Strangely DAVID MORRISON In late 2017, an interstellar asteroid named 'Oumuamua swept past Earth, looped around the Sun, and departed\u2014 the first recorded visit from beyond our solar system (see my \"Interstellar Visitor: The Strange Asteroid from a Faraway System, \" News and Comment, SI, March/April 2018). Its orbit was unique but so was its shape as revealed by its light curve\u2014its variation in brightness as it rotated. 'Oumuamua was highly elongated, with a length at least five times greater than its width. Because it was so small, perhaps 200 meters long, actual images could not be obtained. By the time of its discovery it was already moving away at high speed, so there was no hope of launching a spacecraft mission for a closer look. Despite the meager data, this unique object has proved an ideal subject for speculation. The first question was whether it was an asteroid or a comet. The distinction is that a comet outgases volatiles as it approaches the Sun, while a rocky asteroid does not. Telescopic images showed no tail or wisps of gas, so it was classified as an asteroid. However, there is a second way to detect escaping gas: from changes in the orbit. If jets of gas are strong enough, they can accelerate the comet. Careful tracking of 'Oumuamua showed a slight accelera - tion; on this basis, some scientists began to call it a comet, although a very strange one. Is there any other way to achieve a change in orbit rela - tive to a path defined purely by gravitation? Spacecraft do this all the time with thruster rockets or light sails. Perhaps inevitably, someone would suggest that this interstellar visi - tor was actually a spacecraft using some sort of propulsion system. A second mystery was revealed when the highly sensitive Spitzer Infrared Space Telescope failed to detect 'Oumuamua despite a thirty-hour exposure, suggesting that it was smaller and more reflective than originally assumed. Abraham Loeb, chair of the Harvard Astronomy Depart - ment, with Shmuel Bialy, a postdoc at the Harvard-Smithso - nian Center for Astrophysics, have suggested the possibility of its being a spacecraft in a paper for the prestigious Astro - physical Journal Letters . They write that \"'Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth by an Alien civilization. \" This speculation got a lot of publicity. Most astronomers are, of course, skeptical of this idea. We are unlikely ever to know the definitive answer for 'Ou - muamua, although astronomers hope to discover more in - terstellar visitors (asteroids, comets, or alien probes) and to study them before they fade into deep space.Britt Hermes Awarded 2018 Maddox Prize for Courageous Defense of Science Britt Hermes, who publicized her research and subsequent rejection of natural therapies, is the recip - ient of the 2018 John Maddox Prize. Hermes, a former naturo - path, was awarded the inaugural John Maddox Prize for an early career researcher \"in recognition of her advocacy and writing on evidence-based medicine\u2014in particular her exposure of false claims made by proponents of naturopathy, which she has high - lighted as both dangerous and ineffective.\" The Maddox Prizes, named for the late long-time Nature ed- itor (and former CSI fellow) John Maddox, are given for courage in promoting science and evidence on matters of public interest, despite smears, threats, and attempted law - suits. The prize is run and funded by Sense about Science, a Lon - don organization where Sir John Maddox was a founding trustee, and the leading scientific journal Nature . The Wellcome Collection hosted the awards ceremony. There were 136 nominations from thir - ty-six countries. Professor Terry Hughes, a world expert on the Great Barrier Reef who exposed the extent of coral reef damage caused by rising water temperatures, also received a 2018 Maddox Prize. As for Hermes, the prize an - nouncement said, \"The judges were particularly impressed by her willingness to question her own views, the discomfort involved in communicating about the prac - tices of former colleagues, and her continued commitment in the face of lawsuits and personal ha - rassment.\" It noted she is currently being sued for defamation by an American naturopath in a case to be heard in a German court. \"I was a naturopath, until I looked at the evidence and decided to speak up about the dangerous therapies used in naturopathy, especially those to treat cancer,\" said Hermes. \"Walking away cost me my friends. I am harassed and being sued for defamation. I am honored to be recognized by the scientific community for changing my mind.\" University of London Professor Sir Colin Blakemore, one of the judges, said that \"Britt Hermes's story is one of exceptional cour - age\u2014not only to realize that natu - ropathy, to which she had devoted four years of training, was riddled with bogus practices, but then to criticize these practices in the face of abuse and legal actions.\" Another judge, Natasha Loder of The Economist , said, \"Britt Hermes has fought hard for evi - dence-based medicine in the face of opposition and ongoing legal challenges. ... All this from some - one who is just starting out on a career in science is remarkable.\" Hermes spoke at our CSICon 2017 conference in Las Vegas where she gave a memorable talk, \"The Bloody Work of Naturo - paths\" (see SI, March/April 2018, p. 18).

It is named in recognition of UCD alumnus James Joyce. Loftus is Distinguished Professor of psychological science as well as criminology, law, and society at the University of California, Irvine. She is a fellow and member of the Executive Council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. The medal was presented in November 2018 during the University College Dublin School of Psy - chology's Sixtieth Anniversary Public Lecture Series, at which Loftus spoke on \"The Fiction of Memory. \" After missing for fifty-seven years, the Coso Artifact has been found. First discovered in 1961 in the Coso Range of eastern California, south of Owens Lake, the Coso Artifact was variously alleged to be physical evidence of ancient aliens or the product of an advanced anti-deluvian civilization or time travelers. It was even featured in a popular episode of In Search Of... hosted by Leonard Nimoy. Sliced in half, the object originally (and incor - rectly) alleged to be a geode held a small porcelain cylinder inside with a central metallic shaft. During the 1990s, Pierre Strom - berg was busy organizing the Pacific Northwest Skeptics group and became intrigued by the Coso Artifact when he attended multiple lectures by young- earth creationist Donald Chittick. Chit - tick claimed that the artifact could be evidence of a pre-flood civilization that had \"internal combustion engines or even jet engines way back then.\" Chit - tick was a defense witness who testified in pretrial depositions for the Arkansas \"Balanced Treatment Act,\" which re - quired that \"creation science\" be taught along with evolutionary biology in that state's public schools. Recalling the In Search Of... e p i- sode, Stromberg decided to investigate, and by 2000 he realized, with the help of Louisiana State University geologist Paul Heinrich and the Spark Plug Col - lectors of America, that the Coso Arti - fact was in fact a 1920s Champion spark plug. Upon revealing his findings, many A 2018 photograph of the Coso Artifact, staged to duplicate one of the original photographs from 1961.The Coso Artifact is currently stored in a small, trans - parent, cubicle box, held in place by carved green styrofoam.The shell allegation was the key claim that propelled the Coso Artifact to the fame it enjoyed.

Conor Healy / Picture It PhotographySkeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 11[ NEWS AND COMMENT in the creationist community accepted his findings and ceased any mention of the artifact. But since Stromberg didn't have physical access to the artifact, there were those who did not accept his find - ings, including some of the original players involved in the popularization of the artifact. As recently as 2018, some paranormal proponents, such as Erich Von Daniken, continue to promote the artifact in their literature. In April 2018, Stromberg was con - tacted by the family of one of the orig - inal codiscoverers of the artifact. Aware of Stromberg's research and accepting of his conclusion, the family invited him to physically inspect the artifact. Inspec - tion once again revealed that the artifact is indeed a 1920s Champion spark plug. However, the inspection turned up some unexpected information. Long claimed to have \"fossil shells\" on the artifact's surface that dated back 500,000 years, geologist Heinrich could not identify any such shells. A second physical inspection was conducted by a geologist with the Uni - versity of Washington Earth and Space Science department. The second geol - ogist could not find any shells or shell impressions on the surface of the arti - fact either. Ironically, the disposition of shells on the artifact did not have any relevance to the dating of the artifact itself. But it raises further questions as to the qualifications and compe -tency of the original alleged geologist who claimed there were shells present during the initial inspection in 1961. The shell allegation was the key claim that propelled the Coso Artifact to the fame it enjoyed and helped reenergize the OOPARTs (Out of Place Artifacts) in the late twentieth century. Further certainty regarding the arti - fact's true origin came with the discov - ery that the top of the spark plug was still sticking out of the top of the object, allowing Stromberg to make a detailed verification of the spark plug's make and manufacturer. Pierre Stromberg has provided an extensive analysis of his decades-long research into the Coso Artifact on the Talk.Origins website. In addition, Stromberg has negotiated with the family of one of the original codiscoverers and museum curators to put the artifact on display at Seattle's Pacific Science Center in a new exhibi - tion titled \"What Is Reality?\" The Coso Artifact may be of more humble origins than its original propo - nents may have hoped for, but it can - not be denied that it had an impact on American culture and played a major role in modern pseudo-archaeology.

The Saturday evening Halloween Party this time was a pajama party. That al - lowed the imaginations of scientific skeptics free rein (as if they need more of that)! CSICon 2018, the annual celebration of science and reason by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER magazine, and the Center for Inquiry, had some - thing for everyone. With more than 650 participants gathered at a new and larger Las Vegas conference venue, the Westgate Hotel, just far enough off the strip to seem suitable, it was the biggest\u2014 and some said best\u2014CSICon yet. Before my opening re - marks I asked for a show of hands. How many were at - tending their first ever CSI - Con conference? Hundreds of hands shot up. We were surprised and delighted. So many new faces! Skeptic Rob Palmer talked to some of these first-time attendees\u2014 who came from all over the world. He subsequently pub - lished on our csicop.org web - site \"Meet the First-Timers,\" a fascinating report filled with anecdotes on why they came and how positive their experi - ences were. (See https://www. csicop.org/specialarticles/ show/csicon_2018_meet_ the_first-timers.) Said conference organizer and CSI Executive Director Barry Karr: The conference was a great success. Although not the largest confer - ence we've ever had, it was certainly the largest CSICon, with over 650 people. It was great to see so many old friends, and it's always a plea - sure to welcome first- time attendees. I think the highlight for me was watching James Randi in conversation with Ray Hyman, James Alcock, and Ken Frazier dis - cussing the founding of CSICOP (now CSI) and the dawning of the skep - tic's movement. I am not sure how you can top a line-up like the one we had, but you know we are certainly going to try next year! Added exuberant Center for Inquiry CEO and Presi -dent Robyn Blumner after - ward: CSICon 2018 was a rousing success. People were regularly coming up to me and other CFI staff overflowing with enthu - siasm for what they were experiencing. The speak - ers were tremendous. There were impactful and thoughtful talks but also plenty of humor. This was the best CSICon so far. I simply don't know how it could have been better. Attendees walked away saying they would be back and would bring spouses and friends to the next one. The next CSICon will be a joint conference with CSI's sister organization, the Coun - cil for Secular Humanism, October 17-20, 2019, in Las Vegas at the Flamingo. For more extensive coverage of CSICon 2018, we next offer adapted excerpts from Paul Fidal - go's session-by-session coverage done live at the time on the CFI Live website.

That allowed the imaginations of scientific skeptics free rein (as if they need more of that)!14 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer 2018 CSICon is always a big deal. We wouldn't crow about it so much if it wasn't. We call it things such as \"the premier skeptics' event\" and whatnot because it happens to be true! So even given the cascade of well-earned superlatives we (okay, I) use to describe CSI - Con year after year, it's al - ready obvious that this year's conference was something else. All these people, from remote locations across the country and around the globe, gathering to celebrate science and reason ... and utterly im - mersing themselves in more. This is a good sign for the fu - ture. Nothing but blue skies from here, right?Well, look, being realists, there was no way to open a conference such as this with - out acknowledging that those skies aren't as blue as we'd like. Robyn Blumner, CFI's president and CEO, said that science and skepticism seem to have been \"reduced to flotsam and jetsam\" in pub - lic discourse. But at the same time, it remains that \"reason is the most powerful tool for human progress on Earth.\" Right now, these truths co - exist, so all the more reason to be glad for the people we have working on the side of science and reason. (Blumner made a point of thanking CSI Executive Director and conference organizer Barry Karr and the CFI staff, refer - ring to us as \"the best team under the climate-change- enhanced sun.\") Y ou see, this is one of the cool things about being a skeptic: one can openly ac - knowledge unpleasant reali - ties while also choosing to find hope and joy in the positive truths. Those are just as real. So the theme underlying the opening of CSICon 2018? Wow, there's a lot of hard work to do. Good thing there's us. Also acknowledging our challenges, SKEPTICAL IN - QUIRER Editor Kendrick Fra - zier spoke of the adaptability and universality of skepticism, casting skepticism as a way to empower people who might otherwise be disempowered by pseudoscience and misin - formation. Rattling off a long list of subjects that the maga - zine has covered just over the past year, Frazier illustrated how skepticism is applicable, and badly needed, in every realm of thought, in every subject. \"Y ou can't fit what we do into a neat box\u2014or any box!\" Even if you could, why limit skepticism's power? And that power, the power to think critically and use the tools of science and reason, are open to everyone. And it's for everyone. Eddie Tabash, CFI's board chair, made that point about the wider freethought movement, the community that encompasses skepticism, humanism, and secularism. The work we were doing wasn't just for us, not just to be \"right,\" but to make sure that the rights and freedoms we seek are enjoyed by every - one equally, whether or not they think like we do. Just so, a person doesn't have to be a \"skeptic\" or jazzed about crit - ical thinking for our move - ment to want to keep that person from being harmed by pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and misinformation.

Robyn E. Blumner Eddie Tabash Kendrick Frazier Photo: | March/April 2019 15CONFERENCE REPORT The headliner of the first night of CSICon was Adam Conover of Adam Ruins Everything , who used the idea of parasites in nature as a metaphor for some of the ways our critical brains are overcome without us ever knowing it. Without going too deeply into Conover's standup act and ruining the jokes, I'll just say that he proved that the algorithms of platforms such as Facebook and YouTube are not too dissimilar from invasive fungi that control ant brains and make them either climb up blades of grass so they can be eaten by cows or clamp onto a tree before exploding. Facebook and Twitter make us mad; YouTube keeps pushing crazier stuff on us, and corporate brands have made it so that we literally can't think of any - thing without associating it with a product for pur - chase. We are the explosive zombie ants, unknowingly acting against our own in - terests.Encapsulating what he sees as the foundation of his work, Conover said, \"We as people are intelligent, have free will, and once we know the truth we can control our behavior for the better.\" But the power of algorithms and advertising are designed to affect us subconsciously, so that \"knowing the truth\" becomes much hazier. \"Un - derstanding we don't have all that control,\" he said, \"that gives us some power.\" In times such as these, we'll take it. We can work with that.Parasites and Modern Mind Control False Beliefs Handled with Care at CSICon 2018 As the first morning's pre- sentations came to a close at CSICon 2018, our ebul - lient emcee, George Hrab, commented, \"I love that the theme today is understand - ing.\" I had been thinking the same thing. If there's a talk at CSICon that hints at being understanding of, and sym - pathetic to, those who harbor false beliefs in good faith, I'm probably going to put it in block quotes. But that morning, under - standing was the thread that held everything together. It wasn't intentional; these talks weren't arranged to be a \"niceness block.\" It's just that this morning, empathy and introspection were among the main themes. The most overt examples of the empathetic stance came from Dr. Jen Gunter, who has made a name for herself countering the false and dangerous claims of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop empire, and Troy Campbell, a psychologist who held the title of \"Imagineer\" at Disney. Gunter showed how the con being played on women by Goop is just part of a long history of women being ex -cluded from medicine (as in literally excluded, to the point that in centuries past, women could be neither doctors in life nor cadavers for study in death) and what she calls a \"culture of vaginal shame.\" When Goop sells women magic eggs and coffee ene - mas, they defend it by saying, \"W e're only starting conver - sations\" about the products and treatments. Retorted Gunter, \"Well then you don't understand language either. A conversation starts with 'Hey, how are you,' not 'Hey, put some coffee up your ass.'\" \"I'll be the first to admit there are many problems with modern medicine,\" said We are the explosive zombie ants, unknowingly acting against our own interests. Gunter showed how the con being played on women by Goop is just part of a long history of women being excluded from medicine.Jen GunterAdam Conover16 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer 2018Gunter, explaining that Goop is taking cynical ad - vantage of modern med - icine's gaps. It's difficult to simply blame their cus - tomers who are often not armed with the kind of crit - ical scientific literacy they'd need to overcome the Goop message. \"People want to belong,\" said Gunter, boiling it all down. \"It doesn't matter that their needs aren't being met [by the products].\" In a culture where women have long been medically mar - ginalized, Goop's customers feel listened to and cared about. This actually explains quite a lot about our rather perilous political climate. Similarly, Troy Campbell encouraged us to look at why people refuse to believe certain facts. It has nothing to do with their intelligence. Campbell presented an \"im - plication structure\" whereby we understand that accep - tance of any fact requires accepting the implications of the fact. \"The solution [to a problem] is often the reason for denial.\" So how do we get more people on \"team science,\" as he put it? \"Start with care,\" he said. \"Love people into it. ... Keep your middle fin - ger ready, but also have your hands open when you need to.\" This kind of understand - ing extends to all manner of false beliefs. Writer and in -vestigator Mick West used the example of the 9/11 \"T ruther\" conspiracy the - orists who believe that the towers of the World Trade Center were brought down by controlled demolition and was \"an inside job.\" Amid many examples of how to make iron mi - crospheres at home for fun (though probably not profit), West was adamant that 9/11 Truthers mean well\u2014they truly believe they possess a crucial truth about one of the most tragic and traumatic moments in modern history, and they've gotten themselves lost in a rabbit hole of scienc - ey-sounding, reaffirming misinformation. Craig Foster of the U.S. Air Force Academy had been doing research on pseudoscientific belief at a Bigfoot conference and found not a bunch of cra - zies or fools but people who were open to hearing from those who didn't think ex - actly as they did, who were eager to aid Foster in his study but feel that the insti -tutions of science have been unfair to their preferred field of inquiry. This doesn't make the Bigfoot believers correct, but it dispels some of the uglier stereotypes about those who cling to pseudoscientific beliefs. Foster discovered that, like CSICon attendees, they are folks who want the oppor - tunity to hang out with peo - ple who think like they do. New York Times science writer Carl Zimmer even showed us how susceptible actual scientists can be to false beliefs, as he told of the truly jaw-dropping history of the study of genetics and heredity. Clouded and dis - torted by prejudices, groups of people who were already marginalized, from immi - grants to petty criminals, were considered to be con - genitally bad and that their problems could be traced back through their ancestry. These attitudes led to what became American eugenics, which in turn influenced the position of Nazi eugenicists who decided that undesir - able genes could be dealt Troy Campbell encouraged us to look at why people refuse to believe certain facts. It has nothing to do with their intelligence. Mick West Paul Offit James AlcockSkeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 17CONFERENCE REPORT with only through killing. Jumping back to the very first presentation of the day, James Alcock introduced us to the component parts of false beliefs. Alcock was talking specifically about propaganda, but its ingredients for suc - cess are right in line with the transmission of all false beliefs. They appeal to emotions and to existing fears and preju - dices, the cultural context of who we consider to be more \"trustworthy\" regardless of the content of their words, and our propensity to accept the first thing we hear about a sub - ject as the truth. All this and more make all of us vulnerable. \"Even we have made some real boo-boos when it came to crit - ical thinking in our own lives.\" At the special lunch pre - sentation, virologist Paul Offit recounted several of his ex - periences with the media and doing battle with vaccine de - niers. But early in his talk he also happened to repeat the theme of the day. \"Be sympa - thetic, no matter how trying the circumstances.\" Lesson, I hope, learned.Improving the Narrative: Enlightenment and Illusions I want to believe. Not in UFOs but in the power of enlightenment and the bet - ter angels of our nature. I want to believe that humans have the power to overcome the limitations of our nar - rowly focused senses and use our squishy little brains to bring ever-improving well being to the people with whom we share this mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. Steven Pinker believes, and he has two books full of evidence to back it up. In an era when everything looks to be blatantly and obvi - ously going terribly wrong, Pinker's optimistic message is the ultimate contrarian take of our time. Is he right? (By the way, with this report is a picture of him shaking Bill Nye's hand that I just happened to catch at just the right moment. You're welcome.) Well, he's not wrong about the things that have gotten better. It's unmistak - able, in measure after mea - sure, in almost every way one can think to gauge the well-being of our species, things are looking up. Now, you have to zoom back at least a few decades, if not a few centuries or millennia, to see the trend lines move in a positive direction, but up they indeed go. But it doesn't feel like it, does it?Let's put Pinker's pre - sentation at CSICon 2018 aside for the moment and jump to the mind-bending demonstration of visual il - lusions presented by Susana Martinez-Conde and Ste - phen Macknik. These two neuroscientists provided ex - ample after example of how just unbelievably awful we are at perceiving the world as it actually exists. Oh, you thought that was a set of circles? Nope! It was squares. OR WAS IT??? Now they're actually squir - cles. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN??? Or: Oh, you thought those balls were rolling up toward the top of a ramp all by themselves? Nope! You were just looking at it wrong, and they were really rolling down like balls ought to do. See it now? OF COURSE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN WON'T LET YOU . And as we rub our sore, sprained brains, Stephen Macknik taunts us with ob - servations such as, \"Looks good. Shouldn't. Does.\" It all kind of went like that. As Macknik put it, \"Y our brain would rather defy the laws of physics than show you the world as it really is.\" In an era when everything looks to be blatantly and obviously going terribly wrong, Pinker's optimistic message is the ultimate contrarian take of our time. Bill Nye \"The Science Guy\" shaking hands with Steven Pinker. Deborah Hyde Photo: Paul Fidalgo18 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer 2018Well that sounds like a lot of people with enormous power that I know. \"The brain is lim - ited,\" said Susana Marti - nez-Conde, \"and we don't have the resources to process the vast amount of sensory data that comes in.\" In other words, it's hope - less! We simply cannot per - ceive reality in full. We can approach it, can approximate it, and come to a collective consensus about it. But as Macknik said, \"We're con - stantly just sliding on the ice.\" So here's the Pinker-esque \"turns out\" moment about all this. Our brains evolved to best handle all this sensory data to our benefit. After all, a brain can only get so big and demand so many calo - ries. So it makes do. When there are blanks in what we can perceive, our brain tries to fill them in. It looks for structure, making the bet that a structure exists at all. It \"improves narratives.\" Oh, now that's interesting, isn't it? \"Improves narratives.\" Let's let our limited brains churn on that for a moment. At the beginning of the afternoon, we heard from Deborah Hyde on the sub - ject of vampires and how on earth people ever came to invent and believe in such things. As is often the case with such things, many of our ideas about vampires can be traced to attempts to explain what we otherwise could not: disturbing behavior, claims of night visitations, deforming diseases, and death. Putting herself in the shoes of some medieval European trying to explain some odd activities, she mused, \"What shall we do? These people are doing some really weird shit.\" So the myth of vampires developed to fill in these gaps, to find a structure, to improve the narrative. Susana Martinez-Conde, one of the neuroscientists, said, \"Illusions are part and parcel of how we see the world.\" The question remains: Are things actually getting better? Right now, it really doesn't seem so. But perhaps that's because of the limita - tions of our brains. We can't possibly see the whole pic - ture. Not only can we not look at all peoples through - out history in a non-abstract way to get the \"correct\" per - spective, we can't even pro - cess the torrent of informa - tion we get about this very moment in time. Pinker also reminds us that we are all subject to a negativity bias (he used the example that people tend to think that tornadoes cause more deaths than asthma attacks when the opposite is true), and our information diet from the news is limited to stuff that did happen (a tornado killed some people), while never telling us about what didn't happen (another month with no deaths by tor - nado!). Unlike vampires, en - lightenment is not a myth, Pinker tells us. It is not only true, but it belongs to all of us. The benefits of reason, science, and humanism are empirically measurable, and we don't need to simply trust our lyin' eyes. You know, those same eyes that also told us the balls were rolling up when they were really rolling down. So maybe it's okay if we feel like things are out of control, even if they're not, because our brains need to fill in the gaps. We have to be careful not to go too far in our pessimism, or we start thinking that all news is fake news, that balls really do roll up, or that vampires stalk us in the night. Instead, we can temper our transitory dread with the gentle reminder that we aren't actually seeing the whole picture. And thanks to the tools we've forged with science, we can get better at grasping what is and is not so, improve our narrative in actual fact, and sense the progress that we are truly making. Are things actually getting better? Right now, it really doesn't seem so. But perhaps that's because of the limitations of our brains. Steven PinkerSkeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 19CONFERENCE REPORT It Has Always Been a Matter of Trust Whom do you trust? I sup - pose the default response of a skeptic could be \"no one,\" at least until particular claims can be verified. It may go without saying, however, that the answer \"no one\" also ap - plies to conspiracy theorists and others who buy into var - ious forms of pseudoscience. They also probably think that they are ready to trust someone once their claims have been verified. We just have different ideas of what constitutes \"verified.\" As we heard at CSICon 2018 from political science professor Joseph Uscinski, conspiracy thinking has be - come a major component of our public discourse, which is not news. But what might be news is his observation that conspiracy thinking cuts across all demographics: gen - der, age, class, and so on. If there's no demographic delineator, there does seem to be a line drawn between, bluntly, the winners and the losers. Those who feel they are on the outs in terms of power and influence are much more likely to buy into conspiracies than those who are not. When you don't trust the sincerity or intentions of the people in power, you're liable to buy into some fairly outlandish claims. So it seems that the cul - tivation of trust needs to be a priority for skeptics who want to see some sort of re -surgence of reason. Yvette d'Entremont (a.k.a. the SciBabe) has an approach that might be hard for some: being an open book. \"I need you to understand that there are people who do not want to be questioned for what they do,\" she said, speaking of the peddlers of harmful pseudoscientific nonsense. So if she's going to adopt a stance by which she ruth - lessly seeks the truth behind those who are not happy to be fact checked, she has to be willing to be open about herself as well. To make the point, she showed a progression of im - ages of herself, going from sans makeup to the full ap - plication of the \"SciBabe\" mask. \"This is part of my av - atar,\" she said, and by being open about the fact that it is an avatar, by offering trans - parency, she can begin to earn trust. Trust is earned in some pretty insidious ways by less-principled actors (\"ac - tors\" both in the sense of someone executing an action and in the sense of a person who plays pretend in front of people for a living). Tim - othy Caulfield, whose book is literally titled Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Ev - erything? , spoke to us about \"tokens of legitimacy,\" the gestures of credential that propagators of the dubious use to make people believe that they not only know what they're talking about, but that they know more than anyone with traditional (actual) cre - dentials. Celebrity endorsements are of course a major token of legitimacy, but it gets even more insidious, such as the fudging of resumes or stuff - ing sketchy journals with shoddy \"studies\" that claim to prove some product or thera - py's efficacy. These tokens of efficacy are more effective than one might think, because it's not as though they work only on people who \"don't know any better,\" as it were. Remem - ber, as Uscinski pointed out, conspiracy thinking does not discriminate. Kavin Senapathy, one of the new hosts of CFI's Point of Inquiry podcast, had an atheist upbringing and a life immersed in science, yet she was still vulnerable to the emotional appeals and the tokens of legitimacy from hucksters such as Dr. Oz. Today Senapathy is a re - spected skeptic leader, but there was a journey to be made to get here. \"Tribalism and dogma are the enemy,\" said Senap - athy, \"and religion is a sub - set.\" Tribalism and dogma, like conspiracy thinking, can infect any group, even those whose identity is based on fighting tribalism and dogma. To foster more trust Massimo PolidoroKavin Senapathy\"SciBabe\" Yvette d'Entremont20 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer 2018 in the skeptic point of view, skeptics need to be careful that they don't fall victim to their own biased tunnel vision. \"W e as skeptics must em - brace not only that data and evidence that we wield to champion our pet issues,\" she said, \"but data that affects all marginalized peoples.\" The experience of people outside of skeptics' majority demo - graphics (women and people of color, for example), said Senapathy, must not be dis - missed. Indeed, as we learned from zoologist Abby Hafer, a lot of the things even we smart, educated folks take for granted about gender, sex, and what's \"natural\" is really quite sad. (And what I learned about how male ducks behave toward females makes me very, very sad.) Likewise, Susan Blackmore, in a presentation on out-of- body experiences, urged us to avoid \"negative skepticism\" that seeks only to debunk or dismiss and shuts off curi - osity. There is so much in human (and nonhuman) experience to mine for new data! These messages aligned well with the presentation from Massimo Pigliucci on the perils of scientism, a stance in which science is ap - plied to domains to which it does not apply, and its superi - ority in those domains is as - serted. By allowing \"science\" to become so elastic that it comes to mean the pursuit of any knowledge having to do with facts spreads science too thin. Pigliucci said that we run the risk of over-prom - ising and under-delivering on science's power and im - portance. \"It's all a matter of trust,\" he said. \"The public has to trust science ... if we lose trust, we get in trouble.\" Susan Blackmore urged us to avoid \"negative skepticism\" that seeks only to debunk or dismiss and shuts off curiosity. Playing Gracefully with Ideas: Stephen Fry, Evolution, and Leonardo Massimo Polidoro de - scribed a certain someone as \"a precious jewel\" of a person, whose company and insights were sought by the wisest of leaders. This person \"swam upstream,\" eschewing fads and seeking to discover the truths and communicate those truths to others. This incredible human being ex - emplifies the term Renais - sance person . Polidoro was talking about Leonardo da Vinci (about whom he is writing a biography), but he could easily have been talking about two of the speakers in the Saturday afternoon pre - Timothy Caulfield addresses the audience. James Randi and Stephen FrySkeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 21CONFERENCE REPORT sentations at CSICon 2018. First there is the educa - tional powerhouse Bertha Vasquez, whose secret iden - tity is that of a mild-man - nered middle school science teacher but whose superhero persona is that of the director of CFI's Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science (TIES). According to Polidoro, Leonardo was among those figures of science who, like the best artists, were rebels. Just as Galileo confronted the dogma of a geocentric universe and Darwin up - ended any notion of humans as spontaneously created, so Vasquez fights in the most perilous of trenches for the integrity of science and the education of young Ameri - cans. Indeed, Vasquez has raised TIES up to become a pow - erful and prolific force for good, having put on over 100 workshops for middle school science teachers in forty-two states over just three years of existence. Vasquez will tell you that the content is what matters, that it's the material and in - formation provided in these workshops that prepares teachers to navigate the teaching and defense of evo - lution in the most culturally resistant areas (\"I have kids who turn their chairs to the walls when I teach evolution,\" she said to much shock), but watching her on stage at CSICon, it's clear that TIES also owes much of its success to the force of her presence and personality. Her enthusiasm for her subject is utterly contagious. Her drive to learn, discover, and share her knowledge is undeniable. She's a true Re - naissance woman. Another figure Polidoro might have been speaking of when he talked about the reverence Leonardo inspired in his contemporaries is the \"national treasure\" of En - gland, as Richard Dawkins called him, Stephen Fry. An internationally beloved actor, novelist, essayist, and even pi - oneering podcaster, Fry sat in conversation with Dawkins, lightly moderated by CFI's Nick Little, whom Eddie Tabash referred to as our \"su - per-lawyer.\" Prompted by Dawkins, Fry discussed the various ways different cultures throughout history have dealt with things such as myth and progress. (Fry's latest book is Mythos , a retelling of the Greek myths.) Holding the ancient Greeks as a kind of ideal, Fry noted how they seemed not to take their \"religion\" literally and valued a ceaseless cultivation of new ideas. When religion is treated as more allegorical, Fry said, the assignation of personality and will to forces beyond human comprehen - sion \"is as much art and liter - ature as it is religion.\" For the Greeks in partic - ular, Fry heralded a mode of thinking wherein gods and the heavens were ideals to strive for, not a literal descrip - tion of reality. Fry mused on the value of ritual and how the \"brand power\" of things such as religious institutions or the British monarchy can serve as symbols before which even those in power must humble and justify them - selves. Like Leonardo, Fry is certainly a Renaissance man. \"Skepticism really means alertness,\" he told the CSI - Con audience, advising us, \"Be alive to an idea. An idea is a living thing.\" Fry recalled the words of Oscar Wilde (whom Fry has played to great acclaim on film), who spoke of \"the ability to play gracefully with ideas.\" This is an ability he shares with Bertha Vasquez, who has the grace to inspire young minds and shepherd evolution education through the roughest terrain. To play gracefully with ideas is something to strive for indeed. As Polidoro said of Leonardo, so we hope it may be said of so many of us: \"He was a man who woke up very early, when every - one else around him was still asleep.\" Fry discussed the various ways different cultures throughout history have dealt with things such as myth and progress.

And we continue to ponder how simultaneously some inquiring people can achieve great, provable in - sights while others go off the rails into fringe science or pseudoscience or\u2014 worse\u2014antiscience or fake science. I am writing a book about science and pseudoscience (and antiscience). Throughout it, I attempt to contrast science and pseudoscience by describing actual science and how it works as well as the values that guide good science. (I include an entire chapter on \"The Values of Science,\" which are closely related to the values of skepticism I have talked about in this space before.) I feel strongly that by portraying the real adventure of real science and some of its astonishing findings\u2014and how we achieved them\u2014we can help others more clearly identify pseudoscience or bad science. And we can help people see where pseudoscience fails us and falls far behind, a kind of sterile (yet strangely appealing to some) intellec - tual garbage heap. That brings me to a related point that I think most skeptics appreciate. Our skepticism is always guided by the evidence, and that evidence is obtained by scientific thinking and empirical in - vestigation. While we might make mis -takes, we can't go too far off course if we stick closely to the methods and values of science and of good skeptical inves - tigation\u2014and then focus on the evi - dence. We combine the potent meth - ods of science and skeptical inquiry and emphasize the quality of the evidence (or lack of it). Now that is a powerful recipe for sifting out sense from non - sense, the real from the unreal, and for advancing real knowledge. I said we skeptics do it all. If you doubt that, just take a look at the va - riety of topics we've covered in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER in just the past year. They range from conspiracy the - ories to legitimizing woo; from facts and myths about Roswell seventy years later to a skeptics' guide to understand - ing and combatting racism; from claims of \"free energy\" to the troubling war on science and knowledge; from drug ther - apy hype to twenty-one reasons Noah's flood never happened; from acupunc - ture to homeopathy to vagina quackery; from the return of repressed memories to our weird inability to accept that things may be getting better (progres - sophobia); from wondering how much we should be concerned about recent flat-earth claims to a report of an ac - tual doctoral dissertation advocating a flat Earth\u2014and then to our own IIG group's demonstration of Earth's curva - ture to incredulous flat-earth believers; from multi-level marketing schemes to W e scientific skeptics, we skeptical inquirers, do it all. I am sure one of us somewhere is right now going after some extraordinary claim none of us has even heard of yet, studying it in depth and critiquing it with all the tools of science and skepticism. She\u2014or he\u2014will soon let the rest of us know the results (we hope in SI). Equally likely is that others are synthesizing complex information that might give us a better understanding of, say, how our brains work\u2014both to achieve brilliant creativity or to deceive or elude us.

Note that we cover both very specific claims that generate considerable popu -lar interest and much broader issues and common misconceptions that have wide social or cultural implications. We have always done that. We always will. Some readers are naturally interested more in one end of this spectrum. I get amused and bemused when a reader complains that we have seemingly changed some policy and gone a certain new direction he or she disagrees with. Just wait until our next issue, I want to answer. Our work has to be taken in total. Over sev - eral issues the topics we focus on and the approaches we take cover that entire broad spectrum. Another point: I submit that what - ever stereotypes other people may have about skeptics, they are wrong. And waaaay too narrow. You can't fit what we do into a neat box (or any box). We love science and discovery; we enjoy life; we have all sorts of outside inter - ests. Most of us are good-natured. And we like to get at the truth, as best as possible. Science is by far the best tool for that. Skepticism is a crucial part of sci - ence; it is a crucial part of everyday crit - ical thinking. Without it we couldn't long survive. And we who pursue it more seriously than the rest because we find it both interesting and very im - portant can come from any background, be of any gender, be young or old, or hail from any part of the world. It is inclusive: it is open to everyone. The only requirement is a commit - ment to science and reason, to evidence, and to the quest for truth. We like to get at the truth, as best as possible. Science is by far the best tool for that. Kendrick Frazier is editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER . This commentary is expanded and updated from his welcoming remarks at CSICon 2018 in Las Vegas.24 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerEmbracing Option D: Knowing When Y ou Don't Know BENJAMIN RADFORD One of the first steps to analyzing a photograph, and more broadly a claim, is carefully distinguishing between what is known , what is suspected , and what is assumed . The three are often casually lumped together, but parsing them out is important. Usually key premises are possibilities instead of established fact. Considering alternative explanations is another part of the process. If you've taken any standardized multiple-choice tests such as the GRE, LSAT, or ACT, you probably remem - ber that some of the questions offered a tricky option, usually after three or four possibly correct specific answers. This is some version of \"The answer cannot be determined from the information given.\" This response, often Option D, is designed in part to thwart guessing and to see when test-takers recognize that the question is insoluble or the premise incomplete. The principle can be generalized from a test question to a premise or assertion in the real world. It's diffi - cult for many people\u2014and especially experts, skeptics, and scientists\u2014to admit they don't know the answer to a question. Even if it's outside our exper - tise, we often feel as if not knowing (or even not having a defensible opinion) is a sign of ignorance or failure. Yet there are many examples in our everyday lives when we simply don't have enough information to reach a logical or valid conclusion about a given question, and often we don't recognize that fact. We routinely make decisions based on incomplete information, and unlike on tests, in the real world there are not always clear-cut objectively ver - ifiable answers to settle the matter. This is especially true online. Few people bother to chime in on social media discussions or threads to say that there's not enough information given in the original post to reach a valid conclusion. Social media practically requires that people express firm opin - ions\u2014but of course there's no require - ment that anyone actually know what they're talking about, no paragraph 86 in the Terms of Service affirming that any comments you make will be in - formed or even comprehensible. I thought about this recently when I saw a viral meme of a photo depicting a set of apartment doors in front of a wide set of exterior steps. The path in front of the door on the left-hand side of the photo had been cleared off, and there were a few inches of snow on the steps in front of the door on the right. One I am often asked to examine seemingly mysterious and inher - ently ambiguous photos. Usually the person asking has already settled\u2014sometimes tentatively, more often strongly\u2014on a spe - cific interpretation. They know what the photo shows and want my independent confirmation that their favored interpretation is cor - rect. That shadowy blur in the distant forest is a Bigfoot; that weird white orb\u2014complete with faint facial features if you just magnify enough\u2014is a ghost, and so on. One of the first steps to analyzing a photograph, and more broadly a claim, is carefully distinguishing between what is known , what is suspected , and what is assumed .Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 25typical caption read \"Please don't ever allow yourself to become the person on the left.\" Others added phrasing such as \"Taking selfishness to a new level!\" and hundreds or thousands of people com - plained about the lazy neighbor on the left, some adding idle speculation about the person's politics. This was not a quirky psychological test like the 2015 photo of a dress that was black and blue or white and gold depending on your priming and per - ception. Nor was it intentionally am - biguous and misleading, like a photo of blue-and-tan object that could be a a beach (or painted door edge) widely shared in early 2018. This was instead a seemingly straightforward candid photo depicting obviously inconsiderate be - havior. Had an identifiable tenant been mentioned or seen, he or she would likely have been publicly shamed online. As social media users are wont to do, they used the photo as an opportunity to signal their virtues and publicly reg - ister their dismay at the boorish world. A valuable lesson, to be sure ... but few pointed out that the correct answer might be Option D. I recognized a litany of assumptions people were making, including that both apartments were occupied (noth - ing in the photo suggests that anyone lived in the apartment on the right); that the person on the left had shov -eled the snow in front of their door (it could have been done by a maintenance worker or kind neighbor aware that no one lived in the apartment on the right); and so on. Maybe the neighbor on the left is elderly or infirm and could only shovel their own side. It's even possible that there is no \"person on the left\"\u2014 that both apartments are empty, but the building management planned to show the place on the left to a prospective tenant that day and asked maintenance to clear a path to that apartment. Could or should whoever shoveled the left side have done the right as well? Probably. Maybe. I don't know, and nei - ther do you. No one is suggesting in - ferring zebras instead of horses from hoofbeats; a lazy neighbor is certainly a plausible explanation, but it's hardly the only one. Alternative Explanations We don't really have enough informa - tion about the circumstances of the photo, and it seems no one bothered to track down the source for more information. Why would they, when the photo seems so self-evident? In the beach/door illusion mentioned earlier, the photographer enjoyed the publicity before revealing it was in fact of a beach; the orientation had been changed and photo lightly manipulated to mask its identity.The reactions to the snowy steps image highlighted the desire to make moral judgments about people we don't know based on incomplete information. We can talk about what we would have done\u2014or what we think we would have done\u2014but we don't know the circum - stances. That car zooming past you on the road might be a jerk\u2014or he might be rushing to the hospital with his preg - nant wife or bleeding child in the back seat. That panhandler asking for change might be too lazy to get a job\u2014or he might have some unseen disability that keeps him from holding one down. We make prejudiced assumptions about people and their actions all the time, and we may in fact be right. But unless we get more information, we can't know . Choosing Option D isn't admitting ignorance; it's the opposite. Recognizing that we don't have enough information to reach a valid conclusion demonstrates a deeper and nuanced understanding of the issue. Noting that a premise needs more evidence or information to com - plete a logical argument and reach a valid conclusion is a form of skepticism. Anyone can choose options A through C on a test or pick a side of some online outrage fest. But not everyone can rec - ognize when they can't know. As social media users are wont to do, they used the photo as an opportunity to signal their virtues and publicly register their dismay at the boorish world. Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER and research fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Noting that a premise needs more evidence or information to complete a logical argument and reach a valid conclusion is a form of skepticism.26 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerAt the turn of the twentieth cen - tury in Wyoming, the \"range wars\" claimed many victims, among them fourteen-year-old Willie Nickell (yes, one of my distant cous - ins).1 This is the story of his murder and the hanging of his killer\u2014a leg - endary lawman and now \"ghost.\" It begins over a quarter of a century ear - lier in my home county of Morgan in eastern Kentucky. The Range Wars In 1875, Willie's father Kelsey P . \"Kels\" (or \"Kelse\") Nickell went west from his Kentucky home to join the U.S. Cavalry, spending much of his time there as an Indian fighter. In fact, his company was encamped just fifty miles south of the Little Big Horn River on June 26, 1876, when General George Armstrong Custer and his men were massacred. Kels Nickell was one of two troopers dispatched to recon - noiter the site, and he reported the overwhelming stench of dead men and horses. Following his discharge in 1880, he opened a blacksmith shop at Camp Carlin, Wyoming, and the next year married a young woman named Mary Mahoney, who, like her husband, was of Irish descent. They homesteaded a ranch at Iron Mountain where they eventually raised eight chil - dren (Nickell 1998).In time, the Nickell family became embroiled in a range war between open- range cattlemen on the one hand and sheepherders and homesteaders on the other. The violence involved vigilante slayings of suspected cattle rustlers and altercations between individuals. In one such incident in 1890, Kels Nickell was charged with \"cutting and wounding in attempt to kill\" a cattle baron named John C. Coble. Coble's cattle had over - run Nickell's land, and the men quar - reled. Another man and Coble, armed with a rock, pursued Nickell, who de - fended himself. He was jailed, but the charges were eventually dismissed and hard feelings continued. At a meeting of big ranchers, a proposal to lynch Nickell was voted down, but other plans were discussed. All the while Nickell, who knew of the meeting, sat inside the door of his cabin with his rifle across his knees (Nickell 1998; Ball 2014, 170-172). The unsolved slayings of two ranch - ers and as many suspected cattle rustlers were followed in July 1901 by a warn - ing note posted on Kels Nickell's ranch gate: \"Take your sheep and get out, or meet the same fate as Matt Rash and Isam Dart\" (the alleged rustlers) (Nic - kell 1998). Murder from Ambush Just eight days later, on July 18, 1901, Kels Nickell's fourteen-year-old son Willie set out on an errand, wearing a hat and coat and riding his father's horse. He failed to return, and the next morning his younger brother discov - ered his blood-soaked body at the open gate. Willie had been shot in the back, [ INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE N ICKEL L Joe Nickell, PhD, is, like Tom Horn, a former Pinkerton detective. This is his fiftieth year as a paranormal investigator. He became CSI's senior research fellow in 1995. The Saga of T om Horn Is the Hanged Man's Ghost Still at Large? Tom Horn braiding a rope in the Laramie County jail office in Cheyenne, 1902. Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 27almost certainly mistaken for his father. Funeral services for the boy were held on Sunday, July 21. Kels Nickell knelt by the open grave and vowed to avenge the death. An inquest was held the follow - ing day, and the three physicians who had performed the autopsy testified that Willie had been shot twice and that the bullets\u2014which were not recovered\u2014 were apparently of large caliber. A sur - veyor who had diagrammed the crime scene concluded the killer laid in wait at a distance of about 200 feet. At the inquest, the name of a cattlemen's hired gun elicited much discussion. Then, several days later on August 4, Kels Nickell was himself shot at from ambush. As he ran a zig-zagging course toward the safety of his home, he was hit in the arm, side, and hip. His young - est daughter had been with him but was unscathed; the would-be assassin, obvi - ously a good shot, was not shooting at her. Nickell's brother-in-law got him to a hospital in Cheyenne, saving his life. Had it been Kels who had been killed and not Willie, the crime might have gone unsolved. Kels has been de - scribed as \"red-headed and combative,\" with \"an uncanny ability to offend just about every neighbor\" (Ball 2014, 263). But the murder of the boy provoked an immediate clamor for justice. The public outcry persuaded the Laramie County sheriff to enlist the aid of the deputy U.S. marshal for southern Wy -oming, Joseph LeFors. Marshal LeFors went on leave to devote time to solving the murder. Although the first suspects in the case were neighbors with whom Kels Nickell had feuded, Jim Miller and his two sons, they were soon eliminated from suspicion. Not only did they have an alibi, but LeFors had examined the scene after Kels's wounding and found hoof prints of a single horse. These led through a gate, onto a road, and in a direction away from, not toward, the Miller residence. LeFors's attention was now drawn to the hired gun whose name had come up at the inquest. The man, reportedly bragging of his deeds, was something of a legend in his own time. His name was Tom Horn. (The name would eventually be given to a Hollywood movie starring Steve Mc - Queen in the title role.) The Investigation Tom Horn was the quintessential cowboy: a former trail-herd crewman, prospector, Army Indian fighter, and interpreter\u2014serving as such at the sur - render of Geronimo (Ball 2014, 11-98). Afterward, he had apparently worked as a hired gun, then underwent training to become a full-time \"operative\" of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. However he was fired for being too rough (Siringo 1927, 240)\u2014or as he said in his autobiography, \"My work for them was ... too tame for me\" (Horn 1904, 259-263). Following service in the Spanish American War, he went to Cheyenne to recuperate from Yellow Fever\u2014courtesy of John Coble (with whom Kels Nickell had fought). There, often given to drink, he revealed a dark side to his personality (Ball 2014, 199-217, 251; Raine 1949, 89). The gunslinger had drawn attention to himself from his association with Coble and his reported bragging about killing people. Marshal LeFors was as - sisted in the Willie Nickell murder case by a female Pinkerton operative hired by prosecutor Walter Stoll. She had first posed as a reporter, roaming the Iron Mountain country, although the ter - rorized folk mostly refused to talk. She next played the role of LeFors's wife, and the two sleuths pursued a woman believed to have information. When they got her alone and plied her with her favorite highballs, she told how she had carried sandwiches to Tom Horn as he lay in hiding for his quarry to come into his sights. To attempt to cinch the evidence, Marshal LeFors developed a clever strategy. An acquaintance of Horn, he wrote to him on the pretext of helping him seek employment as a \"stock detec - tive\" to chase rustlers. Horn accepted LeFors's invitation to meet with him in Cheyenne. It was January 1902, some six months after the murder of Willie. To carry out his plan, LeFors secretly placed a deputy sheriff and court ste - nographer in a room adjoining the sheriff 's office. After drinks at a saloon, the pair retired to the office where they could, supposedly, talk more privately. Horn was in an expansive mood. As he bragged to someone he thought a like-minded individual (both men had been range detectives), LeFors skillfully steered the conversation to the slaying of Willie Nickell, and Tom Horn made highly incriminating statements. These were secretly recorded in shorthand by court reporter Charles Ohnhaus. For example: LEFORS: Have you got your money yet for the killing of [Willie] Nickell? HORN: I got that before I did the job. LEFORS: You got $600 for that. Why did you cut the price?In time, the Nickell family became embroiled in a range war between open-range cattlemen on the one hand and sheepherders and homesteaders on the other. The violence involved vigilante slayings and altercations.LeFors's attention was now drawn to the hired gun whose name had come up at the inquest. The man, reportedly bragging of his deeds, was something of a legend in his own time. His name was Tom Horn.28 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerHORN: I got $2,100. LEFORS: How much is that a man? HORN: That is for three dead men, and one man shot at five times. Kill - ing men is my specialty. I look at it as a business proposition, and I think I have a corner on the market. Stenographer Ohnhaus worked throughout the night to transcribe and type the ostensible confession. Sheriff Smalley obtained a warrant the follow - ing morning, Monday, January 13, 1902, and he and the undersheriff found Horn at the Palace Hotel. Smalley walked up casually and said \"Hello,\" as he quickly yanked Horn's pistol out of his waist - band. The outlaw detective was imme - diately taken to the Laramie County Jail\u2014where he would spend the re - mainder of his life, twenty-two months (Ball 2014, 282-309). Justice Done At Horn's surprisingly short trial (October 10-24), Prosecutor Stoll introduced a blood-stained sweater Horn had accidentally left at a store in Laramie. He had ridden there hur - riedly following the murder in an apparent attempt to give himself an alibi. In addition to the stenographi - cally recorded admission of Horn to LeFors, there was testimony of a wit - ness that Horn had bragged to him: \"I am the main guy in that Nickell case. ... That was the best God damned shot I ever made. ...\"The jury returned its verdict on October 24: \"Guilty of murder in the first degree.\" On November 12, Judge Richard H. Scott, denying the defense's motion for a new trial, sentenced Horn to death by hanging. Both the Wyo - ming Supreme Court and the gover - nor (after a thorough review) denied Horn's appeal. Horn had not helped his case by briefly escaping (on August 9, 1903). His head grazed by a bullet and surrounded by citizens, he gave up and was returned to jail (Ball 2014, 300, 332-398, 405). On November 20, 1903, the court's sentence was finally carried out, de - spite rumors that the prisoner would be sprung from jail. Horn's last visitor had been John Coble who, the Denver Post had reported, had attempted to coerce his ranch hands into falsely tes - tifying for Horn; his foreman resigned instead. Kels Nickell had been refused permission to witness the hanging, but he was wisely allowed to view the body afterward at the mortician's to quench other rumors of a substitute having been hanged. Paranormalities From the time of Willie Nickell's mur - der, the fame\u2014or infamy\u2014of Tom Horn has attracted paranormal and other pseudoscientific claims. Some of his admirers were so desperate to set him free that they not only made false confessions\u2014but also appeals to mystical thinking. For example, Denver clairvoyant Frank D. Hinds sent the governor a copy of a \"Psychometric test and Psychic message.\" Hinds reported that he had received a visitation\u2014not from a ghost but from some alleged psychic extension of the killer, described as \"a dark com - plected youth ... , age 22, height five feet seven and one-fourth inches, weight one hundred and forty-four pounds.\" A skeptic observed at the time that the alleged specter suspiciously resembled a Nickell neighbor, one of the Miller boys\u2014an obvious attempt to throw suspicion elsewhere. Graphologists\u2014purveyors of the pseudoscience of divining character from handwriting (Nickell 1996, 17- 22)\u2014have weighed in at various times. Perhaps the earliest was Louise Rice, who believed that Horn's pen move - ments showed him \"affectionate, loyal, and kind-hearted.\" She was emphatic that \"the hanging of such a man was un - just.\" On the other hand (so to speak), a later analyst concluded that Horn's script revealed he \"acted on impulse, sometimes violently,\" and was a \"discon - tented man\" who harbored considerable \"resentment.\" The diviner continued, \"Horn had a conscience and knew right from wrong,\" although his \"urge to in - flict injury was difficult to restrain\" (qtd. in Ball 2014, 452). The purely superstitious have called attention to the number 13, which supposedly influenced Horn's fate. For example, it was observed that Judge Scott\u2014in presenting instructions to jurors\u2014provided fifteen points for the defense but, for the prosecution, a fate - ful thirteen. And newspapers claimed that Friday the 13ths were conspicuous in Tom Horn's final days (Ball 2014, 360, 452). In fact, however, during 1901, 1902, and 1903, we discover there were just six such dates (respectively two, one, and three for those years), and none was associated with significant events in the case\u2014not, for example, the murder of Willie, the wounding of his father, the secretly recorded confession, Horn's ar - rest, jury selection, trial commencement, verdict, death sentence, Horn's failed jailbreak, or his hanging. The closest Friday the 13th connection would ap - pear to have been that of November 13, 1903, but it was only the day before the governor denied Horn's appeal. Such at - tempts to fit evidence to a preconceived notion\u2014typically involving counting the hits and ignoring the misses\u2014is From the time of Willie Nickell's murder, the fame\u2014or infamy\u2014of Tom Horn has attracted paranormal and other pseudoscientific claims.Graphologists\u2014purveyors of the pseudoscience of divining character from handwriting\u2014have weighed in at various times.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 29called confirmation bias (Nickell 2012, 12). No doubt the most enduring super - stitious belief involving Horn is that his ghost was unleashed by the gallows. Not long after the hanging, the Daily Leader hyped, \"Ghostly sounds Disturb Prison - ers in County Jail and suggest Phantom Hanging\"; perhaps imagination simply got the best of prisoners, none of whom wanted \"to live in a dead man's quarters.\" Iron Mountain folk reportedly saw the ghost of both Willie Nickell and Tom Horn, the latter reportedly \"condemned by his misdeeds to ride his old range forever\" (Ball 2014, 424, 452). These tales incorporate common folklore mo - tifs (or story elements), including \"gal - lows ghost,\" \"noises caused by ghost,\" \"murderer cannot rest in grave,\" \"mur - dered person cannot rest in grave,\" and so on (Thompson 1989, 428, 439, 441, 442). Furthermore, the power of sugges - tion was employed in folk practice when mothers adopted Horn as a bogeyman, invoking his name against children's misbehavior, as in \"Hush, or Tom Horn will get you\" (Ball 2014, 452). More recent accounts are recorded. Cheyenne's Wrangler Western Store\u2014 in a landmark three-story building dat - ing from 1882\u2014is allegedly one haunt - ing site. According to Haunted Cheyenne (Pope 2013, 44), \"a cowboy ghost\" is seen there, coming up from the base - ment and wandering around the first and second floors. The specter \"must be Tom,\" says the manager, since Horn \"apparently was held in the basement of the Wrangler while awaiting his trial ...\" (Landreth 2013). In fact, however, as penned in Sheriff Smalley's record book, Horn was lodged in the Laramie County Jail on Monday, January 13, 1902\u2014the day of his arrest\u2014and (ex - cept for the brief jailbreak) remained there in an upper-level cell until he was hanged (Ball 2014, 309-310). The Wrangler's ghost must be an impostor. The hanged man's gravesite\u2014lo - cated in Columbia Cemetery in Boul - der, Colorado (where his brother Charles lived)\u2014has also been claimed to be haunted. According to a pre-Hal - loween article in Colorado Daily (Kale 1999), \"Word has it that western-era Boulderite Tom Horn (who was hung for his crimes), can still be seen swing - ing from the trees of the cemetery.\" Ac - companying the text is a photo of the grave that shows a transparent cowboy ghost. Of course Horn was hanged not \"hung,\" and the photo was deliberately faked (its credit line acknowledges the \"model\" and the supplier of the \"cowboy outfit\"). I visited the gravesite in 1998, taken there by some local Rocky Mountain Skeptics, including my old friend Bela Scheiber. I had been visiting the area, and we were having breakfast in an old mining-hall-turned-restaurant in the foothills of the Rockies. While eat - ing my huevos rancheros , I was asked if I knew who Tom Horn was. Leaning across the table, I replied with mock intensity, \"Tom Horn murdered my cousin!\" \"Oh, that's right,\" the startled skeptic responded. \"He killed a Nick - ell boy!\" And so we agreed to go to the cemetery so I could begin to investigate the alleged haunting site and carry out a little ritual. As it happened, I was still recovering from having badly broken my leg in Spain, so I could only manage a sort of hop and skip, but we all agreed I had \"danced on Tom Horn's grave.\" It somehow seemed appropriate. Note 1. William \"Willie\" Nickell was a son of Kels Nickell who was, in turn, a son of John Desha Nickell (himself a murder victim during the Civil War). Willie's great-grandfather, Joseph, and my fourth-great-grandfather, John, were brothers (sons of Joseph Sr.). Willie was my third cousin twice removed. References Ball, Larry D. 2014.

His website is at www.massimopolidoro.com.[ NOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO The Mind of Leonardo da Vinci, Part 1 This year marks the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci, the \"uni - versal genius\" and, since I have been working a lot on him (two of my books in Italian on Leonardo just came out, and I am lecturing everywhere about him), I thought I would share with my readers some glimpses into the mind of this extraordinary man. The First Drawing Look at the drawing reproduced on this page. It is considered the old - est surviving drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. It was drawn in 1473 and depicts a Tuscan landscape, maybe near Vinci, the small town close to Florence where Leonardo was born. This draw - ing is considered the first \"pure\" land -scape in Western art: a landscape that is drawn not to be the background of some religious scene or a portrait. It is the first time (at least the first doc - umented occasion) where a landscape was drawn just for the sake of it. Y ou can see that it was drawn quickly but with a precise hand: there are hills, trees, some castles in the distance, and water. Water especially is something that fascinated Leonardo for all of his life, and it's already here, in his first drawing. But what is also interesting is the writing on the back of the drawing. In Leonardo's backward handwriting it says: \"I, staying with Anthony, am happy.\" (Anthony was probably the hus - band of Leonardo's mother.) It was, in fact, his grandparents who raised him, even though his parents were both alive; this fact is a key to understanding his upbringing and his very original way of thinking. A Masterpiece of Nature You see? We have barely started, and Leonardo's extraordinary story has already taken us! And Leonardo da Vinci is truly an extraordinary figure. His name is enough to immediately evoke a kaleido - Leonardo da Vinci's name is enough to immediately evoke a kaleidoscope of images that have become icons of our times.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 31scope of images that have become icons of our times: The Mona Lisa , the Vit- ruvian Man , the Last Supper , the Lady with an Ermine , etc. And then there are his anatomical studies, his inventions, the parachute, the submarine, the wings to fly, etc. When he was still alive, he was al - ready considered not only a genius but a masterpiece of nature. Every contem - porary biographer described him as a beautiful man in appearance, engaging, elegant, with a fascinating ability to en - chant and entertain his audience. They could listen for hours to his reasoning and his stories, and he was also a great musician: he could play the lyre and compose and sing improvised verses on the spot\u2014a reason every powerful man wanted him at his side. Raphael, who was younger and greatly admired him, put Leonardo at the center of his School of Athens , the fa -mous fresco in the pope's apartment at the Vatican, and he drew him as Plato, the greatest of all philosophers. Because Leonardo did not limit himself to just brilliant painting but also studied na - ture\u2014from the human body to the stars\u2014many critiqued him for wasting his time. The King of France, Francis I, wanted Leonardo all for himself in the last years of the artist's life, even though he had stopped painting. Francis wanted him near just to have the opportunity of conversing with what he considered to be the greatest mind that ever lived. According to legend, Francis was holding Leonardo when he died, for there could be no other possible death for such a man than to breathe his last in the embrace of the king himself. Celestial Influences? The legends started right after Leonardo's death, when he was quickly transformed into a real-life godlike figure. Giorgio Vasari, who was not a great painter but notable for being the first art historian, was only eight years old when Leonardo died, but he had the chance to meet many who knew Leonardo. In his book on the lives of the great artists, Vasari describes Leonardo almost as a supernatural being: The greatest gifts are often seen, in the course of nature, rained by celes - tial influences on human creatures; and sometimes, in supernatural fash - ion, beauty, grace, and talent are united beyond measure in one single person, in a manner that to whatever such an one turns his attention, his every action is so divine, that, sur - passing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing bestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired by human art. This was seen by all mankind in Leonardo da Vinci. For Vasari and many others after him, if Leonardo had so many talents it was thanks to the \"celestial influ - ences,\" because God himself chose him and favored him. Later, in the nineteenth century, there would be others seriously claiming that Leon - ardo had signed a pact with the devil. But for those who do not believe in supernatural intervention, the fun - damental question remains: How could Leonardo become an immortal figure, still recognized today, 500 years after his death, as the symbol of universal ge - nius? What was his way of thinking that made him so original? Swimming Upstream A defining trait was Leonardo's ten - dency to swim upstream. He was an illegitimate son; his father, a notary public in Florence, had him after a short romance with a girl from Vinci named Caterina. He did not marry her, since he was already promised to a girl from a wealthy family in Florence. Leonardo was raised by his grand - parents and had no formal academic education, for illegitimate sons could not follow a regular course of studies and could not be admitted in the notary public's guild. He was always described as very elegant, but he did not follow fads. He was left-handed, a homosex - ual, and probably a vegetarian\u2014perhaps the first vegetarian recorded in Western history. Leonardo really seems to be the por - trait of everything that is opposite to what was considered to be proper be - havior in his times (and probably today there still are some who would greatly disapprove of him). But it is this char - acteristic\u2014the fact that he did not go with the flow and was quite secure in his choices\u2014that made him unique. And, as we shall see in the next issue, even before science became what we know it to be today, he was already a scientist. When Leonardo was still alive, he was already considered not only a genius but a masterpiece of nature.Because Leonardo did not limit himself to just brilliant painting but also studied nature\u2014from the human body to the stars\u2014many critiqued him for wasting his time.32 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer[ REALITY IS THE BEST MEDICINE HARRIET HALL Harriet Hall, MD, also known as \"The SkepDoc,\" is a retired family physician, a CSI fellow, and an editor of the Science-Based Medicine blog. Her website is www.skepdoc.info. Fake News about Health Products One of my biggest pet peeves is advertisements for bogus health-related products decep - tively presented as news stories. These appear regularly in many newspa - pers, including my own local paper the Tacoma News Tribune , and they typically fill a half page. They usually include the words advertisement or paid advertisement in small print that is easy to miss. In every other way\u2014format, typeface, appearance, reporter byline, pictures, organizational affiliations, and so on\u2014these fake news stories are indistinguishable from real news stories. It got to the point that I opened the daily paper dreading to see how many of these fake news stories it contained. Oc - casionally I found none, but most days there were one, two, or even three of them. I started keeping a list. I got angry enough to critique a few of them in ar - ticles on the Science-Based Medicine website. They were a constant aggrava - tion. Then one day I realized the news - paper had raised the subscription rates and my credit card was being charged $82.34 every month. I had been paying nearly $3 a day for very little real news and way too much fake news. I'd had enough! I cancelled my subscription. They didn't want me to go. They of - fered to reduce the subscription rates. That just made me angrier. If they could reduce the rates, why hadn't they already done that? They kept insisting. They re- ally wanted me back. Finally, they asked how much I would be willing to pay. I told them I didn't want it at any price (I should have asked if they would be will -ing to pay me ). I no longer get the daily paper. I don't miss it. My life is more tranquil now, and my blood pressure is lower. But it still annoys me that naive readers are being fooled by fake news. Fake Reporters Many of the fake news articles name the reporter in a byline. I had not heard of any of them, and a Google search did not recognize any of these individuals as reporters with credible reputations for writing about health or science. In fact, it had no information about most of them. Do these people even exist? Are they pseudonyms? Invented names for nonexistent people? Hacks for hire? In one example posted online a fake news story is printed right alongside a real news story by a repu - table, prize-winning medical journalist, Marilynn Marchione. If the newspaper doesn't recognize the difference, how can readers be expected to? Fake Organizations Many of the fake news stories are at tributed to organizations with credible- sounding names, such as National Media Syndicate, Associated Health Press, Health News Service, National Network Media, National News Syndicate, and National Health Syndicate. These organizations either don't exist or are copycat variations intended to be confused with actual reputable news organizations such as the Associated Press wire service. Many of the fake news stories are attributed to organizations with credible-sounding names.

Dr. Al Sears has developed and sells bogus health products featured in fake news ads.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 33Co-Opting Dr. Oz I have now spotted the same picture in four different fake news stories that are actually ads for four different products developed and sold by Dr. Al Sears, an MD who practices \"integra - tive medicine\" and is a self-proclaimed anti-aging specialist. The picture shows Dr. Sears and Dr. Mehmet Oz photo - graphed together at a health and well - ness festival in Florida. The picture is evidence that they were there together but nothing more; the stories are careful not to make any further claims. But it is obvious that they want readers to assume that Dr. Oz endorses Dr. Sears's prod - ucts. I don't think he does. The four products are Re-Nourish, Restore, Omega Rejuvenol, and Ultra Accel. \"Baldness Reversed in Clinical Trial: New Hair Sprouts in 30 days,\" touts one headline. Re-Nourish is a spray to reverse baldness that was allegedly developed by Dr. Sears based on a discovery by the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. That's very misleading. A doctor at Harvard examined hundreds of substances in the pipeline that nour - ishes stem cells and found one of them so important that he went on record as saying, \"Without it, you're dead in 30 seconds!\" The clinical trial was of niacin; Re-Nourish itself has not been clinically tested. Dr. Sears offers stem cell treat - ments, but Re-Nourish is not a stem cell product; it only contains ingredients said to nourish stem cells. It is highly unlikely that Dr. Oz would endorse anything to do with new, untested stem cell treatments, since he has spoken out strongly against stem cell clinics that offer expensive, unproven treatments. And the article he wrote on hair-loss treatments doesn't mention stem cells or niacin or Re-Nourish. It concluded, \"The only product on the market that is absolutely proven to work and FDA approved is Minoxidil.\" Restore: \"Better than Botox: Takes 10 Years Off Your Face in Just 10 Min - utes.\" This cream uses a special delivery system to supply nutrients that allegedly eliminate fine lines and wrinkles perma - nently. The fake news story references a clinical trial of Madonna lily leaf stem cell extract that improved skin lumi - nance and tone around the eyes. The Restore product itself has never been clinically tested. \"CoQ10's Failure Leaves Millions Wanting\" and \" World's #2 Smart - est Man Reveals Secret 'Genius Pill.'\" These are both fake news stories about Omega Rejuvenol, an anti-aging and brain-boosting supplement based on omega-3 from krill and squid oils. As I explained in my Science-Based Medi - cine article, Dr. Sears makes exaggerated claims for its benefits, but his claims are not supported by evidence. The product Ultra Accel II is al - legedly a \"youth-restoring pill\" that could increase the human life span to 146 years (I wish!). There are some pre - liminary results indicating benefits for mice but no scientific evidence to sup - port any claims for human benefits. Dr. Sears's Modus Operandi On the HighYa website, a review of Dr. Sears explains how he works: [He] takes 1 or 2 studies that: May not have been peer reviewed. May conflict with the wealth of other clinical studies already com - pleted. May not ever have been repeated. May not have even been per - formed on humans, or in some instances, were performed only in a Petri dish. ... and then extrapolates this to reach some conclusion that's far out - side the scope of the trials he's refer - encing. Other Fake Pictures Most of the fake news stories are illus - trated by photographs that are probably stock photo images. Some are generic pictures of doctors and patients. Some say \"models are used in all photos to protect privacy.\" Some are pictures of pills that bear no resemblance to the pills being advertised. Pictures are good for getting the reader's attention, but they just add to the confusion. Fake Information Some of the statements in the fake news articles are false; others are mis - leading. They offer testimonials. They report animal and test tube study results that may not apply to humans. They report positive results in clinical studies, but these are usually studies of a single ingredient rather than of the product itself or even of the mixture of ingredients in the product. The results are far from impressive, and they neglect to mention other studies that were negative. They post X-rays and illustrations that do not depict what they claim to show. The products in these fake news sto - ries are alternative medicine treatments, usually dietary supplements.

He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.[ BEHAVIOR & BELIEF STUART VYSE An Artist with a Science-Based Mission Janyce Boynton is a Maine collage artist who sells her work through her website (www.pineconeand sparrow.com/) and at local shows, but she is also a tireless advocate for science. She would never have pre - dicted that science and skepticism would become such an important part of her life, but something happened to her over twenty years ago that set her on this path. My first contact with Boynton was probably about ten years ago. I was a psychology professor at a liberal arts college when I got a message from Boynton identifying herself as the \"fa - cilitator in the W______1 case\" and of - fering to speak to my class. She must have known that I would understand what that meant, and although I did not follow up with her at the time, it is clear to me now that she was well into her personal mission at that point. It has been a long and, at times, difficult journey. In the early 1990s, Boynton was a speech therapist working in Maine. One of the students she worked with was a non-speaking high school girl with au - tism whom I will call Wendy. An educa - tional technician who also worked with Wendy introduced her to a new com - munication technique called facilitated communication (FC). The technician had been trained in the method and was using it with Wendy with great success. As readers of this column will re - call (see \"Autism Wars,\" November/ December 2018), FC is based on the theory that many people with profound language deficits suffer from a physical problem\u2014an inability to produce the sounds for speech or the movements required for writing or typing\u2014but are not cognitively impaired. According to this theory, these individuals can't get their ideas out of their broken bodies. FC supporters claim this problem can be solved by having another person\u2014a facilitator\u2014hold the student's hand or arm and guide it over a keyboard. If the facilitator could just steady the non-speaking person's hand, the intelli - gence hidden within could emerge. Fa - cilitated communication spread rapidly, and with the help of their facilitators, many previously non-speaking people began writing poetry and performing at grade level in school. Some of Wendy's teachers were skeptical of the technique, but after getting some training from the educa - tional technician, Boynton gave it a try. The results were remarkable. This stu - dent who had never spoken a word was now typing out intelligible sentences and carrying on conversations. Boyn - ton had some initial doubts about her technique and whether she was influ - encing what Wendy said, but she dealt with that uncertainty by getting formal training in FC at a workshop offered at Janyce Boynton with one of her collages. FC is based on the theory that many people with profound language deficits suffer from a physical problem but are not cognitively impaired.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 37a local university. She came back from the training feeling more confident that she was doing it right and that the words typed on the keyboard were com - ing from Wendy. All of this was fine until one day Boynton was working with Wendy in her office, and Wendy typed out some messages that suggested she had been sexually abused. Boynton found this quite concerning and reported it to Wendy's special education teacher, who set in motion the school system's stan - dard protocol for cases of reported sexual abuse. Wendy was interviewed by a po - lice officer and a Department of Human Services (DHS) counselor, with Boynton serving as her facilitator, and in response to more specific questions from the DHS counselor, Wendy typed out very graphic descriptions of sexual abuse. After this interview, Wendy and her brother were removed from their parents' home, and an attorney was as - signed as guardian ad litem for W endy . The guardian focused in on the central question: Who is doing the typing? Are the words coming from Boynton or Wendy? The question was relevant because the two were always in physical contact: Boynton was guiding Wendy's hand. Boynton believed that the words were all coming from Wendy and that she was just there to steady Wendy's hand, but now that there were accusa - tions of abuse, it was important to be certain. To answer this question, the guard - ian brought in Howard Shane, director of the Center for Communication En - hancement and the Autism Language Program at Boston Children's Hospital. With Boynton serving as facilitator, Shane performed a battery of now-fa -miliar double-blind tests used to eval - uate FC. In one situation, Wendy was asked to identify pictures of familiar objects. On some trials both Boynton and Wendy saw the same picture, but on other trials, they were shown different pictures. In each case, the answers typed matched the pictures Boynton saw, not what Wendy had seen. In another part of the test, Shane asked Wendy several very simple questions about her every - day life\u2014but questions whose answers were unknown to Boynton (e.g., \"What color is your family's car?\"). None of these questions were answered correctly. The results could not have been clearer. Whenever Boynton did not know the correct answer, the answer given was wrong. Simple double-blind testing showed that Boynton was doing the typing, not Wendy, and as a result, Wendy and her brother were reunited with their parents. Furthermore, the re - sults were so overwhelming that Boyn - ton was also convinced. And so began a very challenging period for her. Three Difficult Questions Boynton needed to come to grips with three questions: First, was FC real? Second, if not, then how could she have been so completely fooled? And, finally, why sexual abuse? To her credit, she answered the first question very quickly. Boynton was a trained speech and language therapist, and when she saw the results of the testing, she recognized what it meant. FC was a fraud. In addition, the testing had been a very stressful experience for her. She had never facilitated in a situation like that before, and when she didn't know the answer to a question Shane was posing, she found herself mentally searching for an answer she thought Wendy might give. She realized there was something wrong with this, and as a result, even before she saw the data, the testing process raised doubts in her mind. After the findings of Shane's testing were revealed, Boynton stopped using FC and went on to convince the school administration to implement a system-wide prohibition on its use. The administration had not taken a stand on whether FC was valid or not, but at Boynton's insistence and out of an abundance of caution, they banned the use of facilitated communication in the school system until more was known. The next two problems took more time to sort out. The sexual abuse as - pect was very embarrassing, but in hind - sight Boynton had an idea about where it might have come from. In the days prior to the sexual abuse report, Wendy exhibited an increase in violent hitting and scratching. Boynton had never been hit by Wendy or any other student be - fore, but on one occasion Wendy hit her quite hard in the face. She also scratched Boynton, sometimes drawing blood. When a student shows a sudden change in behavior, it is not uncommon for special education staff to hypothe - size that something at home is upset - ting the child. Of course, in any given case, there are many possible reasons for the change in behavior, but when A facilitator and student demonstrating FC on a tab - let.

Whenever Boynton did not know the correct answer, the answer given was wrong. Simple double-blind testing showed that Boynton was doing the typing, not Wendy.38 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerother explanations don't come to mind, teaching staff sometimes imagine that circumstances at home are the cause of the problem. Boynton did not recall consciously thinking about the possibility of sex - ual abuse in Wendy's family before the words came out on the letter board, but once the dust had cleared, she realized this might have been the source of the idea. Unconsciously, Boynton had pro - vided an explanation for the change in Wendy's behavior. Ironically, given further thought, Boynton realized that Wendy's aggressive behavior was much more likely a sign of resistance to FC. Wendy was telling her that she did not like having her hand held or having Boynton sit so close to her. The most difficult question was how she could have been fooled by FC. How could she have come to believe that Wendy was the one controlling the typing? After the episode with Wendy was over, Boynton kept in touch with Howard Shane, who gave her copies of published research studies on FC, all of which showed it to be bogus. It was at this point that Boynton recognized an important mistake she made back at the beginning of her FC experience. When she had doubts about FC, rather than look widely for information about it, Boynton had consulted FC advocates and the pro-FC literature. Outside the cult of FC, opinion was very different, but she had not looked for dissenting views. Shane helped her widen her un - derstanding, but there was still the ques - tion of how she had been so completely fooled. As another facilitator once said to her, \"You mean all this time, I've been talking to myself?\" Wendy's case, as well as other FC-re - lated cases of false sexual abuse allega - tions, were described in a 1993 PBS Frontline documentary \"Prisoners of Silence\" (Palfreman 1993). In addition, the film showed a similar double-blind test of FC conducted at the O.D. Heck Developmental Center in Schenectady, New York. The staff of the center had come under the sway of FC and were using it extensively throughout the institution. As in Boynton's case, dou - ble-blind tests showed that not a sin - gle correct response was typed when the facilitator did not know the answer. Furthermore, there were interviews with experienced staff members who, like Boynton, were completely fooled into believing their students were doing the typing. They reported being \"dev - astated\" by the results of the test\u2014the same word Howard Shane recently used to describe Boynton's initial reaction to the testing with Wendy. So, after seeing the film, Boynton knew she was not alone in her confu - sion, and she went on to read a number of research articles that showed it was quite easy to create credulous facilitators in a laboratory setting. For example, in a study by Burgess and colleagues (1998), college students were told that FC worked, and they received little training in the technique. Despite this minimal level of exposure, the great majority of students willingly took on the role of facilitator. Eighty percent of them pro - duced correct responses to questions whose answers they knew but that the disabled person they were working with\u2014who, in fact, was a non-disabled actor\u2014did not know. And, yet, these new facilitators expressed the belief that they were not typing the words. Although it helped to learn about how easily people can be fooled, Boyn - ton continued to feel uneasy about the entire episode with Wendy and her family. A Personal Journey Boynton stayed on as a speech pathol - ogist in the same school district for another six years, after which she left to pursue a master's degree in educa - tion. She had originally intended to return to teaching, but by the time she completed her master's, she wanted to pursue her art. Over the years, she kept in touch with Howard Shane, who provided her with articles about FC and checked in to see how she was doing. In the meantime, reporters called her on occasion, and although she was reluctant to speak to them, she was often persuaded to do so, knowing that they were likely to write about her whether she spoke to them or not. It seemed better to take the opportunity to describe things in her own words. But this also meant that it was difficult to let her FC experience fade into the past. So, over the years, Boynton began to take a number of active measures to both make amends and do what she could to lessen the harm of FC. First, she made a sincere and very public apology to Wendy's parents. With the consent of all parties, the apology was filmed for an episode of ABC TV's 20/20 , and although many families might not have been so gen - erous, Wendy's parents graciously ac - cepted her apology. Quite a few years later, Shane learned that the journal Evidence-Based Commu - nication Assessment and Intervention had scheduled a special issue on the topic \"Orange Blooms\" (2018) by Janyce Boynton.Ironically, given further thought, Boynton realized that Wendy's aggressive behavior was much more likely a sign of resistance to FC.Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 39of facilitated communication. Knowing that Boynton was still troubled by her experiences with FC, he suggested she write an account of what had happened to her. Writing the article turned out to be a very positive experience. It helped her sort out her thoughts about what had happened from the vantage point of several years of separation, and as part of the peer-review process, she received helpful criticism from professional re - viewers. The result was a remarkably frank description of her case that stands as a unique and very valuable contribu - tion to the literature on FC (Boynton 2012). Finally, in recent years she has gone on to become a leading activist in the effort to end the use of FC. Despite overwhelming evidence discrediting FC that eventually led to at least nine - teen professional, governmental, and advocacy groups throughout the world issuing policy statements against its use (Behavior Analysis Association of Michigan 2018), the supporters of FC have come roaring back to defend it. In addition, they have introduced new forms of FC that are just as pseudo - scientific but packaged differently, the most prominent of which is called rapid prompting method (Vyse 2016). Like many of those who have followed the FC saga, Boynton was frustrated by its continued\u2014and even growing\u2014popu - larity. In response, she helped organize a small band of activists and has become their unofficial leader. She maintains a clearinghouse of professional articles and media coverage about FC, as well as a variety of other resources, and she keeps her eye open for opportunities to expose the bogus nature of FC and pre - vent the many harms it can cause. Boynton's efforts have already borne fruit. As outlined in a previous col - umn, earlier this year the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) sponsored a \"Midwest Summer Institute: Inclusion and Communication,\" which included instruction in FC. The university also offered college credit for some of the institute's workshops. In collaboration with her crew of advocates, Boynton drafted a letter objecting to the pro - motion of a discredited and potentially dangerous technique. The letter was signed by thirty academics and profes - sionals and sent to the administration of the university. In addition, the con - troversy was covered by the local Cedar Rapids newspaper. Eventually, the UNI Provost responded by saying that he would assemble a committee to evaluate their summer workshops (Vyse 2018). In October, the Provost announced that the committee had reached its conclu - sion and that the university would \"no longer be hosting the facilitated com - munication conference.\" By removing the University of Northern Iowa's stamp of approval from an FC workshop, a substantial blow was struck against pseudoscience and in favor of reason. But this is just the beginning. There are a number of other universities and governmental or - ganizations that tacitly or explicitly en - dorse FC and/or its related techniques, and Boynton and her allies have their eyes on a number of these future targets. Janyce Boynton, who, along with Wendy's family, was a victim of FC pseudoscience over twenty years ago, has come full circle from believer to skeptic and from a user of FC to a dedicated advocate for abolishing it. Her perspec - tive is completely unique. No one else has taken her unusual journey. But she has emerged as an important figure in the cause for science and reason in the field of autism treatment. Howard Shane has known Boyn - ton since those early days when they were brought together by Wendy's case. Asked to comment on her career, he wrote: It is truly courageous, if not inspira - tional, that Janyce was able to imme - diately recognize and accept that she had been seduced into the role of facilitator, but has worked tirelessly for decades to make amends for that unconscious, involuntary misstep. As a result, she has quietly assumed a leadership role of a small army of academics and advocates in their unremitting struggle to mitigate the negative effects of FC. I can think of no one who has had a more unusual path to science advocacy than Janyce Boynton, but the nature of her journey is part of what makes her voice so powerful. This collage artist from Maine speaks with a kind of au - thority that none of her academic and professional colleagues can match, and what she has chosen to do with her voice is, indeed, courageous and inspi - rational.

NISBET The Science of Why Y oga Quiets the Mind Fitness Industry Hype Obscures Y oga's True Benefits I had been practicing yoga for a decade, but it took an unexplained injury to push me toward turning yoga into a daily routine. I had spent a brutally cold winter battling unex - plained nerve pain in my legs, which doctors after a series of diagnostic tests eventually characterized as related to \"muscle tension.\" For years as a professor and writer, my days were spent at a desk chair, slouched over a computer. I always prided myself on staying in shape, taking breaks to run and lift weights. But now it seemed the years of sitting at a computer, pressed to meet the next deadline, had taken their toll. As I worked with a physical ther -apist, I began to notice that the nerve pain I felt in my lower legs appeared to be connected to chronic tightness in my hamstrings and hips, and this tightness would intensify after sitting at a desk and/or under conditions of stress. I switched to a standing desk, which helped considerably, and I quit exercising as intensely as I did when I was twen - ty-five years old. But it was yoga that seemed to make the most difference. As I recovered, I carefully worked my way back to an hour-long yoga practice. After a few weeks of practicing each morning, I noticed that not only did my nerve pain start to subside, but my posture, sleep, and mood improved. In comparison to any other exercise routine I had previ - ously done, yoga was far more effective at putting my mind and body at ease. Yoga helped me become \"non-reactive \" to any pain I might be feeling, fending off resulting feelings of anticipation and worry, which by inducing stress would often result in increased pain. My approach to yoga today is very different from when I first took up the practice. Ten years ago, like many Americans, I approached yoga as just another form of exercise. I recognized the calming effect yoga had on me, but I still began each practice eager to ex - perience an intense workout. But as I have come to understand first hand, ap - Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 41proaching yoga as an intense workout not only risks injury, it also distracts from what researchers are discovering are the true benefits, which include managing mood, controlling our fight or flight stress response, and promoting mental clarity and focus. It's about the Breath Even though more than 1,000 studies have been published on yoga, only a handful of high-quality studies exist. A main reason is a comparative lack of U.S. federal funding for health-related yoga research. But based on available evidence that lines up with what we know about the body, the brain, and the nervous system, there are a few things we can at least hypothesize about yoga's health benefits. As with other forms of exercise, practicing strenuous yoga releases en - dorphins, which are thought to create not only temporary forms of euphoria but also can help mask pain. Like exer - cise generally, practicing yoga can lower cortisol, a hormone correlated with stress, depression, and anxiety. By regu - lating cortisol levels, yoga may also help practitioners produce more melatonin, which can improve sleep and thereby overall mood. But compared to running, lifting weights, or other forms of exercise, it is yoga's focus on controlled breathing that makes the practice unique, writes New York Times science journalist Wil - liam Broad (2012) in The Science of Yoga . The focus on the breath is one reason studies consistently indicate that yoga in comparison to conventional exercise is more effective at managing feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety. Almost all forms of yoga emphasize Ujjayi pra - nayama , a style of slow breathing. When we breathe quickly, which often occurs when we experience stress or anxiety, carbon dioxide levels in our blood - stream decrease while oxygen levels stay the same. The imbalance produced by faster than normal breathing boosts the excitability of our nerves and muscles, producing muscle spasms and tingling in our extremities, which can trigger greater feelings of anxiety. In contrast, the slow breathing em - phasized in yoga practice increases car -bon dioxide levels. In response, blood vessels in the brain dilate, sending more oxygen to the brain. By enabling our brains to absorb more oxygen, the slow breathing of yoga increases calm - ness and alertness, writes Broad. Recent studies point to a second possible way that the effects of yoga may differ from conventional exercise. Yoga appears to uniquely boost levels of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The role of this neurotransmitter is still not fully un - derstood by scientists, but GABA is typically found at lower levels among those experiencing depression, anxi - ety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic pain. In contrast, higher levels of GABA are correlated with more pos - itive mood and feelings (Streeter et al. 2017). Moving Fast and Slow A second way that yoga may be unique from other forms of exercise, writes Broad, is yoga's ability to regulate autonomic features of our nervous system, functions that were once con - sidered beyond our reach to control. Some researchers hypothesize that yoga has the unique ability to either put the brake on our sympathetic sys - tem (which generates \"fight or flight\" stress reactions) or boost our parasym - pathetic system (which controls our \"rest-and-digest\" functions). By cycling through the fast and slow parts of our nervous system, a yoga practice gives our metabolism and nervous system a healthy workout, pro - moting greater balance. A typical hour- long yoga practice will cycle through braking the sympathetic system and boosting the parasympathetic system. Fast flowing poses stimulate our sym - pathetic system. More static poses that we hold for a longer period of time or in positions of relaxation put the brake on the \"fight or flight\" system and pro - mote the \"rest and digest\" parasympa - thetic system. By cycling through the fast and slow parts of our nervous system, a yoga practice gives our metabolism and ner - vous system a healthy workout. In other words, writes Broad, yoga seems to not only promote the body's flexibility but also our inner flexibility, allowing us to more easily sink into a state of quietude and letting go. Chasing Perfection Even as scientists begin to uncover the unique benefits of yoga to mental health and overall well-being, many Americans continue to pursue yoga for the wrong reasons. It is not spirituality or mental harmony that drives their practice but \"the pursuit of bodily per - fection \u2014 the perfect abs, the perfect butt, the perfect backbend,\" writes journalist John Philp (2009) in Yoga Inc. The message of our image-driven culture, Philp observes, is that \"yoga is a method that women, mostly, can use to attain physical perfection.\" Studies consistently show that people who regularly exercise, as much as they may not admit, tend to care most about appearances. \"People exercise not for the physiological benefits,\" writes University of Alberta's Timothy Caulfield (2012) in The Cure for Everything , \"but for weight control and looks.\" There are variations in goals by age and by the health of an individual, \"but looks and weight control (for the purpose of looks) are themes in almost every study,\" notes Caulfield. Yoga is no different. More than 70 percent of yoga practitioners in the United States are women, according to a 2016 IPSOS survey commissioned by Yoga Journal magazine. Among those polled, one in five said that \"losing weight\" was a motivation for begin - ning yoga, though the true proportion is likely higher given that 50 percent of practitioners also cited \"getting in shape\" as a primary goal.I switched to a standing desk, which helped considerably, and I quit exercising as intensely as I did when I was twenty-five years old. But it was yoga that seemed to make the most difference.42 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerBut as a form of exercise, yoga is not a very efficient means to lose weight. The reason, as Caulfield explains, is that our bodies are eating machines. If you want to lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you eat. If, as a 175-pound man, I practiced intense vinyasa or power yoga for sixty minutes, I might burn 350-700 calories. If I fol - lowed that by drinking a medium-sized smoothie and eating a modest salad, I would immediately consume as much if not more calories than I just burned. For the rest of the day, writes Caul - field, I must then eat fewer calories than my body needs, or I will not lose an ounce. There's another paradox: In - tense yoga, like other forms of exercise, also tends to increase our appetites. Our bodies are calibrated to stay at what - ever weight we might be at the present moment. If you burn off more calories doing yoga than you consume, your body will send strong signals of hunger and craving, compelling you to try to make up the difference, unless you have the willpower to resist. Many magazines and advertisements featuring ultra-lean women practicing yoga, combined with the competitive culture of fitness clubs and studios, can also breed unhealthy obsessions. In Yoga Inc ., for example, Philp notes stud - ies showing a link between an extreme commitment to yoga and eating disor - ders, given the emphasis by some teach - ers on the need to practice on an empty stomach and to follow a strict diet. Rather than a calorie-burning workout, yoga's true benefits to weight loss relate to mind-body balance. If, as reviewed earlier, because of yoga an individual experiences less stress and anxiety and improved sleep, then they are less likely to overeat or seek out high-calorie carbs and sugary foods. Risky Business In terms of staying active, yoga's pro - motion of flexibility and joint mobility may also help ward off injury. But if taken to the extreme, yoga can also cause injury. Between 2001 and 2014, there were more than 29,000 yoga-related injuries in the United States, according to a study by University of Alabama researchers who analyzed data com - piled from hospitals by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. During that period, as yoga grew in popularity across age groups, there was a doubling in the injury rate among those aged forty-five to sixty-four (Swain and McGin 2016). In The Science of Yoga , Broad warns that a few popular yoga positions in rare instances may lead to severe inju - ries. These positions include shoulder stand, plow, wheel, and head stand, which could cause stroke or spinal and arterial injuries. Given the risk, Broad concludes that these poses add little to a practice and should be avoided. Particularly risky may also be \"hot yoga,\" a vigorous practice performed in a studio heated to above ninety degrees. Philp interviewed medical experts who offered a variety of warnings about the practice. Packed into sweltering hot studios that in contrast to other yoga traditions are often lined with mir - rors, we are likely to draw comparisons to others as to how far we should be stretching or what poses we should be perfecting. Under conditions of intense heat, in competition with others we see in the mirrors, and fueled by endorphins, it is easy to stretch our muscles too far, weakening or tearing them. A common claim also is that hot yoga, by induc - ing buckets of sweat, cleanses the body of toxins. If you experience nausea or a headache, it is because the toxins are leaving the body. This is dangerous, pseudoscientific nonsense. The most likely trigger of nausea and a headache is dehydration, which requires immedi - ate replacement of fluids.Practicing Non-Doing As I recovered from my leg pain and adopted a daily yoga routine, I practiced a slow yet vigorous form of vinyasa yoga on my own at home or outside, visiting a studio once or twice a week. Instead of a workout, my central focus was on my breath and body positioning. In doing so, I came to approach yoga as stren - uous meditation-in-motion, adopting the Taoist concept of \"non-doing\" and \"non-forcing.\" During yoga, I let go of the relentless striving that rules con - temporary life. I am not trying to get anywhere, or to achieve anything, but to just be. I came to this view after reading Jon Kabat-Zinn's (2009) classic Full Catastrophe Living , his comprehensive guide to the Mindful-Based Stress Reduction program he pioneered over several decades. In the program, par - ticipants after several weeks of regular meditation move to a slow yoga practice. Y oga should be done without forcing or striving, \"accepting our body, as we find it in the present, from one moment to the next,\" Kabat-Zinn writes. \"While stretching, lifting, or balancing, we learn to work with and dwell at our limits while maintaining moment-to-moment awareness.\" From this approach we may create an \"island of being in the sea of constant doing in which our lives are usually immersed, a time in which we allow all the doing to stop\" (Kabat-Zinn 2009).

Discover magazine writer LeeAundra Temescu wrote in 2006 that \"During a railway expansion in Egypt in the nineteenth century, construction companies un - earthed so many mummies that they used them as locomotive fuel.\" This factoid inspired poet Charles Webb to write a piece titled \"Mummies to Burn\" for Slate in January 20101. There is no evidence at all that mum - mies were burned in locomotives, and Dail correctly identified the origin of the myth. Cecil Adams of The Straight Dope received a similar query in 2002 and replied, in part, \"What you heard was a mangled version of a classic joke told by one of the masters of the art. But don't feel bad\u2014people have been falling for this one for more than 130 years.\" Some people, apparently unaware of Twain's penchant for humor and hy - perbole, took his comment literally or as \"reporting.\" For example, Joann Fletcher (2011), an honorary research fellow at the University of Y ork and part of Y ork's Mummy Research Group, in an article for no less an authoritative source than the BBC, wrote that \"Even less fortu - nate were those mummies exported to the U.S. for use in the papermaking in - dustry or even, as Mark Twain reported, to be burnt as railroad fuel.\" [ SKEPTICAL INQUIREE BENJAMIN RADFORDBenjamin Radford is a research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author or coauthor of several books, including Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits . Bailing in the Mummies Today I heard a speaker repeat the story that mummies were used as fuel in British trains. I recall this was a classic legend first related by Mark Twain in The Innocents Abroad , but the speaker insisted that she thoroughly researched the subject, and it was true. Got anything on this? \u2014B. Dail Q: A: There is no evidence at all that mummies were burned in locomotives, and reader Dail correctly identified the origin of the myth. Celestia Ward, Two Heads Studios44 Volume 43 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerSo let's consult the source: in Twain's The Innocents Abroad , chapter 58, he writes, in part: I shall not tell of the Great Caravan which leaves for Mecca every year, for I did not see it; nor of the fashion the people have of prostrating themselves and so forming a long human pave - ment to be ridden over by the chief of the expedition on its return, to the end that their salvation may be thus secured, for I did not see that either; I shall not speak of the railway, for it is like any other railway\u2014I shall only say that the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies three thousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that purpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out pettishly, \"D--n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent\u2014pass out a King;\"\u2014(Stated to me for a fact. I only tell it as I got it. I am willing to believe it. I can believe anything.) I include the preamble for con -text\u2014though no excuse is needed to quote Twain at any length\u2014and not only is the comment explicitly made in the context of other absurd claims (\"a long human pavement to be ridden over\" by exalted leaders would surely be a needlessly bumpy ride), but Twain goes out of his way to say that if he (and by extension his readers) will be - lieve that, they'll \"believe anything.\" It seems he was right. From competitive jumping frogs to Tom Sawyer's adven - tures, it's hard to fathom how, of any English-language author, Twain's works would not be recognized as satirical and greatly embellished. It's certainly true that in the 1800s Egyptian mummies were both plentiful and often displayed with little respect for the dead in sideshows and muse - ums. But the idea that they were burned for fuel (or \"bailed into\" the locomo - tive furnace) is another matter. Most sources I found debunk and discredit the story (including Mummies: Truth and Rumors b y H e a t h e r M o n t g o m - ery), but probably the most definitive appears in the book The Mummy Con - gress: Science, Obsession, and the Ever - lasting Dead , by Heather Pringle (2001, Penguin Books). On pages 189 and 190 she explains, \"So striking was this brief sketch that Twain's tale has lodged it - self firmly in mummy lore. No mummy It's not uncommon for people to mistakenly repeat myths and misin - formation; we all hear and share information that we haven't personally vetted. Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2019 45expert has ever been able to authenti - cate the story, however, although sev - eral have tried and written about their frustration. Twain seems to be the only published source\u2014and a rather suspect one at that.\" Pringle notes that it's only one of several legends about mummies of that era, including that in the 1850s as demand for paper grew in America, mummies were imported and their an - cient linen used to help manufacture brown wrapping paper for household use (York University's Joann Fletcher mentions this). This \"mummy paper\" was discontinued when it was discov - ered that diseases had leached from the Egyptian bodies and into the wrapping paper. In the mid-1990s, Joseph Dane, an America English professor, went hunting for proof that mills had ever recycled mummy wrappings. He was unable to recover a single shred. He came across no conclusive records of the trade or even a single example of the paper\u2014surprising given how novel these sheets would have seemed at the time. (Pringle 2001, 191) It's not uncommon for people to mistakenly repeat myths and misinfor - mation; we all hear and share informa - tion that we haven't personally vetted. I'm more concerned about the \"expert\" who repeated this myth to Dail and her audience; if she really did \"thoroughly research the subject\" as she claimed, it raises serious questions about her re - searching skills. It is one thing to pres - ent a piece of information with a caveat such as \"some say\" or \"attributed to,\" but quite another to positively affirm an inherently suspect or dubious claim by personally endorsing it. This example shows why diligent research involves consulting a variety of sources; at least three and ideally five or more. If you just do an internet search and glance at the top result to see if any writers or experts have reached the same conclusion you have, you may likely find confirming information. But if you spend a few minutes to do a less superficial search, you're more likely to discover if the idea is widely accepted or has been thoroughly debunked. Besides, everyone knows that kings make better human pavement than peasants. Note 1. The error was pointed out to the mag - azine's editors, who later added a note at the bottom of the online version acknowledging that \"this was probably a hoax.\" The fact that the misinformation was cited as true four years later by Slate poet Charles Webb suggests that the correction has gone largely unnoticed.
