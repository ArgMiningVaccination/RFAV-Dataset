The APP does not in any way relieve site personnel, contractors, 55 or subcontractors from responsibility for the safety and health of their personnel. Contractors shall 56 be required to review the site conditions and the work to be performed to determine specific safety 57 and health requirements for their personnel. Site personnel will document in their logbook any on- 58 site visitors. Any visitors to the site shall be required to read, understand, and comply with the 59 approved APP. 60 The APP is the interface with WESTON's Corporate Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) 61 manual and is prepared to be consistent with applicable Army, federal, state, and local health and 62 safety requirements, wh ich include the following: 63 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1904, 1910, and 1926 [ Occupational Safety and 64 Health Administration ( OSHA) General Industry and Construction Standards]. 65 Engineering Manual (EM) 385-1- 1, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) S afety 66 and Health Requirements Manual, 15 September 2008. 67 EM 385-1-97, USACE Safety Explosives Safety and Health Requirements Manual, 68 12 April 2013. 69 Technical Manual 60A 1 -1-31, EOD Procedures/General Information on EOD Disposal 70 Procedures.

The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is within Lebanon County and is 82 approximately 24 miles east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and 72 miles northwest of Philadelphia , 83 Pennsylvania (see Figure 2-1). The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS was used for artillery and 84 rifle training from 1885 through 1941 (estimated). 85 The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS ( PAHQ-008-R- 01) boundary encompasses 181 acres as 86 demarcated on Figure 2 -2. Th e MRS consists of a former north- south artillery range and portions 87 of a former east -west rifle range. In the north- south artillery range , berm features and 3-inch Stokes 88 mortar s were observed, and lead in surface soil exceeded the Pennsylvania Department of 89 Environmental Protection ( PADEP ) evaluation criterion during the Site Inspection (SI). The 181 90 acres of land area within the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is owned primarily by one entity, 91 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but also includes multiple residential parcels and one 92 industrial property (sewage treatment) located along the western MRS boundary. 93 The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is located in a partially wooded area with no distinct 94 boundaries and with Conewago Hill to the north. The northern portion of the MRS is bisected by 95 Route 117. The Conewago Creek flows through the MRS north of Route 117 ( see Figure 2-2). 96 2.3 PROJECT AND WORK DES CRIPTION 97 Several investigation phases of the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation, and 98 Liability Act (CERCLA ) process have already been completed at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West 99 MRS under the MMRP, including an Inventory Report and SI. As a result of the SI findings, it 100 was recommended that a R emedial Investigation (RI)/Feasibility Study ( FS) be performed f or 101 Mount Gre tna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR MT. GRETNA \\APP_Gretna.docx munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and munitions constituents ( MC) at the Mount Gretna 102 TCAR - West MRS. 103 2.3.1 Previous Investigations 104 In August 2011, the SI field investigation was performed at the MRS, including a magnetometer - 105 assisted visual survey , which encompassed 12.62 miles. The northeast corner of the MRS, east of 106 Pinch Road, was not investigated during the SI because deer fencing prohibit ed access to field 107 personnel (Parsons, 2012). 108 Surface soil samples were collected from a total of 12 biased locations within the MRS and 109 3 ambient locations outside of the MRS during the SI. Additionally, two co- located surface 110 water/sediment samples were collected within the MRS, and one ambient surface water/sediment 111 location was assessed from outside of the MRS boundary. The samples were analyzed for MC 112 metals (antimony, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc) and explosives. Explosive compounds were 113 not detected in surface soil, surface water, or sediment samples. Antimony, copper, lead, mercury, 114 and zinc were detected above MRS -specific SI maximum ambient background concentrations in 115 soils; however, only lead exceeded the specified PADEP evaluation criteria of 500 milligrams per 116 kilogram (mg/kg) with a maximum concentration of 520 mg/kg. Copper was detected in sedi ment 117 above the MRS -specific SI maximum ambient background concentration of 35 mg/kg with a 118 maximum detection of 42 mg/kg, but did not exceed PADEP human health screening criterion of 119 8,100 mg/kg. Zinc was reported in surface water results with a maximum concentration of 120 10 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/L) , which is higher than the ambient background concentration of 4 121 \u00b5g/L but did not exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) screening criterion of 122 7,400 \u00b5g/L (Parsons, 2012). No groundwater samples were collected during the SI (Parsons, 2012). 123 Pursuant to CERCLA and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan, the 124 purposes of the RI at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS are to collect and analyze the data 125 necessary to conduct site charact erization and to develop a baseline risk assessment ( EPA , 1988) . 126 The RI data will be used to assist in determining what remediation alternatives, if any, are 127 necessary at the MRS consistent with the current and anticipated future land use. In the FS, 128 remed ial alternatives for the MRS will be developed, screened, and analyzed to identify the most 129 Mount Gre tna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR response action for the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS based on the results of the 130 RI. 131 The RI will include the activities presented in Table 2 -1. 132 Table 2-1 133 134 Anticipated Phases of Work 135 Work Phase Work Description Task 1 - Mobilization/Demobilization Manpower mobilization , setup of site support areas ( equipment laydown , conex box for storage ), and demobilizati on.

HEALTH AND SAFETY PO LICY 149 3.1 HEALTH AND SAFETY PO LICY 150 WESTON personnel operate in a culture where safety, health, and protection of personnel and the 151 environment take precedence over expediency. A fundamental premise of our Behavior -Based 152 Safety (BBS) culture is that accidents are preventable through choosin g safe, proactive behaviors. 153 WESTON's policy on Health and Safety emphasizes several important points: 154 WESTON has established a goal of working safely 100% of the time (employees and 155 contractors) with the expected outcome being zero incidents that result in injuries, 156 illnesses, property damage, or environmental damage or contamination. 157 Managers and workers accept the responsibility of a concerted and sustained effort to 158 achieve a goal of Safety Every Minute of Every Day. 159 Managers and workers assume a safety leadership role. 160 Managers and workers take action for safety, coach peers in safe practices, and share 161 experiences, successes, and failures. 162 Workers are involved in the identification and the control of workplace hazards during 163 work planning, work executi on, and feedback activities. 164 Management is committed to a work environment that allows free and open expression 165 of safety concerns and where workers fear no reprisals or retaliation. 166 Workers are the most important asset to WESTON and are critical in the pr ocess of 167 establishing, implementing, and observing safe work practices. 168 3.1.1 100% Safe- Work and Stop- Work Policy Statement 169 For each activity and contract under which WESTON performs work, a policy is implemented 170 clearly stating that WESTON employees have the responsibility and the right to stop or curtail any 171 work they perceive to be unsafe (a threat to public health, the safety and health of workers, or the 172 environment). Employees must be free to voice concerns about safety and health without fear of 173 reprisal, retaliation, or harassment. This policy is implemented by a clear, straightforward, 174 contract -specific procedure as part of the WESTON Integrated Safety Management System. 175 Mount Gretna Traini ng Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR MT. GRETNA \\APP_Gretna.docx To support the WESTON goal of all employees and subcontractors working safely 100% of the 176 time, managers will use every available resource to maintain safe, hazard -controlled work 177 environments characterized by a vigorous emphasis on accident prevention. Standards, 178 requirements, and best practices will be implemented to avoid accidents. Managers will ensure 179 that employees are familiar with the standards, requirements, and best practices that pertain to their 180 safety. 181 WESTON managers and supervisors are held directly accountable for the health and safety of their 182 employees, subcontractors, and other resources employed to maintain employee health and safety, 183 and the continual communication of hazards and hazard controls to the workforce. 184 3.2 PROGRAM GOALS 185 WESTON has implemented a BBS program in which employees assume a safety leadership role 186 and ar e responsible for the safety of coworkers, team members, and stakeholders. Employees focus 187 on behaviors and intervention techniques to improve behavioral processes. As part of WESTON's 188 BBS program, employees create high -quality connections with one another , team members, and 189 stakeholders to foster an active, caring culture. Commitment is high, and employees help each 190 other be Safe Every Minute of Every Day to achieve the corporate goal of Zero Accidents involving 191 personnel and the environment. WESTON uses t he EMR as a metric to determine the effectiveness 192 of the BBS program. 193 3.3 PROGRAM OBJECTIVES 194 The WESTON EHS Program has the following objectives: 195 1. EHS staff, resources, and procedures are provided as necessary and used in an efficient 196 and cost -effective manner to establish a safe work environment for WESTON 197 employees, subcontractors, clients, and the general public. 198 2. Compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is assured, and risk is 199 managed and minimized for employees, as well as the corporatio n. 200 3. Management involvement is established and maintained within the EHS Program. 201 4. Clear lines of reporting, authorities, responsibilities, and performance expectations are 202 established. 203 Mount Gretna Traini ng Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR World -class EHS culture is attained at our places of employment, in our h omes, and in 204 our communities through the elimination of at-risk behavior. 205 3.4 ACCIDENT EXPERIENCE GOAL 206 The accident experience goal for this project, as well as for every WESTON project, is zero. 207 Work shall not be performed in a manner that conflicts with the safety, health, or environmental 208 precautions outlined in the APP or in the Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) ( Appendix A ). Site 209 personnel, including any WESTON subcontractors, who have the potential for exposure to site 210 hazards, are subject to the requirements of the APP and SSHP. Personnel violating safety 211 procedures are subject to dismissal/removal from the project site. 212 WESTON gathers information on incidents in an electronic database that allows assessment of 213 trends and causes of incidents. By learni ng from past experience, WESTON staff avoids the 214 recurrence of incidents. This information is available to every WESTON employee and is used in 215 training as well as in the development of APPs, SSHPs, and AHAs. The availability of this 216 information assists in achieving WESTON's goal of working safely 100% of the time. 217 Mount Gretna Traini ng Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR MT.

The deficiency tracking form lists and monitors the status of safety and health 497 deficiencies in chronological order. The form displays the type and description of the deficiency , 498 the risk rating , code ref erence, the corrective action taken and the projected resolution date , the 499 date resolved , and the person responsible for the corrective action. The deficiency tracking form 500 will be posted on the safety bulletin board and will be updated daily. In most case s, discrepancies 501 of greater severity are corrected immediately or within 24 hours if they are of lower severity. 502 When a deficiency is identified, the UXOSO/SSHO will follow up by updating the deficiency 503 tracking form to indicate the specific corrective act ion, the person(s) responsible for the 504 corrections, and the date by which the action needs to be accomplished. The UXOSO/SSHO will 505 also follow up by ensuring that the corrective action is accomplished in the timeframe indicated. 506 During health and safety audits, the deficiency log is reviewed to ensure that the corrective action 507 process has been implemented. The information from the deficiency tracking form is presented in 508 daily safety meetings and monthly supervisor meetings so that lessons learned are diss eminated. 509 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munit ions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract 7.4 EXTERNAL INSPECTIONS/CERTIFICATIONS 510 Although no external inspection is expected, regulatory agencies do conduct inspections from time 511 to time. An inspector should be treated professionally and with courtesy. The regulatory agency 512 inspector should introduce himself/herself to the manager in charge of the operation and present 513 credentials to verify that he/she is representing a recognized regulatory agency, such as OSHA or 514 the U.S. Department of Transportation. Personnel who cannot demonstrate their affiliation with a 515 recognized regulatory agency should not be allowed access to the project site or office. 516 Any pre -inspection conference will be attended by the UXOSO/SSHO, at a minimum. At that time, 517 the scope of the inspection should clearly be described by the inspector. If the inspector has not 518 described the scope of the inspection during the pre -inspection conference, the inspector should 519 be asked to provide such a description. 520 Coordination of any regulatory agency inspection is the responsibility of the Army National 521 Guard Directorate ( ARNG ), PAARNG, and/or USACE , who must accompany the inspection 522 agency representative and the UXOSO/SSHO at all times. Prior to taking the inspector on - 523 site or into the office, the UXOSO/SSHO must contact the WESTON PM, and either the EHS 524 Leader or EHS Director. The inspector will perform the inspection, which may include a walk- 525 through inspection of the work site or a targeted file/records review. The site or office inspection 526 typically will end with a closeout conference during which the inspector may provide tentative 527 findings. In some cases, the inspector may forego the close -out conference and issue a written 528 citation after leaving the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS . On occasion, inspections may require 529 more than 1 day. 530 Regulatory agency inspectors seldom issue citations during the inspection. However, if an OSHA 531 or PA DEP inspector observes an imminent hazard, he/she can order a work stoppage. 532 It is WESTON's practice to cooperate with investigations. Information that is requested should be 533 provided; however, requests for copies of documents, safety and health plans, and training records 534 should not be provided without first obtaining approval from WESTON's Law Department. Under 535 no circumstances should any attempt be made to mislead the inspector. 536 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munit ions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract MT. GRETNA \\APP_Gretna.docx Coordination of any regulatory agency inspection is the responsibility of the UXOSO/SSHO, who 537 will accompany the inspector during all stages of the inspection. 538 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munit ions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract CCIDENT REPORTING 539 8.1 EXPOSURE DATA (MAN -HOURS WORKED) 540 The UXOSO/SSHO and PM will track exposure hours.

PERSONAL PROTECTI VE EQUIPMENT 666 10.1 HAZARD ASSESSMENTS 667 For the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS project, the EHS Leader and the UXOSO/SSHO are 668 responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the PPE Program. Once on- 669 site, the UXOSO/SSHO is responsible for ensuring t hat the level of protection is correct for the 670 activities. If field conditions change, an amendment will be made to the APP and SSHP to reflect 671 the necessary PPE. 672 10.2 IDENTIFYING WHEN HAZ ARD ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED 673 Hazard assessments are conducted during the site walk and document review. During the initial 674 review of the available information, the minimum levels of protection were established for site 675 personnel. This process is then approved by the EHS Leader . Additional hazard assessments will 676 be conduct ed periodically , and when field activities or site conditions change , amendments will be 677 prepared based on this information. 678 10.3 IDENTIFYING HOW HAZARD ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED 679 The selection of the most appropriate level of protection depends on the following: 680 Hazards, known or potential: 681 Physical hazards 682 Biological hazards 683 Chemical hazards 684 Properties such as toxicity, radioactivity, route of exposure, and matrix (i.e., air, soil, 685 water) in which the contaminants are known or suspected. 686 Type and measured concentrations of contaminants. 687 Potential for exposure based upon task. 688 Route of exposure. 689 Based upon the initial AHAs, the APP preparer, in consultation with the appropriate sa fety 690 professionals, identified PPE for the specific tasks. The UXOSO/SSHO will e valuate the AHAs 691 and the identified PPE to determine its suitability based on the site activities and conditions. New 692 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR MT. GRETNA \\APP_Gretna.docx or additional PPE will be selected as conditions change to ensure that employees are protected 693 from hazards. Care will be taken to recogni ze the possibility of multiple and simultaneous 694 exposures to a variety of hazards. 695 The levels of personal protection and the procedures specified in this plan are based on the best 696 information available from reference documents and current site data; therefore, these 697 recommendations represent the minimum safety and health requirements to be observed by 698 personnel engaged in this project. Unforeseeable site conditions or changes may warrant a 699 reassessment of protection levels and controls stated. Adjustments to the APP must have prior 700 approval by the EHS Leader and USACE , Baltimore District. 701 Work at Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS will be completed in a minimum of Level D. If higher 702 levels of protection are required, an addendum to the APP and SSHP will be prepa red and 703 approved. 704 10.4 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TRAINING 705 In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I (Personal Protective Equipment), PPE will be 706 provided, used, and maintained in a sanitary and a reliable condition. The construction, design, 707 and materi al of PPE will provide employees with protection against known or anticipated hazards. 708 PPE that properly and appropriately fit s the employee will be selected . Any concerns regarding 709 the use of appropriate PPE will be brought to the attention of the UXOSO/SSHO, who will contact 710 the EHS Leader for assistance. 711 In accordance with OSHA, any worker required to wear PPE shall receive training in the proper 712 use and care of PPE. Periodic retraining shall be offered by the EHS Leader or designees to both 713 the employee s and the supervisors. The training shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the 714 following subjects: 715 Proper selection of PPE. 716 When PPE is anticipated for use. 717 Proper uses and limitations of equipment during temperature extremes, heat/cold stress, 718 and in relation to employee medical conditions. 719 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Proper donning and doffing, and adjusting of PPE. 720 Maintenance, cleaning, and storage of PPE. 721 Inspection procedures for PPE. 722 Training is typically delivered through formal programs such as HAZWOPER training, r efresher 723 training, or specific hazard training. Additional training is offered through routine site training and 724 site-specific training. After the training, the employees will demonstrate that they understand the 725 components of the PPE Program and how to us e PPE properly, or they will be retrained. 726 10.5 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT RETRAINING 727 Retraining is typically delivered through formal programs such as HAZWOPER annual refresher 728 training or specific hazard training. Additional retraining is offered through r outine site training and 729 site-specific training. 730 The UXOSO/SSHO will identify personnel that have received PPE training but do not have the 731 understanding and skill required to use the PPE . Those personnel will be re -trained to acquire the 732 appropriate skill s. The re -training will be documented in WESTON's EHS Track and available for 733 review on site. 734 10.6 MONITORING EQUIPMENT TRAINING 735 Personnel are initially trained on instrument use and calibration during their 40- hour OSHA 736 training. Instrument use and calibration is reviewed annually during the 8- hour refresher training. 737 Site personnel will review the manufacturer's instructions accompanying the instrument prior to 738 use. Personnel will receive a site -specific briefing covering the hazards, testing, and monitoring 739 procedures prior to start of monitoring for site -specific chemicals of concern . 740 10.7 WRITTEN CERTIFICATIO N OF EMPLOYEE PPE TRAININ G 741 Project personnel will have appropriate training as determined by the EHS Leader . Required 742 training and certifications are reviewe d internally as part of the APP and SSHP development prior 743 to project commencement.

INTRODUCTION 1 The Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) provides detailed project -specific health and safety 2 information for conducting the remedial investigation (RI) at the Mount Gretna Training Camp 3 Artillery Range (TCAR) - West Munitions Response Site (MRS ). The RI is being conducted to 4 determine the nature and extent of munitions and explosives of concern ( MEC ), material 5 potentially presenting an explosives hazard ( MPPEH ), munitions debris (MD) and munitions 6 constituents ( MC) that may remain from activities co nducted at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West 7 MRS that may pose a threat to human health and/or the environment. The SSHP is written in 8 accordance with applicable United States ( U.S.) Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), federal, 9 state, and local health and safety r equirements and presents the minimum requirements for safety 10 and health that must be met by personnel engaged in site operations. The SSHP does not in any 11 way relieve Weston Solutions, Inc. (WESTON\u00ae) site personnel or subcontractors from 12 responsibility for the safety and health of their personnel. Visitors to the Mount Gretna TCAR - 13 West MRS will receive a safety briefing by the Unexploded Ordnance Safety Officer 14 (UXOSO) /Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) prior to gaining entry to the work area. The 15 UXOS O/SSHO will provide visitors with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and 16 an escort while on -site and will maintain an on -site visitor log. 17 Changes and modifications to the SSHP are permitted and will be made in writing with the 18 knowledge and concurrence of the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Leader and accepted 19 by the U SACE , Baltimore District (CENAB) Project Manager (PM). 20 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsy lvania Contract CONTAMINANT CHARACTE RIZATION 21 2.1 SITE DESCRIPTION 22 The Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range ( TCAR) - West Munitions Response Site 23 (MRS) (PAHQ -008-R- 01) is located mainly with in State Game Land 145, in Mount Gretna, 24 Pennsylvania. The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is within Lebanon County and is 25 approximately 24 miles east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and 72 miles northwest of 26 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (see Figure 2-1). The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS was used 27 for artillery and rifle training from 1885 through 1941 (estimated). 28 The M ount Gretna TCAR - West MRS (PAHQ-008-R- 01) boundary encompasses 181 acres as 29 demarcated on Figure 2 -2. The MRS consists of a former north- south artillery range and 30 portions of a former east -west rifle range. In the north -south artillery range, berm features and 3- 31 inch Stokes mortar s were observed, and lead in surface soil exceeded the Pennsylvania 32 Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP ) evaluation criterion during the Site 33 Inspection (SI). The 181 acres of land area within the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is 34 owned primarily by one entity, t he Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but also includes multiple 35 residential parcels and one industrial property (sewage treatment) located along the western MRS 36 boundary. 37 The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is located in a partially wooded area with no distinct 38 boundaries and with Conewago Hill to the north. The northern portion of the MRS is bisected by 39 Route 117. The Conewago Creek flows through the MRS north of Route 117 (see Figure 2 -2). 40 2.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 41 The project description is summarized in Subsection 2.3 of the APP. 42 The proje ct will include activities at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS (see Figure 2 -2), as 43 presented in Table 2 -1. 44 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsy lvania Contract Gretna.docx Table 2-1 45 46 Anticipated Phases of Work 47 Work Phase Work Description Task 1 - Mobilization/Demobilization Manpower mobilization , setup of site support areas ( equipment laydown , conex box for storage ), and demobilization . Task 2 - Land Survey and Mapping Arrange for a licensed surveyor to locate and establish site survey control . Task 3 - Vegetation Clearance Small diameter brush removal will occur. Set up of exclusion areas . Surface sweep before clearance is performed. Task 4 - Geophysical Surveying Activities Perform analog mag and dig transect and full coverage surveys to detect geophysical anomalies and potential MEC within the designated MRS. Dig Safe notification is required before seeding . A surface sweep will be conducted before surveying is performed. Task 5 -Intrusive Activities Qualified Unexploded Ordnance ( UXO) Technicians will conduct mag and dig transects and perform surface and subsurface removal activities at anomaly locations . MEC [UXO and discarded military munitions (DMM )], MPPEH, MD, and/or other non- munitions -related metal debris will be recovered to evaluate the nature and extent of potential explosives hazards . Surface and s ubsurface removal activities will include the excavation of detected anomalies using hand tools, demolition activities of recovered MEC and MPPEH, and MD and non -MD inspection and transport to a certified recy cling program. Task 6 - MC Sampling Collection of MC samples in areas impacted by small arms and with lead concentrations exceed ing the PADEP evaluation criterion during the SI , and in areas impacted by a MEC release, or DMM pit sampling . Samples will be collected by hand , using hand tools . Mechanized equipment may be used to remove overburden. Samples will be collected using hand tools following anomaly avoidance surveys performed by a UXO Technician II or higher. Task 6 - Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) A UTV will be utilized to aid in transporting equipment and personnel at the site. Under each phase of work, inherently hazardous activities have been analyzed to identify the 48 controls that will protect the safety and health of personnel working at and entering the Mount 49 Gretna TCAR - West MRS [see the Activity Hazard Analyses (AHAs) in Section 12 of the 50 Accident Prevention Plan ( APP) ]. 51 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsy lvania Contract Gretna.docx 2.3 CONTAMINATION AND EX POSURE POTENTIAL 52 WESTON will ensure compliance with the requirements of EM 385 -1-1, Occupational S afety 53 and Health Administration ( OSHA) [29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) 1910 and 1926] , and 54 WESTON policy requirements through formal and site -specific training programs, as well as 55 routine inspections with follow -up compliance. Specific information pertaining to suspected 56 physical, chemical, biological, and radiological hazards associated with the work areas, tasks, 57 and operations is presented in the following subsections . As new data become available, this 58 APP/SSHP may need to be modified. 59 2.3.1 Chemical H azards 60 Typically , elevated levels of lead have been identified at comparable MRS s. Although no 61 sampling has been conducted to show positive lead levels at the M ount Gretna TCAR - West 62 MRS , information for lead is provided as a precaution (see Table 2 -2). B ased on the hazard/risk 63 assessment of the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS , the nature of the work, and previous 64 experience performing UXO operations, it is not expected that any airborne contaminants or 65 nuisance dust level exposure limits will be exceeded. Th e use of chemicals on -site during field 66 operations creates a potential exposure of chemical hazards to personnel through inhalation, 67 ingestion, or absorption. Clearing of vegetation and related work may require the use of 68 concentrated chemicals for proper equipment operation. 69 Site personnel will comply with the storage, handling, and use requirements stated on the Safety 70 Data Sheets ( SDSs) for each chemical brought on -site by WESTON or its subcontractors. All 71 chemicals brought on -site will be properly labe led. An inventory of all chemicals brought on -site 72 and an SDS for each will be maintained on- site. Project subcontractors shall inform WESTON of 73 any chemical materials brought on -site and the location of their SDSs. In the case of conflicts 74 between American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and other standards on the 75 SDS, the more stringent standard will prevail. A site -specific Hazard Communication Plan is 76 presented in Attachment 1. The SDSs for chemicals brought to the Mount Gretna TCAR - West 77 MRS will be added by the UXOSO/SSHO to Attachment 2. 78 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsy lvania Contract Gretna.docx 2.3.2 Physical Hazards 79 Exposure to physical hazards may include manual lifting; slips, trips, falls; heat/cold stress; hand 80 tools (manual and power); terrain or vegetation; uneven walking surfaces; and wea ther hazards. 81 Additional common physical hazards include hands or fingers caught between objects; electric 82 hazards; being caught in between/against or struck by an object; and traffic. 83 2.3.3 MEC Hazards 84 The MEC avoidance activities will be accomplished by a UXO Technician II (minimum). Only 85 UXO- qualified personnel in accordance with Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board 86 (DDESB) Technical Paper 18 will conduct MEC avoidance activities using a magnetometer, and 87 activities will be conducted during daylight h ours. Any identified anomalies will be reported to the 88 USACE representative immediately. Under no circumstances will any MEC be moved in an attempt 89 to make a definitive identification. 90 All WESTON and subcontractor personnel engaged in field operations will be thoroughly trained 91 and capable of recognizing the specific hazards associated with MEC items. All field personnel 92 will be under the direct supervision of a UXO Technician II. 93 This SSHP is the interface with WESTON's Corporate EHS manual and is prepared to be consistent 94 with applicable Army, federal, state, and local health and safety requirements, which include 95 Technical Manual 60A 1-1- 31, EOD Procedures/General Information on EOD Disposal Procedures; 96 EM 385 -1-1, Health and Safety Requirements Manual; and Department of Defense Manual 97 6055.9-M , DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards: General Explosives Safety 98 Information and Requirements . Based on the applicable UXO safety regulations, some g eneral 99 UXO safety guidelines are listed below: 100 Consider projectiles containing base -detonating fuses to be armed if the round is 101 fired. 102 Do not attempt to remove or dismantle any components of UXO items. 103 UXO personnel are not authorized to render inert any UXO items found on- site. 104 UXO items will not be taken fr om the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS . 105 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsy lvania Contract Gretna.docx Consider UXO items, which may have been exposed to fire and detonation, as 106 extremely hazardous. 107 Do not rely on the color- coding of UXO items for definitive identification. 108 Assume that a practice UXO item contains a li ve charge until investigation proves 109 otherwise. 110 Do not approach a smoking munition. MEC hazards and precautions are addressed in 111 the Explosives Site Plan /Explosives Management Plan . 112 2.3.4 Biological Hazards 113 Biological hazards include wild animals (raccoons, fox es, snakes, rats, and mice); insect bites 114 and stings (ticks, bees, mosquitoes); and poisonous plants. A poster indicating the various types 115 of hazardous plants and reptiles to avoid will be displayed at the site trailer. Site personnel will 116 be instructed to be alert for and to avoid wild animals, to wear long pants and shirts while 117 working in brush, and to use insect repellent as well as poison- ivy block and cleanser. Any site 118 worker who is known to be allergic to insect bites will be required to inform the UXOSO/SSHO 119 and to carry an allergy response kit. First -aid providers will also be trained in the proper first -aid 120 procedures for bites . Personnel will receive instruction in recognition of biological hazards and 121 in using appropriate PPE and/or procedures to follow in the event that biological hazards create a 122 concern and first-aid treatment is required . 123 2.3.4.1 Nonionizing Radiation 124 The most likely exposure to nonionizing radiation is the sun. Personnel will receive instruction in 125 using appropriate PPE and/or procedures to follow in the event that nonionizing radiation creates 126 a concern and the use of sunscreen and hats is required . 127 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 2-2 128 129 Chemicals of Concern 130 Analytes of Concern and Methods CAS Number Exposure Li mits Characteristics Routes of Exposure Symptoms and Effects of Exposure Lead 7439- 92-1 REL: TWA 0.05 mg/m3 eyes; hypotension 131 = Inhalation MW = molecular weight mmHg = millimeter of mercury 132 ING = Ingestion mg/m3 = milligrams per cubic meter REL = Recommended Exposure Limit for a 10 -hour, TWA. 133 CON = Skin and/or eye contact BP = boiling point IDLH = Immediately dangerous to life an d health. 134 IP = ionization potential \u00b0F = degrees Fahrenheit TWA = time -weighted average 135 CAS = Chemical Abstracts Service Sp Gr =specific gravity PEL = Permissible Exposure Limit for an 8 -hour TWA. 136 NA = not available VP = vapor pressure 137 Former MRS Boundary NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS 181 Acres File: Manheim, PA. 1975 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West Lebanon County, PA Coordinate System: UTM, Z18N, WGS84, Meter \u00b10 1,000 750 1,125 MetersFIGURE 2-1 Regiona l Location Map NDNOD S Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Lebanon County, PennsylvaniaU.S Army Corps Of Engineers NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRSLegend Former MRS Boundary NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS(PAHQ-008-R-01)NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range West MRS (PAHQ-008-R-01) 181 AcresFormer MRS BoundarySuspected Range Firing Point 3 inch Stokes Mortar Cluster LocationConewago CreekConewago Hill Route 117 File: Y:\\NDNODS\\Mount Gretna\\MXD\\SI\\MRS_Range_Locations.mxd, 9/18/2015 2:53:42 PM, johna C a m p D a w s o n C o n t o n m e n t B o u n d a r y PROJ: 03886.551.0089/23/2015 Revision: 0NOTES:Aerial Data Source: ESRI Imagery Mapping Service, 2011 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range Lebanon County, PA \u00b10 500 1,000 1,500 Feet 0 180 360 540 MetersFIGURE 2-2 MRS Location Map NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West Lebanon County, PennsylvaniaUS Army Corps Of Engineers Coordinate System: UTM, Z18N ,WGS84, Meter Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRSLegend Firing Line Water Features Former MRS Boundary NDNODS Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS(PAHQ-008-R-01)Mortar Cluster Location Parcel Boundary Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 3.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 288 The PPE to be used for this work is described below. Personnel performing operations on- site 289 will be required to use the appropriate level of protection. The minimum level of protection 290 required to begin each activity of this project is shown in Table 6 -1. 291 Table 6-1 292 293 Minimum Level of Protection Requirements 294 Activity Level of Protection Task 1 - Mobilization/Demobilization Level D Task 2 - Land Survey and Mapping Level D Task 3 - Vegetation Clearance Level D Task 4 - Geophysical Surveying Level D Task 5 - MEC Intrusive Activities Level D Task 6 - MC Sampling Level D Task 7 - UTV Level D The effectiveness of the PPE program will be evaluated by the UXOSO/SSHO. If additional 295 hazards are identified requiring a higher level of protection and changes to the program are 296 necessary, the UXOSO/SSHO will inform the EHS Leader and amend the PPE requirements. 297 In accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I - Personal Protective Equipment, PPE will be 298 provided, used, and maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition. T he construction, design, and 299 material of the PPE will provide employees with protection against known or anticipated 300 hazards. The PPE that properly and appropriately fits the employee will be selected . WESTON 301 employees have received OSHA -compliant training. Any concerns regarding the use of 302 appropriate PPE will be brought to the attention of the UXOSO/SSHO, who will contact the EHS 303 Leader for assistance in the evaluation of PPE, as necessary. 304 Work at Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS will be completed in a minimum of Level D PPE. If 305 higher levels of protection are required based on actual site conditions, an addendum to the APP 306 and SSHP will be prepared and approved. 307 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR The UXOSO/SSHO will review the following criteria with employees: 308 Proper selection of PPE. 309 When PPE is anticipated for use. 310 Proper uses and limitations of equipment during temperature extremes, heat/cold 311 stress, and in relation to employee medical conditions. 312 Proper donning and doffing, and adjusting of PPE. 313 Maintenance, cleaning, and storage of PPE. 314 Inspection procedures for PPE. 315 6.1 LEVEL D PERSONAL PRO TECTIVE EQUIPMENT 316 Level D PPE consists of the following: 317 Work clothes such as coveralls, long pants, and shirts with sleeves . 318 American National Standards Institute (ANSI) -compliant safety boots. 319 ANSI Class 2 high -visibility reflective vest. 320 Safety glasses (ANSI/American Society of Safety Engineers Z87.1). 321 Nitrile gloves for field work that involves potential exposure to chemicals of concern. 322 Leather gloves (hand tool operations). 323 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx 7. MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE 324 7.1 MEDICAL SUPPORT FUNCTIONS 325 Since 1980, WESTON has used a comprehensive Occupational Health Program (OHP) that 326 complies with OSHA and USACE requirements. All personnel who enter the Mount Gretna 327 TCAR - West MRS when operations are being conducted must comply with a comparable OHP. 328 All medical records are maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1020. If an unforeseen 329 hazard becomes evident during the performance of work, the UXOSO/SSHO will bring such 330 hazard information to the attention of the EHS Leader and USACE , both verbally and in writing 331 for resolution as soon as possible. In the interim, the necessary action will be taken to reestablish 332 and maintain safe working conditions. Medical certifications for site personnel are sum marized 333 in Table 5 -1. P ersonnel certifications will be available on -site for review. 334 7.2 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAM 335 To comply with OSHA requirements, WESTON has designated Dr. Peter Greaney of 336 WorkCare\u00ae to oversee the site -specific medical surveillance and OH P. Dr. Greaney is a board- 337 certified physician in internal and occupational medicine. Dr. Greaney can be reached during 338 regular business hours at (800) 455-6155. 339 The purpose of the OHP is to ensure suitable job placement of employees, to monitor the health 340 effects of hazards encountered in the workplace, and to maintain and to promote good health 341 through preventive measures. Medical examination criteria are established by WorkCare in 342 compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120. 343 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 8. EXPOSURE MONITORING/ AIR SAMPLING PROGRAM 344 Based on the hazard/risk assessment of the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS , the nature of the 345 work, and previous experience performing UXO operations, it is not expected that any airborne 346 contaminants or nuisance dust level exposure limits will be exceeded. A s a result, no air 347 monitoring or air sampling will be performed. If conditions change, the AHAs and SSHP will be 348 amended. Subsequently, WESTON would perform required monitoring to evaluate the 349 effectiveness of prescribed PPE and to evaluate potential work exposure. Any amendment to the 350 plan will be reviewed and approved by the EHS Leader and accepted by USACE . 351 In the event that well installation is necessary, air monitoring for volatile organic compounds , 352 explosive atmosphere s, and oxygen would be conducted using a flame ionization 353 detector/photoionization detector to ensure that no exposures occur during drilling activities. 354 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 9. HEAT AND COLD STRESS /WEATHER 355 Personnel will be provided information about heat and cold stress symptoms. Weather conditions 356 will be d iscussed during morning safety briefings. 357 9.1 HEAT STRESS 358 One of the most common types of stress that can affect field personnel is heat stress. Heat stress 359 can be a serious hazard to workers at project sites because of the PPE required. The 360 UXOSO/SSHO is res ponsible for evaluating the conditions, work tasks, and requirements for 361 PPE, and for implementing the emergency response procedures. The following subsections 362 describe the signs and symptoms, monitoring requirements, and prevention and treatment 363 procedure s for heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. These requirements and 364 procedures will be followed at all times. 365 During hot conditions, cool drinking water will be provided for employees. Employees will be 366 encouraged to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes and take breaks in a cooler, shady 367 location. Personnel not acclimated to the climate or taking medications that might make them 368 sensitive to heat should be allowed additional breaks. When possible, work should be scheduled 369 during cooler periods of the day. Personnel working outside should use sun screen with a high 370 SPF. 371 9.1.1 Heat Stress Symptoms and Treatment 372 9.1.1.1 Heat Rash 373 Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, may occur in hot and humid environments where sweat is 374 not easily removed from the surface of the skin by evaporation, and skin is aggravated by 375 chafing clothes. When extensive or complicated by infection, heat rash can be so uncomfortable 376 that it inhibits sleep and impairs a worker's performance. 377 Symptoms \u2014 Mild red rash, especially on ar eas of the body that come into contact 378 with protective gear. 379 Treatment \u2014 Decrease amount of time spent working in protective gear and provide 380 body powder to help absorb moisture and decrease chafing. Heat rash can be 381 prevented by showering, resting in a cool place, and allowing the skin to dry. 382 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 9.1.1.2 Heat Cramps 383 Heat cramps are caused by inadequate electrolyte intake. The individual may be receiving 384 adequate water; however, if not combined with an adequate supply of electrolytes, the blood can 385 thin to the point w here it seeps into the active muscle tissue, causing cramping. 386 Symptoms \u2014 Acute painful spasms of voluntary muscles, most notably of the 387 abdomen and extremities. 388 Treatment \u2014 Move the victim to a cool area and loosen clothing. Have the victim 389 drink 1 to 2 cups of cool potable water or diluted commercial electrolyte solution 390 (e.g., Gatorade\u00ae, Quench\u00ae) immediately, and then every 20 minutes thereafter until 391 symptoms subside. Electrolyte supplements can enhance recovery; however, it is best 392 to double the amount of water required by the dry mix package directions or to add 393 supplemental water to the liquid form. 394 9.1.1.3 Heat Exhaustion 395 Heat exhaustion is a state of weakness or exhaustion caused by the loss of fluids from the body. 396 Heat exhaustion is not as dangerous as heat stroke, but if not properly managed in the field, it 397 may lead to heat stroke. 398 Symptoms \u2014 Pale, clammy, and moist skin, profuse perspiring, and extreme 399 weakness. Body temperature is normal, pulse is weak and rapid, and breathing is 400 shallow. The person may have a headache, may vomit, may feel dizzy, and may be 401 irritable or confused. 402 Treatment \u2014 Move the victim to a cool, air -conditioned or temperature -controlled 403 area, loosen clothing, place in a position with the head lower than the feet (shock 404 prevention) , and allow the victim to rest. Consult a physician. Ensure that the victim 405 is not nauseated or vomiting. If not nauseated or vomiting, give the victim small sips 406 of cool water or diluted electrolyte replenishment solution (1 to 1 dilution with water, 407 or if mixing from powder, double the water added). If this is tolerated, have the 408 victim drink 1 to 2 cups of fluid immediately, and every 20 minutes thereafter until 409 symptoms subside. Seek medical attention at the advice of the consulting physician. 410 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 9.1.1.4 Heat Stro ke 411 Heat stroke is an acute and dangerous reaction to heat stress caused by a failure of the body's 412 heat regulating mechanisms, i.e., the individual's temperature control system (sweating) stops 413 working correctly. Body temperature rises so high that brain damage and death may result if the 414 person is not cooled quickly. 415 Symptoms \u2014 Red, hot, dry skin (although the person may have been sweating 416 earlier); nausea, dizziness, confusion, extremely high body temperature [i.e., 417 104 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) or greater as measured with a tympanic thermometer ], 418 rapid respiratory and pulse rate, seizures or convulsions, unconsciousness or coma. 419 Treatment \u2014 Immediately call for emergency medical assistance. Remove the victim 420 from the source of heat and cool the victim quickly. If the body temperature is not 421 brought down quickly, permanent brain damage or death may result. Remove all PPE 422 and as much personal clothing as decency permits. Fan the person while sponging or 423 spraying with cool or tepid water. Apply ice packs (if available) to the back of the 424 neck, armpits, groin area, or behind the knees. Place the victim flat on his or her back 425 or with head and shoulders slightly elevated. If conscious, and not nauseated or 426 vomiting, the victim may be provided sips of cool water. Do not give the victim 427 coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverages. Emergency medical personnel will take over 428 treatment upon arrival. 429 9.1.2 Heat Stress Prevention 430 The following measures should be followed to prevent heat stress: 431 The most important measure is to prevent heat-related illness through adequate fluid 432 intake. 433 Ensure workers drink 1/2 to 1 quart of liquid per hour in high heat conditions. Most 434 of this liquid should be water. 435 Provide a shaded area for rest breaks. 436 Ensure that adequate shelter is available to pr otect personnel against heat and direct 437 sunlight. When possible, shade the work area. 438 Discourage the intake of caffeinated drinks during working hours. 439 Monitor for signs of heat stress. 440 Encourage workers to maintain a good diet during these periods. In mos t cases, a 441 balanced diet and lightly salted foods should help maintain the body's electrolyte 442 balance. Bananas are especially good for maintaining the body's potassium level. 443 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx If using commercial electrolyte mixes, double the amount of water called for in t he 444 package directions. Indications are that \"full -strength\" preparations taken under high 445 heat stress conditions may actually decrease the body's electrolytes. 446 Acclimate workers to site work conditions by slowly increasing workloads (i.e., do 447 not begin wor k activities with extremely demanding tasks). 448 Encourage workers to wear lightweight, light-colored, loose- fitting clothing. 449 In extremely hot weather, conduct field activities in the early morning and evening. 450 Maintain good hygienic standards through frequent showering and changes of 451 clothing. 452 Allow clothing to dry during rest periods. 453 9.1.3 Heat Stress Monitoring and Work Cycle Management 454 When strenuous field activities are part of ongoing site work conducted in hot weather, the 455 following guidelines should be used to monitor the body's physiological response to heat, and to 456 manage the work cycle, even if workers are not wearing impervious clothing. These procedures 457 should be instituted when the temperature exceeds 70 \u00baF and the tasks and risk analysis indicate 458 an increased risk of heat stress problems. Consult the safety professional (e.g., EHS Leader or 459 CIH) if questions arise as to the need for specific heat stress monitoring. In all cases, the site 460 personnel must be aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stress and be provided adequate rest 461 breaks and proper aid as necessary. The UXOSO/SSHO will conduct heat stress monitoring. The 462 UXOSO/SSHO will use a thermometer for body temperature and a standard thermometer for 463 ambient temperature. 464 NOTE: For purposes of thi s operating practice, a break is defined as a 15 -minute period. 465 A physiological monitoring schedule is determined by following the steps below: 466 Measure the air temperature with a standard thermometer. 467 Estimate the fraction of sunshine by judging the percentage of time the sun is out 468 (refer to Table 9 -1). 469 Calculate the adjusted temperature based on the following formula: 470 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx Adjusted Temperature = Actual Temperature + 13 X (where X = sunshine fraction 471 from Table 9-1 ). 472 Using Table 9 -2, determine the physiological monitoring schedule for fit and 473 acclimated workers for the calculated adjusted temperature. 474 The length of the work period is governed by the frequency of physiological monitoring 475 (Table 9-2). The length of the work period is governed by physiological para meters (heart rate 476 and body temperature). As noted above, the rest period will be set at 15 minutes in duration. To 477 check the heart rate, count the radial pulse for 30 seconds at the beginning of the rest period. If 478 the heart rate exceeds 110 beats per min ute, shorten the next work period by one third and 479 maintain the same rest period. Body temperature can be checked with a tympanic thermometer 480 after work but before the employee drinks water. If the body temperature taken exceeds 99.7\u00b0F , 481 shorten the next work cycle by one third. These adjustments of the work period based on heart 482 rate and body temperature were recommended in OSHA Technical Manual TED 01 -00-015, 483 January 1999, Section III: Chapter 4, Heat Stress. 484 Table 9-1 485 486 Percent Sunshine Factors \u2014Heat Stress Prevention and Monitoring 487 Percent Sunshine (%) Cloud Cover Sunshine Fraction 100 No cloud cover 1.0 50 50% cloud cover 0.5 0 Full cloud cover 0.0 Table 9-2 488 489 Physiological Monitoring Schedule \u2014Heat Stress Prevention and Monitoring 490 Adjusted Temperature Level D (Permeable clothing) 90\u00b0F (32.2\u00b0C) or above After each 45 minutes of work 87.5\u00b0F (30.8\u00b0 C - 32.2\u00b0C ) After each 60 minutes of work 82.5\u00b0F - 87.5\u00b0F (28.1\u00b0C - 32.2\u00b0C) After each 90 minutes of work 77.5\u00b0F - 82.5\u00b0F (25.3\u00b0C - 28.1\u00b0C) After each 120 minutes of work 72.5\u00b0F - 77.5\u00b0F (22.5\u00b0C - 25.3\u00b0C) After each 150 minutes of work Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx 9.2 COLD STRESS 491 In the planning stages of a project, the potential for cold -related hazards are considered during 492 risk assessment. The UXOSO/SSHO must make decisions on the proper safety procedures. The 493 UXOSO/SSHO will be responsible for implementing the program as well as attaining data on 494 cold stress monitoring using a kestrel or other si milar device, which measures wind speed, 495 humidity, and ambient temperature. Each worker must evaluate the risk associated with his or 496 her work and be actively alert to these hazards. Any site worker may stop work if safety 497 procedures are not followed or if the risk is too great. 498 Personnel working outdoors are subject to cold stress at temperatures below 40\u00b0F . Exposure to 499 extreme cold can cause skin injury or death if the core body temperature is unchecked and 500 permitted to drop. Chemical -protective clothing does not provide protection against cold stress 501 and may increase susceptibility. The following subsections describe the signs and symptoms, 502 monitoring requirements, prevention, and treatment procedures for cold stress. These 503 requirements and procedures wil l be followed at all times. 504 During cold conditions, employees will be encouraged to take rewarming breaks. Any employee 505 whose clothes become wet will immediately be wrapped in a blanket and will change into dry 506 clothes as soon as possible. Thermally protective gloves should be worn and extremities covered 507 by appropriate clothing. Clothing should allow sufficient ventilation or wick moisture away from 508 the skin. Metal hand-held equipment should have a barrier between the equipment and skin. 509 9.2.1 Cold Stress Sympto ms and Treatment 510 9.2.1.1 Frostbite 511 Frostbite is the freezing of tissue and most commonly affects the toes, ears, fingers, and face. 512 Frostbite occurs when an extremity loses heat faster than it can be replaced by the circulating 513 blood. Frostbite may result from direct exposure to extreme cold or to cool, high wind. Damp 514 socks or shoes may contribute to frostbite of the toes. 515 Symptoms \u2014 Cold, tingling, aching, or stinging feeling followed by numbness; skin 516 color is red, purple, white, or very pale and is cold to the touch; blisters may be 517 present (in severe cases). 518 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx Treatment \u2014 Call for emergency medical assistance. Move the victim indoors 519 and/or away from additional exposure to cold, wet, and wind. Wrap the affected area 520 in a soft, clean cloth (sterile, if available) . Give a warm drink (water or juices, not 521 coffee, tea or alcohol). Do not allow the victim to smoke. Do not rub the frostbitten 522 part (this may cause gangrene). Do not use ice, snow, gasoline, or anything cold on 523 the frostbitten area. Do not use heat lamps or hot water bottles to rewarm the 524 frostbitten area. Do not place the frostbitten area near a hot stove. Do not break 525 blisters. After rewarming, elevate the area and protect it from further injury. 526 9.2.1.2 Hypothermia 527 Hypothermia means \"low heat\" and is a potentially serious condition. Systemic hypothermia 528 occurs when body heat loss exceeds body heat gain and the body core temperature falls below 529 the normal 98.6\u00baF. Although some hypothermia cases are caused by extremely cold 530 temperatures, most cases develop in air temperatures between 30 \u00baF and 50\u00baF, especially when 531 compounded with water immersion and/or windy conditions. The victim of hypothermia may not 532 know, or may refuse to admit, that he or she is experiencing hypothermia. All personnel must be 533 observant for these signs for themselves and for other team members. 534 Symptoms \u2014 Cool bluish skin; uncontrollable shivering; vague, slow, slurred 535 speech; irritable, behavior; memory lapses; clumsy 536 movements, fumbling hands; fatigue or drowsiness. Be low the critical body core 537 temperature of 95 \u00baF, the body cannot produce enough heat by itself to recover. At 538 this point, emergency measures must be taken to reverse the drop in core temperature. 539 The victim may slip into unconsciousness and can die in less than 2 hours after the 540 first signs of hypothermia are detected. Treatment and medical assistance are critical. 541 Treatment \u2014 Call for emergency medical assistance. Do not leave the victim alone. 542 Prevent further heat loss by moving the person to a warmer location out of wind, wet, 543 and cold. Remove cold, wet clothing, and replace with warm, dry clothing or wrap the 544 victim in blankets. If the victim is conscious, provide warm liquids, candy, or 545 sweetened foods. Carbohydrates are the food most quickly transformed into heat and 546 energy. Do not give the victim alcohol or caffeine. Have the person move his or her 547 arms and legs to create muscle heat. If he or she is unable to move, place warm 548 bottles or hot packs on the arm pits, groin, neck, and head. Do not rub the arms and 549 legs or place the person in warm water. 550 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 9.2.2 Prevention and Protection 551 The following general guidelines are recommended for preventing or minimizing cold stress: 552 Wear loose, layered clothing, masks, woolen scarves, and hats . Wear liners under 553 hard hats. 554 Protect hands with gloves or mittens. 555 Never touch cold metal with bare hands. 556 Wear waterproof, slip -resistant, insulated boots. 557 Use chemical foot and hand warmers (commercially available) inside boots and 558 gloves. 559 In extreme cold, cover the mouth and nose with wool or fur to \"pre -warm\" the air you 560 breathe. 561 If wearing a face protector, remove it periodically to check for frostbite. 562 Ensure that clothing remains secure around the body, especially at the neck and waist. 563 If required to wear chemical protective clothing, remember that it generally does not 564 afford protection against cold stress . In many instances, chemical protective clothing 565 increases susceptibility . Dress carefully if both chemical protection and thermal 566 insulation are required. 567 Remove outer layers to avoid overheating, and remove clothing soaked with 568 perspiration; replace layers to avoid becoming chilled. 569 Keep clothes dry by wearing water -resistant and wind- resistant clothing and 570 outerwear. 571 Wear clothing that will \"breathe\" or allow water vapor to escape. 572 Eat well -balanced meals, ensure adequate intake of liquids and avoid alcoholic 573 beverages . Drink warm, sweet beverages and soups . Limit the intake of caffeinated 574 drinks due to the diuretic and circulatory effects. 575 Use available warm shelters and implement work -rest schedules. 576 If warm shelters are not available, use cars/vehicles as shelters from the cold . (Ensure 577 that tailpipes are not covered by heavy snowfall). 578 Use radiant heaters to provide warmth (if using propane heaters ensure adequate 579 ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning). 580 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx Monitor yourself and others for changes in physical and mental condition. 581 Use the buddy system or supervision to ensure constant protective observation. 582 If heavy work must be done, resulting in sweating/wet clothing, take rest periods in 583 heated shelters and change into dry clothing as necessary. 584 New employees should not work full -time in the cold during the first days of 585 employment until they become accustomed to the working conditions and the use of 586 required prot ective clothing. 587 Include the weight and bulkiness of clothing in estimating the required work 588 performance and weights to be lifted by the worker. 589 Arrange the work in such a way that sitting or standing still for long periods is 590 minimized. 591 Perform work prot ected from drafts to the greatest extent possible . If possible, shield 592 the work area from wind. 593 Table 9 -3 and Table 9-4 should be consulted to adjust working schedules for wind chill 594 conditions based on equivalent chill temperature. These tables are guidelines only; ambient 595 temperatures and wind conditions should be monitored frequently, and work schedules adjusted 596 as required. If workers show signs or symptoms of cold stress, the work schedule must be 597 adjusted, as required. 598 9.2.3 Work/Warming Regimen 599 Work should be performed during the warmest part of the day. If work is performed 600 continuously in cold or winter conditions or where rain or cool winds are expected, provide 601 heated warming shelters, tents, cabins, or break rooms nearby. Encourage workers to use the 602 shelter at regular intervals, depending on the severity of the cold exposure. Table 9 -4, Cold 603 Work/Warm -up Schedule for 4- Hour Shifts, provides guidance for working in severe cold 604 weather. The onset of heavy shivering and/or the feeling of excessive fatigue, drowsiness, 605 irritability, or euphoria indicate the need to immediately return to the shelter. Pain, numbness, or 606 tingling in the extremities is indication of the need to immediately return to the shelter. When 607 entering the heated shelter, the outer layer of clothing should be removed and the remainder of 608 the clothing loosened to permit sweat evaporation, or the worker should change into dry clothing. 609 Never return to work in wet clothing. 610 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 613 614 Table 9-4 615 616 Cold Work/Warm -up Schedule for 4 -Hour Shifts 617 Equivalent Chill Temperature Maximum Work Period Number of Breaks -24\u00b0F Normal 1 -25\u00b0F to -29\u00b0F 75 minutes 2 -30\u00b0F to -34\u00b0F 55 minutes 3 -35\u00b0F to -39\u00b0F 40 minutes 4 -40\u00b0F to -44\u00b0F 30 minutes 5 -45\u00b0F Stop work Stop work 9.3 WEATHER HAZARDS 618 It is possible that severe weather will occur during this project. In the event that a storm threatens 619 the area through observation of a storm system (lightning observation and thunder), all field 620 work will be halted and weather service bulletins and civil defense messages will be monitored 621 on local radio or through cell phone applications. The UXOSO/SSHO will determine through 622 visual observations and weather updates (gathered through the radio or cell phone) when it is 623 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx necessary to halt work and when to re -start field activities, which include observing the \"30-30\" 624 rule that states: 625 If you see lightning and thunder is heard within 30 seconds (approximately 6 miles), 626 seek shelter. 627 If you hear thunder, but did not see the lightning, assume that lightning is within 628 6 miles and seek shelter. 629 Remain in the shelter for 30 minutes following the last lightning strike. 630 When a tornado warning goes into effect, the following actions will be taken: 631 If in your vehicle: Leave your vehicle and seek shelter in a sturdy building. As a last 632 resort, seek shelter in a ditch or culvert. 633 In buildings: Take shelter in an interior hallway on a lower floor. A closet, bathroom, 634 or other small room with short, stout walls will give some protection from collapse 635 and flying debris. Otherwise, get under heavy furniture and stay away from the 636 windows. 637 Out in open country: Seek inside shelter immediately. If a tornado approaches, lie flat 638 in the nearest depression, such as a ditch or culvert, and cover your head with your 639 arms. 640 Additionally, when wind speed exceeds 40 miles per hour , the following actions will be take n: 641 Follow manufacturer instructions in assessing the limitations associated with field 642 equipment. 643 Shut down outdoor activities involving work at elevation. 644 Move mobile items stored outside to indoor locations. 645 Secure any items that cannot be moved inside. 646 Be careful opening exterior doors. 647 Stay away from power lines. 648 Be cautious about downed power lines, tree limbs, and debris on roads. 649 If weather remains unstable for more than 1 hour, the UXOSO/SSHO will monitor weather 650 bulletins to further assess changing conditions. 651 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 10. STANDARD OPERATING SAFETY PROCEDURES, 652 ENGINEERING CONTROLS, AND WORK PRACTICES 653 Using common sense, operating under the \"buddy system\" (or two- person rule), and following 654 safe practices can reduce the hazards of normal project activities. 655 The general site safety procedures contained in the WESTON Corporate EHS Program field 656 operating procedures guide (which will be on- site) will be followed, and no running or horseplay 657 will be allowed at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS . 658 10.1 SITE RULES/PROHIBITIONS 659 10.1.1 Buddy System 660 All work at Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS will be performed using the buddy system. Team 661 members will keep in contact with each other at all times. Team members will be made aware of 662 any slip, trip, and lifting hazards along with any potential exposure to chemical substances, heat 663 or cold stress, and general hazards within their work area. 664 10.1.2 Designated Eating/Break Areas 665 Eating and break areas will be located away from the active work area. No food or beverages 666 will be allowed in any work environments. 667 10.1.3 Designated Smoking Areas 668 All regulations governing approved areas for smoking and spark generation will be strictly 669 followed. Smoking is prohibited except in designated smoking areas. The UXOSO/SSHO will 670 identify designated smoking areas. Discarding tobacco materials other than into designated 671 tobacco receptacles is considered littering and is subject to fines. 672 10.2 WORK PERMITS 673 No facility work permits are associated with this project. 674 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 10.3 MATERIAL HANDLING PR OCEDURES 675 Work areas and means of access will be maintained in a safe and orderly condition. Tools, 676 materials, extension cords, hoses , or debris will not cause tripping or other hazards. Storage and 677 construction sites will be kept free from the accumulation of combustible materials. There are no 678 radioacti ve materials present on -site. Drum, container, and/or tank handling is not anticipated 679 during this project. Spill contingencies are listed in Section 15. 680 10.4 SPILLS 681 Employees will be handling small quantities of fuel during brush clearing operations. Spill 682 prevention measures and response procedures for small spills are provided in Section 15. 683 10.5 DRUM/CONTAINER TANK HANDLING 684 No drums or container handling will be part of this project. 685 10.6 DRUG AWARENESS AND DRUG -FREE WORKPLACE 686 WESTON fully supports all aspects of the Drug -Free Workplace Act of 1988. WESTON has 687 implemented a Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedure No. 08.04. This procedure is in accordance 688 with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 23.500. Strict disciplinary actions are 689 enforced for any violation of WESTON's Drug -Free Workplace policy. All WESTON 690 employees, as a condition of employment, have documented understanding and receipt of this 691 policy. 692 While on duty, employees will not use or be under the influence of alcohol, narcotics, 693 intoxicants, or similar mind -altering substances. Employees found to be under the influence of or 694 consuming such substances will be immediately removed from the job site. Contractors will also 695 adhere to WESTON's drug- free workplace requirements. 696 Any employee under a physician's treatment and taking prescribed narcotics or any medication, 697 including over -the- counter medication, that may prevent a person from being ready, willing, and 698 able to safely perform his/her duties will provide a medical clearance statement to his/her 699 supervisor from the attending physician. 700 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx WESTON's Operating Practice emphasizes supervisor training, a provision for self -referral to 701 treatment, and maximum respect for individual confidentiality as well as a provision for 702 identifying and dealing with illegal dr ug users, including testing. WESTON's practice also 703 provides for education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available community 704 resources. 705 10.7 EMPLOYEE DUTY SCHEDU LE/BASIC FATIGUE MAN AGEMENT PLAN 706 10.7.1 Employee Duty Schedule 707 Personnel will follow W ESTON's Employee Schedule. If extended periods of working long 708 hours are required, the UXOSO/SSHO will monitor employees for outward signs of fatigue. 709 Employee rotations may need to be adjusted to allow for individual differences in how fatigue - 710 related str ess is handled and for employee-specific roles on the project. 711 When employees are working extended hours, employee travel time to and from work will be 712 minimized to allow for sufficient rest and travel time should be taken into account in determining 713 limits on hours per day and per week. Group transportation to and from the work location and 714 lodging will be used to address this situation. Consideration should be given to \"awake\" time and 715 not just the hours logged on a timesheet. 716 10.7.2 Fatigue Symptoms 717 Intrinsic S ymptoms 718 Physical \u2014 Frequent, unexplainable headaches, muscle aches and pains, breathing 719 difficulties, blurred/double vision, and/or burning urination. 720 Mental \u2014 Difficulty focusing attention, distracted easily, depression, impaired 721 judgment, and/or poor visual perception. 722 Extrinsic Symptoms 723 Physical \u2014 D egraded motor skills, tenseness and tremors, intolerant/irritable, 724 increased reaction time, and/or social withdrawal. 725 Mental \u2014 Absentmindedness, poor short -term memory, lack of interest and drive, 726 confusion and fearfulness, slow startle response, worry, and/or anxiety. 727 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 10.7.3 Fatigue Management 728 WESTON employees and subcontractors should not work in excess of 84 hours per week 729 (12 hours/day - 7 days/week) unless approved by the PM .

Visitors will be escorted by site 735 personnel. 736 10.8.2 Site Control 737 The Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS is located within a non- secured area because the MRS 738 lies within both commercial and residential zoned properties . Sign-in procedures for all project 739 staff will be required f or access to the site , and coordination with the property owners will be 740 conducted daily during site activities to ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed. 741 10.8.3 Theft 742 On-site theft of equipment is not expected. No equipment or valuable items will be kept inside 743 vehicles. If it is necessary that equipment remain inside a vehicle, it will be kept out of obvious 744 sight, and the vehicle will be locked and all windows closed. Personnel will secure vehicles, even 745 if parking for only brief periods, and will carr y vehicle keys with them at all times. Vehicles will 746 be parked in well- lit areas. 747 In the event a theft does occur, local authorities will be promptly notified and appropriate 748 WESTON personnel will be notified. Notice of Incident ( NOI) Track information will be 749 completed within 24 hours. 750 10.8.4 Confrontation 751 Personnel will be observant of their surroundings. They should ensure their own safety, the 752 safety of their co -workers, and the safety of the public by not confronting or challenging 753 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR National Guard, USACE , and the 754 appropriate authorities should be contacted if site personnel observe any unusual circumstances. 755 10.9 MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY 756 Safety is of utmost importance at WESTON. Employees must act responsibly every day to 757 ensure the safety of themselves and others. This safety commitment also applies when driving 758 vehicles. All employee drivers are required to operate vehicles safely, obeying federal, state, and 759 local laws, and company policies. Driving is a privilege, not a right. 760 10.10 TRAFFIC 761 Posted speed limits will be obeyed at all times, and seat belts will be worn when driving. All 762 drivers will be licensed. All geophysical, UXO, and sampling activities will be coordinated to 763 minimize impacts to nearby traffic and roads , and safety distances shall be adhered to for all site 764 activities. 765 10.10.1 Employee Requirements/Responsibilities 766 Compliance with all federal, state, and local laws is expected. 767 Drivers of WESTON vehicles must possess a current, valid driver's license of the appropri ate 768 class required for their driving needs, e.g., Class C, Commercial Driver's License. 769 All driving duties and functions are to be performed in a safe, legal, and professional manner. 770 Employee drivers are to attend periodic defensive driving training and other driver safety 771 meetings as scheduled through their local Safety Officers. 772 Driving requires a high level of skill and alertness. When fatigue, illness, or medication impact 773 alertness, reflexes, and decision -making capabilities, an employee driver should cease driving 774 until the situation improves or is corrected and contact his/her manager to discuss the situation. 775 Unsafe vehicles and related equipment will be reported and repaired. Unsafe vehicles are not to 776 be driven for WESTON business. 777 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx NOITrack will b e used to report any vehicle accident while on the job or any accident occurring 778 at any time if a company -owned or insured \"allowance\" vehicle is involved. 779 A driver orientation program and/or driving evaluation tests may be required of drivers to assess 780 overall driving skills. 781 10.10.2 Compliance Issues/Driving Practices 782 10.10.2.1 Speed Limits 783 Drivers are required to obey posted speed limits and other traffic laws. Fines for any traffic 784 violations are the employee's responsibility . 785 10.10.2.2 Seat Belts 786 WESTON drivers and their pass engers are required to wear seat belts at all times while the 787 vehicle is in operation. 788 10.10.2.3 Distracted Driving 789 It is recognized that distracted driving can contribute to accidents; accordingly, WESTON 790 employees are to exercise caution and good judgment when driving. Reading maps, eating, 791 placing or receiving a call on a cell phone, and other activities may contribute to an accident. 792 Cell phone use while driving, including the use of hands -free devices, creates a distraction and 793 driver inattention. The following basic guidelines should always be observed: 794 Make outgoing calls after you have pulled over to a safe area. 795 Let incoming calls go to voice mail, or if answering the phone is necessary, make 796 sure the caller knows you are driving and keep the call short. Be aware of local or 797 state laws governing the use of cell phones while driving. 798 At all times, drivers are to operate vehicles in a safe, legal, and professional manner. 799 10.10.2.4 Transporting Weapons 800 Transporting weapons (such as firearms, large knives) or dangerous property (significant or 801 placardable quantities of regulated hazardous materials or substances) is prohibited unless 802 specifically authorized. 803 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 10.10.3 Other Issues 804 Additional safety procedures may be established at a particular job site or within a Division. 805 WESTON employees are responsible for compliance with any additional safety procedures and 806 safety solutions that apply or that may be identified. 807 10.11 SANITATION 808 Employers will establish and maintain hygienic sanitation provisions for all employees in all 809 places of employment. General housekeeping activities will occur daily . 810 10.11.1 Drinking Water 811 An adequate supply of potable water will be provided in all places of employment, for both 812 drinking and personal cleansing. Cool drinking water (bottled water) will be provided. 813 10.11.2 Toilets 814 Toilets are required in all places of employment.

Organics, such as foods, will be wrapped and 819 then properly discarded to avoid attracting pests. 820 10.11.4 Waste Disposal 821 A dumpster or other disposal container for garbage will be made available. 822 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 11. SITE CONTROL The UXOSO/SSHO coordinates access control and security on -site. Because of the nature of the 824 activities, only authorized personnel are allowed in the work zone. Authorized personnel are 825 those who have completed the required training and who meet medical requirements. 826 Unauthorized personnel will not be allowed in the work zone. The potential of cross - 827 contamination is not applicable to this project based on the project characterization. 828 During on- site operations, the UXOSO/SSHO will order operations to cease if nonauthorize d 829 personnel are observed within the operating area. To ensure safety, site controls include the 830 following: 831 Eating, drinking, and smoking are prohibited except in designated areas. 832 Operations will cease if nonauthorized personnel are present. 833 The UXOSO/SSHO or his designee will escort authorized site visitors. 834 All personnel entering the site, including visitors, will wear the proper PPE and sign 835 in and out on the Site Control Log. 836 The UXOSO/SSHO will maintain the Site Control Log to ensure accurate 837 accountab ility of personnel on- site. 838 The UXOSO/SSHO will provide an SSHP safety briefing to all personnel entering the 839 Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS to inform them of potential site hazards. Personnel 840 must acknowledge this briefing by signing the SSHP Review Form. 841 In case of an emergency, personnel will exit the Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS 842 and move to a designated safe area. The UXOSO/SSHO will determine the 843 designated safe area that is located upwind of the MRS . The UXOSO/SSHO will 844 notify the PM and the EHS Leader if an emergency warrants site evacuation. 845 11.1 ON-SITE COMMUNICATIONS 846 In an emergency, important messages will be conveyed quickly and accurately. Verbal 847 communication will be the primary form of communication at the Mount Gretna TCAR - West 848 MRS . The anticipated distance between the site workers will be no more than 1,000 yards . 849 Verbal communication can be impeded by on- site background noise and the use of PPE. A 850 vehicle horn or air horn will be available with each team for emergency alerting purposes. 851 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR SSHP Gretna.docx Outside support sources will be reached, assistance obtained, and measures for public 852 notification ensured, if necessary. Separate internal emergency signals will be developed and 853 rehearsed daily at safety meetings. External communications will be obtained through cellular 854 phones or radios located at the facility , and procedures will be posted in a location accessible to 855 site workers. 856 The emergency telephone numbers, which are listed in Tables 15-1 through 15-3, will be 857 prominently posted in WESTON's field vehicles. The emergency telephone numbers, along with 858 the APP and SSHP, OSHA 300 Log, safety and health promotional posters, date of last work day 859 injury, and OSHA Safety and Health poster, will be kept unobstructed and readily available to 860 the workers. 861 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 12. DECONTAMI NATION 862 12.1 CONTAMINATION PREVEN TION 863 Based on field tasks and appropriate PPE usage, no contact with contamination is expected. 864 12.2 PERSONAL HYGIENE 865 Employees will practice sound hygiene practices, including washing hands, face, and arms at the 866 hygiene station after operations have concluded. Appropriate hand- washing facilities with soap 867 will be available at the facility. In addition, hand sanitizer will be available. Following Centers 868 for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, personnel should wet their hands with clean 869 running water and apply soap. Use warm water if it is available. Rub hands together to form 870 lather and scrub all surfaces. Continue rubbing hands for 20 seconds. Rinse hands well under 871 running water, then dry hands using paper towels. If possible, use that same paper towel to turn 872 off the faucet. Good personal hygiene should be in effect at all times. 873 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 13. EQUIPMENT DECONTAMIN ATION 874 All equipment and tools will be cleaned prior to site entry to remove grease, oil, dirt, or any other 875 off-site materials. The UXOSO/SSHO will inspect the equipment prior to approving the items 876 for use on- site. The UXOSO/SSHO is responsible for inspecting equipment for adequate 877 decontamination prior to removal off- site. 878 Sampling equipment will undergo a dry gross decontamination. Dedicated sampling equipment 879 will be used to the extent practicable. 880 13.1 DISPOSITION OF DECON TAMINATION WASTE 881 Any excess sample soil will be returned to the sample hole after completing sampling, and PPE 882 and other disposable sampling equipment will be double -bagged and disposed of as solid waste 883 unless elevated concentrations are detected for metals or explosives during MC sampling. 884 No other investigation- derived waste (IDW) is anticipated during this sampling. If site 885 information nece ssitates sampling additional matrices and using alternative sampling approaches, 886 a change to this document will be completed detailing the IDW anticipated and the procedures 887 and protocols required for disposal. 888 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 14.

The evacuation route and predetermined meeting location map will be 914 reviewed with all employees prior to the start of work and prior to the start of each new task. 915 Within a few days of the startup of work, a drill will be run for the emergency response plan. 916 WESTON has evaluated the emergency medical services. The UXOSO/SSHO will have a roster 917 of individuals on-site so that they can be accounted for in the event of an emergency. 918 15.2 PERSON NEL AND LINES OF AUTHORITY FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS 919 Fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) will provide support as necessary. The 920 UXOSO/SSHO will be appointed as an Emergency Coordinator (EC), and a system will be 921 implemented to provide a common framework within which people can work together 922 effectively. 923 15.3 CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR EMERGENCY RE COGNITION 924 AND SITE EVACUATION 925 15.3.1 Medical Emergency and Personal Injury 926 The first worker who notices that a medical emergency or personal injury has occurred will 927 immediately make a subjective decision whether the emergency is life- threatening and/or 928 otherwise serious and will then proceed as described in the following subsections. Because of 929 levels of the contaminant of concern (lead), emergency decontamination should be conducted. 930 This will include removal of any PPE and visibly contaminated clothing or footwear. 931 15.3.1.1 Life-Threatening and/or Otherwise Serious Incident 932 If a life -threatening incident occurs, emergency medical assistance will be immediately 933 requested. If an apparent life -threatening and/or otherwise serious incident has occurred, the first 934 person who identifies the situation will summon the UXOSO/SSHO. The UXOSO/SSHO will 935 assume the role of EC. The EC will be apprised of the situation and told where the injured 936 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR person(s) is/are located. As the EC proceeds to the accident scene, communications channels will 937 be opened and kept on standby until the EC has surveyed the scene and performed a primary 938 survey of the injured person. The EC will determine whether emergency assistance should be 939 summoned and what information must be relayed, and will provide emergency action principles 940 that are consistent with the injury. The EC will appoint a staff person or persons who will meet 941 the emergency responders and take them qu ickly to the injured person. If necessary, 942 decontamination of the individual will be performed at the direction of the EC. 943 15.3.2 Non-Life-Thre atening Incident 944 If it is determined that no threat to life is present, the worker will assist the injured person to a 945 safe location and contact the UXOSO/SSHO. The injured person will then be treated and 946 monitored in accordance with standard first-aid procedures and this SSHP. 947 15.3.3 Worker Injury or Illness 948 The UXOSO/SSHO will be responsible for monitoring the general health of site workers. Site 949 illnesses, conditions, or injuries that can be expected given the working conditions include heat 950 stress, construction-related injuries, insect bites, and injuries caused by slips, trips, and falls. 951 These conditions will be prevented by properly training site workers in the appropriate use of 952 health and safety equipment, dressing appropriately, monitoring the breathing zone atmosphere 953 when necessary, and maintaining good housekeeping procedures. 954 The specific response to an injury or illness will depend on its type and severity, but in general, 955 first aid will be administered in the field by the UXOSO/SSHO, who is certified in first aid and 956 CPR. The worker may then be transported to the hospital designated in this SSHP (see Table 957 15-1 and Figure 15-1 for hospital information and directions). General guidelines for first aid are 958 as follows: 959 For minor injuries, routine first-aid procedures will be used and documented. 960 For major injuries, an ambulance will be called immediately and the appropria te first 961 aid administered while awaiting arrival of the ambulance. 962 Trained personnel will use approved measures to administer treatment. 963 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx 15.3.4 Emergency Response 964 During an emergency, the following actions will be taken, with some actions conducted 965 concurrently.

Follow ing the phone call, 1091 WESTON personnel will contact on- site personnel to inform them that emergency service 1092 personnel and equipment will be entering the work area. Subsequent to these notifications, 1093 appropriate WESTON personnel will be contacted and informed regarding the situation. 1094 Information provided by the servicing agencies is provided in Appendix F of the APP. 1095 15.4 SPILL PLAN 1096 The following procedures comprise the spill containment program in place for activities at the 1097 Mount Gretna TCAR - West MRS . Spill procedures will be reviewed by the UXOSO/SSHO 1098 with team members. 1099 15.4.1 Measures for Preventing Fuel Spills 1100 Care shall be taken when transferring fuels. 1101 A containment dike around fuel storage tanks shall be constructed. 1102 Inspect all fuel storage tanks and containment structures for leaks daily. 1103 Where spills, leaks, or ruptures may occur, adequate quantities of spill containment 1104 equipment (e.g., absorbent, pillow, shovels) will be stationed in the immediate area. 1105 The spill containment equipment must be sufficient to contain and isolate the entire 1106 volume of fuel being transferred. 1107 Fire-extinguishing equipment meeting 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart F, shall be on hand 1108 and ready for use to control fires. 1109 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 15.4.2 Fuel Spills Greater than Five Gallons 1110 The following response procedures shall be followed for spills of flammable fuels greater than 1111 5 gallons in volume: 1112 Shut down operation in area immediately. 1113 Limit ignition sources. 1114 Suppress vapors as required. 1115 Survey area with combustible gas indicator , if available; don protective equipment as 1116 necessary. 1117 Pump liquids into drums. 1118 Recover contaminated solids and place in containers. 1119 Clean up all residues. 1120 15.5 FIREFIGHTING PLAN 1121 Potential sources of fuel include grass and leaves. Types of fire suppression systems include 1122 multipurpose ABC portable fi re extinguishers. In case of fire, evacuate the area immediately. 1123 Activate 911 or the established Fire Emergency Number from a safe location. Indicate what is 1124 happening, the location of the fire, and whether there are injuries. Comply with requests from the 1125 911 operator for information. Do not hang up until told to do so by the operator, or allow the 1126 operator to hang up first. Upon completion of the emergency phase, comply with incident 1127 notification procedures. 1128 If the fire is small and manageable with fire -extinguishing equipment at hand, and you are 1129 trained in the use of this equipment, you may make the decision to use this equipment while 1130 waiting for advanced assistance. Never place yourself in danger, always have a plan for escape, 1131 and never attempt to fight a fire if there are any doubts about the type of fire or your ability to 1132 successfully fight the fire. Never allow the fire to get between you and your escape route. 1133 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR that meets 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart F, will be on hand and ready 1135 for use to control fires. The following procedures will be followed: 1136 1. Flammable and Combustible Materials (liquids, gases): 1137 Flammable materials mus t be properly labeled, stored, handled, and used. 1138 No smoking or use of op en flame- producing devices within 50 feet of flammable and 1139 combustible materials. 1140 Obtain SDSs for all flammable materials in use and ensure all personnel are aware of 1141 hazards. 1142 Label all containers with contents, the word \"Flammable\", and in accordance with 1143 hazard communication requirements. 1144 Store materials in well- ventilated areas that are free of ignition sources and flame or 1145 sparks. 1146 Ensure that incompatible materials are stored in remote locations from each other 1147 (e.g., keep flammables from oxidizers). 1148 Limit quantities to minimum required. 1149 Store cylinders in upright and secure positions. 1150 Bond and ground containers as (and where) necessary. 1151 Use proper storage cabinets for flammable and combustible materials. Contact EHS 1152 Staff for assistance. 1153 Use only approved containers. 1154 Use and dispense only in well- ventilated areas. 1155 2. Combustible Materials (solids): 1156 Solid combustible materials include wood, paper, and cloth. Proper housekeeping 1157 reduces concerns for combustion of these materials. Use proper receptacles for 1158 disposal, and dispose of solid combustible materials routinely. 1159 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR 3. Oxidizers: oxidizer is a substance that increases the flammability of materials, allowing them 1161 to burn more easily. Examples include pure oxygen, chlorine, and ammonium nitrate. 1162 Store oxidize rs in a remote location from flammable and combustible materials. 1163 4. Electric Appliances: 1164 Do not use electric appliances near flammable or combustible materials. Never place 1165 an appliance on an unstable surface. Use only Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.- or 1166 Factory Mutual Research Corp.- approved appliances. Follow the manufacturer's 1167 recommendations or requirements for use and maintenance. 1168 5. Smoking: 1169 Smoking is prohibited indoors. Smoking is allowed only in outdoor, designated areas. 1170 Smokers are to maintain smoking areas in a clean and safe condition. Ensure that 1171 receptacles for disposal of cigarettes and other smoking materials are appropriately 1172 constructed, free of combustible debris, and, when necessary, are cool before 1173 emptying into waste receptacles. 1174 6. Housekeepi ng: 1175 Personnel are responsible for keeping work areas free of combustible materials and 1176 debris. 1177 Weeds and grass must be properly maintained to limit potential fire hazard. 1178 The UXOSO/SSHO will document and inspect all project fire extinguishers on a 1179 monthly basis. 1180 15.6 WILD FIRES 1181 15.6.1 Prevention 1182 Site personnel should practice smart fire safety habits and watch out for hazardous conditions. If 1183 conditions are dry, wild fires can pose a threat \u2014not only because there is plenty of fuel to burn, 1184 but also because rural areas and remote locations often do not have easy access for firefighters. 1185 There also is a chance that embers from a fire a mile or more away may fall onto nearby 1186 vegetation and cause them to catch fire. The following preventive measures will be observed: 1187 Smoke only in designated areas. 1188 Avoid driving through high grass or areas where vehicle exhaust or hot engine 1189 surfaces could cause fires. 1190 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Keep a fire extinguisher handy. 1191 Be extra cautious during the dry season and observe warnings and prohibitions 1192 established by the Forestry Service or other agencies. 1193 Be aware of wild fires in neighboring areas. 1194 15.6.2 Aware ness and Response 1195 Wild fires can spread quickly and without warning. A subtle shift in the wind could send the 1196 flames in your direction even though authorities may h ave deemed your area safe. Make sure you 1197 have a plan in place: 1198 Be aware of wild fires in neighboring areas. 1199 Do not attempt to fight forest fires. If fire or smoke is observed, notify all site 1200 personnel, initiate evacuation, and report the fire to the desig nated emergency 1201 agencies. 1202 Designate a place to meet if there is a fire. 1203 Identify multiple places you could evacuate to, such as a motel outside the danger 1204 zone. 1205 It is very easy to panic, but if you remain calm and prepare for emergency situations, you will 1206 increase your chances of evacuating safely. If you are driving: 1207 Roll up your windows and close your air vents. 1208 Drive slowly and turn on your headlights. 1209 Do not drive through heavy smoke. 1210 15.7 MEDICAL SUPPORT 1211 15.7.1 On-Site Medical S upport 1212 In the event specialized/elevated care is necessary, either WESTON or the local on -call 1213 ambulance service will transport the injured person to the Good Samaritan H ospital. The lo cal 1214 Fire and EMS Department can be notified of emergency situations by using the telephone 1215 numbers listed in Table 15-1. There will be fewer than 100 people on -site; therefore, WESTON 1216 will not be providing on- site medical support. 1217 Mount Gretna Training Camp Artillery Range - West MRS Military Munitions Response Program Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania Contract No. W912DR Gretna.docx A first with the criteria contained in ANSI Z308.1 -2009 will be provided 1218 on-site. 1219 For minor injuries, routine f irst-aid procedures will be used and documented. 1220 For major injuries, an ambulance will be called immediately, and the appropriate first 1221 aid administered while awaiting the arrival of the ambulance. 1222 Trained personnel will use approved measures for treatment based on the training 1223 they have received. 1224 15.7.2 Off-Site Medical Support 1225 WESTON has contacted the local emergency resources to verify their availability and ability to 1226 respond to any emergencies encountered (see Appendix F of the APP). 1227 15.7.3 Directions and Map to N earest Hospital 1228 The appropriate emergency vehicle will travel to the closest emergency hospital to the MRS , 1229 which is the Good Samaritan Hospital (see Figure 15-1) .

First Aid: Inhalation Remove person to fresh air. If person is not breathing provide artificial resp iration. If necessary, provide additional oxygen once breathing is restored if trained to do so. Seek medical attention immediately. First Aid: Notes to Physician Acute aspiration of large amounts of oil-laden material may produce a serious aspiration hazard. Patients who aspirate these oils should be followed for the development of long-term sequelae. Repeated aspiration of mineral oil can produce chronic inflammation of the lungs (i.e. li poid pneumonia) that may progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms are often subtle and radiological changes appe ar worse than clinical abnormalities. Occasionally, persistent cough, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, shortness of breath with exertion, fever, and bloody sputum occur. Inhalation exposure to oil mists below cu rrent workplace exposure limits is unlikely to cause pulmonary abnormalities. Preexisting disorders of the fo llowing organs (or organ systems) may be aggravated by exposure to this material: skin. * * * Section 5 - Fire Fighting Measures * * * General Fire Hazards See Section 9 for Flammability Properties. Never use welding or cutting torch on or near drum (even empty) because product (even just residue) can ignite explosively. No special fire hazards are known to be associated with this product.

Safety Data Sheet Material Name: Hess 10W40 Motor Oil ____________________________________________________________ Page 3 of 8 Revision Date 8/30/12 Hazardous Combustion Products May form: carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, ox ides of sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorous, various hydrocarbons. Extinguishing Media SMALL FIRES: Any extinguisher suitable for Class B fires, dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fire fighting foam, or gaseous extinguishing agent. LARGE FIRES: Water spray, fog or fire fighting foam. Water may be ineffective for fighting the fire, but may be used to cool fire-exposed containers. Unsuitable Extinguishing Media None Fire Fighting Equipment/Instructions Small fires in the incipient (beginning) stage may typically be extinguished using handheld portable fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment. Firefighting ac tivities that may result in potential exposure to high heat, smoke or toxic by-products of combustion shou ld require NIOSH/MSHA- appr oved pressure-demand self- contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece and full protective clothing. Isolate area around container involved in fire. Cool tanks, shells, and containers expo sed to fire and excessive heat with water. For massive fires the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles may be advantageous to further minimize personnel exposure. Major fires may require withdrawal, allowing the tank to burn. Large storage tank fires typically require specially trained personnel and equipment to extinguish t he fire, often including the need for properly applied fire fighting foam. * * * Section 6 - Accidental Release Measures * * * Recovery and Neutralization Carefully contain and stop the source of the spill, if safe to do so. Materials and Methods for Clean-Up Take up with sand or other oil absorbing materials. Care fully shovel, scoop or sweep up into a waste container for reclamation or disposal. Caution, flammable vapors may accumulate in closed containers. SMALL SPILL: Absorb liquid on vermiculite, floor absorbe nt or other absorbent material. Persons not wearing proper personal protective equipment should be excluded from area of spill. LARGE SPILL: Prevent run-off to sewers, streams, or other bodies of water. If run-off occurs, notify authorities as required, that a spill has occurred. Persons not wearing proper personal protective equipment should be excluded from area of spill until clean-up has been completed. Emergency Measures Evacuate nonessential personnel and remove or secure all i gnition sources. Consider wind direction; stay upwind and uphill, if possible. Evaluate the dire ction of product travel, diking, sewers , etc. to confirm spill areas. Spills may infiltrate subsurface soil and groundwater; professi onal assistance may be necessary to determine the extent of subsurface impact.

Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment. Hygiene measures Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smo king and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Personal protection Eyes Avoid contact with eyes. Safety glasses with side shields. Skin and body Avoid contact with skin and clothing. Wear suitable protective clothing. Respiratory Use only with adequate ventilation. Do not breathe vapor or mist. If ventilation is inadequate, use a NIO SH-certified respirator with an organic vapor cartridge and P95 particulate filter. CAUTION: The protection provided by air-purifying respirators is limited. Use a positive pressure air-supplied respirator if there is any potential for an uncontrolled release, if exposure levels are not known, or if concentrations exceed the protection limits of air-purifying respirator. Hands Wear gloves that cannot be penetrated by chemicals or oil. The correct choice of protect ive gloves depends upon the chemicals being handled, the conditions of work and use, and the condition of the gloves (even the best chemically resistant glove will break down after repeated chemical exposures). Most gloves provide only a short time of protection before they must be discarded and replaced. Because specific work environments and material handling practices vary, safety procedures should be developed for each intended application. Gloves should therefore be chosen in consultation with the supplier/manufacturer and with a full assessment of the working conditions.

Toxicological information Acute toxicity Classification Naphthalene 2B Possible - fuel, diesel no. 2 3 - -Product/ingredient name NTP IARC OSHA Aspiration of this product into the lungs can cause chemical pneumonia and can be fatal. Aspiration into the lungs can occur while vomiting after ingestion of this product. Do not siphon by mouth. Middle distillate: From skin-painting studies of petroleum distillates of similar composition and distillate range, it has been shown that these types of materials often possess weak carcinogenic activity in laboratory animals. In these tests, the material is painted on the shaved backs of mice twice a week for their lifetime. The material is not washed off between applications. Therefore, there may be a potential risk of skin cancer from prolonged or repeated skin contact with this product in the absence of good personal hygiene. This particular product has not been tested for carcinogenic activity, but we have chosen to be cautious in light of the findings with other distillate streams. Occasional skin contact with this product is not expected to have serious effects, but good personal hygiene should be practiced and repeated skin contact avoided. This product can also be expected to produce skin irritation upon prolonged or repeated skin contact. Personal hygiene measures taken to prevent skin irritation are expected to be adequate to prevent risk of skin cancer. Diesel exhaust particulates have been classified by the National Toxicological Program (NTP) to be a reasonably anticipated human carcinogen. Exposure should be minimized to reduce potential risk. Naphthalene has been reported to cause developmental toxicity in mice after oral exposure to relatively high dose levels, but developmental toxicity was not observed in NTP (National Toxicology Program) sponsored studies in rats and rabbits. Ingestion or inhalation of naphthalene can result in hemolysis and other blood abnormalities, and individuals (and infants) deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase may be especially susceptible to these effects. Inhalation of naphthalene may cause headache and nausea. Airborne exposure can result in eye irritation.

As a Release Abatement Measure (RAM) under the provisions of Massachusetts Environmental Regul ations, project goal was to perform in situ Shallow Soil Mixing (SSM) of impacted soil (Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid [LNAPL] and Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid [DNAPL]) over an area of approximately 2.2 acres. Approximately 103,000 cy of soils were stabilized in-place to an average depth of 22 feet below ground surface for this project. The property was the former location of a Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP). Past MGP operations resulted in the release of hazar dous chemicals into the soil and groundwater. Hazardous chemicals, including, but not limite d to, volatile and semivolatile organic compounds were present in soil and groundwater at concentrati ons greater than Reportable Concentrations specified in the Regulations for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

GRETNA\\Bios_Certs\\Hannah_Herold_PRT_Profile.doc The equipment being used to perform the stabilization included the following: a 4000 series Manitowoc crane, a rotary drill table (Caldwell CH-200 capable of developing 350,000 foot-pounds of torque), a 10-foot diameter mixing tool, a batch plant, a Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) system, and a shroud and carbon f ilter. The SVE system was used to collect and treat any hazardous gases that might have be en released during the stabilization process. Cement-Kiln Dust (CKD) and benton ite were the mixing reagents. A spacing of 8.67 feet between the center of ad jacent columns was implemented based on the effective 10-foot column mixed by the 10-foot -diameter mixing tool. This pattern layout allowed mixing of 100% of the soil mass and in cluded approximately 35% overlap of each interior column. The SSM opera tion required approximately 590 columns for treatment of the LNAPL-impacted soils and approximate ly 1,620 columns for treatment of the DNAPL-impacted soils inside the treatment boundary. All columns within the LNAPL stabilization area were stabilized to a depth of 12 feet below the existing ground surface. In areas where both LN APL and DNAPL are present, stabilization occurred to a depth of 2 feet below the clay surface. All columns within the boundary of the DNAPL stabilization area were stabilized to a de pth of 2 feet below the clay surface. Prior to stabilizing the soil, exca vation was performed within the limits of the stabilization area to locate and remove rock obstructions and abandoned subsurface structures to a depth of approximately 22 feet below the existing land surface. The subsurface structures consisted of gas holders, tar tanks, a boiler hous e, and other structures. The obs tructions were either removed or broken in place and removed. The existing gro undwater elevation is approximately 8 to 10 feet below land surface. To reduce the odor s generated during the excavation of the substructures, the disturbed area wa s constantly foamed. [4-00 to 10-00] Site Remediation, Municipal Gas Plant (M GP), Georgetown, DE, Health and Safety Manager. Site remediation project at a small site locat ed within the city limits of Georgetown. A special concern of the client was the proximity (8 feet) of the proposed excavation area to a cold storage food warehouse because differentia l settlement could adversely impact its operations. Additionally, a completion date of April 30, 2001 was mandatory because warehouse operations commenced on May 1, 2001. Initial work consisted of removal of several bu ildings and the foundation of a former gas holder, which involved approximately 150 tons of materi als. A 2-foot wide, 10-foot deep diaphragm wall was installed, which allowed the successful removal of contaminated subsurface soils. A small offset excavator was used to excavate the trench. Bentonite slurry was simultaneously pumped and maintained in the trench during excavation. A truck-mounted drill rig preceded the excavator and augered 18-inch diam eter holes through 22 f eet of soil. The 23 holes were used to set the support columns a nd anchor them in 10 feet of virgin soil. Thereafter, 14 x 73 \"H\" beams spaced 10 to 15 feet from centers were placed in the holes. Upon trench completion, 3,000 psi concrete was pumped into the trench, displacing the slurry and creating the retention wall. The subsurface contaminated soils were excavated and loaded directly into trucks for disposal. Upon completion of back filling activities, final restoration was completed. Weston Solutions, Inc.

[11-00 to 4-01] Shallow Soil Mixing/Soil Vapor Extraction, Pi keton, OH, Department of Energy - MMES, Health and Safety Manager. First full-scale project to use Shallow Soil Mixing (SSM)/Thermally Enhanced Vapor Extraction (TEVE) and Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) to remove VOCs contamination from a waste dispos al area. The site at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, OH, was contaminat ed to a depth of 22 feet. The cleanup was completed without excavation and the soils remained in place after treatment in accordance with Ohio EPA approvals. SSM was performed with 8- to 12-foot diamet er mixing tools. The site consisted of primarily silty and clayey soils with a groundwater table 15 feet below the surface. Trichloroethylene (TCE) contamination was spread over the site at levels that varied from 1 to 500 ppm. The VOCs were mobilized by SSM and TEVE and removed through an SVE treatment unit. Considerable experimentation was required in au ger/mixer designs, procedures, additives, and equipment during the work. Hydrogen peroxide was experimentally used during part of the process. Much of the work was performed in harsh winter conditions. Work was performed around the clock, 7 days per week to avoid state-mandated liquidated damages. Geo-Con completed the project on time and remove d 200% of the planned amount of VOCs. The specified objective of the Work Plan was to remove or destroy a minimum of 70 % of the VOCs. More than 90% of the VOCs were rem oved. This project was the first full-scale implementation of SSM/SVE and is being used as the model for future DOE cleanups. [5-96 to 7-96] Site Remediation Island Sports Comple x Neville Land Company, Excavation and Disposal, Neville Island, PA, Health and Safety Manager. Site remediation of a former steel byproducts waste disposal site entailed completi on of a slurry cutoff wall, 9-acre multi-layer geomembrane cap, river bank slope stabilizatio n, monitoring well abandonment, gas well abandonment, placement of 200,000 cy of soil fi ll, building and ancillary demolition, and installation of subsurface u tilities for future use. The project was a one-of-a-kind Superfund site where a multi-discipline sports complex was constructed above the cap. The complex consists of four ice hockey surfaces, batting cages, a nine-hole golf course, an indoor /outdoor golf dome, and a restaurant. The project presented significant challenges because the work scope was not initially developed and evolved as it progressed. This situation required significant ma nagement and scheduling demands to keep the project on track and within budget. The primary contaminants of concern on this site were aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated monitoring on-site consisted of use of a photoionization detector (PID) for Weston Solutions, Inc. Herold S.

Meteorol ogical conditions were tracked da ily by using the Internet to collect weather data that provided current weat her conditions (e.g., temper ature, wind direction, humidity, precipitation). [4-00 to 11-00] Rocky Mountain Arsenal Site Remediation; Soil Treatment (Lead, Pesticides, Chemical Agent, CO, Rocky Mountain PMC, Health and Safety Manager. Contractor at Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Denver, CO, for completio n of a soil remediation project. The project consisted of the remediation of material in form er disposal pits that contained waste from the manufacture of chemical weapons on the Arsenal. The material in the pits was excavated and combined with the clean soil surrounding the pits. This mixture was then fed through a pugmill plant where it was mixed with cement and wa ter to produce a stab ilized end product. The primary contaminants treated were heavy me tals such as arsenic, lead and mercury. The maximum mercury concentration in soil equa led 94.0 mg/kg. The 6% cement in the mixture was designed to bind the metals and reduce the leachability, achieving the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) criteri a. The treated material was hauled to the on-post landfill. Initially completed trial batches of various cement contents to determine what would be used during full-scale production. Th e entire project was performed under Level B PPE. Additionally, in order to minimize the possibili ty of vapors being released during the pugmill mixing, a custom built vapor extraction and treatment system was attached to the pugmill mixing chamber. Proper blending of the pit ma terial and the clean surrounding material was achieved with a system of screens and belts equi pped with a belt scale system. The belt scales were connected to a Central Processing Unit (CPU ), which constantly monitored and adjusted the belt speeds to ensure the proper blending ratio. The cleanup at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a multi-contractor effort under the direction of the Program Management Contractor.

WESTON workers expected to administer first aid must have a basi c understanding of bloodborne pathogens in order to protect themselves effectively from any hazards. At a minimum, this Bloodborne Pathogen ECP for First Aid Providers will be on site WESTON personnel may deliver First Aid and CPR in a nonclinical setting. First Aid and CPR duties are often performed in uncontrolled environments, which, due to a lack of time and other factors, do not allow for application of a complex decisi on-making process to the emergency at hand. This ECP is intended to assist personnel in making decisions concerning the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and resuscitation equipment, as well as for decontamination, labeling, containerizing and disposal procedures. Information Program Identification and assessment of risk from exposure to biological hazards is conducted as part of the development of the APP and SSHP. This ECP deals with forms of infection that are of concern to workers who can come in contact with bodi ly fluids associated with blood. WESTON training programs provide information on bloodborne pathogens and the Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to a ll field personnel with special emphasis on those employees who are certified and called upon to perform First Aid. Exposure Control This ECP is designed to eliminate or minimize em ployee exposure to bloodborne pathogens through information and training, use of PPE, safe handling pr ocedures, decontamination, and proper disposal methods. Exposure Determination Employees certified in First Aid and CPR may be at risk from bloodborne pathogens when these services are rendered. Attachment 1 identifies tasks in which occupational exposure may occur, potential contact, and required protective measures for First Aid providers. METHODS OF COMPLIANCE Universal Precautions When treating a victim for an injury, conducting CPR, or handling potentially infectious waste, the use of universal precautions is the recommended approach to infection control. Universal precautions assume all human blood and certain human body fluids are infectious for HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens. Other body substances, including feces, urin e, or vomit are not included, unless they contain visible blood. Under circumstances in which differe ntiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids shall be consid ered potentially infectious materials. G:\\03886551\\301-ND_NODS\\5_0-PROJECT PLANS\\APP - MT. GRETNA\\AppG_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 2/24/2016 Work Practice Controls Work practice controls reduce the likelihood of expos ure by formalizing the manner in which a task is performed. All first aid procedures involving blood or othe r potentially infectious materials shall be performed in a manner that minimizes splashi ng, spraying, spattering, and generation of droplets of these substances. Mouth suctioning of blood or other in fectious materials is prohibited. When handling sharps such as needles used for bee stings or diabetes, do not recap, purposely bend, break by hand, remove from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulate by hand. As soon as possible after use, contaminated shar ps are to be placed in puncture proof/leak proof containers until they can be disposed. Broken glassware which may be contaminated shall not be picked up directly with the hands unless gloves are used to protect the hands against cuts. It is best to use mechanical means, such as a brush and dust pan then place contam inated broken glass in a puncture proof/leak proof container. When handling red bag waste, hold the top end of the bag rather than the bottom. Containers of potentially infectious waste should be labeled with a biohazard label. All PPE should be inspected prior to use. PPE should not be worn if the PPE barrier is compromised. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood, other body fluids to which unive rsal precautions apply, or their potentially contaminated articles. Hands should always be washed after gloves are removed even if the gloves appear intact. Where hand washing facilities are not readily accessible, an antiseptic hand cleaner along with clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes should be used. When antiseptic hand cleaners or towelettes are used hands shall be washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible. Engineering Controls Engineering controls isolate or remove th e bloodborne pathogen hazard from the workplace. Proper containerizing, labeling and disposal of contaminated items are required for all potentially infectious waste. Minimizing needle sticks by placing them in a puncture proof container. Limiting access or close off areas which contain potentially infectious materials. G:\\03886551\\301-ND_NODS\\5_0-PROJECT PLANS\\APP - MT. GRETNA\\AppG_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 2/24/2016 Administrative Controls Administrative controls reduce or eliminate bloodborne pathogen hazards from the workplace by program development (i.e., ECP), auditing to ensure these pr ograms are in place and impl emented, and providing information and training. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) PPE is specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. Attachment 1 provides examples of recommendations for PPE in the nonclinical setting; the list is not intended to be all-inclusive. First-aid kits will be supplemented with bloodbor ne pathogen kits or supplies and will be readily accessible at all times. If the chance of being exposed to blood is high, the caregiver should put on protective attire before beginning CPR or First Aid. Protective barriers shoul d be used in accordance with the level of exposure encountered. Under rare or extraordinary circumstances, a responding employee may decide, based on his or her judgment, that use of PPE would prevent delivery of care or pose an increased hazard to safety of the employee or co-worker. When this judgment has been made, an investigation of the event will be initiated and documented in order to determine what changes in procedures or protective equipment is needed. Resuscitation Equipment No transmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth to mouth resuscitation has been documented. However, because of the risk of salivary transmission of other infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV and HBV transmission during artificial ventilati on of trauma victims, disposable mouth to mouth resuscitation masks (one-way valve type only) should be used. These devices are designed to isolate emergency response personnel from contact with vi ctim's blood and blood-contaminated saliva, respiratory secretions, and vomit. Disposable resusci tation equipment and devices should be disposed of once they have been used. Decontamination and Disposal All PPE will be removed prior to leaving a contamin ated area and secured properly for decontamination or proper disposal. Decontamination uses physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy bloodborne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal. All spills of blood and blood-contaminated fluids should be promptly cleaned up. The area should be decontaminated with a commercial disinfectant solution or a 1:100 solutio n of household bleach. Soiled cleaning equipment should be cleaned and decontaminated with the disinfectant solution. If a victim's clothes become soiled with blood during First Aid or CPR, the soiled material (i.e., clothes, resuscitation equipment or disposable towels) should be placed in a red or orange plastic bag. If possible this bag should accompany the victim to the hospi tal or ambulance. Where on-site emergency care is given and additional medical treatment is not likely, soiled material should be placed in a red or orange plastic bag and then pick-up should be arranged by a local medical waste disposal company. Containers must be identified prior to transport or pick-up. Any questions regarding the disposal or management of soiled garments or materials should be directed to Federal Team Health and Safety Officer or Di vision Environmental Health and Safety Officer.

GRETNA\\AppG_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 2/24/2016 Containerizing The potentially contaminated materials and sharps container generated from giving First Aid and CPR will be placed in a red or orange container/bag. When PPE is removed it shall be placed in an appropriate designated area for containerization. If the outside c ontamination of the primary container occurs, the primary container shall be placed within a second container which prevents leakage during handling processing storage, transport or shippi ng and is labeled or color coded. Sharps such as needles used for bee stings or di abetes should be placed in a puncture proof/leak proof color coded or labeled container. If other contents could puncture th e primary container, the primary container shall be placed within a secondary containe r which is puncture resistant. The liquid generated from the decontamination process should be containe d in a leak proof container until a local medical waste disposal company can provide information on proper disposal based on local, state and federal regulations. Labeling and Hazard Communication Biohazard warning labels required by the Standard [29 CFR 1910.1030(g)(1)(i)(B)] must be attached to containers of regulated wastes or other containers of potentially infectious materials during storage, transport or shipment. Red or orange bags may be substituted for labeling requirements, otherwise, a biohazard label with lettering or symbols should be affixed to the outside of each bag or container generated. Consequently, any containe r so labeled or any red or orange bagged waste or materials shall be considered to contain either bloo d or other infectious material. Incident Reporting When an employee gives First Aid or CPR, or is potentially exposed to a bloodborne pathogen, a Notification of Incident (NOI) Report must be comple ted. The report must indicate \"Potential Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Vaccination and Post-Exposure Evaluation and Follow-up The pre-work Hepatitis B Vaccination for First Aid provide rs is not required, it will therefore, be offered post-exposure. Hepatitis B vaccines are effective in preventing hepa titis B following a documented exposure when given within 1 week after HBV exposure. The vaccine may be more effective when combined with HBIG, a preparation of immune globulin with high levels of antibody to HBV (anti-HBs). The U.S. Public Health Service and Center for Disease Control guidelines should be accessed for current information. Upon suspicion or verification of exposure to blood or infectious ma terials, Hepatitis vaccine will be made available to the exposed individual(s) at no co st to the employee. The employee will immediately be referred to WESTON's Occupational Medical C onsultant (OMC) for counseling and management. Upon learning of exposure to a source or source individual found to be positive for HBV or HIV, WESTON's OMC will provide direction on case manage ment. The OMC, after discussion of the exposure situation with the medical clinic or hospital where th e victim was evaluated and treated for injury, will determine whether the exposed employee should be t ested for HBV or HIV prior to the status of the source being known (or in the case where the source is unknown). HBV and HIV testing of the source individual should be done at the local offices' medical clinic or at the hospital where the victim was treated for injury. Local laws may apply for testing source individuals in situations where consent cannot be obtained because the source refuses testing or cannot be identified (i.e., an unconscious patient). If the job location does not allow access to the local offices' medical clinic then a new WESTON OMC will be consulted for guida nce. The alternate clinic/hospital must offer pretest counseling, post test coun seling and referral for treatment. PLANS\\APP - MT. GRETNA\\AppG_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 2/24/2016 Consult with WESTON's OMC to determine if the exposed employee should be given the HBV post- exposure vaccination. Collection and testing of blood for HBV and HIV serologi cal status shall be perfo rmed as soon as feasible on the exposed employee's blood (after consent) where the source is found to be positive for HIV or HBV. Results of the source individual's testing shall be made available to the exposed employee, and the employee shall be informed by the Medical Safety Officer of applicable laws and regulations concerning disclosure of the identity and infectious status of the source individual. When the source individual is already known to be infected with HBV or HIV te sting of the source individual known HBV or HIV status need not be repeated (Center for Disease Control, 1985). If the source of the exposure is a needle stick or bloodstained material (i.e ., blood stained material contacted an open wound on a field team member) the source should be placed in an appropriate container (i.e., sharps container for needles and red bag for blood tainted materi al). The container should be given to the WESTON medical clinic for analysis. If the source is found to be HBV or HIV positive, the incident report must be updated to change the st atus from suspected to confirmed exposure. At this point the NOI Report will be placed in a limited control access portion of incident filing system to maintain confidentiality. Human Immunodeficiency Viru s Post Exposure Management For any exposure to a source or source individua l who has AIDS, who is found to be positive for HIV infection or who refuses testing, the worker should be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated clinically and serologically for eviden ce for the HIV infection as soon as possible after the exposure. WESTON's OMC will provid e direction on the case management. If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, follow-up will be determined by WESTON's OMC. If the source or source individual cannot be identifie d, decisions regarding appropriate follow-up should be individualized. Serological testing will be made available to all workers who may be concerned they have been infected with HIV through an occupati onal exposure. WESTON's OMC will provide direction on the case management. Communication of Hazards to Employees Training Schedule WESTON ensures that employees, who are certified to provide First Aid and CPR, are trained in all components of the bloodborne pathogen standard u pon assignment and at the annual refresher training. All First Aid providers must be aware of task modi fications or procedure changes which might affect occupational exposure. Training Contents A training sign-up sheet will be completed to include course title, date, attendees' names, signatures, job classifications, instructor's name, and duration of the class. Training content will include the following information: Where an accessible copy of the regulatory text and the WESTON's ECP can be found. An explanation of WESTON's ECP and the means by which employees can obtain a copy of the written plan. A general explanation of the epidemiolo gy and symptoms of bloodborne diseases. G:\\03886551\\301-ND_NODS\\5_0-PROJECT PLANS\\APP - MT. GRETNA\\AppG_BBP_ExpControlPlan.docx 2/24/2016 An explanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials. An explanation of the use and limitations of methods that will prevent or reduce exposure including appropriate engineering controls, work practices, and PPE. Information on the types, proper use, locati on, removal, handling, decontamination and disposal of PPE. An explanation of the basis for selection of PPE. Information on the Hepatitis B vaccine (or an y new vaccines), including information on its efficacy, safety, method of administration, the benefits of being vaccinated. An explanation of the procedure to follow if an exposure incident occurs, including the method of reporting the incident and the medi cal follow-up that will be made available. Information on the post-exposure evaluation and follow-up that WESTON is required to provide for the employee following an exposure incident. An explanation of the signs and labels and/or color coding for disposal of infectious materials. An opportunity for interactive questions and answers with the person conducting the training session. Recordkeeping When an employee gives First Aid or CPR and in doing so becomes subject to this ECP, he/she will verbally report the incident within 1 hour and comp lete a WESTON NOI Report within 24 hours. As part of a medical record, the circumst ances of exposure will be kept c onfidential. Relevant information includes the activities in which the worker was engaged at the time of exposure, the extent to which appropriate work practices and PPE were used, and a description of the source of exposure (USHHS and NIOSH, 1989). When the source is tested for HIV or HBV, the incident report is updated and placed in a confidential file. G:\\03886551\\301-ND_NODS\\5_0-PROJECT PLANS\\APP - MT. GR "}
