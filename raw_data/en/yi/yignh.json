I didn't even think about all the chemicals that go into the usual nail polish you would find at your local drugstore. I grew up painting my nails black with WetnWild, and I don't think once I checked to see what they put inside the bottle. As I was writing this post, I learned some new lingo I was unaware of and felt to include. What ingredients should you avoid in nail polish? Below, these nail polishes will say #-Free, and it refers to the number of toxic ingredients they did not use, which you would typically find in conventional nail polish. Ingredients you should most certainly avoid when purchasing a new bottle are Dibutyl Phthalate, Toluene, Formaldehyde, Formaldehyde resin, and Camphor. And good news for your nails - many brands are making non-toxic nail polish that doesn't use those ingredients, along with many other ingredients you find in conventional polish. What to look for when shopping for non-toxic, sustainable nail polish Always check for the number of free ingredients they do not include. 10-Free is pretty standard for non-toxic nail polishes, but as long as you don't see the above ingredients on the label, you are already choosing better nail polish. When shopping for non-toxic nail polish, we look for the labels' Vegan' & 'Cruelty-Free,' which means no animal products are used within the ingredients, and there has been no animal testing. Since I live in the states, I also like to look for Made in the USA to lower my carbon footprint. now, our top picks for sustainable and non-toxic nail polish: 1) [Jolie Vegan](https://jolievegan.com) Vegan, Cruelty-Free, Made in USA Price: $9 Not only does this 100% vegan and 10-free nail polish brand create gorgeous non-toxic colors, but they give back, too.
