A system that uses natural remedies, the therapies and treatments naturopathy embraces include herbs, massages, acupuncture, and nutritional counselling. Some of them might be what you call old wives' tales, but today, traditional treatments still in use by naturopathic doctors are backed by modern science. To get you started, here are some tip that will be helpful in boosting your immunity (in case, you know, you've been drinking too much): Load up on the As... In case you forgot, Vitamin A is an important immunity nutrient (it also helps organs work properly). It can be found in orange coloured vegetables and fruits like carrots, squash, cantaloupe, apricots, and mangos. And also the Zs Besides eight hours of good-quality sleep, which is crucial for the prevention of recurrent infections, zinc keeps our immune system in check. Consider getting extra zinc (15 mg per day) through supplements or by eating a few handfuls of pumpkin seeds every day. Can we say, healthy snack? Get Out We don't mean to be rude, but most people in developed countries will need at least 10 minutes of sun exposure per day to boost levels of vitamin D and ensure good immune function. An easy way to do this is to make time to go out for lunch instead of ordering in at the office. Goods for Your Gut We all know brands like Vitagen and Yakult, but a high quality probiotic containing at least 1 billion organisms per dose can help if infections are common, or after completing antibiotic treatments. Know Yourself It's a good idea to identify possible food intolerances, which often contribute to a lowered immune system. Detox retreats are generally great when it comes to identifying food intolerances and help rejuvenate our immune system. However, upon returning home, it's important to avoid alcohol and caffeine for at least another 3 weeks, and to reintroduce them carefully and in low amounts (no more than a glass of wine per day and a cup of coffee per day). If food intolerances were identified during the retreat, stay away from the offending food consistently for about three months before re-introducing it in our routine diet. This helps in keeping our immune system as optimised as possible.
