Additionally, people are taking more ownership and responsibility for their health. We are no longer satisfied with the medical status quo that requires you to \"come back in two weeks.\" Conventional Medicine The treatment protocol of conventional medicine mainly recognizes an isolated set of symptoms a patient is experiencing and uses those same symptoms to identify an illness and develop a treatment plan. This plan often entails finding the appropriate synthetic pharmaceuticals that will decrease or suppress the symptoms. A generic approach of drugs to solve your problems. However, if you discontinue the medication, the symptoms usually return. Medication may not eliminate nor correct of the root cause of the disease. With conventional medicine, treatment is usually achieved through medication, invasive surgery, and radiation. This medication is the best for use in triage emergencies or accidental and traumatic occurrences. Triage medicine delivers excellent results in situations such as in car accidents, industrial accidents, home accidents and natural disasters. Due to its success in the given scenarios, this triage model was applied to the whole spectrum of healthcare including chronic disease management, mental health, nutrition and preventive medicine. The results are mediocre, and have caused individuals to search for and demand better health care. Naturopathic, Functional, and Alternative Medicine Naturopathic and functional medicine differ from conventional medicine in the philosophy that guides our approach to chronic symptoms. When a patient has experienced a long-lasting or recurring symptom, we focus on the root cause of disease. Our objective is to not only eliminate the symptom, but also the underlying problem. Our holistic approach allows us to view the body as an interconnected matrix rather than a collection of separate systems. It's important to keep in mind that treatment for comparable symptoms might vary considerably for various patients according to their biological tests and medical history. Factors that contribute to similar symptoms include pathogenic bacteria, virus, parasites, and toxic chemicals. Therefore, both naturopathic and functional medicine use a recognized scientific framework for evaluating rDNA, DNA, cellar function and dysfunction, hormone variations, and metabolic functions. By using this comprehensive approach, therapy can be tailored to the individual. Using the latest modern biological tests, the functional root cause of a problem is unveiled through a combination of urine and blood lab analysis, hormone and gut panels, and genetic testing. Once the cause of the illness is determined, its treatment consists of propelling the body's natural physiology and biochemistry into a state of self-correction. Natural healing is obtained through the use of all-natural vitamins, enzymes, herbs, amino acids and natural compounds. Changes in the illness may be seen in as little as 5 to 7 days. By using all-natural supplements and elements, side effects are almost non-existent. Naturopathic and functional medicine treat the person who has the disease, not the disease the person has. Our body's immune system has a natural ability to overcome a disease if given the proper nutrition to remove toxins and inflammation. If an unconventional practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it is referred to as alternative medicine. But if a nonconventional practice is used in conjunction with conventional medicine, it is referred to as complementary medicine. Alternative medicine primarily consists of mental, emotional, functional, spiritual, and social factors. Deep breathing, Yoga, Tai Chi or Qi Gong, Massage, Progressive Relaxation and Guided Imagery are a few of the therapies that are used within alternative medicine. Holistic medicine seeks to expand the focus of health care beyond the boundaries of assessing and treating discreet physical symptoms. It includes an equal emphasis on mental and spiritual factors in the overall health and wellness. This mind-body-spirit approach has much to offer, particularly for both doctors and patients who consider health maintenance and disease prevention just as vital as treating a pre-existing condition or disease. At Bio Wellness Center, we believe wholly in your health and wellbeing.
