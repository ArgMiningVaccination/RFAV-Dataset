Specically, the SPA would authorize the DMAS to provide Medicaid reimbursement for pharmacy-administered immuniza \u0000ons. Providing for Medicaid reimbursement for pharmacy-administered immuniza \u0000ons creates a pathway for con \u0000nued access to these important services for Medicaid bene ciaries. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, pharmacies improve access to vaccina \u0000on delivery . Even before COVID, nearly 1 in 3 adult in fluenza vaccines - around 38 million - were provided in pharmacies, illustra \u0000ng that pa \u0000ents trust and rely on the convenience of pharmacies. In fact, in the three years preceding the pandemic, pharmacies provided more than 4 million vaccines to Virginia's pa \u0000ents. As research has shown, community pharmacies provide a convenient op \u0000on for at-risk families juggling shi\u0000 work, transporta \u0000on challenges, and school schedules in which more than 30% of pa \u0000ents receive vaccines outside of tradi\u0000onal oce physician oce hours. Providing for Medicaid reimbursement for pharmacists- administered immuniza \u0000ons would not only ensure fair and accurate reimbursement for these services, but it would also ensure pa \u0000ent access and help expand the community-level bene t of protec\u0000ng the popula \u0000on as a whole through the uptake of immuniza \u0000on services. NACDS and VACDS applaud DMAS for proposing this SPA amendment. Incen \u0000vizing Medicaid pa \u0000ents' access to vaccina \u0000ons at their local pharmacy will lead to increases in vaccina \u0000on rates among the popula \u0000on, resul\u0000ng in improved pa \u0000ent health and overall healthcare savings. Again, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on this and are available to answer any ques \u0000ons or provide further informa \u0000on.
