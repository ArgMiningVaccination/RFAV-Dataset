A: It's the waxy, fat-like material your body makes to help digest food. You need a certain amount of cholesterol to produce hormones, vitamin D and other substances. Your liver makes cholesterol; it's also found in foods from animal sources like meat, egg yolks and cheese. Q: Why is it harmful? A: Your body does need a certain amount of cholesterol, but if you consume too much it increases in your bloodstream and can produce waxy plaque in blood vessels that can lead to coronary artery and heart disease. The plaque narrows arteries and can even block them, which disrupts the oxygen supply to the heart, possibly causing a heart attack. If plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and further block the artery. Plaque also can form on arteries that feed your brain and limbs; blockages in those can cause carotid artery disease or stroke. Q: What are \"good\" and \"bad\" cholesterol, and what are healthy levels? A: High-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol, carries cholesterol from other parts of your body to your liver for removal. Healthy HDL levels are more than 40 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for men and more than 50 mg/dL for women. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are the cholesterol that can form plaque in arteries. A blood cholesterol of less than 100 mg/dL is optimal. Get your cholesterol checked through a blood test at a doctor 's office; it 's also often part of a routine physical exam. Q: How can I avoid unhealthy cholesterol levels? A: High cholesterol can run in families, and you 're at greater risk if you smoke, are in your mid-forties or older or are overweight. But the most common cause of high cholesterol is a lifestyle of unhealthy eating and lack of exercise. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and avoid saturated and trans fats in red meats, dairy products, baked goods and fried or processsed foods. Eat unsaturated \"good \" fats\u2014avocado, nuts and olive oil\u2014and opt for skim milk over whole milk. Go for high- fiber foods like apples, bananas, oranges, beans and oatmeal, and limit sugary carbs and alcohol. Aim for at least 30 minut es of moderate or stronger exercise a day. Q: How do I nd out if my cholesterol is elevated? A: Ask your doctor for a blood test. Often there are no signs or symptoms of high cholesterol, so it 's important to get a test, especially if you have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol. Q: What should I do if it's above normal? A: If diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes can't bring your cholesterol down, your doctor may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering drug, such as a statin. Sources: medlineplus.gov/hdlthegoodcholesterol.html medlineplus.gov/ldlthebadcholesterol.html medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.htmlPHOTO Tobin BennettThese lifestyle changes can help keep cholesterol levels in a healthy range. If your cholesterol is high or you have a family history of high cholesterol, talk to your health care provider and come up with an easy-to-manage plan of attack.DIETITIAN TIPS WAYS TO LOWER CHOLESTEROL 5 5 EAT THE RIGHT FOODS LIMIT SATURATED FATS FROM RED MEAT, BUTTER, CHEESE AND OTHER DAIRY PRODUCTS. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS THAT LESS THAN 6 PERCENT OF DAILY CALORIES COME FROM SATURATED FAT. CHOOSE LEAN PROTEIN: FISH, SKINLESS CHICKEN BREASTS, LEAN BEEF CUTS (EYE OF ROUND, TOP SIRLOIN, SIRLOIN TIP), LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS AND MONOUNSATURATED FATS FROM OLIVE, PEANUT AND CANOLA OILS. WHOLE GRAINS, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CAN ALL HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL. FOODS RICH IN OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS, INCLUDING WILD SALMON, WALNUTS, ALMONDS AND GROUND FLAXSEED, CAN HELP INCREASE GOOD CHOLESTEROL AND REDUCE TRIGLYCERIDES. OATMEAL CONTAINS SOLUBLE FIBER, WHICH CAN HELP REDUCE BAD CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. KIDNEY BEANS, APPLES, PEARS, BARLEY AND PRUNES ARE ALSO GOOD SOURCES OF SOLUBLE FIBER.1 LOSE WEIGHT By losing five to 10 percent of your body weight, you may be able to reduce cholesterol levels significantly, according to the Mayo Clinic. Work small changes into your daily activity: Use the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or park farther from your office. Cut calories \u2014munch on carrot sticks instead of potato chips or take a healthy homemade lunch to work instead of eating fast food. Hy-Vee offers a healthy lifestyle program called Begin , which offers guidance in healthful eating, weight loss and exercises. Contact the Hy-Vee dietitians for more information. 2 QUIT SMOKING It's never too late to quit. If you do, you may improve your good cholesterol level. What's more, your blood pressure decreases within 20 minutes after quitting, according to the Mayo Clinic. Risk of heart attack lowers within 24 hours of quitting smoking. Within a year the risk of heart disease is just half that of someone who smokes. Hy-Vee offers a Quit for Good program, a series of classes led by a trained pharmacist.3 GET ACTIVE Exercise can improve cholesterol levels. Work 30 minutes of moderate exercise into your daily routine\u2014even 10-minute intervals several times a day\u2014to raise good cholesterol. Take a walk during your lunch hour, bike to work or take an early-morning run. Do a few situps while watching TV. Finding an exercise partner can help. And consider joining a group that works out together. 4 DRINK ALCOHOL IN MODERATION Interestingly, moderate use of alcohol has been linked with higher levels of good cholesterol, but there hasn't been enough research to recommend alcohol to nondrinkers. It's recommended that women of all ages and men older than 65 limit themselves to one alcoholic beverage per day; up to two drinks for men 65 and under.

Or perhaps you're already on it and are considering changes.HEALTHY LIVING *Hy-Vee does not endorse any particular plan. Hy-Vee and its pharmacists are not licensed insurance agents and Hy-Vee and its pharmacists do not make specific plan recommendations. Hy-Vee encourages all patients to think about their own personal considerations, including medical and financial, when selecting a plan. For a complete listing of plans in your area please call 1-800-MEDICARE (TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048) or visit www.medicare.gov Sources: www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html www.medicareresources.org/faqs/when-is-the-next-medicare-open-enrollment-period/ www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-part-d-in-2018-the-latest-on-enrollment-premiums-and-cost-sharing/Medicare prescription drug coverage saves money for millions of people, but it can be complicated to understand and use. That 's why Hy-Vee pharmacies will offer customers a free medication review and Part D plan comparison during the enrollment period this fall.* If you 're about to turn 65, or are 65 or over, you should also check out www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html to learn more. SOME BASICS Even if you 're covered by Medicare Part A (hospitalization) and/or Part B (doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays, screenings, etc.), you are not automatically enrolled in prescription drug coverage. You can get prescription coverage separately through one of the following (you must already have Part A and/or Part B): Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D) This is a stand-alone plan administered by a private insurer. You can find additional information about plans in your area and what medications the plan covers at www.medicare.gov/ nd-a-plan/questions/home.aspx Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) An alternative to get Medicare A and B benefits, which might include prescription drugs. The advantage is that all services are rolled into one plan. When can you sign up? Your initial enrollment period is the 7-month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65 and ends 3 months after. Or you can sign up during the annual fall enrollment period; this year it 's Oct. 15-Dec. 7. During these periods you also can switch to another policy offered in your area or disenroll from Medicare drug coverage altogether. What does it cost? Private plans vary in premiums (what you pay each month to receive coverage), deductible (what you pay before coverage kicks in) and co-payment (your portion of the cost of each service) as well as the drugs covered. Each calendar year, plans may change costs and benefits or even withdraw from Medicare. Review your plan every year to ensure that it covers the drugs you need now and during the up coming year. During the Part D open enrollment period (October 15 to December 7) your Hy-Vee Pharmacy is offering free medication reviews and plan comparisons.* We can help you navigate the system so you can determine which option is best for you.

It was then that he started watching football with passion. \"I think, honestly, I might have been trained for my future job without even really knowing it, \" Herbstreit says. He didn't just watch the games each week\u2014 he studied them. \"You could say something to me when I was little and probably not get a reaction, because I was listening to the announcers, listening to the crowd, watching the smallest nuances of the game and just digesting. \" At Centerville High School, he started as quarterback, and with the help of his coach, Bob Gregg, was named the 1987 Gatorade Ohio State Player of the Year. \"My high school football coach was a game changer for me. He was a former Marine and incredibly tough on his players, \" Herbstreit says. \"If you stuck with his program you learned work ethic, perseverance, about getting knocked down and getting back up. \" After playing for Ohio State, he focused on covering college sports at a local radio station, later moving to television. When he tested for College GameDay at 25 years old, in 1996, his chances of being chosen for the job were poor. \"They literally told me, you're not gonna get this job, but it would be good for you to go through the audition, \" he says. \"I was nervous to death doing the audition\u2014 terrified, actually, sitting next to Lee Corso. They ended up hiring me. \" Herbstreit knew most viewers wouldn't know him, so he focused on being well prepared. Years later, after winning three Sports Emmys, the man inside is still the same as he was in 1996. He still wants people to say: That guy seems to be pretty prepared and well informed. \"I go all the way back to my high school coach for instilling that in me, \" Herbstreit says.revolving roster every season adds a new, dynamic mix of players and coaches to college football. Millions of fans, glued to their televisions each week, demand a talented commentator prepped to share compelling stories, stats and strategies. In the midst of chaos \u2014upsets, rabid, outspoken fans and fast-paced games\u2014Kirk Herbstreit is the voice of reason. He calms the storm and invites everyone to be part of the team. Four months out of the year, Herbstreit doesn't stop. Just as he did as a quarterback at Ohio State University, Herbstreit spends his weekdays diligently working toward game day. \"I prepare for Saturdays like my kids do for their final exams during the school year, \" Herbstreit says. \"My Saturdays are my final exams. If I do my job that week, I prepare for one hundred percent of what that final is gonna be . Typically, I only need to use twenty percent. \" Being prepared is what gives him the edge and keeps viewers tuning in week after week. \"It's incredible how much power that gives you. I don't think anybody is as prepared as I am when I go on the air. \" Growing up in central Ohio, Herbstreit was raised on college football. His father, Jim, was a captain on the 1960 Ohio State University football team and briefly coached under Woody Hayes and, later, Bo Schembechler at Miami University of Ohio. Herbstreit 's parents were very supportive of his athletic interests. His Texas-born mom had an infectious spirit and encouraged him to be tough and not be afraid to get hurt. Kirk Herbstreit is prepped and ready for a day in front of the cameras. Each week during football season he, Lee Corso, Rece Davis, Desmond Howard, David Pollack and Maria Taylor analyze highlights, players and coaches and visit football stadiums across the United States to bring college football to life for enthusiastic fans. \"I'M ON A TREADMILL AND THAT TREADMILL DOESN'T STOP\u2014IT'S LIKE FULL SPRINT,\" HERBSTREIT SAYS. \"THAT'S BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE FOR ME OVER THE YEARS, OF TRYING TO FIND BALANCE.\" BALANCE | hy-vee.com35MICBEHIND KirkHERBSTREITthe WITHQ. What was your dream job growing up? A. To play football for Ohio State and shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds. If I could do those two things, I would have conquered the world. Q. How do you nd balance in your life? A. Getting outside of my comfort zone to try different things, because I de nitely stay in the sports world the majority of the time. Q. What does healthy living mean to you? A. I'm married to an absolute health nut and she's all about clean eating. Those are things that I didn't pay attention to most of my life. I've always looked at healthy living as, I'm gonna work out and eat. She coached me and our boys on the importance of clean eating. When you're eating clean and drinking water you have much more energy during the day and better sleep at night. And man, it's actually true. I kind of rolled my eyes when she was saying it, and then I did it and sure enough, it makes a huge difference. Q. What kind of workouts do you do? A. Sometimes cardio. I do what's called HIIT, which is high intensity interval training. I enjoy the HIIT cycle\u2014you can get a really intense workout within 30 to 40 minutes. I think it's actually even better for you when you're my age. Q. Favorite game you've covered? A. THAT'S LIKE WHICH OF YOUR KIDS DO YOU LIKE THE BEST KIND OF QUESTION\u2014THAT'S A REALLY HARD ONE. PROBABLY THE USC- TEXAS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP. LAST YEAR'S ALABAMA-GEORGIA GAME WAS RIDICULOUS. Q. Favorite game as a fan? A. As a fan, I would say when the Reds won the World Series in 1990\u2014they went wire to wire. I was able to sneak down to go to [the game] in Cincinnati. Q. Best college football player you've ever watched? A. Reggie Bush. Q. If you could change one rule in college football, what would it be? A. I WOULD LIMIT INSTANT REPLAY TO TWO MINUTES OR LESS. SOMETIMES THE INSTANT REPLAY JUST DRAGS THE GAME OUT. I'M COOL WITH INSTANT REPLAY, I JUST THINK SOMETIMES IT GOES ON TOO LONG. Q. Heisman pick for the year? A. I'm gonna go with Tua Tagovailoa. I think it's a given he starts, and I think whoever starts quarterback for Alabama this year is going to have a big year. His teammate, Damien Harris, could be up there, too. Q. Proudest moment of your life? A. I know the hokey answer is to say when your kids are born, but something happens to you when your kids are born. It's just really hard to describe until you have a kid. Q. Do the possible dangers of playing football concern you at all, having sons who play? A. Absolutely. I'm very aware of the studies and of the importance of my boys understanding how to protect their head when they're involved in a tackle or being tackled. I think the game teaches too many valuable life skills for me to say to my kids right now, 'nope, you can't play. ' I still feel like we're learning and research is being done, but I've met so many football players that are in their 70s that are not impacted by it at all. So I don't know enough about it to be able to say to my boys, 'you can't play.

Eckrich 's quality meats and dedication to college football won him over. Each year the company backs a $1 Million Dollar Challenge giving lucky fans a chance to throw for the win (to learn more go to football.Eckrich. com ). \"I've been really lucky that my relationship with them has become much, much more.

What percentage of Americans, if they're really being honest, can say they go to bed on Sunday nights and they can't wait to go to work the next day? \" Herbstreit says. \"I have a job where I feel that way. I love what I do. I love college football. \" But being in the limelight can be challenging, especially for a guy who 's paid to have an opinion on everybody 's favorite team. \"I'm a very rational guy. If you told me, 'man, I can't believe you said that about Matt Campbell, ' my instinct is to help you understand what I meant by what I said.\" Herbstreit 's job requires honest commentary and analysis based on his understanding of the facts. \"We may disagree, but you're going to walk away saying, 'okay, you know what, I don't agree with what he said, but I don't hate him anymore. I understand.'\" Though he 's con dent of his opinions, it's not always easy for him. \"I would label myself as a pleaser, and when you're a pleaser it's very hard when people say things about you that are hurtful, \" Herbstreit says. \"There's not a book that you can read on how to live in the public eye, so the tendency is to pull back. And when you do that, it can be very isolating, \" Herbstreit says. \"I try to branch out and do things. It's hard for me, but I think we all have to try to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. And for me, being uncomfortable is doing new things and doing things with people that aren't in my inner circle. \"GAME ON!

Deficiency can lead to neurological disorders such as depression and to cognitive impairment. BANANAS In addition to several B vitamins, bananas contain vitamin C, an antioxidant that studies suggest may delay cognitive decline in the elderly. BEETS Beets are a good source of folate to combat fatigue and forgetfulness. BERRIES & GRAPES Both are good sources of the antioxidant vitamin C. One cup of strawberries has more than 100 percent of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C. BROCCOLI Broccoli is rich in vitamin C and contains folate and other B vitamins thought to improve mood and increase production of hemoglobin. C O F F E E & D A R K CHOCOLATE Dark chocolate and cocoa contain flavonols,which studies suggest may act as antioxidants. Coffee contains the B vitamin riboflavin. DARK LEAFY GREENS Deficiency of vitamin E, found in leafy green vegetables, has been linked with poor memory in older individuals. EGG YOLKS Studies suggest a relationship between choline in egg yolks and cognition. Other sources of choline include chicken, turkey and veal. FLAXSEEDS Omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseeds may help reduce cognitive decline in the elderly. NUTS Cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer 's disease has been linked to low levels of copper, found in nuts. TURMERIC Curcumin in turmeric is a strong antioxidant and has been associated with reduced memory loss in studies of Alzheimer's disease.

Although almost every adult has certainly struggled with loving how they look ( 83 percent of women and 74 percent of men are unhappy with their bodies, according to a 2018 Ipsos global market research survey ) studies show that most parents are unaware that children as young as preschool-age are already developing their own body image.

Other signs include binge- eating, hiding food, a fear of gaining weight, exercising excessively, constant calorie counting and, for girls, missed periods.THE SIGNS TWO-THIRDS OF 13-YEAR-OLD GIRLS ARE AFRAID OF as young as 5 express dissatisfaction with their bodies, and preschoolers can already understand that society judges people based on appearance. By the time children reach adolescence, messages about the value of appearance can be even stronger. \"During teenage years social groups and social media have the potential to provide a stronger infl uence on perceptions and behaviors,\" says Kevin Sloan, psychologist at Beaumont Health in Royal Oak, Michigan. \"There are a variety of physiological, social and emotional adjustments that teenagers are experiencing, and they are more susceptible to developing maladaptive behaviors to compensate.\" Research from the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine shows that the three main factors contributing to negative body image in adolescents are media, peer and parental infl uence. Developing open dialogue, monitoring media consumption and being a body-positive role model are stepping stones to helping your child develop a healthy body image.

A study published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine surveyed 5,331 girls and 3,881 boys between the ages of 12 and 18, along with their mothers, about their attitudes toward weight. Researchers found that mothers who over-emphasize their concerns about body weight are likely to pass those attitudes on to their children, and girls who think their mothers want them to be thin are two or three times more worried about trying to lose weight. \"Parents may need to get their own support if they struggle with body image issues to better support their child, \" says Williams.Teach young children how their body works, talking gently about the importance of hygiene and good nutrition and giving them genuine compliments. Notice what makes them feel good about their bodies\u2014 mastering a new sport or accomplishing an activity\u2014and build on those moments. \"It is important to discuss with your child that their worth is not determined by their physical appearance, \" says Sloan. \"It's also important to emphasize other positive traits and abilities that the child possesses. \"3ROLEHABITS MODELSCOMPLIMENT MAKEOVERS kidshealth.org/en/parents/body-image.html commonsensemedia.org/children-teens-body-image-media-infographicOffering genuine praise is an important tool for helping young children develop self-esteem and a healthy body image, but keep the focus on their achievements and abilities. \"Spend less time praising or reinforcing appearances and more time expressing appreciation for all the things our bodies allow us to do,\" says Williams.5- TO 8-YEAR-OLDS WHO THINK THEIR MOTHERS ARE UNHAPPY WITH THEIR BODIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO FORM NEGATIVE OPINIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES.\u2014 COMMON SENSE MEDIA, 2015 71WORDS Kristi Chew PHOTOS Tobin BennettBALANCEin BALANCE | September 201872 Keep priorities and goals from evaporating in the daily shuffle.

Growing up in Germany, Pilates devoted himself to physical tness at an early age as a way to overcome constant health struggles. While living in England as an adult during World War II, Pilates was placed in a German internment camp where he continued to develop and rene his physical training and therapy techniques by working with other internees who suffered from wartime injury or illness. Originally known as \"Contrology,\" Pilates is a method of exercise that focuses on core strength, posture and muscle balancing through flowing, controlled movements and precise breathing techniques. Special emphasis is placed on breathing: inhaling through the nose and out through pursed lips with calm yet forceful exhalation to activate the pelvic floor and deep stabilizing muscles in the abdomen. EXERCISES TARGET STABILIZING MUSCLES AROUND THE CORE, WHICH CONTROLS SPINAL AND PELVIC MOVEMENT. STRENGTHENING STABILIZING MUSCLES ALLOWS JOINTS AND LARGER MUSCLES TO PERFORM MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF INJURY.

Here's how to nd the right one. Oh, for the days of the town doctor, the kindhearted physician who came to your home, black bag in hand, dispensing medicine and reassuring words to the whole family. These days, the closest thing we have to the town doctor is a primary care provider, or PCP, a medical pro you see for regular checkups and other general health care needs. But PCPs are falling out of favor of late: 28% of men and 17% of women in the United States do not currently have a PCP, and more than a third of people ages 18 to 35 would prefer to see specialists rather than have a single provider coordinate their care. That may be a mistake. \"People generally do better and stay out of the hospital when they have a primary care physician that they see on a regular basis,\" says Teri Dreher, R.N., president of Northshore Patient Advocates in Chicago. With a PCP at your side, care is more comprehensive. Potential problems are caught earlier. The health care labyrinth is easier to navigate.80 BALANCE | September 2018 FINDING YOUR PCP URGENT NEEDS Emergency departments and urgent care facilities, two other choices for people who don't have a PCP, are designed to handle acute problems when other options aren't available. EDs handle life-threatening emergencies, whereas urgent care facilities handle illnesses and injuries that don't appear life threatening. In a pinch, these offi ces serve you well, but you won't get the continuity of care that you get with your PCP. You may also put off going to the ED or urgent care longer than you would visiting your PCP\u2014 which can make some health issues worse. Which type of PCP is right for you? Family practicioners treat all ages, making them ideal for both parents and children. Pediatricians specialize in infants, children and adolescents. Geriatricians are experts in medical care for aging adults. Internists specialize in preventive medical care for adults of all ages.PCPs can diff er signi cantly in their approach. Some factors to consider, and steps to take, when making your choice: Ask around. Doc-shopping is one area in which it pays to go low-tech: Consumer-rating sites like healthgrades. com and ZocDoc are not typically reliable. Instead, says Dreher, \"Ask your neighbors or friends. Most people are only too glad to brag about their doctor.\" Kick a few tires. Don't settle on a PCP without a sample visit. Rude staff ? Inconvenient location? Dirty offi ce? Take a pass. Think long term. Your relationship with your PCP may last decades and cover very personal territory, including decisions around alcohol, diet, sexuality and end-of- life considerations. You need to feel comfortable with them. Remember the bottom line. The cost of primary care services is substantially off set by insurance, but policies can change. Ask up front what you'll pay for a regular visit, and under what circumstances you'll have to pay more. Consider a nurse practitioner. In primary care, nurse practitioners often are more accessible and can provide the rst line of care for minor illnesses and injuries. Ask about access. A wonderful doctor won't do you much good if it takes three months to get in. Ask how long it usually takes to get seen when you call for an appointment. (Check also if the offi ce has walk-in hours.) Consider a pro. When all else fails, a patient advocate can be a lifesaver. It's their job to help you nd the workable solutions to any medical issue, starting with choosing a PCP that ts your quarterback,\" says Dreher. \"They manage standard medical problems \u2014high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes. Need a blood test, a physical, or a simple biopsy? Your PCP has your back.\" Contrary to popular opinion, most health care issues are not 'specialist' problems. \"Usually [a primary care provider] can take care of the simplest things cheaper,\" says pediatrician Katharine Delgado. If things get more complicated, your PCP will refer you to a specialist, but even then, they remain in charge of your care.

WHEN IT DOESN'T, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS CAN HELP GET YOUR BACK IN SHAPE AGAIN. WORDS David KrauseWHEN YOU HAVE AN ACHING BACK, EVEN THE SIMPLEST MOVEMENT, SUCH AS PICKING UP A PENCIL FROM THE FLOOR, CAN SEND PAIN SHOOTING THROUGH YOUR BACK. Most back pain aff ects the low back. And most often such cases are acute, or short-term, lasting from a few days to a few weeks, while subacute low- back pain lasts from four to twelve weeks. Chronic low-back pain tends to persist for twelve weeks or longer, even after an initial injury or underlying cause has been treated. For short-term pain, there's plenty you can do for your back without seeing a doctor. \"My general recommendation is to rest the back for the immediate cause, put some ice on it, and avoid any activity that makes the pain worse,\" says Ed Steinmann, D.C., D.O., a chiropractor and family physician in Des Moines, Iowa. Dr. Steinmann regularly sees patients whose back pain hasn't gone away after a few days because they haven't followed his initial advice. \"They just keep on doing what caused the problem,\" he says. \"The low back is so complex that if you push through the pain, you are going to make it worse.\" Most cases of low-back pain are mechanical, which means there's a disruption in the normal functioning of the spine. Thankfully, most of these cases tend to resolve themselves, even without special care. But how do you know whether a spell of back pain will subside on its own or whether you should consult a medical professional? If the pain is severe and persists for more than a couple of days, seek medical attention. \"Don't wait for back pain to become full-blown to where you're disabled,\" says T. K. Williams, D.C., a chiropractor who practices in Clive, Iowa. \"Get help from someone who looks at these things every day. That's the best way of dealing with the pain rather than waiting until it interferes with your life.\" You can prevent recurring back pain by avoiding movements that jolt or strain the back and by lifting heavy objects correctly.

From there, I formulate a treatment plan, again using skills from my training as both a chiropractor and osteopathic physician. Then I approach the patient with whatever is needed to alleviate stress to their lower back and to optimize their health. That may be through manipulation, biomechanical training, physical therapy, medication, or a combination of these\u2014up to and including injections for patients who have progressive arthritis in the back or a degenerative disc\u2014or perhaps a surgical consult.\"54TAKE ACTION WHEN BACK PAIN DOESN'T GO AWAY WITH AT-HOME CARE, SEEK HELP FROM A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IF: - PAIN LASTS 4 WEEKS OR MORE - PAIN HAS INCREASED OVER TIME - YOU HAVE OTHER SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FEVER, SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS OR WEIGHT GAIN, LOSS OF FUNCTION OR WEAKNESS IN EXTREMITIES, BLADDER PROBLEMS OR OTHER TROUBLING CHANGES IN HEALTH \"FOR A LOT OF PATIENTS, THEY'VE HAD THE PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AND THEY REALIZE IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.\" \u2014 T. K. WILLIAMS, EXPERIENCE LOW-BACK PAIN SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR DAY SITTING. Physician researchers who combed through hundreds of published studies on low-back pain learned about the eff ectiveness of non- interventional (nonsurgical) treatment. They focused on the 85 percent of low-back pain that is mechanical, such as from muscle spasm, ligament strain and arthritis. The researchers discovered that the best and safest treatments for acute and subacute low- back pain are not medicines, and they make these recommendations: - Most patients with acute or subacute low- back pain improve over time with or without treatment; potentially harmful and costly treatments and tests should be avoided. - First-line, nondrug therapies such as super cial heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation should be used. - If non-drug therapy isn't eff ective, NSAIDs (non- steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs) or skeletal muscle relaxants might help relieve pain. ILLUSTRATION Sebastian Kaulitzki/ShutterstockBALANCE | September 201884 Obesity is associated with several types of chronic pain, including low-back pain. Stress on the spine increases in people with high body mass index, or BMI.Back pain is one of the most common reasons for missed work. It is the second most common reason for visits to the doctor's offi ce, outnumbered only by upper-respiratory infections.SMOKING raises infl ammation inside the body and hinders the body from healing. Multiple studies establish a link between smoking and low- back pain. CHRONIC BACK PAIN IS DEFINED AS PAIN THAT PERSISTS FOR TWELVE WEEKS OR LONGER, EVEN AFTER AN INITIAL INJURY OR UNDERLYING CAUSE OF ACUTE LOW-BACK PAIN HAS BEEN TREATED. AMERICANS EXPERIENCE LOW-BACK PAIN AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

START BY LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS COMMON PIECE OF EQUIPMENT: THE LAT PULLDOWN MACHINE. Simple and effective, the lat pulldown machine is a staple in gyms. It's designed to work the latissimus dorsi, the triangular muscles on both sides of the spine that wrap under the armpit. The biceps assist during the exercise, as well. First, set your desired weight. Sit on the bench with thighs beneath the two cylindrical pads. Grip the ends of the bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Slowly pull the bar down to your chest. Pause for a moment and allow the bar to slowly return to the top. PRIME FOR PULL-UPS Lat pulldowns can be an excellent option for those who struggle to perform pull-ups. CORE REQUIREMENT Brace your core while performing lat pulldowns to prevent your back from arching. ATTACHED TO YOU Many gyms provide different attachments, such as a V-bar, that can be used instead of the lateral bar. Using a V-bar attachment can work biceps more vigorously than a regular lateral bar can. GET A GRIP Gripping a lat bar at different lengths elicits more activation in certain muscles. A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that the latissimus dorsi muscles are more activated using a wide grip in which hands are placed near the ends of the bar. LAT PULLDOWN MACHINE WORKING MUSCLES LATISSIMUS DORSI RHOMBOIDS BICEPS DELTOIDSTHE LAT PULLDOWN MACHINE OFFERS A QUICK AND SAFE COMPOUND LIFT TO BUILD STRONGER BACK MUSCLES.

Fortified soymilk is the only nondairy milk listed in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans as being comparable to dairy milk. Soyfoods are excellent sources of quality protein. Soy protein is a complete protein that provides all the essential amino acids needed for growth. PROTEIN PRO Use canned soybeans in chili and other bean- based recipes. For a hearty dip, blend canned black soybeans, canned tan soybeans and soybean oil then minced garlic, chopped onion, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, red pepper flakes and ground cumin.Soybean oil is high in poly- unsaturated fat, the type of fat that lowers blood cholesterol levels. So convincing is the evidence that the FDA just awarded a health claim for soybean oil and coronary heart disease. Soybean oil has a neutral flavor and a high smoke point. Use this multipurpose cooking oil for saut \u00e9ing, in salad dressings and for baking.

Often used as a condiment (we recommend sprinkling it over popcorn or on top of a salad), it can also be integrated into most types of cooking. Stir a tablespoon into your favorite pasta or soup to give it a little added nutrition without the added calories. Its rich, savory fl avor melds well in most recipes and makes a great cheese substitute for those who are either vegan or lactose-intolerant.WITH A CHEESY, NUTTY TASTE, THIS HEALTH FOOD IS HIGH IN FLAVORA recent study from the University of Houston found that the ber in nutritional yeast can HELP MAINTAIN WHITE BLOOD CELL LEVELS during strenuous exercise, which is crucial for post-workout recovery.WHAT IS IT? Nutritional yeast contains many of the same nutrients as brewer 's yeast but doesn't share its bitter fl avor. Nutritional yeast is also \"deactivated, \" which means it won 't rise during cooking like baker 's yeast does. Look for brands of nutritional yeast forti ed with vitamin B12, which plays a key role in neurological development and is therefore essential for pregnant women and young children. A long-time staple of vegan cooking, nutritional yeast is nding its way to the mainstream. While food bloggers tout its rich, creamy fl a v o r \u2014 i t 's often cited as a handy cheese substitute\u2014 recent scienti c research highlights its considerable health bene ts. Not only is it rich in protein and high in ber, most brands are also forti ed with B vitamins. What 's more, according to research published in the journal Diabetes , nutritional yeast can also boost your immune system and help regulate blood sugar.

The most common culprits are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat and fish. Some people are allergic to multiple foods. Food allergies can develop at any stage of life, although they're more common in children. \"The most common method [of discovering a food allergy] is by having a bad reaction,\" says Hy-Vee Pharmacist Becky Gobermann of Madison, Wisconsin.
