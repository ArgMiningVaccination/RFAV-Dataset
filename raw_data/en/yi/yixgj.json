We are honored to host the nation's largest indoor agricultural expo. Every January, throngs of people travel from around the region and around the corner to visit th e Farm Show Pennsylvania's State Fair. This year's theme, Inspiring Pennsylvania's Story , invites you to experience the stories of the more than 580,000 people working in Pennsylvania's agriculture and food industry, the economy they drive, and the famil ies and communities that thrive because of them. The Farm Show provides an opportunity to celebrate Pennsylvania agriculture as an economic powerhouse. Our industry generating $135.7 billion dollars for our economy annually - that's almost one fifth of ou r state domestic product. From the smallest organic start -up to a historic farm in the same family for 300 years, Pennsylvania's 58,000 farms and 7.63 million acres of productive farmland are as integral to the prosperity of our communities as they are to our strikingly beautiful landscapes. While you're here, you can experience the stories of families caring for their land and animals using centuries -old methods; stories of breakthroughs in animal care, medicine, and food science; and robotic equipment a nd data -gathering drones that power today's large -scale, precision agriculture. You can see and hear about how farmland is being preserved for the future, how water and pollinators are protected today to feed the people of tomorrow, and how innovation is s ustaining the industry that feeds, fuels, and clothes us all. You can meet the top competitors from among Pennsylvania's 109 county and community fairs and see and hear their unique stories as they proudly display what they have grown, nurtured, produced, or created. They are each a part of Pennsylvania's story, and so are you. We invite you to add your own chapter as we continue Inspiring Pennsylvania's Story during the 2019 Pennsylvania Farm Show. Sincerely, TOM WOLF RUSSELL C. REDDING Governor Secre tary of Agriculture Dear Friend of Pennsylvania Agriculture: Welcome to the 107th Pennsylvania Farm Show! We're pleased to have you as our honored guest at the nation's largest indoor agricultural expo and Pennsylvania's State Fair. We're proud to welcome you to our capital city to experience and taste the best of Pennsylvania's agriculture and food industry \u2014 past, present and future. This year's theme, Rooted in Progress, promises a glimpse at all three. We'll show - case the innovations, ingenuity, and investments powering our past, feeding our present, and propelling Pennsylvania' s $132.5 billion agriculture industry to a prosperous tomorrow. The PA Farm Show is an annual stage where the rich bounty and quality of Pennsylvania agriculture and its people shine. Whether you're a veteran competitor, a first-timer vying for a blue ribbon, an annual visi - tor, or a new guest, we're glad you've joined us to celebrate the inspirational people who feed us, enrich our communities, and sustain our economy every day . You can explore your roots while you're here, and, if you're a young person or seeking change, we hope you catch a glimpse of your future and find career inspiration. The PA Farm Show Complex and Expo Center is a million square-foot classroom where you can meet people who care for animals, raise crops, use high-tech, precision equipment, harvest valuable hardwoods, protect our precious land and water re - sources, and ensure a safe, nutritious food supply to feed a hungry world, no matter what challenges come their way. Agriculture is a field rich with rewarding, diverse career options and Farm Show is a great time to see those careers in action and find a place you fit in. There is nothing like the Farm Show Food Court, where you can sample delicious PA agricultural prod - ucts for every taste. We invite you to meet the neighbors who produce your food and support them by buying a take-home treat from our farm market. If you're an amateur chef or foodie, we invite you to find inspiration at the PA Preferred\u00ae Culinary Connection and sample delicious recipes sourced on PA farms and skillfully prepared by TV chefs and PA culinary geniuses. You may even see a demo and take home a handcrafted creation from the many skilled artisans who grace our great state. Over the course of eight exciting days, the PA Farm Show brings the top youth and adult competitors from Pennsylvania's 108 county and community fairs to proudly display the fruits of their labor throughout the year. We hope you find your roots, nourish your progress, and leave inspired by the people of Pennsylva - nia agriculture. Sincerely, TOM WOLF RUSSELL C. REDDING Governor Secretary , Pennsylvania Department of Agriculturefarmshow.pa.gov 5 The Foundation exists in order to stimulate, facilitate and support educational programs, incentives and events relating to the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show.The 2023 Farm Show Visitors Guide is provided courtesy of the Friends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Foundation, Inc. Information about the purpose and mission of the Foundation is located on page 13. William L. Piper ChairmanFriends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Foundation, Inc. Friends of Farm Show Funding the Future of AgWelcome to the 2023 Pennsylvania Farm Show! Dear Friends, This effort for 2023 is not much different than it has been for the many previous years that I have sat down to Welcome our thousands of visitors. On behalf of our Annual Friends, our Lifetime Friends and our Board of Direc - tors, Welcome \u2014 the enthusiasm is intense! As everyone exited the pandemic-related Virtual 2021 Farm Show and began planning for the in-person 2022 Farm Show, no one knew what to expect concerning participation and attendance. But, in 2022 our producers, agribusinesses, and consumers did not hesitate to return to the walls of our million-square-foot facility to celebrate our $132.5 billion dollar agricultural industry . For 2023, we are hopeful that all of our participants and visitors will be returning to near normal levels. Excitement is overwhelming! Pennsylvania's agriculturalists exhibited tremendous ingenuity and resourcefulness from the time that they began clearing Penn's Woods from East to West to provide food and fiber for their families, to today where our farmers provide sustenance for our Commonwealth's over 13 million residents to populations well beyond our borders. The 107th Farm Show theme, Rooted in Progress, is only fitting. The vast degree of knowledge gained by participants vying for awards, plaques or ribbons engaged in the Farm Show contests provide Roots for advancement of food and fiber expertise whether it is related to poultry, livestock, fruits, vegetables, etc., or any of the other thousands of competitions that occur at this event. Our Commonwealth's 4-H and FFA youth who are so inclined and enthusiastic to be involved in any of their lo - cal programs throughout this vast state can gain Rooted in Progress life lessons that will be immeasurable. These young people are our future agricultural leaders. What better place for them to further develop their Roots in agri - culture than at the Pennsylvania Farm Show? What better way to exemplify this year's Farm Show theme, Rooted in Progress, than to address our Common - wealth's #1 national standing in the Land Preservation Program? To date, Pennsylvania has preserved 6,118 farms containing 616,713 acres of prime farmland in perpetuity for all types of future agriculture production. This land will provide for our future farmers! Thank you to all of our participating farmers! The Board of Directors of the Foundation is very proud to report, that since our financial support of the first Farm Show in 2011, the Board, as of the end of the 2022 Farm Show, has contributed over 1.5 Million Dollars in support of our Mission Statement. W e are hopeful that this Visitor's Guide provides you with valuable information that enhances your educational experience at the 2023 Farm Show. The Foundation sincerely thanks the Visitor's Guide advertisers for their in - volvement and participation since without their help, this publication would not be possible. Thank you for being a Friend of the Pennsylvania Farm Show.

Sunflowers are grown for a variety of reasons including: cover crops, birdseed, sunflower oil, cut flowers, or just to have a sunflower festival. Sunflower oil is a key ingredient in many snack foods produced in the state, including potato chips. Sunflower meal is one of the major protein meals used for livestock feed, particularly for ruminants. Dehulled sunflower meal, which is high in fiber and amino acids, can have as much as 41% crude protein. Sunflower protein can be used as a sole source of protein in beef rations.What to Expect: The display will teach more about how sunflowers are being grown and used in the Keystone State! Photo by Leslie J. Bowman HELP FARMERS REDUCE WASTE FIGHT HUNGERThe Sunflower display is sponsored by: Uglies\u00ae Kettle Chips by Dieffenbach's Snacks rely on sunflower oil for their distinct flavor and quality , and the kettle cooking process shown in the exhibit demonstrates the steps required to make our delicious, small-batch Uglies\u00ae Kettle Chips. \"...They are crafted in small batches from potatoes with slight imperfections - perhaps the wrong size, wrong color, slightly blemished or just farmer surplus. By making Uglies\u00ae Kettle Chips, we're supporting farmers, reducing food waste, and fighting hunger! It's good to be ugly, because what we lack in looks, we make up for in taste!\" - Bob Zender Dieffenbach's Director Of Marketing28 107th Pennsylvania Farm Show LAUNCH YOUR CAREER WITH 4-H STATE COUNCIL18 U.S.C. 707 Pennsylvania 4-H is in the business of building leaders for tomorrow through hands-on work encouraging personal growth and lifelong learning.

Instead of housing cows and chickens, horses and hogs and various competitions, the complex in Janu - ary 1943 housed the Pennsylvania State School of Aeronautics, where thousands of civilians came to learn how to repair airplane engines shot up in W orld War II. The complex later became an Army Air Corps aircraft engine repair facility where workers over - hauled aircraft engines. Friends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Founda - tion, Inc. Historian Mary Klaus details the role of the Farm Show Complex during those years, calling the era,, \"one of the Farm Show's best kept secrets\" in her book,\"Blue Ribbon Patriotism.\" Klaus, author of \"Hold Your Horses! The Pennsyl - vania Farm Show at 100,\" said readers of \"Blue Rib - bon Patriotism\" will learn how: Mary Satkanus Lidwell, the oldest of 10 chil - dren in her family, became a classic \"Rosie the Riv - eter.\" The Cambria County young woman got into the Pennsylvania State School of Aeronautics and later worked at the Middletown Air Depot to have money to help her mother raise her siblings. She and a friend paid $3 a week to rent a room in someone's house.blue ribb n patriotism Tales of Farm Show Complex and WWII: Tales of Farm Show Complex and WWII: History Book Sales Support Farm Show's FutureHistory Book Sales Support Farm Show's Future Photos courtesy of The Pennsylvania Farm Show Archives The late Esther (McKinney) Tritt was called to the Lamberton High School principal's office and told she was one of six students selected to help the government in the U.S. Air Corps. Despite her par - ents' worries and her church's disapproval, the feisty teenager attended the Pennsylvania State School of Aeronautics in the Farm Show Complex, then went to work at the Middletown Air Depot refurbishing and repairing military aircraft.44 107th Pennsylvania Farm Show Slang from those years included ducky shin - cracker - a good dancer; killer diller - the best; Army chicken - beans and franks; and gams - legs. Women, who couldn't buy stockings because silk and nylon was needed for the war effort, shaved their legs, painted them with leg makeup to replicate stockings and used eyebrow pencils to draw seams up the back of their legs to look like the seams in real stockings of the day. Gen. George S. Patton wrote to his pen pal in Harrisburg, \"While I was in America, I flew over Har - risburg, but was not low enough to pick out the state Farm Show Building.\"T wo fans installed by the Army Air Corps during the early 1940s are still running in the Farm Show Com - plex.

Ties That Bind Scrubgrass Stitchers Guild met at the Scrubgrass Grange Hall in Emlenton, Pa. on Monday May 3rd to attend Beverly Gruber's presentation, \"Ties that Bind\" which included information on her collection of over seventy aprons that go back decades. Gruber shared that many of us may think of grandma baking that apple pie or Aunt Jane carving the Thanksgiving turkey. For some aprons symbolized status or occupation and other aprons were worn to keep our clothes from getting dirty. In the days when a woman's place was unquestionably in the home, one thing that women had was a drawer full of neatly ironed aprons. There were practical ones for everyday, and cute ones for when company was coming. Whether a functional or elaborate apron they reflect craftmanship, beauty and are classics of American Folk art. Gruber shared that the rst apron was made by Adam and Eve when they sewed gs leaves together. The name apron comes from the French word \"napron\" which Gruber said during the middle ages was an extra piece of cloth tied over a woman's skirt before she sat down at the table. Aprons were made of animal skin and worn by men, in their jobs as blacksmith's, cobblers, woodworke rs, and tanners. Colors were designated per profession: blue for gardners, spinners, and weavers, green for butlers, and white for masons. In the 18th century apron fabrics were cambric and silk as ladies started to wear aprons for dress-up with embroidery, ruffles, ribbons and bows being added. Into the 19th century aprons continued to change shared Gruber with the design of the \"allover\" apro n that had armholes for women to use when working in their good clothes. In the early 1920's special work projects for farm youth were developed shared Gruber, 4-H was adapted in 1913. The \"Mother Hubbard\" style apron was worn which had broad shoulder strap and ties and protected the entire dress and were often made from cotton prints and had pockets. In the 1930's most women made their aprons wit h McCall's or Butterick pattern cost 15 cents. It was also commonplace to use grain feed sacks from the feed mill. They came in beautiful designs. The 1940's brought more fabrics, decorations and less use of the bib apron. You would nd rick- rack, crocheted appliques, smocking, stencil, and embroidery. Skipping forward to the 1980's more men were wearing aprons as barbequing became popular. G ruber said that aprons recalls a time, a place, a story, a face, it is because of these important ties that we must treasure our aprons and recognize the threads which they sew among us and the stories they tell about us. Beverly Gruber holds up an apron made by mother which still has the blue ribbon she won at the PA Farm Show. Beverly Gruber is showing an example of how fancy aprons were becoming for social events. Two beautiful examples of the handcrafted crocheted aprons. 5Questions?

Cliff passed away on Feb. 20, 2022. Cliff Day taught ag education for 32 years at the Garden Spot High School in New Holland. When he retired from teaching, he then went on to work at the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture for ten years. Bob Lauffer, who taught with Cliff, shares, \"I learned to value his insights and wealth of knowledge but just as importantly his genuine caring spirit. Cliff had the ability to reach out to and connect with certain students that no one else seemed to be able to.\" Kristin Crawford, a student of Cliff's back in the late 1980s, said, \"I always had a high level of respect for him as my agriculture advisor and teacher.\" The Friends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Foundation, Inc. appreciated Cliff for his volun - teerism and involvement at the Farm Show. His passion for agricultural education and helping others and his kindness are part of his legacy .

The Farm Show is a perfect example of the phrase, \"many hands make light work.\" Without the teamwork of a cast of thousands coming together to host visitors from across Pennsylvania and around the world, the Farm Show would not run as smoothly as it does. This year, we want you to meet our floor managers. If you see them working around the complex, be sure to thank them!

I'm very much a \"people person\" and love helping others. I look forward to working with the vendors and learning more about the Farm Show behind the scenes. I'm a Pennsylvania native; my husband, Cliff, and I live in Cumberland County. We have three children and five grandchildren, which keeps us busy. I de-scribe myself as a daughter of \"hobby farmers\" as we lived on ten acres, and mom was very much into gardening, raising animals, and living off the land. My Gramm and parents felt it was important for me to learn skills to make it through the rough times. I grew up learning a litany of skills; gardening, cooking, sewing, hunting, and fishing. I once asked my Gramm why I didn't have artistic talents like others in my fam-ily. She wrapped her arm around me and patted my hand, and said, \"You have the \"gift of gab.\" I smile when I think of her reply, but that \"gift of gab\" has served me well with agriculture storytelling. I have a MA in education/adult training and a BS in business management from the University of Phoe-nix. I completed the Penn State Extension Rural- Urban Leadership Program in 2013. I currently serve as a board member of The Friends of the PA Farm Show Foundation, Inc. and a member of the Phila - delphia Society of Promoting Agriculture, where I am the communication chairperson. I am the President of the Cumberland Valley Grange and a member of the Shippensburg Young Farmers. The Pennsylva - nia State Grange employed me as their membership/communications director.Main Hall Assistant Floor and Stage Manager Madi Shaw Meet Madi Hello! My name is Madi Shaw and I am super excited to be the 2023 Assistant Main Hall Manager! Although this is my first time act- ing in a management role, I am no stranger to this wonderful agricul - tural event! I have been partici-pating at the Farm Show every year since I was five years old and I am now 21! I have participated in so many contests, including Sheep-to-Shawl and Fleece-to-Shawl, square danc-ing, potato judging, Master Showman, and my family even helped start the Angorapalooza event! In 4-H and at the Farm Show I have shown rabbits, poultry, swine, dairy cows, sheep, goats, alpacas, horses, and other small animal pets. Growing up in Harrisburg, it was always very con- venient to go to the Farm Show, but now that I live in Westmoreland County, about 3 1/2 hours away, that will not stop me from being heavily involved in the Farm Show! I was a member of the 2020 and 2021 PA Farm Show Jr. Committee and from the time I was five years old until I was 18, I volunteered in the informa-tion booths to handout Farm Show programs. One of my favorite things about the Farm Show is having the opportunity educate individuals about ag-riculture both on stage and off stage. I would attend events at the Farm Show Complex all year round and I always look forward to the Farm Show itself! This year as the assistant manager , I will be working alongside Lizzie Bailey in helping manage the Main Hall as well as the Family Living Stage. We both will be working hard to ensure all vendors in the Main Hall have a smooth Farm Show experience and we will be assisting everyone we scheduled to be present-ing on the Family Living stage. I am looking forward to all of the new experiences both Lizzie and I will be encountering together and I want to thank the Friends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Foundation, Inc. for graciously including me in the Farm Show family!

I'm from Loretto Pennsylvania, where I live and work with my fam-ily on our 250-cow dairy farm. We also process our own milk and de-liver it to schools and stores and people's front doors. I've come full circle with Farm Show, where I start- ed out as an exhibitor of market goats and dairy cattle and then joined the PA Farm Show Junior Committee, and recently was an intern for the Calving Corner. New for this year, I will be taking on the task of be- ing one of the Barn Managers, where I will bridge the gap between the exhibitor and Farm Show coordina - tors. I look forward to keeping shows and activities running smoothly for staff, exhibitors and spectators. I cannot wait to show the public what agriculture looks like and the opportunities that are within. Meet Lexi: Lexi is a Pennsylva - nia native currently living in north - ern York County. She' s an avid equestrian, hav - ing grown up competing in hunt - ers and equitation, competing on her college equestrian team, and recently making the switch to the world of eventing. She competes in the apiculture division of the Farm Show alongside her dad, who she raises hon - eybees with. Lexi works full-time in event coordination in the music and sports industries. She attended Drexel University in Philadelphia where she earned her degree in music industry studies, with a concentra - tion in business. Lexi most recently worked as the Floor Manager of the 2022 Keystone International Livestock Exposition, ensuring a safe and success - ful show for exhibitors and visitors.

Recognizing the value of agriculture to the state' s economy, this program is designed to help students reach their goals and hopefully keep them our agriculture industry. The Farm Show Scholarship Foundation was established in 1993 through the vision and gen - erous support of several key leaders in agricul - ture and three companies that contributed more than $1 1,000 toward scholarships. Since then, the Foundation has awarded nearly $1.7 million in scholarships to nearly 600 worthy 4-H and FFA youth. Eligible applicants must be enrolled in a post- secondary educational institution and have been a P A Farm Show exhibitor of junior market livestock including sheep, steers, swine, rabbits or goats.

The Farm Show Junior Live- stock Sale provides the opportunity to take home meat raised right here in the Keystone State. 4-H and FFA members work hard for a year or more, to prepare to show their market livestock over the three days at the beginning of the PA Farm Show. Their work purchasing, raising, training, clipping, and showing their market animals has all led to the minute they bring their animal to the auction block at Tuesday's sale. Bidders support these youth, who then invest the money in their education or their herds and flocks. Why buy an animal at the Junior Livestock Sale? Cheaper than purchasing meat at the store. Knowing where your food comes from and who raised it. Supporting the next generation of agriculturalists and agriculture promoters. Do you have a preferred butcher shop? If so, let them know you'd like them to han - dle harvesting and fabrication of an animal you hope to purchase at the Farm Show . If not, contact your county Penn State Exten - sion office for help locating a shop. If you are purchasing a hog: all hogs must go directly to harvest with pre-approval of trucking and harvest facilities. If you don't have a livestock trailer, your butcher shop, or the exhibitor you plan to purchase from, may be able to help you find a hauler. Please contact the PA Farm Show's livestock office at 717-787-2905 if you need more info.But before you seek the winning bid: Do you have enough freezer space? (Here' s how much meat to expect!) Steer: 450-500 pounds of beef Hog: 120-150 pounds of pork (bacon, sausage, ham) Sheep: 40-55 pounds of lamb Goat: 35 pounds of meat Rabbit (sold by pen): 3-4 pounds each94 107th Pennsylvania Farm Show2023 Sponsors Friends of the Pennsylvania Farm Show F oundation, Inc. \u2014 Sponsors~ MISSION STATEMENT~ The Foundation exists in order to stimulate, facilitate and support educational programs, incentives and events relating to the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show.
