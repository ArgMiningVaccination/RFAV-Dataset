A Healthy Diet = A Healthy Life However, remember to consider all the aspects of a Healthy and Vibrant life including Emotionally, Mentally, Spiritually, and Physically. An unawareness that may occur or an unintentional pattern of deficiencies and gaps within the support of the body, mind, and spirit that may need to be recognized and brought to attention to be addressed is: The individual(s) will cleanse/liberate themselves from emotionally charged experiences, but continue to eat sugar and processed foods, then will question why their \"physical\" life isn't getting any better. On the other hand, seeing the individual(s) becoming physically fit and following through with an exceptional nutritional regimen and physical fitness choices, but disregards the emotional and mental aspects and denies facing themselves, their trauma, \"trapped\" emotions within the body, or shifting their mental stagnation (negative belief(s)/self-talk, and/or subconscious programming). Additionally, the spiritual aspects of prayer/meditation, and self-care are deprived of as well and the individual lacks self-nourishment needed to care for oneself. Reflecting on granting the gracefulness of patience and understanding that being gentle and coming to terms with beginning a restoration of the mind, body, spirit is a personal and \"individualized\" continual sequence of healing! Once you change the Frequency, Energy, and Vibration- Healing of the whole self-commences Physically, Emotionally, and Spiritually Traci Shetler, CTN Our Second Blog Entry Our Second Blog Entry February 11, 2023 Do you Know what Naturopathy is?? WHAT IS NATUROPATHY: It is one the oldest forms of healing. It is an art, science, and philosophy that takes into account the integrity of the whole person and uses natural approaches to guide the person in their healing process. Naturopathy includes the individual in the entirety of the physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental aspects as the body is designed by Natural Law to have the innate ability to restore and heal itself. ~ Traci Shetler, CTN To join Facebook link Reflections with a Naturopath [(click here)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1540112883120117/?ref=share_group_link) Our First Blog Entry Our First Blog Entry February 11, 2023 What are the Energy Ring Tables? The ICOSA-X Energy Chambers are a customized massage table that incorporates copper tensor rings, which are superconductors for enhancing coherence within the body allowing the individual lying on the massage table to be engulfed in pure white light at the core of their own biofield. While bathing in your own biofield it is of upmost importance to empower yourself with holding the intentions throughout your meditation and relaxation of clearing the mind and essentially calming your autonomic nervous system and switching out of the excessive or dominant state of the sympathetic nervous system. Being gripped in this excessive sympathetic state can be attained by high intensity stress that most individuals are stuck in due to continual destructive patterns in relationships, career/work, beliefs/programming, and/or financial issues causing nervousness, restlessness, anxiety, headaches, digestion issues, bowel/urination issues, heart palpations/issues, eating disorders, brain fog, forgetfulness, weight issues, panic attacks, anger, frustration, annoyance, bitterness, and overall negatively charged life experiences in general. When this habitual process is freed and reestablished these dominating toxic patterns in everyday living can then allow for restoration, learning, and healing within our own physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual bodies because the individual is moving out of the excessively dominating state and moving into a more balanced and aligned state within, which formulates Coherence!

It is a superconductor that neutralizes magnetic fields, bringing coherency to chaos, and easily stabilizes and equalizes the bio magnetic and energy fields of the body. Tensor Fields produce a measurable gravitational effect. Tensor Technology is noted for its use in healing, energizing, and restructuring water, enhancing plant growth and vitality, beekeeping, among thousands of other observations, including connectivity to the spiritual. Tensor Fields are science based, though go far beyond the current scope and reality of most sciences. Tensor Rings are truly an integration of Scientific and Spiritual Technologies.\" Cited from: Public Domain 2023 Twistedsage Studios. \"What are Tensor Rings.\" January 21, 2023: [https://twistedsage.com/what-is-a-tensor-ring/](https://twistedsage.com/what-is-a-tensor-ring/) Our First Featured Book for the Natural Health Book Club February 24, 2023 Our First Featured Book for the Natural Health Book Club February 24, 2023 Wow, I've been reading and writing notes to prepare for our upcoming natural health book club meeting (February 24th at 5:00) with our first featured book. We will be reading 3-4 chapters a month and review and share notes each monthly meeting with what we learned. An interesting quote from the book states, \"It doesn't matter how much you drive around; you will never get to where you want to go if you don't have the right road map.\" ~Stanley Rosenberg, from \"Accessing the Healing of the Vagus Nerve.\" - Chapter 1 Overview: Page 11: \"Unique responses are the norm, not the exception (be cautious giving supplements, homeopathic remedies, etc.). Unfortunately, our world has heightened in toxicity related to the commonness of chemicals, heavy metals, genetically modified food (GMO'S), radioactivity, and EMF's (electromagnetic radiation) - rising epidemic.\" Page 12: \"These conditions are related to years of biochemical and medical dominoes! Looking at an individuals experience(s) such as an illness, perhaps a virus, motor vehicle accident (MVA), or simply childbirth, and for some reason is not fully restored to health and then more susceptible to another illness, then another, and then another, until the patient reaches out (to your doorstep). We need to work through these steps to clarify all the components, determine which of the instigating influences is the leading interference with the healing process, and slowly and gently begin to reverse it. Step 1: Find the ROOT CAUSE Step 2: Tease them Apart (Toxicity vs Sensitivities or Multiple chemical sensitivities - MCS) Step 3: Begin the Treatment Process: \"NEED REBOOTED\" Signs of Complex Medical Model include: Tired all the time Can't read or see well Can't focus or concentrate or think sometimes Headache Joint and muscle pain Anxiety Depression Ringing in the ears Odd electrical and vibration sensations going up and down your spine Nausea Diarrhea Numbness and tingling on your chin **As well as highly Sensitive to just about anything your doctor or health practitioner gives you!
