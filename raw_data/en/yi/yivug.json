However, finding accurate information is challenging: no herbs have been scientifically proven to prevent or treat COVID-19, and some may even cause harm. The following evidence-based information on popular herbs used for immunity and to relieve anxiety and stress is adapted from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's [About Herbs](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs) website. The links will take you to the full monographs to learn more about adverse effects and herb-drug interactions. Herbs and Supplements for Immunity [Echinacea](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/echinacea)is widely used to stimulate the immune system and prevent and treat the common cold and influenza. [Clinical data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24877712)suggest that it may help improve immune function, but findings on [cold prevention](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668266)are not definitive. [Ginger](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ginger)is commonly used in culinary preparations, and it's used in traditional medicine for cold, fevers, headache, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, no clinical evidence supports antiviral effects. [Zinc](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/zinc)is used to treat the common cold, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. [It has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775705)to help reduce the symptoms and duration of the common cold, but only when taken within 24 hours after symptoms appear. [Garlic](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/garlic)is a mainstay of many cuisines around the world. Clinical studies show that it [stimulates the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26764326)and [may prevent the common cold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419312), but robust data are lacking. Herbs and Supplements for Anxiety and Stress [Ashwagandha](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ashwagandha), referred to as \"Indian ginseng,\" is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine to relieve [anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718255)and [stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517876). Clinical studies indicate that it may help alleviate anxiety and stress and improve [sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31728244)in patients with insomnia. [Chamomile](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/chamomile-german)is a popular relaxant that's shown modest benefits for chronic insomnia and anxiety. It was also reported useful for improving [sleep quality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29154054), [fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21939549), and [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894890). [Valerian](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/valerian)is known for its calming effects, but current [evidence is insufficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653088)to support its use for reducing anxiety. [L-theanine](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/l-theanine)is an amino acid in green tea that's known for its relaxant effects. It was shown to be safe in improving [depressive symptoms and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27396868)in patients with major depressive disorder. Oncology nurses have an important role in informing patients that no herbs can cure COVID-19, that indiscriminate use of herbal supplements is unsafe, and that supplements have the potential to interact with prescription medications. The best way to prevent or treat COVID-19 is to follow advice from healthcare authorities and clinicians, not self-medicating with herbs and supplements. "}
