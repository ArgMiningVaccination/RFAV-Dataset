Rudolf Steiner indicated 3 seven year cycles of growth and development that comprise the journey of childhood for every human being. Within each 7 year cycle (birth-7yrs, , 7-14yrs, 14-21yrs,) growth processes are connected to three distinct systems within the bodily vehicle: the nerve-sense system (head and nerve endings), the rhythmic system (torso and rhythmic organs) and the metabolic system (limbs and metabolizing organs), each pertaining to different aspects of the physical body, which also have reflections in both the child's inner experiences and social interactions. While each system is unique, and one system is more dominant than the others during particular stages of growth, the systems also overlap and interact with complex and profound wisdom throughout child development. By recognizing the collective journey of childhood and understanding the developmental stages from infancy through to adulthood, we can gain insights into healthy growth and development that help us to perceive and meet the needs of our children. Constitutional Tendencies Understanding the threefold nature of the human being helps us understand children's constitutional tendencies, which manifest as a bodily dominance either in the upper pole (the nerve-sense system or pole of consciousness) or in the lower pole (the metabolic-limb system or pole of life). These tendencies are expressed in different types of difficulties, preferences, and capacities in children, in areas such as motor skills, behavior, learning style, appetite, food and nutrition, sleep, warmth, movement, environment, social life, health and illness, and relationship to technology. Recognizing and understanding a child's constitutional tendencies is essential for supporting health and well-being through child development and provides insight into how we can best support them educationally, therapeutically and nutritionally. The care and development of the senses in the first seven years An introduction to the four foundational senses supportive activities for the healthy development of the touch sense in Early Childhood: The greater the variety of natural materials that we experience, the more opportunity we have of meeting many perspectives of life and our self. Create opportunities for experiencing light silks and heavy stones, rough barks and slippery shells, spikey ferns and spongy petals, soft pillows and hard benches. Touching a variety of natural fibres makes us feel something different with each experience and requires us to bring something of our self to meet it. Some supportive activities for the healthy development of the life sense in Early Childhood: Weaving, knitting, bread baking, gardening and experiencing the changes and transitions in nature help establish a connection to the ebb and flow, death and life processes in nature and in our self. Rhythm in movement, song and routine help experience these changes in the day. Some supportive activities for the healthy development of the movement sense in Early Childhood: For children, it helps to have lots of gross motor activities that have a purpose and a rhythm including bread baking, gardening, climbing, walking, building and preparing for seasonal changes. Folding cloths and sheets with another child encourages them to mirror a movement because they have to meet each other's fingers to catch the corner of the cloth. They walk backwards to open the cloth out again and repeat the steps becoming closer each time while judging the distance. Some supportive activities for the healthy development of the balance sense in Early Childhood: Ensure that children have daily opportunities of losing uprightness and regaining it in activities such as using stilts and bicycles, crossing wobbly bridges and walking upon stump ends or rocks around a garden edge. Having non-uniform spacing between steps keeps us aware of where we have to place our feet. "}
