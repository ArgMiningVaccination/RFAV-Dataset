First Edition : June 2012 iii iv v NATIONAL ANTHEM vi \"Education plays a vital role in shaping the destiny of the nation\" is an old dictum which percolates in all spirit while restructuring the syllabi, the fifth phase of change, ever since the State accepted 10+2 pattern of education. Marked as the premier syllabi of thetwenty-first century, it intends to empower the students for confronting the present and futurechallenges of life and be citizen of tomorrow, in letter and spirit. The syllabi for the different subjects have been restructured after the careful reflection of the analogous documents of the different States and that of 'NCERT's \"National Curriculum Framework of School Education 2005\" keeping the standard at par with the National level. The unique position of the State, the local needs and aspirations of the peopleare duly considered in Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework 2010. The expectations asenvisaged in the document are well reflected into the making of the syllabi. A solid base forthe foundation of the new syllabi is being provided by the other documents, such as 'Rightto Education 2009' and 'Learning without Burden'. Infact, these documents are the motivating documents that have prompted to restructure the syllabi. These documents have raised many issues that are social, economical, cultural and so on. They need to be immediately addressedthrough the revised textbooks. The syllabi will provide the essential structure to remould withthe expectations of new era. While restructuring the syllabi the Board had undertaken variousstudies, such as, comparative analysis of the syllabi of NCERT and the syllabi of the differentstates, analysis of the information/suggestions collected through widely circulated questionnaire, newspaper reports, historical perspective, etc. A critical exercise of knowing the expectations of the stakeholders was carried out with a specially designed questionnaire, which provedhelpful in shaping the \"syllabi of the people'. The curricular concerns ushered in due to the National, International, Global affairs, political, social, economic upheavals along with explosion of knowledge and technologyhave all been reflected in the syllabi. The metamorphosis experienced in the last decade in all the fields of life and envisaging the aftermath of the circumstances have been rightly interwoven in the fabric of the different subjects, making the syllabi truly needbased,futuristic fulfilling the requisitions of the stakeholders. These syllabi will be implemented progressively in Stds. XI and XII commencing from the academic year 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 respectively. It is hoped that the syllabiwill be received warmly and in its right earnest. As a remarkable feature of the syllabi Information and Communication Technology Skill (ICT) will be introduced as a compulsory subject from Std. IX. It is hoped that it will take the students of Maharashtra far above the national standards.FOREWORD Sarjerao Jadhav Chairman Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Pune - 411 004. vii Analytical Perspective on Curriculum Development Background Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Kothari Commission (1964-66) and National Education Policy(1968), the State of Maharashtra adopted the 10+2+3 educational pattern and implemented uniformly throughout the state. Accordinglythe first Secondary School Certificate Examination on the new syllabi was held in April 1975. The implementation at the +2stage for Std. XI and Std. XII was done from the academic year 1975-76 and 1976-77 respectively. The first Higher SecondaryCertificate Examination was held in April 1977. Subsequently the syllabi were revised based on the recommendations of Dr.Ishwarbhai Patel National Review Committee. This was implemented for Std. VIII from the academic year 1982-83 and first S.S.C.Examination was conducted in March 1985. It was implemented at the +2 stage from the year 1985-86 and 1986-87 respectively and the firstHigher Secondary Certificate Examination was held in March 1987. Based on the National Policy of 1986 the syllabi were again restructured for the thirdtime. These syllabi were implemented for Std. IX and Std. XI simultaneously in the academicyear 1994-95 and for Std. X and Std. XII in the year 1995-96. The first Secondary School Certificate and Higher Secondary CertificateExaminations were held in March 1996 by the Board.Taking inspiration from National curriculum Framework 2000, the enterprise of restructuring the syllabus was undertaken.Keeping up with the National Standards the revised syllabus was prepared and it was implemented in the schools in the year 2005and 2006 and subsequently in the year 2006 and 2007, By the time the revised course was introduced, National Curriculum Framework2005 was published. In the light of the recommendations inspection of the syllabi and textbooks was made, considerable changes werealso made. However, taking into consideration the position papers published by NCERT in connection with NCF 2005 Maharashtra StateCurriculum Framework was prepared. This again gave a rise to rethink of restructuring the syllabi. The first Secondary School Certificateexamination and Higher Secondary Certificate examination will be held in the year March 2014. Participative restructuring of the Syllabi While restructuring the syllabi after almost a decade, a variety of exercises wereundertaken by the State Board to ensure a broad-based participation of the stakeholders. Syllabi are often criticized as being framed byexperts in ivory towers and stakeholders' views are ignored. The syllabi fail to reflect the needs and aspirations of the society. To pre-empt this,the State Board undertook various studies before forming its policy. This also ensured the adopting of the 'bottom up' policy i.e. takinginto consideration the needs of the society before framing the syllabi.INTRODUCTION viii A comprehensive questionnaire was developed covering various issues relevant to the framing of syllabi, such as scheme of thesubjects, nature of textbooks, contents of the textbooks, teaching-learning process, evaluation process, inclusion of non-scholastic subjects,need to bring quality into education, need to include life skill education, etc. The questionnaire was focused and yet kept openfor the public to comment on. The respondents were requested to make a note of their expectations from the newsyllabi and give valuable suggestions. The respondents to the questionnaire included headmasters, teachers, parents, experts ineducation, and heads of the institutions, social workers, education officers, deputy directors of education, elected members, governmentofficers, students and regular website surfers. The exercise gave everyone the opportunity to have their say in framing the syllabi of theState. It was also made available through a website. The responses received were analysed and the observations were made available tothe various Subject Boards of Studies for their consideration. Thus, an effort has been made to make the syllabi truly of the people and bythe people. Other Studies Apart from the questionnaire the State Board also undertook various studies to have the relevant database for revising the syllabi. The study was again reported whilerestructuring the syllabi. 1. Subjectwise review of previous Syllabi The study included a review of the old existing syllabi implemented in the State from time to time. It is to be noted that in keeping with the changing needs ofthe times, the Board incorporated changes in the content, approach, methodology, etc. in the syllabi at every stage. Inframing the new syllabi, again, a conscious effort was made to include challenging areas to keep pace with thechallenges of the changing world scenario. 2. Comparative analysis of the Syllabi of other StatesBefore, framing its own policy as in- depth study of the syllabi of various subjects from different State Boards ofEducation in India was undertaken. The major objectives of the enterprise were - 1. To compare difficulty levels of syllabi in Maharashtra with that of syllabi of otherStates. 2. To decide the importance to be accorded to a particular subject in the curriculumset up. 3. To analyse the structuring of the content of the syllabi. 4. To study the scope and limitations of different subjects. 5. To study the scope and limitations of content. 6. To decide the best approach towards teaching and learning. 7. To compare the syllabi through different perspectives. 8. To study the evaluation system.9. To find out which syllabus is closest to our needs. 10. To find out the extent to which the syllabi in Maharashtra are at par with the syllabi of other States. 11. To establish a foundation for restructuring the syllabi. 12. To undertake the necessary research and ix restructuring the syllabi. Different parameters of observation were decided upon and detailed reading of thesyllabi was undertaken. The parameters included - 1. The place of the subject in the curriculum. 2. Objectives of the syllabus. 3. Presentation of the syllabus.4. Contents of the syllabus. 5. Suitability of the textbooks with respect to the syllabus. 6. Periods to be allotted.7. Evaluation pattern. 8. Total marks to be allotted to the examination. 9. Duration of the examination.10. Minimum marks for passing.11. Design of the question paper and test items.The Syllabi of the different States like Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Bengal were considered. The syllabi of NCERT,CBSE and ICSE were also studied and a comparative statement was evolved to note the status of the State's position. An attempt wasmade by the Boards of Studies to incorporate the best in all these syllabi after considering the local needs and the background of ourstudents. The exercise was an effort to keep the State syllabi at par with national standard. 3. Study of the Newspaper Cuttings Often the public expresses its opinions about various issues pertaining to educationthrough newspapers. Therefore, cuttings ofnewspapers dealing with educational issues. 4. Reactions of Expert Teachers To ascertain the valuable opinions of theexperienced teachers in the field regarding theexisting syllabi of different subjects questionnaire was sent to about hundredteachers of different subjects throughout the state. They were requested to send their responses. The questionnaire was framed so asto elicit the reactions of these teachers regarding objectives, content and presentation of the syllabi:1. Under 'Objectives' the study aimed at examining:1.1 The suitability of the objectives in each subject 1.2 Clarity of the objectives1.3 Scope and limitations of the objectives 1.4 Drawback of the objectives1.5 Changes needed in the objectives to suit the changing times 2. Under 'content' of the subject, reactions to the following points were studied:2.1 Desired contents in the syllabus 2.2 The suitability of the content 2.3 Scope and limitations of the content2.4 Drawbacks in the content 2.5 The changes called for in the content to suit the changing needs of the times 3. Under 'presentation' of the syllabus, opinions on the following issues werestudied : 3.1 Objectives 3.2 Teaching-learning process3.3 Textbooks and learning material 3.4 Evaluation process 3.5 Reference materialThe views have immensely helped the State Board in framing the restructured syllabi. x Features of the restructured Syllabi The periodic reframing of the syllabi of almost all the subjects ensures an adequate coverage of knowledge and information in accordance with the times and the age group of the learners.

The coursebooks and other materials will offer necessary guidance in this regard. Grammar Grammar has an important role to play in the teaching and learning of English. However, our focus has to be not so much on the rules of grammar but on the use of grammar.The knowledge of grammar should lead to an effective use/application of the skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing.Therefore, the focus has to be on the functional aspects of grammar and not on the formal ones.

Students pursue a common curriculum up to class X and would have developed asubstantive understanding of the environmentalissues from the perspective of both natural and social sciences. At the higher secondary stage, that is, in classes XI and XII, they pursue many differentacademic streams drawn from languages, sciences, mathematics, social sciences, commerce, arts and physical education or vocational courses intended to help learnersbecome skilful, [productive and efficient workers. It is important that the students further strengthen their knowledge and understandingof various aspects of environment and its problems and acquire attitudes and behaviours desirable for environmental improvement, safetymanagement, and sustainable development. By the time students enter class XI they will be mature enough to effectively participatein formulation, planning and implementation of projects and investigative studies pertaining to environmental problems. In this course, the Environment is treated as an interconnected system of a variety ofcomponents including people, institutions,knowledge, artefacts, geosphere (atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere), biosphere (ecosystems, biological populations), energy,material, and information flows. An attempt has been made to illustrate the manifold environmental impacts that cascade throughsuch interconnected systems and bring about continual processes of environmental change. Std. XI 1.

The syllabus designed and finalized and prepared by NCERT for std. 11 & 12th has to be followed by the state after adapting it according to their local specific needs. Maharashtra state has adapted the syllabus of Environment Education prepared by NCERT and taking into consideration the local specificity the education material isprepared accordingly. Separate text books have been prepared for std. 11 & 12th. Local specific examples have been included so as to make the book student friendly. Various activities have beenincluded to make the book and overall Environment Education activity based. Journalassignments are also included to make the assessment process easy for students and teachers as well. An attempt has been made to make Environment Education interesting as far as possible and in accordance with the local needs and national needs as well. 10 Introduction The process of Health and Physical Education requires the integration of psychomotor, cognitive and affective learning. As a part of this process, the physical educationcontent area establishes the competencies and skills necessary for all students to be physically, mentally, socially and emotionally educated.Each individual posseses a Life Energy Curve, which cannot be rewritten but can be improved upon. It is a fact that we have been successful in engineering activity out of modern life andwe train children to be sedentary. Researchstrongly suggests that this life style would ultimately lead to the onset of hypokinetic diseases like premature death, blood pressure,diabetes, cardiac problems, etc. Stress is one more factor that is adversely affecting the lives of one and all. Hence intervention inthe schooling age would be one of the keys to address this serious problem. There is a growing momentum for change, and so theproposed syllabus of Health and Physical Education has adopted a totally new approach. We now seek to bring reformative change. This challenge requires our approach to the subject with a whole new mind set. It focuses on encouraging the adoption of appropriatelife long exercise behaviours in order to develop and maintain physical fitness for adequate functional capacity and healthenhancement.The proposed syllabus has certain distinctcharacteristics:1. It has been designed for the masses and not merely for selected few. 2. It is realistic, achievable, effective, accountable and objectively measurable. 3. At this stage it is developed on the basis of the curriculum of the primary stage. 4. It takes care of the Rural and Urban school settings, the availability of infrastructure,the time span of a period and the teacher:student ratio. 5. It proposes continuous comprehensive evaluation of students participation. 6. Self learning has also been incorporated in the syllabus in terms of assignments,observation, project work etc. 7. A new concept of deriving a Physical Fitness Index for each school has beensuggested. Motivation in terms of Awards would also be considered for the Best School. Wide range of options have been suggested, so as to take care of diversity in theState. The focus being Fitness, Fun, Excitementand Skill, along with the development of a positive attitude towards life long exercise behaviour which would ultimately lead toWellness and the Health of the Nation.Health and Physical Education 14 10) Cricket 11) Cycling 12) Football13) Gymnastics 14) Hockey 15) Handball16) Judo 17) Kho-Kho 18) Kabaddi19) Karate 20) Tennis 21) Roller Skating22) Soft ball 23) Swimming 24) Throw ball25) Table Tennis 26) Volleyball 27) Water polo28) Wt.

Language expresses our ideas, views, and other imaginations. With thelanguage we celebrate our trend and tradition.Gujarati (03) 20 Development of language is ultimately stimulated by our cultural heritage and the needs of social development, but we would notoverlook the reverse dependence either.

The Colonialism in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries helped increase their spheres of dominance the world over. The two worldwars and their aftermath however changed all this. In the post world war scenario Japan has emerged from the ashes to become a major industrial force in the world. Whether it isheavy engineering, electronics, or automobile industry, Japan has taken the lead and flooded the world markets with quality goods at muchcheaper prices. Industry apart, Japanese work culture is also an object-lesson in discipline and perfection and is being adopted by othercountries. With growing affluence, the Japanese are major contributors to the tourism industry.Today, their presence is in evidence at every tourist spot the world over. India, for its part, has several tie-ups with Japanese companies. We are also trying topromote India as tourist destination. Obviously, there is a great demand for translators,interpreters and personnel fluent in Japanese. Institutes teaching Japanese are mushrooming in every major city to cater to the ever-increasing demand. Students too are looking eastwards for fresh pastures. Japanese is the language of one of the most technically and industrially advancednations. A lot of technical literature produced in Japan is not available in any other language.Thus, the Japanese language which is a unique one with 3 scripts and a grammarsimilar to Indian languages, is ideal for studyby Indian students (who have a gift for languages).

Moreover,geography being a subject of interdisciplinary nature, it helps in the study of natural sciences and social sciences. The course is based on the guidelines provided in NCF2005 and SCF 2010. Coreelements such as protection of environment and inculcation of scientific temper as mentioned in NPE and POA have also beenreflected in the course content of geography. The theoretical study of geography is complemented by practical work have beenmade a part of curriculum for 10+2 stage. For 10+2, the geography course has complements of theory and practical work. Thecourse is designed in such a way that students will be acquiring knowledge of the world as a whole with the new technologies the world isshrinking and new patterns of regional co- operations are emerging. At the same time world as a whole is facing problems like,global warming and climate changes. Different regions in the world having variedphysiographic and social personalities areexpected to respond to these global problems in different ways. Hence, it is necessary thatthe students understand the strengths and weaknesses of each region to face these problems. Though regions have different personalities, none remains in isolation andthey complement each other in different ways. With the study of world as an entity and understanding the problems, will promotestudents to accept the concept of world as ahome of man and to realize the need for conserving their home. Field visits and practical work will be useful in developing necessary geographicalskills. Objective The course in Geography will help learnersto 1. understand the terms, key concepts and basic principles of Geography. 2. recognize and understand the processes and patterns of the spatial arrangement ofnatural as well as human features and phenomena on the earth's surface. 3. understand and analyse the inter- relationship between physical and humanenvironment and their impact. 4. know about the scarcity of minerals and power resources and to understand theimportance of its conservation and use of non-conventional power resources. 5. understand the causes of environmental pollution and its impact on life on theearth.Geography (39) 77 6. apply geographical knowledge and method of enquiry to new situations or problems at different levels : local,regional, national and global. 7. understand major types of human activities as influenced by geographical factors.1. develop geographical skills relating to collection, processing and analysisof data or information includinggrapics and use of computers wherever possible and preparation of a report. 2. understand the effects of natural hazards and prepare them to help theaffected persons.

We live in a society with full ofsocial and natural calamities. It is not in thehands of common man to control the situation. The study of social problems should be without personal bias. The proper applications ofscientific principles are necessary. So Sociologyis a Science which tackles problems by usingScientific methods. Science asks us to find outthe actual sequence of the incidents and their interrelation. Sociology studies the incidents in a systematic way. In a society we interact with human beings. So it is the duty of Sociology tounderstand human interactions. Society isunited on the basis of Social relationships.Individuals learn the culture and aspects of social life by social processes. This process of socialization changes the raw human beinginto a social being. A teacher should build anoble person for future society throughsociology. He teaches students to behave to beresponsible persons with humanity. Education provides various experiences to the students. These experiences set the students to understandsociety and to adopt social conditions in adesirable manner. Applied sociology includes various practical uses of Sociology in planning, adjustment with the changing time, preparing welfare programme, removal of illiteracy,corruption, communalization, exploitation etc.The students are expected to studyenvironmental issues, modernization, populationeducation, Sanskritization, globalization with other social factors. The course prepared for standard XI and XII would certainly serve as a foundation course in Humanities. Std. XI (SOCIOLOGY) Objectives 1.

The Scientific and Technological advancement has brought theworld into one's house. Our nation cannot remain aloof from this world reality with which it is bound to be affected. On the other hand, religious fundamentalism and terrorism are alsobequeathed by the last century, both phenomenahave posed challenges to value system. It is the first and foremost responsibility and duty of philosophy as a discipline to makethe students aware of this challenge and prepare them to confront it. Hence, the thrust of any new curriculum has to acquire social and moral Philosophy which will serve to prepare a critique of both tradition and modernity andpreserve healthy elements in both and introduce new ideas if and when required. It is in this situation and under these compulsions that Moral and Social Philosophyneeds to be introduced at +2 level where students are quite receptive and prone tointernalize what they are taught. As problems of Moral and Social Philosophy are Philosophical problems andrequire philosophical method for their discussion, knowledge of Philosophy and Philosophical problems also turn out to benecessary.

Although this power is natural to every human being, scholars have identified the rulesof reasoning which he makes use of, withoutbeing conscious of them. This is the Science of Logic. Traditionally, Logic was known and esteemed as the Queen of all Sciences as it istraining of Logic, that sharpens reasoning capacity and makes one to understand arguments and detect fallacies in them if any.Logic thus happens to be the fundamental discipline useful for all branches of knowledge. With introduction of Logic at +2 Level, students will be able to understand, argue and convince with considerable amount of maturity. It willalso contribute in enriching their power of critical thinking which is necessary in present situation and to save us from various irrationalforces operative in society. Positively, it may also help in overcoming various crises confronted by us. Objective To enable the students to1. Acquire knowledge of fundamental terms, definitions, concepts, principles and theories of Logic. 2. Understand logic as the study of inference. 3. Understand the purpose of logic and enquiry in general. 4. Differentiate between various forms of statements and arguments. 5. Apply formal techniques to arguments.6.

As a discipline, psychology specialises in the study of experience,behaviours and mental processes of human beings within a socio-cultural and socio- historical context. This course purports tointroduce the learners to the basic ideas, principles and methods in psychology so as to enable them to understand themselves and theirsocial world better. The emphasis is put on creating interest and exposure needed by learners to develop their own knowledge baseand understanding. The course deals with psychological knowledge and practices which are contextually rooted. It emphasises the complexity of behavioural processes and discouragessimplistic cause-effect thinking. This is pursued by encouraging critical reasoning, allowing students to appreciate the role of cultural factorsin behaviour and illustrating how biology and experience shape behaviour. The course while developing an appreciation of subjectivity, alsofocuses on multiplicity of worldviews. It is suggested that the teaching-learning processes should involve students in evolvingtheir own understanding. Therefore, teaching of psychology should be based on the use of case studies, narratives, experiential exercises,analysis of common everyday experiences, etc. Objectives 1. To develop appreciation about human behaviour and human mind in the contextof learners' immediate society andenvironment. 2. To develop in learners an appreciation of multidisciplinary nature of psychologicalknowledge and its applications in variousaspects of life. 3. To enable learners to become perceptive, socially aware and self-reflective. 4.
