In such times we turn to Sir William Osler for wisdom and perspective. In 1896, Osler observed that \"Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever.\" Before his death at the age of 70 in 1919, Osler had lived through the potato famine, which dispatched some 1 million souls in Ireland; World War I, which claimed 10 million soldiers (including his only son, Revere Osler) and an equal number of civilians; and the Spanish flu, which is purported to have killed 17 to 100 million worldwide. An expert in all facets of medicine, Osler regarded pneumonia as the \"old man's friend.\" \"Pneumonia may well be called the friend of the aged. Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illness, the old man escapes those 'cold gradations of decay' so distressing to himself and to his friends.\" Osler himself succumbed to postpneumonic empyema 2 years after Revere fell at Passchendaele. One wonders how Osler would have viewed the current pandemic, and the unprecedented worldwide response, on the recommendation of the world's most distinguished public health physicians. Osler was attuned to the diversity of disease: \"Variability is the law of life, and as no two faces are the same, so no two bodies are alike, and no two individuals react alike and behave alike under the abnormal conditions which we know as disease.\" Not surprisingly, each epidemic behaves as a \"complex system\" to use today's parlance. While Spanish flu (N1H1) and COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) are both highly contagious respiratory viruses, they behave differently. The latter has proved more insidious: significant Whatever is popular is wrong and other pandemic reflections 24 March 2020Defying understanding, COVID-19 has to date essentially spared Africa, South America, Russia, and India; none of these population centres have reported 100 deaths. Also puzzling and inexplicable has been the staggeringly di- vergent mortality of COVID-19 in neighboring countries. Italy's eastern neighbor, Slovenia, has announced 4 deaths, while Austria has had 28. In short, this current pandemic, in keeping with its predecessors, is proving to be fickle, capricious, and utterly unpredictable. Much more predictable has been the medico-political response. In Canada and the US, initial complacency has given way to a cry for total war against the virus. Measures that would have been inconceivable 2 months ago\u2014 border closures, the shuttering of business and public institutions, and banning of all public gatherings, have been universally championed by the medical establish- ment, with politicians and the public joining enthu-siastically in a deafen-ing chorus: \"We must do more!\" This unprecedented response cannot help but give senior physicians pause. Osler stated, \"The greater the ignorance the greater the dogma- tism.\" Over the course of a long career, who among us has not witnessed prominent physi- cians alternately espouse and then condemn medical interventions with great fervor? In the 1980s, surgeons insisted that physicians with- hold opiates from patients with abdominal pain prior to their examination\u2014giving morphine would preclude accurate diagnosis. In the 1990s, medical thought leaders exhorted us to provide opioids to those with chronic pain\u2014addiction was a myth, and denying patients relief from pain tantamount to malpractice. Liberal opioid prescribing became a cri du coeur touted by vir- tuous and compassionate physicians\u2014few dared to question a dogma that proved fatally flawed. In parallel, few physicians\u2014a notable ex- ception being Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis\u2014have dared publicly question the wisdom of the North American public health response to COVID-19. Does enforcing social transmission apparently occurs before symp- toms peak. While the mortality of both patho- gens is likely 2.5% (this will never be known with any certainty), they target different age groups. Spanish flu had a tragic predilection for healthy young adults, while COVID-19 preferentially targets frail elderly people. The most striking feature of pandemics is their unpredictability and inexplicability. The Spanish flu peaked abruptly in November 1918 at the end of World War I then died out after a brief peak in the spring of 1919. The SARS (novel corona- virus) epidemic lasted only 6 months, peaking in the spring of 2013 then dis- appearing, claiming 774 lives worldwide. MERS (camel flu), with a striking case fatality rate of 35%, emerged in 2012 and has never disappeared. Fortunately, it has to date claimed only 900 lives. COVID-19 was identified in China in De- cember 2019, claiming 3300 lives\u20140.00024% of China's 1. 4 billion citizens\u2014then quickly died out in the world's most populous country. Neighboring Asian countries have been com- paratively fortunate with only South Korea (120) tallying more than 100 deaths. In the mid-east, Iran (1934) is the only country to have recorded more than 100 deaths. Western Europe has emerged as the disease epi- centre with the death toll in Italy reaching 7000 and several other countries counting over 100 deaths including Spain (2808), France (1100), UK (422), Netherlands (276), Germany (157), Belgium, and Switzerland (122 each). In comparison, North America has been fortunate, with some 700 deaths in the US and very few in Canada (26) and Mexico (6). In short, this current pandemic, in keeping with its predecessors, is proving to be fickle, capricious, and utterly unpredictable. 86 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202086Editorials It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\" begins Charles Dickens in his famous novel, A Tale of Two Cities, first published in 1859. I would like to think that human nature has gravi- tated more toward the best of times in the more than 160 years that have passed since this date. Pink Shirt Day in BC took place on 26 Febru - ary, marked by individu- als wearing pink shirts as a statement against bullying. This tradition started in 2007 after a grade 9 student in Nova Scotia was bullied for wearing a pink shirt to school. In solidarity, other students started wearing similar shirts and within a few days almost the whole school was adorned in pink. Every year on this day I sport a bright pink T-shirt with the words Be Kind Brave and Awe- some screened in big white letters on the front. My patients are used to my colorful wardrobe, but most of them realize wearing a pink T-shirt in February is unusual even for me. Some pa- tients look at me suspiciously and I can tell they want to ask about it, but they bite their tongues for whatever reason. Other patients are aware of the significance of the shirt and acknowledge this good cause. A few, like one of my elderly patients, can't help themselves. \"Why are you wearing a pink shirt, Doc- tor?\" she blurted out. \"It's for antibullying day Mrs Smith,\" I replied. \"Oh, I see,\" she accepted. However, at the end of the patient encounter she suddenly queried, \"I don't get it, what do you have against bowling?\"* I love the idea of a day dedicated to the fight against bullying, which I like to think we have been winning. But then a story highlighting the \"worst of times\" surfaced on social media and in the news. A video appeared in which using our position to spread kindness and acceptance an Australian boy, Quaden Bayles, who has a form of dwarfism, talks about wanting to die because of the incessant bullying he faces at school. Heartbreaking to watch, it was shared by his mother to show the anguish this negative be- havior causes her son. In it she pleads for kindness in thought and action toward Quaden and others like him. Sadness filled my heart as I thought about this boy and his struggle. It seemed like little had changed despite public campaigns and educa-tion. I remember being bullied as a youngster and on self-reflection, if I'm honest, at times I was the bully. What is it about human nature that leads to this less than admirable behavior? Thankfully, I was pulled from my dark rumina- tions by an outpouring of worldwide support for the young man (the best of times). Numerous celebrities, including Hugh Jack- man and comedian Brad Williams, who also has dwarfism, came out in support of the bullied boy. Apparently, Quaden loves rugby and was asked to lead an Australian all-star team out onto the field before a game. A GoFundMe page was started to send him to Disneyland, and it quickly built up to a few hundred thou-sand dollars. Quaden and his family, showing absolute class, declined the trip and instead plan to donate the money to anti-abuse and antibullying charities. We can all do our part to end bullying. Phy- sicians are still respected members of society (well at least most of you are), and through our patient interactions we can spread a message of kindness and acceptance, making stories like Quaden's a thing of the past. I sincerely hope this won't take 160 years. n \u2014David r. r ichardson, MD *Who doesn't have a problem with bowling, by the way? I mean, really, how clean are those rented shoes?\" Every year on this day I sport a bright pink T-shirt with the words Be Kind Brave and Awesome. isolation and suspending access to routine medical and hospital care in the event we are overrun by patients requiring ventilation in the ICU serve the greater good, given the mercifully low number of serious cases seen in Canada to date? I suspect that Oscar Wilde\u2014never one to run with the crowd\u2014would have re- sponded, as he famously did when com - menting on bad art: \"Whatever is popular is wrong.\" Such a skeptical view is unpalatable in trying times, as many others have observed. Former Prime Minister Kim Campbell noted that \"An election is no time to discuss serious issues.\" The philosopher Bertrand Russell stated, \"Neither a man nor a crowd nor a nation can be trusted to act humanely or to think sanely under the influence of a great fear.\" Perhaps Texas-born CBS anchor Dan Rather said it best: \"Once the herd starts moving in one direction, it's very hard to turn it, even slightly.\" In these trying times, Osler serves as a voice of wisdom and comfort. From his most famous essay, Aequanimitas: One of the first essentials in securing a good-natured equanimity is not to expect too much of the people amongst whom you dwell... Deal gently then with this deliciously credulous old human nature in which we work, and restrain your indignation, when you find your pet parson has triturates of the 1000th potentiality in his waistcoat pocket, or you discover accidentally a case of Warner's Safe Cure in the bedroom of your best patient. It must be that offences of this kind come, expect them, and do not be vexed. n \u2014David J. Esler, MD information on C oviD-19 from Doctors of BC, updated regularly: www.doctorsofbc.ca/ covid-1987 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202087prEsidEnt's commEnt Physician wellness \" i shall not today attempt further to define [it]. . . but i know it when i see it. \" \u2014Justice Potter Stewart While this quote applies to some- thing much more graphic, I feel that it could also describe phy- sician wellness. Wellness has a wide variety of definitions for physicians, many of which depend on our current state of physical and mental health, work pressures, family demands, and stage of career. How then do we figure out the different aspects of wellness and effec- tively address them to find the right solutions and improve the working and personal lives of physicians? I know how important this is, and fortu - nately, work on this front is moving forward at a rapid pace. At the grassroots level across BC, divisions of family practice and medical staff associations support physician wellness cham- pions (among other initiatives) who connect with their colleagues to strengthen health and wellness work. As well, the Specialist Services Committee has made addressing physician bur- dens, burnout, and wellness at the local level a new strategic priority. Each local initiative is unique in its approach (many of which are targeted at individual processes), and while their importance is valued by many, we must find system-wide solutions to tackle the problem at the source. Doctors of BC's Physician Burdens sur- vey of members revealed that a fair number of the pressures that physicians face fall well outside the individual physician's control and contribute to the moral injury that is driving burnout across our profession. Physicians re- ported working in environments with exces - sively high demands from clinical settings, administrators, and patients. In some cases, physicians are working in environments that are not physically safe and fail to meet the basic WorkSafeBC Occupational Health and Safety Regulations that, by law, apply to all workers in BC. Tremendous variation exists across clinical settings, which highlights the upstream system problems requiring an overarching approach. In response to member identified priori- ties, the 2019 Physician Master Agreement generated a memorandum of agreement with our health authorities, titled Physical and Psy- chological Health and Safety, which is intended to ensure physician input to improve physical and psychological workplace health and safety for health care workers. In consultation with physi- cian groups across BC, our governance bodies have committed to establish- ing occupational standards across all health authori- ties, as defined by the Canadian Standards As- sociation (CSA). This is a complex issue. For those not aware of the CSA Standards, there are 13 workplace factors that it suggests ad- dressing: organizational culture, psychological and social support, clear leadership with ex- pectations, civility and respect, psychological demands, growth and development, recogni- tion and reward, involvement and influence, workload management, engagement, balance, psychological protection, and protection of physical safety. Finding solutions that address the systemic pressures needs to begin with face-to-face meet- ings between administrators and physicians where honest and safe conversations about the barriers can take place and answers that respect the perspectives and capabilities of all parties are co-developed. Physicians cannot do this in isolation; neither should we leave our ad- ministrators to establish processes without our specific grassroots knowledge. Other than the initiatives developed by Doctors of BC, medical staff associations, and divisions, a number of other systems-level so- lutions are in various stages of implementa - tion, including work with ICBC, WorkSafeBC, and health authorities, among others. As well, through the Regional Physical/Psychological Health and Safety Working Group, Doctors of BC will now have representatives in pro- vincial and regional structures to gather your input and to help establish processes that sup- port physician-specific physical and psycho- logical safety projects. These representatives need your participation, in whatever way you are able to engage, to pro- vide an adequate foun- dation and inform new processes. Doctors of BC will be reaching out and I encourage everyone to contribute. BC is not alone in recognizing the com- plexity and critical timing of this issue. The Canadian Medi- cal Association State- ment on Physician Health and Wellness (www.cma.ca/sites/default/files/2018-11/ physician-health-wellness-statement-e.pdf) of 2018 established several principles for the consideration of physicians across Canada. The aspect that resonated with me the most was that regardless of the definition, physician wellness should be a shared responsibility and a qual- ity indicator. For too long, we physicians have toiled in isolation, carrying our many burdens. The way forward is to share our loads and begin to truly and fully address the system pressures alongside those with the organizational prowess to make meaningful improvements. n \u2014Kathleen ross, MD Doctors of BC PresidentA fair number of the pressures that physicians face fall well outside the individual physician's control and contribute to the moral injury that is driving burnout across our profession.88 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202088E-cigarettes and youth health Tobacco products in all forms are highly ad - dictive because they contain nicotine, one of the most addictive substances used by humans. High-nicotine content in e-cigarettes poses as a potentially disastrous innovation in the 21st century and a well-known public health threat to our vulnerable children's future and their overall health and well-being. Even though we clearly know that the nico- tine is addictive and poses significant challenges to smoking cessation, sophisticated social media campaigns tend to unduly discount the risks and overstate the benefits of e-cigarettes. Distorted risk perceptions are associated with adolescents' decisions to initiate e-cigarette use, decisions they will likely regret in adulthood. We need Health Canada's sensible pres - ence in e-cigarette prevention and control ef- forts, including federal government regulation over e-cigarette flavored products, online sales, and social marketing. We need creative strate-gies to put our children on a path to a healthy, tobacco-free lifestyle and ensure that young leaders influence future tobacco control policies in Canada and globally.1-3 E-cigarettes should carry health warnings like combustible tobacco, which could counter- act misinformation suggesting that they are a less harmful and safer alternative to combus- tible tobacco. We should train student leaders to become peer counselors in their schools to help their peers to quit e-cigarettes. School ad- ministrators, teachers, parents, caregivers, and public health officials should build a meaning- ful partnership to address this issue in schools.

SCARs include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epi- dermal necrolysis and drug reaction with eo - sinophilia and systemic symptoms, and lead to elevated morbidity/mortality and long-term sequelae. Two recent Canadian publications2,3 have highlighted the importance of screen - ing at-risk populations for the development SCARs. The American College of Rheuma- tology guidelines recommend screening East Asian patients for the HLA-B*58:01 genotype prior to prescribing allopurinol, to eliminate the risk of SCARs in this population.4,5 Un- fortunately, HLA-B*58:01 genotype testing is underutilized in British Columbia despite East Asians comprising a substantial proportion of the population.2 Other risk factors for SCARs in individuals prescribed allopurinol include heart disease and chronic kidney disease.3 The cost-effectiveness of preventive HLA screening for East Asians prior to allopurinol has been established in various populations globally and this screening needs to be more widely adopted in Canada. In British Columbia, HLA-B*58:01 genotype screening can be or- dered by sending blood tests to BC Transplant, the laboratory in charge of HLA genotyping. Other therapeutic options for the control of hy - peruricemia include feboxustat and uricosurics. We believe that not performing this test prior to the prescription of allopurinol may cause your Asian patients serious harm. \u2014Marisa Ponzo, MD-PhD, Fr CPC Vancouver \u2014Jan Dutz, MD, Fr CPC Vancouver references 1.

The virus subse- quently spread to countries around the globe, prompting the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. At the time of writing (28 February 2020), 83 324 cases have been re - ported, with the vast majority still in Mainland China. Fifty-one countries, including Canada, have reported imported cases, and a handful of countries, including Iran, Italy, and South Korea, are responding to local outbreaks. By the time this article is published, the global picture will likely look very different. This article describes the health system response to a novel pathogen as it emerges. COVID-19 in British Columbia As of 28 February 2020, testing of 1425 speci - mens has identified seven infections in BC, all in travelers or close contacts of travelers to an area with community transmission. The very small number of cases, all of which have a known source of infection, indicate that at the end of February 2020 there is little com- munity transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia. At this stage of the emergence of a new pathogen, containment measures can be effective. How do we respond to an emerging respiratory pathogen? On 31 December 2019, China reported an out- break of pneumonia of unknown cause to the World Health Organization. At that time, the pathogen, the clinical spectrum of disease, and COVID-19: responding to an emerging respiratory pathogen This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.the populations at greatest risk were unknown. However, within 10 days, China identified the virus and published the viral genetic code. This enabled laboratories to quickly develop tests for the virus. The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) Public Health Laboratory was able to develop a test within 3 days, and then test the first specimen within 10 days. In the following month, testing protocols were developed and validated, and laboratories throughout BC had the ability to test for the virus. Public health monitored emerging re- search and epidemiol- ogy about COVID-19 in order to provide advice to the public and test- ing recommendations to clinicians. During this period of an emerging disease, there is a great deal of informa- tion and misinformation, and recommendations change rapidly, often leading to uncertainty and concern. In British Columbia, the provincial health officer, your local medical health officers, and the BCCDC are committed to providing you with up-to-date information that is relevant to your community. By the end of February, a great deal was learned about COVID-19. Information from the outbreak in China indicated that among those with a diagnosed illness, the majority (over 80%) of people have mild illness with recovery in about 2 weeks. Early data from out- breaks on cruise ships suggested that a sub - stantial proportion of people with infection are asymptomatic. Children and adolescents appear to be relatively spared, and the risk of serious ill- ness and death increases sharply in the seventh and eighth decades of life and in those with chronic conditions including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The case fatality rate, which is essential to know for both planning and response, remains difficult to estimate. In Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, it is estimated to be 2% to 3%, while outside this area the case fatality rate is well below 1%. These estimates are likely to be refined by the time this article is published, as information becomes available about the rate of asymptomatic infections. At the early stage of a new communicable disease, when there is no indication of com - munity transmission, each individual case is managed using the core measures of public health: prompt identi - fication and isolation of cases, contact tracing and management, and effective infection control practices in health care settings. At the same time, the health care system prepares for potential sustained local transmission. How do we prepare for the possibility of sustained community transmission in BC? In February, emergency operations centres (EOCs) were established at provincial, regional, and hospital levels to coordinate public health and clinical responses across the health care system and with government and commu- nity partners.

However, as of late February, community transmission is occurring in multiple locations globally including South Korea, Japan, Singa- pore, Iran, and Italy. This raises the probability of sustained community transmission in BC. If sustained local transmission occurs, the focus of the intervention will shift. Testing for COVID-19 will decrease even as community cases increase, as we shift from containment to mitigation. People with mild symptoms consis- tent with COVID-19 (or with other respiratory illnesses), in whom knowledge of the infec- tious agent would not change management, will be asked to self-isolate without testing. Testing capacity will focus on severe cases and on sentinel surveillance, which will allow us to estimate the total disease burden and monitor trends in disease activity in our communities. In this scenario, clinicians will be asked to support patients by educating them on basic self-care measures at home when symptomatic; reinforc- ing messaging about hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and the importance of self-isolation during illness to prevent transmission; and iden- tifying patients experiencing severe symptoms or at risk of severe disease who will need more intensive management and support. Additional social distancing strategies, such as telecom- muting or discouraging mass gatherings, will be recommended by public health only if the epidemiology of the disease suggests significant transmission in these settings. Once mitigation is the goal, it will remain essential that measures to prevent health care-associated transmis- sion, including adherence to personal protective equipment guidelines, be maintained. Some nonessential services may need to be paused to meet demand and maintain continuity of care for urgent medical needs. A novel disease such as COVID-19 is a challenge to our health care system, but also an opportunity to strengthen our relationships in service of patient needs. It remains essential to have a rational and measured response to COVID-19 while ensuring that uncertain- ty and fear do not lead to undue disruption and delay of care.

Due to the number of fatal overdoses, BC's life expectancy has fallen for the first time in modern history. Facing this crisis, many organizations, such as Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC,1 Moms Stop the Harm,2 the Canadian Asso- ciation of People Who Use Drugs,3 and the City of Vancouver,4 have called for a change in drug policies, including drug decriminalization and increased access to a safer supply of drugs. Nonetheless, both the federal and provincial government have been hesitant to fully com- mit to these ideas. The concept of drug decriminalization is not new. Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001. While having drugs for personal use is no longer a criminal offence, it remains an administrative violation. The money saved in the criminal justice sys- tem has freed up resources to be invested in addiction treatment, mental health, and social services. Within a decade of decriminalizing drugs in Portugal, continuation rates of drug use dropped by 15%. In addition, the rate of HIV, hepatitis, and drug-related deaths and crimes decreased. This shift from a criminal to public health approach to drug use has received praise from many international organizations, including the United Nations. This article is the opinion of the Emergency and Public Safety Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.In terms of safe supply, Switzerland offers a good example. Like much of Europe, the country experienced a rapid rise in IV heroin use during the 1970s and 80s, which led to high rates of HIV transmission and drug-related deaths. Since the mid- 1990s, Switzerland has offered heroin-assisted treatment (HAT). With over 20 years of data, it's clear that HAT has sub- stantially improved the well-being of the partici- pants, reduced continual use of illicit heroin, and decreased criminal activities. Locally, the BC Centre on Substance Use published an evidence-based document last year that high- lights the benefits and rationale for safe supply, and a proposed model for implementation.5 I can think of a particular patient whose story reinforced my support for changing drug policies. Over the years, my team and I provided her with medical and psychosocial treatment for her opioid-use disorder while she worked dili- gently on her recovery. By the time she moved on to another clinic closer to her new home, she had obtained her diploma and was ready to start a new job to help youth struggling with addic - tion. I still remember the light in her eyes and the confidence in her smile when she told me about her graduation and the new job. Mean-while, as I recalled the multiple overdoses she had in the past, a shivering thought came to mind: she could have died so many times. Sadly, not every patient of mine was as lucky as she was; many had died from overdoses and were never able to continue the journey of recovery. I truly believe that decriminalization of peo- ple who use drugs and safe supply save lives. We need to change outdated drug policies so our patients struggling with addiction can stay alive and have an opportunity to access the treatment and support they need. By doing so, we are sending a clear message to society that drug addiction is a health issue, not a crimi- nal issue, which in turn helps reduce stigma and encourages more individ- uals to access care or call 911 in case of an overdose without the fear of being incarcerated. As doctors in the province with the highest number of overdoses and deaths in Canada, we should engage in a broad- er discussion about these important issues. n \u2014Derek Chang, MD references 1.

Kendall Ho, MD, Gerry Oleman Dr KEnDAll HO : What if one day a patient asks you for therapy based on Indigenous tra- ditional medicine? This happened to me 6 years ago when I was working in the emergency de- partment. I saw an Indigenous patient after he had a car accident and I recommended a standard treatment plan. He politely declined and asked for Indigenous traditional medicine instead. I was unsure how to proceed as I knew very little about this approach. He thanked me and we parted company amicably. This began my journey to explore Indigenous traditional medicine and how it might be used in combi- nation with Western medicine. Soon afterward I met Elder Gerry Oleman, who became my teacher and guide, opening my eyes to how traditional practitioners contribute to the BC medical system. ElDEr GErry OlEMAn: In 1995 families with a loved one in hospital started to call me. When I reflect on these first calls, I think about how I had not been formally identified as someone to call in the Indigenous world when there is a medical crisis. I was called because I was known for practising Indigenous ceremony, meaning I was taught and mentored by Elders in Indig- enous ways of helping those in need. Today when I am called to the hospital, I connect with the family first so I can learn what is going on with the patient. Once I have the informa- tion, I share with the family and patient what I will be doing and carry on only after obtaining their approval. Since I am working in a hospital setting, I understand that the patient is in the hands of competent medical professionals and that we should not interfere with each other's practices. I see my involvement as providing what is missing for the patient: attention for the soul/spirit of the patient. With my words, songs, prayers, and spiritual tools I am helping to strengthen the spirit of the individual. If I accomplish this, the patient can become an ac- tive participant in the healing process. I believe that what Indigenous practitioners provide in this moment of damage to physical health can improve the mental and spiritual health of the patient. I also believe practitioners have a re- sponsibility to assist family and friends who are present so that they can support the patient and medical staff in the healing process. When I look at my involvement and jour- ney working with patients, families, and health care professionals in the medical system, I see the need for all involved to understand each Kendall Ho, MD, Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, University of British Columbia.

Working with patients and families early on, I came to ap- preciate the rhythm of the hospital and would plan my work around that rhythm. As a result, I have never had conflict with the system. I do not have formal recognition when I am called to the hospital, yet the Indigenous practices I offer patients are not disallowed. I have heard of Indigenous practitioners having difficulties carrying out their work of assisting patients. This may very well be because of ignorance or racism on the part of the health care staff. It has been my experience that those in the medical system will respect an Indigenous practitioner when they understand that the two systems can support one another and benefit the patient. I believe that although there are differences, when we work together and do not interfere with each other these differences can be worked out. After all, Indigenous practitioners are involved in the medical system at the request of families and patients. I am grateful to the Canadian medical system for all the services it has provided to me and my family. I am also extremely grateful to the traditional practitioners who have provided comfort, hope, and success for members of my family and for myself personally. Dr KEnDAll HO : As an emergency physician, my journey with Elder Gerry Oleman and other traditional practitioners has helped me better understand the context of Indigenous patients, their caregivers, and their communities regard - ing a holistic approach to health and wellness, and the potential anxiety some patients may experience when seeking Western medical care. This journey raises my awareness of the need for cultural safety and positively changes my practice when I interact with Indigenous pa - tients. My journey also challenges me to be more aware of and seek understanding from all patients I encounter and treat. As executive director of the interCultural Online Health Network (iCON), I would like to thank the many collaborators and support- ers who have been part of this journey so far to incorporate traditional healing into the BC health care system.

ABSTRACT: The interCultural Online Health Net- work (iC on) at the University of British Columbia has been collaborating since 2010 with health authorities and i ndigenous communities across the province to support the integration of tradi- tional medicine practices into Western primary care and acute care settings. This is being done to fulfill recommendations contained in health policy frameworks and strategic documents, including the Truth and r econciliation Commission report, the United nations Declaration of the r ights of indigenous Peoples, and the BC Declaration on Commitment to Cultural Safety and Humility in Health Services. With the help of an advisory committee, a video and a discussion guide were produced in 2016. The video features the stories, experiences, and insights of individuals who have used traditional medicine in different health care settings. A workshop was organized to share the video and guide with patients and communities. This event focused on identifying gaps and barri- ers within regions and the wider system and on proposing actions to enable change. Participant recommendations were grouped according to whether the actions proposed could be taken at the individual, advocacy, community, or health care system level. The iC on team continues to cohost discussions designed to share learn- ings and engage communities, administrators, decision-makers, and policymakers in transform- ing the health system to better serve all British Columbians. The team welcomes feedback about experiences with traditional healing practices and efforts made to improve access to culturally safe health care for i ndigenous patients in BC. In 2010 the interCultural Online Health Network (iCON) at the University of Brit- ish Columbia set out to explore problems faced by Indigenous peoples in British Colum- bia seeking health and wellness. Since then, iCON has been collaborating with health au- thorities and Indigenous communities across the province to support the integration of tradi- tional medicine practices into Western primary care and acute care settings. Providing culturally safe care for all Indig- enous patients has been found to include: Ensuring all health care employees under - take cultural safety training. Fostering an understanding of Indigenous perspectives on health and wellness. Allocating time to build connections, re- lationships, and trust in the community.

Structural bar- riers, power imbalances, and the perseverance of stereotypes and racist attitudes all play a part.1,2 One outcome of colonization is a lack of emphasis on traditional medicine and prac- tices as important components of wellness for Indigenous peoples. Research and an environ- mental scan conducted by the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) affirms the contin- ued value of traditional medicine and practices within Indigenous communities.1 Health policy frameworks and strategic documents, includ- ing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report and the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), highlight the need for improved services and support for Indigenous patients.2-5 Specifically, UNDRIP article 24.1 states: Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to main- tain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals. Indigenous individuals also have the right to access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services.5 In November 2019 British Columbia was the first province to legally implement UND-RIP . Bringing BC laws in line with UNDRIP is part of a major shift in provincial and local commitments to improve health access and outcomes for Indigenous patients. The Dec- laration of Commitment on Cultural Safety and Humility in Health Services was signed by the BC Ministry of Health and all BC's health authorities in 20156 and by Doctors of BC in 2019.7,8 The declaration commits health care professionals and organizations to culturally safe and appropriate practices and a process of mu- tual trust and respect when delivering services to Indigenous peoples. Specific health authority policies9-14 and programs such as the San'yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training Program15 have been developed to support health care professionals. Nevertheless, medical trainees in Canada still receive limited education on the impacts of colonization and racism and little exposure to Indigenous traditional practices. This means that many newly trained health care providers are unable to provide culturally safe care. 16,17 Supporting cultural safety iCON18 began developing educational tools to support cultural safety19,20 in 2015. As part of a community-based initiative operated by Digital Emergency Medicine at UBC,21 iCON explored how to partner with Indigenous com- munity members to address specific health pri- orities and develop culturally relevant health resources. iCON then worked with Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) to create A Coming Together of Health Systems, a video22 featuring Indigenous traditional healers [Figure] and a discussion guide. 23 The aims of the video and guide were to: Increase understanding of the role of tradi - tional healing and the work of traditional practitioners. Encourage the integration of traditional healing into the care of Indigenous patients. Support positive health care experiences through a culturally safe care framework. Throughout the development of the video and accompanying discussion guide, feedback was sought from an advisory committee that had been formed in 2012. This committee was originally a tripartite collaboration between iCON, the VCH Aboriginal Health Strategic Initiative, and the former UBC Institute for Aboriginal Health. Members included tra - ditional practitioners, Elders, and the project team. With the committee's help, stories and in- sights into traditional medicine were featured in the video. Traditional practices were described along with the experiences of individuals who have used traditional medicine in hospital set- tings. Key messages and learning objectives were summarized in the guide and included with reflection questions and additional resources. The video and guide were piloted with health care professionals at Vancouver General Hospital and St. Paul's Hospital to validate them, ensuring that the content was accessible and deepened understanding of traditional heal- ing practices that patients might request in hospital settings. The video and guide have now been dissemi- nated through education sessions with health authorities, integrated into VCH cultural safety training, and presented at various conferences, including the 2016 Fourth Global Symposium on Health Systems Research and the BC Min- istry of Health summit in 2017.22-24 The video FIgUrE . the video and discussion guide, A Coming Together of Health Systems, features traditional practitioners, Elders, and Western health care professionals. Elder Gerry Oleman is pictured.96 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202096 CliniC al clinical Digital storytelling and dialogue to support culturally safe health care for Indigenous patients in BC and guide are also now integrated into the UBC medical school undergraduate curriculum. A Coming Together of Health Systems is not intended to be a definitive resource concern- ing traditional practitioners and healing ser- vices but a starting point for dialogue. Before medical professionals can be comfortable and confident providing culturally safe care, they must first recognize the value of offering dual services (traditional Indigenous and Western) in serving their patients, and must gain a more nuanced view of the nature of traditional heal- ing practices. Watching the video and sharing experiences with a diverse group of stakeholders can produce attitude shifts and practice changes and have rich cultural impacts for both Indig- enous and non-Indigenous British Columbians. Community dialogue To understand how the health care system can best integrate traditional healing into every- day practice, a community dialogue workshop was cohosted by iCON, VCH, Island Health, and FNHA on 15 March 2017. Elders, tra- ditional practitioners, nurses, physicians, stu - dents, and Ministry of Health representatives were invited to Tsawout, located on the home- lands of the W'S\u00c1NE peoples on the Saan-ich Peninsula, and asked to identify gaps and barriers in the system and to produce a list of recommendations. The workshop began with more than 100 participants viewing the video. A storytelling session followed, with Elders and tradition- al practitioners sharing their experiences of seeking and/or delivering traditional wellness and healing. The candid and personal accounts created a sense of community that carried on throughout the workshop. Participants were divided into small groups for breakout sessions. Each group included a mix of health care professionals and commu- nity members to ensure a range of perspectives, expertise, and experiences were represented. In these sessions, participants were invited to share their views on ways to provide better access to traditional medicine within the BC health care system and how to harmonize Indigenous and Western approaches. Guiding questions were provided: In what ways can access to traditional prac- titioners be improved in your work setting at the clinical/practice level? How should we start thinking about shifting and changing health care system settings to better incorporate traditional medicine? What type of policy needs to be in place to facilitate and enable the changes discussed? Perspectives and proposed actions The post-workshop evaluation surveys that were completed by 59 participants showed how per- spectives were changed: 93% felt the workshop helped them better understand traditional heal - ing and the role of traditional practitioners; 89% agreed they would use the information from the workshop to better facilitate access to traditional practitioners; and 81% agreed they would make a change to improve the BC health care system to better incorporate tradi-tional medicine. Participant recommendations gathered from the breakout sessions were analyzed and grouped according to whether the actions pro- posed could be taken at the individual, advocacy, community, or health care system level. Individual actions All health care employees, including admin- istrative staff, should engage in cultural safety training as part of an ongoing learning journey that helps individuals to: Practise humility and self-reflection in words, actions, and work activities. Integrate learning into their work. Increase knowledge of resources already in place at hospitals (e.g., how to access traditional practitioners). Continue the dialogue and share with col- leagues (e.g., start conversations at staff meetings). Respond to the patient's need in the mo- ment (e.g., ask \"What do you need/want?\" or \"Are there any resources outside the ones we are providing that might help you?\"). Advocacy actions Advocacy for traditional healers and practi- tioners should include actions that encourage individuals, community-based organizations, and policymakers to: Respect the use of Indigenous language and worldviews as integral to the healing process. Promote a better understanding of the value of culturally safe care and the different per - spectives Indigenous patients may have on health and wellness. Shift the definition and understanding of \"health\" to incorporate mental and spiritual health. Address misconceptions and mistrust through education about traditional healing and its value. Recognize and embrace the power of story- telling to create a space for shared under - standing and self-reflection and to build community resiliency. Avoid tokenism. Community actions Community-based organizations should engage with others to: Include more policymakers in future work - shops and dialogue. Build experiential learning and training opportunities for health care professionals, trainees, and medical students. Increase involvement of community advocates, patient voices, and Aboriginal liaison nurses. Codevelop protocols led by traditional practitioners in partnership with health authorities.Before medical professionals can be comfortable and confident providing culturally safe care, they must first recognize the value of offering dual services ... and gain a more nuanced view of the nature of traditional healing practices. 97 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202097 CliniC al Hyman A, Stacy E, Atkinson K, n ovak l auscher H, r abeneck J, Oleman G, Cooper P , young W, Kellman C, Ho K clinical Develop a directory for contacting tradi - tional practitioners.

To address the resulting service shortages, rheumatologists in BC explored mul- tidisciplinary patient care approaches, including a new fee-for-service code that allows nurses to provide education and counseling to patients concerning medication, diet, and exercise. The nursing model of outpatient rheumatology care that resulted has changed the practice patterns J. Connell, BSc, MPH, J. Kur, MD, Fr CPC, J.H. Gurmin, lPhil, PhD Assessing the impact of a nursing model of care on rheumatology practice patterns and patient satisfaction in British Columbia Study results from three clinics indicate a significant increase in outpatient encounters and high levels of patient satisfaction after implementation of a rheumatology multidisciplinary care assessment billing code.

A study was proposed to explore how patient access to rheumatology care has changed since the implementation of the Mul- tidisciplinary Conference billing code G31060 (as of 1 April 2020 called the Multidisciplinary Care Assessment billing code) and how acceptable this model of care is to patients. Methods: in 2018 a review of electronic medical records was conducted in three rheumatology clinics in British Columbia to measure changes in the number of outpatient encounters before and after the implementation of a nursing model of care. Data from the records were used to generate descriptive statistics. RCPSC-certified rheumatolo - gists in BC were asked to respond to a survey about practice patterns. Patients were asked to respond to a survey about six aspects of care: general sat- isfaction, giving of information, empathy with the patient, technical quality and competence, attitude toward the patient, and access and continuity. A literature review was completed to identify studies of physician-led care in similar patient populations. Results: The mean number of weekly outpatient encounters per rheumatologist for all inflammatory diseases was 17.4 patients per week in 2009 and 30.4 patients per week in 2016, an increase of 74.7% (13 patients per rheumatologist per week). When encounters were considered by diagnosis, there was a mean increase of 84.0% for diffuse diseases of connective tissue (3.8 patients per rheumatol- ogist per week), 56.9% for rheumatoid arthritis (4.6 patients), for ankylosing spondylitis (2.4 patients), and 75.3% for psoriatic arthritis (2.2 patients). Survey results for patient satisfaction show the care was highly acceptable, with a mean overall patient score of 4.35 out of 5.00. Survey results for rheumatologist practice patterns show an increase in the use of nursing support, with only 23% having access to nursing support in 2010 and 71% having access after implementation of the billing code. Conclusions: More outpatient encounters for all disease types were seen at all three participating rheumatology clinics after implementation of the billing code. r heumatologists received increased remuneration and had time to see more patients while nurses assisted with patient assessments and educated patients about medications, diet, and exercise. Patient satisfaction scores for six aspects of care were all higher than 4.00 out of 5.00. 99 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 202099 CliniC alBackground Rheumatologists are internal medicine sub- specialists who care for patients with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ar- thritis, lupus, vasculitis, and inflammatory diseases of the back. In addition, rheuma- tologists care for patients with complicated musculoskeletal problems such as advanced osteoarthritis, injuries, and tendinopathies. Public Health Agency of Canada data indi- cate that the burden of rheumatic diseases is increasing. 1 In BC rheumatologic care is primarily de- livered in an outpatient private practice clinic setting. The patients seen in a rheumatologist's clinic suffer from some of the most complicated diseases in medicine. Disorders in rheumatol- ogy strike multiple organ systems, including the joints, heart, skin, muscle, lungs, and kidneys. The rheumatologist is often a coordinator of care for patients with complicated disease who require a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to their multiorgan pathology. Timely access to care and control of disease activity in inflammatory arthritis is crucial to prevent joint damage and loss of function and to maintain quality of life. Joint damage can occur within 3 months of disease and lead to disability. Research has shown that intervention with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy will help patients with inflammatory arthritis achieve disease remis- sion, improve physical function, and prevent long-term disability. Previous studies in BC have shown that only 39% of the early incident rheumatoid arthritis population and 45% of the prevalent late rheumatoid arthritis population were receiving DMARD therapy, suggesting the existence of large service gaps.2,3 In 2010 BC was faced with a shortage of rheumatologists. Recruitment and retention pressures, caused in part by disparities between rheumatology and other subspecialties, had re- sulted in poor access to care for BC residents with rheumatic diseases. At that time, there were only 32 full-time equivalent (FTE) rheu- matologists in the province, or one rheumatolo- gist for every 140 000 residents.4 Guidelines recommend a rheumatologist-to-patient ratio of 1:70 000, which meant that the BC popu-lation was underserviced by approximately 32 FTEs. In addition, 33% of rheumatologists reported that wait times for nonurgent consults were longer than 4 months, suggesting that the shortage of rheumatologists was having an impact on patient outcomes.4 To address these service shortages, rheuma - tologists in BC explored patient care approach- es through the Specialist Services Committee (SSC). This eventually led to the introduction of a Multidisciplinary Conference billing code G31060 (as of 1 April 2020 called the Multi- disciplinary Care Assessment billing code) that allowed for nursing sup- port in outpatient rheu- matology care. The new billing code allows patients with complex inflammatory disease to receive per- sonalized counseling and education from rheuma- tology nurses, including education about medica- tions, diet, immunization, and exercise, training in self-injection of rheuma-tologic agents, and coun- seling for DMARD therapy.5 This support from nurses in the management of patients frees up more physician time and allows for more care to be delivered in fewer encounters, thus reducing the number of visits to other health care professionals. Since the billing code was introduced, there has been a dramatic shift in the delivery of rheumatology care for outpatients in BC. A specialty nursing group has been established, BC Rheumatology Nurses, and rheumatologists throughout the province have engaged nurses in their clinics part-time and full-time. The introduction of multidisciplinary teams that include rheumatology nurses has changed the practice patterns of BC rheumatologists and has potentially changed patient access to care. Because access to care is a quality indicator, the changes made have the potential to alter the quality or acceptability of care for patients.6 A study was proposed to explore how patient ac- cess (the number of rheumatology patients seen in a period of time by an individual rheumatolo- gist) has changed since the implementation of the billing code and how acceptable this model of care is to patients. Methods An electronic medical record (EMR) review was conducted in the summer of 2018 to mea- sure changes in the number of patient visits in three urban rheumatology clinics in Vancouver and Victoria. Each rheumatology clinic was run by a single specialist, was using the same EMR system, and was operating both before and af- ter implementation of the billing code in 2010. The total number of distinct patients seen per year was measured for 2009 and for 2016 to allow for a 6-year period of adjustment af- ter the billing code was implemented. Each pa- tient was counted only once in a year, regardless of the number of visits to the clinic, to determine if more individual patients were being seen with the change in the model of care as opposed to the same patient being seen more often. The num- ber of days the clinic's rheumatologist worked that year were taken into account, and the en- counters were stratified by inflammatory disease type (connective tissue diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis). Additional data were obtained from 2010 and 2018 surveys by the BC Society of Rheu-matologists. Each online, self-administered survey consisted of questions on demographics and practice patterns. The surveys were sent out to all RCPSC-certified rheumatologists in BC. The response rate for 2010 was 98% (n = 45) and for 2018 was 91% (n = 77). These data were supplemented with billing infor- mation provided by the BC Medical Services Plan (MSP), the sole insurer for rheumatology services in the region. Data on patient satisfaction were collected using the Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ), a validated and reliable tool for assess- ing care in rheumatology outpatient clinics.7 The new billing code allows patients with complex inflammatory disease to receive personalized counseling and education from rheumatology nurses.Connell J, Kur J, Gurmin J clinical100 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020100 CliniC al clinical Assessing the impact of a nursing model of care on rheumatology practice patterns and patient satisfaction in BC Patients were asked to consider 45 statements and use a Likert scale to rate six aspects of their rheumatology care: general satisfaction, giving of information, empathy with the patient, tech- nical quality and competence, attitude toward the patient, and access and continuity. The LSQ was administered in English to outpatients with inflammatory disease 19 years and older who were attending a follow-up appointment and were able to complete the survey on their own. The questionnaire was completed in the wait- ing room before the appointment to ensure the responses were not biased by the most recent interaction or by acquiescence bias resulting from the presence of the rheumatologist. The completed questionnaires were sealed in envelopes and patients were assured they would remain anonymous and their responses would not be viewed by the treating rheumatolo- gist. Questionnaires were collected in two of the three rheumatology clinics studied. Means from the responses were pooled and compared with values from studies identified in a literature review as having similar patient populations but more traditional physician-led service delivery methods.8,9 Descriptive statistics were calculated during data analysis. As this was an exploratory health services study, the patient access measure was not powered to allow for statistical comparisons between physicians. The study was done as part of an evaluation of labor market adjustment (LMA) fees. Funding for the evaluation was provided by the Specialist Services Commit- tee, a joint collaborative committee of Doctors of BC and the BC Ministry of Health. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board. Results In 2009, before implementation of the bill- ing code for rheumatology, 1493 patient en- counters occurred over 439 working days. In 2016, after implementation, 2761 patient en-counters occurred over 463 working days. The mean number of weekly outpatient encoun- ters per rheumatologist for all inflammatory diseases was 17.4 patients per week in 2009 and 30.4 patients per week in 2016, an increase of 74.7% (13 patients per rheumatologist per week) [Figure 1]. When encounters were considered by di- agnosis, there was a mean increase of 84.0% for diffuse diseases of connective tissue (3.8 patients per rheumatologist per week), 56.9% for rheumatoid arthritis (4.6 patients), 118.3% for ankylosing spondylitis (2.4 patients), and 75.3% for psoriatic arthritis (2.2 patients) [Figure 2]. The Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire was completed by 92 patients at two of the three rheumatology clinics studied. The mean overall satisfaction score was 4.35 out of 5.00 and all aspects of care received ratings higher than 4.00. When these results were compared with results from studies in Alberta and Norway, the scores in British Columbia were found to be equal or significantly higher [Table]. Only 23% of rheumatologists in 2010 had access to nursing support as part of their practice, but that number increased to 71% in 2018, after implementation of the billing code [Figure 3]. From 2011 to 2018, the use of the code across BC increased by 234%. Billings per rheumatologist went from 140 in the 2011/12 fiscal year (the first year after code G31060 was implemented) to 467 billings in the 2017/18 fiscal year (written communication with Raaj Tiagi, senior health economist, Doctors of BC, 16 January 2019) [Figure 4]. As of 2018, 22 FTE nurses were employed in rheumatology community outpatient clinics in BC, compared with only one nurse in 2010. Conclusions The number of outpatient encounters is a vi- tal metric when determining accessibility of care for rheumatology patients. Increases in patient visits were seen for all three rheuma- tology clinics studied and for all disease types after implementation of the billing code. This suggests that rheumatologists can care for more FIgUrE 1.

Rheumatology is a time-intensive specialty with patients having complex histories, requiring detailed physical examinations, and needing in- formation about the expanding field of biologic treatments. The observed increase in patient ac- cess is substantial given the complexity of the patients involved. Also, it is important to note that the increase in access at the three rheuma- tology clinics studied means that joint damage and function loss in those patients with inflam- matory conditions was probably prevented. Advantages of the nursing model Studies have shown that nurse-led care in rheumatology is acceptable, safe, and equally effective as physician-led care.10 A systematic review by Garner and colleagues demonstrates conflicting evidence about the cost-effectiveness of implementing nurse-led care, but most stud- ies suggest that it either costs the same or less than other models of care. When assessing patient satisfaction with this model, we compared our results with those from two recent studies with similar patient populations, namely traditional physician-led health service delivery methods in Alberta8 and Norway.9 The equal and significantly higher scores found in our study suggest greater sat-isfaction with multidisciplinary care in BC as compared with physician-led care in Alberta and Norway. Any negative impact caused by implementing a nursing model of rheumatology care has not been significant, with all aspects of care scoring more than 4.00 out of 5.00. Results from the 2018 BC Society of Rheu - matologists survey suggest multiple advantages to having additional nursing support in outpa- tient rheumatology practices. Rheumatologists benefit from increased remuneration and from having time to see more patients while nurses assist with patient assessments and educate patients about medications, diet, and other as-pects of care.

The league also concluded that statistically significant higher levels of knowledge were found in patients with access to nursing support compared with those seen only by rheumatologists.11,12 In addition, the recommendations state that the participa- tion of nurses can help control disease activity and improve patient-preferred outcomes. 6Connell J, Kur J, Gurmin J clinical Plastic surgery 5 (3-8) 75 189 radiology 3 (1-9) 56 84 immunology 1 (0-4) 50 70 *Results could not be compared because researchers altered the questions for access and continuity.TablE . results from Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ) completed in British Columbia, Alberta, and Norway by patients at rheumatology clinics using a multidisciplinary care model.102 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020102 CliniC al Study limitations The results of our study have limited generaliz - ability to rural and remote communities as the three participating clinics were all in urban cen- tres. In addition, demographic shifts and other changes in the BC health system that were not measured may have had an impact on the change in patient visits over time. Regarding results from the Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire, informa- tion was not collected on demographics or disease progression, so confound- ing variables could not be accurately analyzed to de- termine their effect on ac- ceptability of care. Regarding the studies used for comparing patient satisfaction, there were two issues. First, the Norway study had a dif-ferent time frame as compared to the Alberta and British Columbia studies. Second, a control clinic with rheumatologist-only care could not be found in BC because all clinics approached to participate were already using nurses in some capacity, and a control clinic serving patients with noninflammatory disease would be inap- propriate since patient satisfaction is known to vary by disease type. In future, comparisons might be made in other provinces where nursing care is not common in rheumatology clinics.Summary Implementation of the rheumatology billing code G31060 in BC has been associated with a significant increase in outpatient encounters for individual physicians managing patients with inflammatory disease. Implementation has also been associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. Our findings indicate nursing support has become an accept- able and integral part of outpatient rheumatology care provincially, and has the potential to improve service delivery and qual- ity of care. n Competing interests none declared. references 1.

David A. Obert, MD, MPP Dr David A. Obert is a resident physician in his fifth year in the UBC Royal College Emergency Medicine program at Vancouver General Hospital. During his fourth year, he took additional training in prehospital and transport medicine and participated in several rotations and experiences with BC Emergency Health Services. When he completes his residency, he will pursue an emergency medical services fellowship at Stanford University. This article has been peer reviewed.A bush plane crashes in Yukon's wilder- ness. A fishing boat strikes a log off British Columbia's coast and is rapidly taking on water. A caller reports seeing several red flares in a remote area on the rugged western shores of Vancouver Island. In these and other air and sea rescue situations, the Joint Res - cue Coordination Centre ( JRCC) in Victoria, BC, sits atop the nexus of the fast-paced, often multi-agency response that follows. Often with limited initial information and lives on the line, search and rescue mission coordinators at the JRCC spring into action. Depending on the circumstances, a variety of resources may be tasked to respond, ranging from civilian vessels and other nearby assets to Royal Canadian Air Force planes and helicopters as well as Canadian Coast Guard vessels. During 2 weeks in May 2019, I was very fortunate to get an inside look at the operations of the JRCC Victoria in fulfilling its mission to coordinate air and maritime search and rescue for BC and Yukon. As an emergency medi- cine resident pursuing training in prehospital and transport medicine, the experience was invaluable in offering a contrast between feder - ally mandated search and rescue services and those of the provincially administered civilian emergency medical services system in British Columbia (BC Emergency Health Services), with which I am more familiar. While there are obvious inherent differences between search and rescue and emergency medical services, there are also areas of significant overlap and the echoes of several similar challenges. It is here, in the overlap, where we can benefit from the insights gleaned in seeing each other's worlds. The JRCC Victoria (one of three JRCCs in Canada) is truly a joint operation. Located at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, Royal Ca- nadian Air Force and Canadian Coast Guard personnel at the JRCC work together on op-posite sides of a large room. The air force side of the room is staffed by a Royal Canadian Air Force air controller (an experienced pilot or air combat systems officer) who, during day- time hours, is joined by an assistant air control- ler. The marine side consists of two seasoned Canadian Coast Guard mariners. Despite a computer-monitor-to-person ratio of well over five to one, the room is open and designed to facilitate communication and collaboration. The marine and air search and rescue mission coordinators work 24/7 answering a variety of calls from the public, the Canadian military, the Canadian Coast Guard (and sometimes their US counterparts), RCMP , and other agencies. I even witnessed a call from the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Many are small matters\u2014an empty boat adrift or an acciden- tally activated emergency locator transmitter. Dr Obert on the open ramp of the CH-149 Cormorant as it navigates a valley on Vancouver Island.104 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020104tides, currents, and wind patterns\u2014are input into complex models to generate a search area based on predicted drift patterns. Search maps are then updated in real time to factor in con- tinued drift, while also accounting for areas already searched. To say that the job requires a high degree of skill is an understatement. Outside the walls of the JRCC, I also had the privilege to witness the exceptional prow-ess of a team of search and rescue technicians from the 442 Transport and Rescue Squad- ron in Comox, BC\u2014the \"pointy end of the spear\" for air-based search and rescue. As part of a medi- cal simulation exercise, I watched as the team, which had been inserted by helicopter, rushed to the scene of an incred- ibly realistic plane crash mock-up (complete with twisted fuselage and air- craft parts strewn about the landscape). Multiple mock casualties, played by Canadian Forces personnel, were quickly assessed and triaged as the search and rescue technicians got to work. The sound of a circling Buffalo aircraft thundered overhead, and soon after several blaze-orange parachutes appeared across the sky bringing additional personnel to the scene. The medical care that was delivered was impressive in its scope and in the ability of personnel to adapt on the fly to the fluid and technically challenging conditions. At the con- clusion of the simulation exercise, several mock patients had been stabilized and remained in the capable hands of the search and rescue techni- cians. In a real-life scenario, the JRCC would have already been hard at work facilitating the transfer of care to the provincial trauma system. However, technical skills are only one part of the equation. Equally important are the softer skills, the interpersonal aptitude necessary to coordinate effectively between multiple players in an emotionally charged, fast-moving situa-tion. The parallels to the worlds of both emer-gency medicine and prehospital medicine are easy to spot. Unfortunately, so too are some of the challenges. Posttraumatic stress and burn- out are ever-present issues. Recruitment and retention difficulties further burden the exist-ing complement of search and rescue mission coordinators who are often forced to pick up extra shifts to keep the JRCC staffed 24/7/365. Additionally, as the older, experienced search and rescue mission coordinators begin to retire, there is risk of significant institutional knowl-edge loss. Securing adequate funding in an era of re- straint is but one factor in addressing these is- sues. Among other things, the JRCC must also continue to be innovative and agile in respond- ing to challenges. Collaboration and resource pooling with related organizations is one strat- egy for achieving these ends and has the poten- tial to produce mutually beneficial outcomes. The relationship between the BC Emergency Health Services' Emergency Physician Online Support program and the JRCC is a shining example of such a collaboration. The Emergency Physician Online Support program gives pre- hospital providers around-the-clock telephone access to a BC Emergency Health Services physician advisor for clinical decision support. BC Emergency Health Services has made the Emergency Physician Online Support service available to JRCC, as well as to Canadian Forces search and rescue technicians and Canadian Coast Guard rescue specialists. This has proven to be an invaluable resource. For example, as is the case with BC Emergency Health Services paramedics, the search and rescue technicians and rescue specialists report greatly increased confidence in their ability to provide the high- est quality of patient care knowing that Emer- gency Physician Online Support advice is only a phone (or satellite phone) call away. From the JRCC's perspective, a frequent issue in recent years has been calls from cruise ships for medevacs. Given the finite air and sea assets at JRCC's disposal, it is necessary to appropriately steward these resources for use where and when they are most needed. Thus, calls must be medically triaged, a task that at a command level is generally best handled by a physician. By bringing an Emergency Phy- sician Online Support doctor on the line, physician-to-physician communication can oc- cur with the cruise ship's medical officer and, working with the search and rescue mission coordinators, a plan using resources appropriate Others can be multiday search operations in- volving multiple search and rescue mission co- ordinators and a variety of air and sea assets. Generally, calls are categorized as either air, marine, or humanitarian. Air calls include monitoring notifications of distress communi- cations picked up from pilots such as \"mayday\" and \"pan-pan\" calls. As well, all emergency lo- cator transmitter signals (which could indicate a plane crash) that are picked up by satellites monitored at the Canadian Mission Control Centre and that fall with- in JRCC Victoria's search and rescue area are inves-tigated by search and res-cue mission coordinators. If a crash is determined to have occurred, JRCC then coordinates the search and rescue effort. Marine calls operate similar to air calls, but owing to the higher number of vessels on the water than aircraft in the sky, they are far more frequent. All incidents involving a threat to life or limb that occur in the waters contained within JRCC Victoria's search and rescue zone are managed by marine search and rescue mission coordinators. Such incidents may include sinking vessels, persons in the water, medical emergencies occurring at sea, and any emergency position indicating radio beacon activation (the marine equivalent of an aircraft emergency locator transmitter). Finally, humanitarian calls make up an increas- ing number of calls and include JRCC assis- tance offered in situations that otherwise fall outside its federal air and maritime search and rescue mandate. Examples include assisting land-based search and rescue agencies (such as the RCMP) as well as the BC Ambulance Service to evacuate patients from more remote and difficult-to-access areas. Whether a call technically falls to the air or marine side does not betray the teamwork necessary for the more involved calls. The level of complexity that search and rescue mission coordinators are sometimes called on to grapple with can be mind boggling. For example, in the case of a missing person in the water, a multitude of variables\u2014including last location, spEcial fEaturE The medical care that was delivered was impressive in its scope and in the ability of personnel to adapt on the fly to the fluid and technically challenging conditions. 105 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020105spEcial fEaturE to the urgency of the medevac can be put in motion. Judging from the taped calls I listened to while observing at the JRCC, the system works exactly as designed. It is important to note that the collaboration goes both ways. While it is beyond its federal air and maritime search and rescue mandate, assist- ing BC Emergency Health Services to evacuate patients from particularly difficult-to-access parts of BC has often been part of JRCC's work. Canadian Coast Guard vessels with rescue spe- cialists aboard can reach many of the remote water-access-only communities found in BC. One would be hard pressed to find a place in BC that is beyond the combined reach of these organizations. Furthermore, patients in these remote areas can be confident that, once they are reached, they will be under the care of highly competent professionals. Above one of the desks at the JRCC is a large Canadian flag with the motto \"That Oth- ers May Live\" below the words \"RCAF Para- rescue.\" Despite the many differences between federal search and rescue and the prehospital medicine world of BC Emergency Health Ser- vices, the driving motivation behind their re-spective efforts is the same. \"That Others May Live\" is part of the search and rescue techni- cians' pledge, and it aptly sums up this motiva- tion. During my 2 weeks with the JRCC (and on-field excursions to 442 Squadron in Comox and two Canadian Coast Guard lifeboat sta- tions), I saw this mentality on full display. I am extremely grateful to have been welcomed into their world. It is my hope that, through this reflection, I am able to share with the wider prehospital medicine world an understanding of the mandates, capabilities, and operations of the JRCC, Royal Canadian Air Force, and Ca- nadian Coast Guard in delivering world-class search and rescue coverage. With this common understanding and shared ethos, collaboration between the federal air and maritime search and rescue and BC Emergency Health Services can be at its most fruitful. n Acknowledgments Dr obert would like to acknowledge and give par - ticular thanks to Captain S\u00e9bastien Lemire, CD, and lieutenant Philip Yoon, MD, for organizing and facilitating this unique experience with the JRCC. While it is beyond its federal air and maritime search and rescue mandate, assisting BC Emergency Health Services to evacuate patients from particularly difficult-to-access parts of BC has often been part of JrCC's work.

We have all been taught that Darwinian evolution is based on the principles of random mutation and natural selection. However, there are many people now questioning the com- pleteness of these principles. There is a third principle, which is sometimes called group se- lection1 and sometimes called cooperation.2 Even Darwin had doubts about the complete- ness of his theory.3For at least 50 years, biological dictum has said that it is the individual who is subject to evolution. It is now believed that the small co-operative group is the fundamental unit of an organization that evolves. In fact, the evolution probably happens at many different levels. This has been termed \"multilevel selection.\" And evolution is not perfect. If an adap- tation is selected at one level, this inevitably creates problems the next level up. So what is good for me may not be good for my family, what is good for my family may not be good for the community, what is good for the com- munity may not be good for the province, what is good for the province may not be good for the country, and so forth. There is a well-known example involving hens to illustrate how group selection trumps individual selection.4 Let's say you have groups of hens in cages (10 to a cage) on a modern agricultural egg farm. You might think that breeding the most productive individual hens would give you more eggs. But what happens after about five generations of this breeding is the hens peck each other's feathers out and egg production plummets. If, on the other hand, Group medical practice is the natural evolution of medicine Eight core design principles that favor cooperation and the welfare of groups, applicable to the evolution of medical practice.

Think about the difference be- tween one surgeon struggling for hours versus two surgeons together struggling for hours with a bad outcome. Eight: Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the low- est level up to the entire interconnected system Interconnectedness is what defines a complex adaptive system. Health care is just one of many such systems. Johnny von Neumann said that the defining characteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral description. If we try to reduce the system's behavior to any formal description it makes things more complicated, not less. This seems rather demoralizing in our health care system, but the responsibility that Ostrom's eighth prin- ciple suggests needs to be developed is better than anarchy. Evolution is not top-down like the hierarchy of the military or hospital administration. Nor is it completely bottom-up, with evolution only working its wonders on genes that mutate and then get randomly selected (like laissez-faire capitalism with its inevitable booms and crush- ing busts). Evolution tinkers with things. It experiments, lets most things fail, and keeps the things that work until they, too, fail. Medical practice is no different. n references 1. Wilson DS.

The rational usually given for the disastrous outcome in the first scenario is that you are breeding bullies who then do nothing but fight each other. Maybe one bully in a cage of 10 hens was okay, but 10 bullies in a cage is problematic, at least as far as egg production goes. Elinor Ostrom won a Nobel prize in eco- nomics in 2009 for outlining eight core design principles that favor cooperation and the welfare of groups.5 This work greatly influenced biolo - gists developing the theory of evolution at the group level.6 These principles are very applicable to medical practice. They are outlined here. One: Define clear group boundaries The group must have clear boundaries so its members know they are members and know what the group does.Two: Match rules governing the use of com- mon goods to local needs and conditions The group must ensure the use of common goods by individuals matches the welfare of the group. This may seem more relevant to fish- ers regulating some area of the sea or farmers regulating crops in fields, but it is also pertinent to group medical practice. Basically it means you can't steal your money; you must earn it.Three: Ensure those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules The group must agree to things collectively so no one individual can be bossed around. Four: Ensure the rule-making rights of com- munity members are respected by outside authorities In the case of doctors, the rules they enact must be respected by the larger collective system, whether that be a hospital administration, a regional health authority, or a provincial gov- ernment. This is where it is good to have a group leader who is able to communicate well with the authorities and not simply be their hired hand. Five: Develop a system, carried out by com- munity members, for monitoring members' behavior There must be a system to monitor the actions of a group's members. This is where a good leader shows their other side by being able to communicate well with group members, con-vincing them to change a practice if it is in the interest of the group. Six: Use graduated sanctions for rule violators If an individual doctor in a group breaks a rule, there must be a graduated, agreed-upon sys- tem of escalating sanctions against that mem-ber. The sanctions must start out benignly and should build up to a real sting after repeated transgressions. Seven: Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution Disputes must be settled with very little cost to the group. If they aren't, then medicolegal problems arise. Most lawsuits stem from long- standing grudges between doctors that result in a patient either overhearing one doctor com-plaining about how bad another doctor is or a doctor telling that directly to the patient. If a disastrous complication results from some situ- ation, it is much easier for the individual doctor if everyone in the group does things similarly 108 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020108register now for the Business Cost Premium The new Business Cost Premium (BCP) was negotiated in the 2019 Physician Master Agree- ment to help physicians offset some of the costs associated with running their office. Physicians will be able to claim the BCP on fees for con- sultation, visit, counseling, and complete ex- amination services to help cover the rising rent, lease, or ownership costs of a community-based office. Physicians need to register their facility and attach themselves as a practitioner of the facility. The BCP came into effect 1 April 2020. Eligible physicians are those who provide eligible services in an eligible community-based office and who are responsible for some or all of the lease, rental, or ownership costs of that office, either directly or indirectly. Physicians must also be entitled to receive and retain pay- ment for the eligible fees directly from MSP (that is, payments assigned to health authorities are not eligible for the premium). The BCP will be applied to eligible fees sub- mitted on a physician's billing claims, and will be paid to the physician's (or assigned) payee number. The claims system will apply the per- centage for the premium and calculate the daily maximum. In order to identify the physical loca- tion in which services are provided and for the correct percentage premium to be applied, phy- sicians need to register their community-based office for a facility number, which is a unique physician/office location-identifier. If an eligible physician is responsible for some or all of the lease, rental, or ownership costs at more than one community-based loca- tion, they need to register each location where eligible services are provided. Community-based offices with multiple eligible physicians should assign one physi- cian to act as the administrator and register the office for a facility number. It is not required that all physicians in the same clinic apply for a facility number. However, each eligible phy-sician is required to complete an Attach Prac- titioner to MSP Facility Number application form using the facility number obtained by your administrator.

The HIP Fracture Accelerated Surgical Treatment and Care Track (HIP ATTACK) Trial, published in The Lancet, was led by re- searchers of the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) of McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) in Hamil- ton. HIP ATTACK involved 2970 people at 69 sites in 17 countries. Ten years ago, Dr P .J. Devereaux, principal investigator of the HIP ATTACK trial, as well as senior scientific lead of PHRI's perioperative and surgery program, professor of medicine at McMaster, and cardiologist with HHS, was consulted to manage a 73-year-old female with a hip fracture who also had elevated troponin, demonstrating heart injury. The referring doc- tor told Dr Devereaux the patient's heart issue had to be treated before surgery for her hip fracture could occur. Despite the best of inten- tions, with the medical treatment Dr Devereaux provided based on current practice at that time, the patient died before she was able to undergo surgery for her hip fracture. Dr Devereaux wondered if the prevail- ing dogma regarding the need to medically optimize patients before hip fracture surgery was the wrong approach. He contacted Dr Mohit Bhandari, co-principal investigator of HIP ATTACK and an orthopaedic surgeon in Hamilton, to get his perspective on the case. Dr 109 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020109nEws Bhandari told Dr Devereaux that observational studies suggested that shorter time to surgery may prevent death and major complications in patients with a hip fracture. Based on this evidence, they initiated a large randomized con- trolled trial to understand the effects of accel- erated surgery in patients with a hip fracture. Accelerated surgery did not result in a re- duction in death or a collection of major com- plications; however, patients randomized to accelerated surgery had a lower risk of delir- ium, urinary tract infection, moderate to se- vere pain, and were faster to stand, mobilize, and go home compared to patients random- ized to standard care.

Physical activity for prostate cancer patients and its effect on tumors Prostate cancer affects 15% to 20% of North American men. Living with a cancer diagnosis can be frightening and anxiety-inducing, but at the same time there exists a hopeful phe- nomenon called the \"teachable moment.\" The teachable moment describes cancer patients' increased likelihood of accepting and acting on their health care provider's lifestyle change recommendations because of their diagnosis. Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute scientist Dr Ryan Flannigan is currently study- ing whether the teachable moment offers an opportunity to get prostate cancer patients into a regular exercise routine that may change the genetic expression and molecular makeup of their tumor and improve their diagnosis. Dr Flannigan is a urologist focused on men's health at Vancouver General Hospital and senior research scientist at the Vancou- ver Prostate Centre. He is also clinical lead of the Prostate Cancer Supportive Care Sexual 110 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020110nEws Medicine Program, British Columbia, direc- tor of the Male Infertility & Sexual Medicine Research Program, and assistant professor in the Department of Urologic Sciences at UBC. There have been a number of research stud- ies on a population level that have identified the association between exercise and reduced risk for acquiring prostate cancer, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and delayed disease progression. Studies have also shown a con- nection between regular exercise and improved quality of life for patients in terms of allevi- ating treatment-associated side effects such as fatigue and decreased muscle strength and physical function. Dr Flannigan's study participants were 20 men diagnosed with immediate-risk prostate cancer, meaning eventual surgery to remove the prostate gland. Ten participants were ran- domly assigned to an 8- to 12-week exercise intervention completed prior to surgery. The intervention comprised two 1-hour sessions of supervised resistance and aerobic training per week, as well as home aerobic training at least twice weekly. The other 10 participants received standard prostate cancer care that included edu- cation about healthy exercise and diet. The study found that introducing exercise during the teachable moment (after diagnosis and before surgery) led to increased physical activity among participants 6 months post- surgery and well after the exercise interven- tion period. The study also found that prostate cancer-specific quality of life and depressive symptoms were similar 6 months after surgery as before surgery. Studies using animal models have demon- strated decreased tumor activity following exer- cise treatments. For example, research suggests that exercise may interfere with oxygen delivery in prostate cancer tumor microcirculation and tumor proliferation, decreasing chances of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body and delaying tumor growth. As part of their study, Dr Flannigan and his team are testing participants' tumor specimens to see if there are any changes resulting from the exercise intervention. They hope to have preliminary molecular and genetic study results by summer 2020.Doctors know that patients are not always fully truth- ful with them, but just how much do patients lie, and about what? A recent Poll- fish survey found that 43% of those who admitted to lying say they lie about their ex- ercise habits; the only thing that more people admitted to lying about was smoking (46%). Patients 35 and older were more likely to lie about their exercise habits than younger patients, while those under 35 were more likely to lie about smoking. More men lied to doctors about alcohol consumption than women (50% men vs. 32% women), while women were more likely to lie about sexual partners (33% women vs. 21% men). Why are patients lying? 75% of respondents cited embarrassment. 31% lie to avoid discrimination. 22% lie because they don't think their doctor will take them seriously if they tell the truth.Of those who admitted to lying to their physician, the group that lied to avoid dis- crimination was overwhelmingly female (80% female, 20% male). On the bright side, in general most people (77% of those surveyed) are honest with their doctor, and 34% said they were comfortable talking with their doctor about anything. The survey was conducted for insurance aggregator TermLife2Go, and had 500 re- spondents from throughout the US.

Dr Hans Adalbert Witt 1934-2020 Dr Hans Adalbert Witt was born in Brasdorf, East Prussia, on 29 August 1934. At the out-break of World War II, Hans's life changed in ways that would shape his character and influ - ence his legacy of tenacity. In 1945, Hans, his seven siblings, and their mother fled to Schleswig-Holstein. There, Hans completed his schooling and apprenticed as a tool and die maker. In 1955 the family, spon-sored by the Mennonite Church, immigrated to Canada and settled on a farm in Virgil, On- tario. To support his family, Hans worked as a newspaper truck driver and then as a tool and die maker with GM. During this time, he took courses at night to learn English, and his hard work saw him enter medical school. He became a family doctor and then specialized in anesthesia. He married Nancy McAdam and they lived in various towns in BC with their two children, Heidi and Jonathan. Sadly, his marriage did not continue. In 1994, Hans returned to Toronto and began practising psychotherapy. He retired in 2005. On a visit to Kelowna, he met Ela Jackel and their beautiful relationship began. In addi- tion to dancing and gardening with Ela, Hans was an avid bridge player. As a young immigrant, his career was shaped by his mother's words that \"education will save your life.\" His passion for lifelong learning was evidenced when he became a stu- dent once more and, at age 82 at UBC Okana- gan, achieved his dream of attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree. Indeed, he is a role model for anyone whose life circumstances are challeng- ing. His love of learning is indeed a legacy he leaves the next generation of family. In 2018, Hans was diagnosed with cancer. He underwent surgery and radiation, but in December his health challenges increased. He died peacefully at Kelowna Hospice House on 21 January 2020. \u2014Heidi Grogan Calgary Dr Barry King Cutler 1937-2019 Dr Barry King Cutler, 82 years of age, passed away peacefully at the Berkley Care Centre on 16 December 2019, surrounded by family. A man of faith, Barry is lovingly remem - bered by his wife of 58 years, Judith; his chil- dren, Duffy (Shari) and Rob ( Joanne); his sister, Diane (Doug Porter); his grandchildren, Cam- eron, Emily, and McKenzie, and Gemma and Declan. He will also be remembered by many friends and colleagues from Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Barry was predeceased by his mother, Wilma (nee King); his father, Don; and his eldest son, Scott.A loving husband and father, Barry was a compassionate physician and surgeon in the Powell River area for 32 years. After Barry com- pleted his high school education at University of Toronto Schools and medical training at the University of Toronto, he and Judy left ex- tended family and moved to BC in 1968 to raise a family and begin a lifelong mission of car- ing for the members of Powell River's thriving coastal community. Barry was president of the BC Surgical Society (1986-87) and president of the Powell River Medical Society (1991-95). Barry was an avid athlete, farmer, outdoors- man, mariner, and fan of all things related to sports. A pioneer in every sense of the word, and a gentle spirit, Barry would count his contribu- tions to the Powell River community among his proudest accomplishments. He was recently named to the Powell River Sports Hall of Fame as team physician for the Power River Regals Hockey Club and its run to the Allan Cup championship in 1969. He was a member of the medical team at the Montreal Olympic Games, and as president of the Powell River Golf Club (1984-88), he was instrumental in initiating the planning and construction of the Myrtle Point Golf Club. In 2000 Barry and Judy began spending winters in Ajijic, Mexico, and in 2013 they moved to North Vancouver to be closer to family. In 2006, Barry began a 13-year battle with Parkinson disease and Lewy body demen- tia. His family thanks Drs Doug Toole, Steve Burns, Silke Cresswell, Arvind Kang, and Garry Jenkins, and the nurses, care aids, and staff of Berkley Care Centre for their exceptional and dedicated care for Barry over the years and dur - ing his 3\u00bd years living at the care centre. A Mass of Christian Burial was held on 15 January 2020 at Christ the Redeemer Parish, 599 Keith Road, West Vancouver.

The Medical Services Commission (MSC) is responsible for administering the Medical Services Plan (MSP), which includes remu- nerating physicians. As part of administering MSP , audits are conducted to ensure physicians have appropriate billing patterns. As a medical inspector, you will participate in one or more audits by reviewing medical records to assess whether a physician's MSP billings comply with billing rules. In this inter- esting and rewarding role, you will be making decisions about appropriate billing practices in accordance with the MSC payment schedule, and you will also help provide explanations to the physician who is being audited. If appointed as a medical inspector, you will be placed on a call list and asked to participate in audits related to your specialty and/or scope of practice. If you are called, the audit will be scheduled based on your availability, and you will have the option to decline to participate if you are unavailable at that time.Why become a medical inspector? This article is the opinion of the Patterns of Practice Committee and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.When the Audit and Inspection Committee (AIC) requests an on-site audit of a medical practice, an attempt is made to match the medi- cal inspector with the type of practice being audited. Having a peer physician conduct the review is preferred by both the AIC and the physician undergoing the audit and inspection. The AIC is accepting applications for medical inspectors from any section, but it is currently looking to fill medical inspector roles for the following specialties: General practice Pediatrics Infectious diseases Neurosurgery Endocrinology Neurology Psychiatry Otolaryngology Anesthesiology Sleep medicine Internal medicine and other medical subspecialties General surgery and other surgical sub specialties Inspectors are appointed by the AIC under the Medicare Protection Act. Inspectors are responsible for reviewing medical records in order to assess compliance with the MSC Pay - ment Schedule, the Act, and the Regulations. Conditions of appointment Candidates must: Have a minimum 5 years' experience in the applicable specialty. Be an active registrant with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. Have billing practices that fall within the accepted standards of the profession or gen - erally designated by the Patterns of Practice Committee. Have the ability to exercise sound judgment. Have an understanding and knowledge of the MSC payment schedule. Not be subject to circumstances that could give rise to a conflict of interest. Inspectors are required to: Sign a 3-year contract, with possible ex- tension, to be placed on a call list with the Ministry of Health. Once under contract, medical inspectors will be contacted to conduct audits on an as-needed basis. If a medical inspector is contacted, the audit will be scheduled based on the medical in - spector's availability. Attend an orientation and training session. Attend on-site audits, which may include travel and stay at accommodations outside the medical inspector's city (length varies from 3 to 5 days). Work as part of a team with members of the Billing Integrity Program while on site. Inspect medical records, make determinations about compliance with the payment schedule, and flag any quality-of-care concerns. Have an exit interview with the auditee to clear up any unanswered questions or obtain explanations of billing issues. Review and sign the final audit report. Act as a witness before a panel established under the Act, if necessary. Maintain confidentiality and independence at all times as required by Section 49 of the Act. CompensationMedical inspectors are paid an hourly rate de- rived from the hourly equivalent of Doctors of BC's sessional rate for GPs or specialists. In- spectors also receive compensation for eligible travel expenses. If you are interested in becoming a medical inspector, please contact Tara Hamilton, project coordinator, audit and billing, at 604 638-6058 or thamilton@doctorsofbc.ca. n \u2014n ick Szpakowicz, MD Vice-Chair, Patterns of Practice Committee Having a peer physician conduct the review is preferred by both the AIC and the physician undergoing the audit and inspection.115 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 3 | April 2020115BCMJ guidElinEs 270 BC MediC al Journal vol. 61 no. 7 | september 2019 270BCMJ Guidelines Guidelines for authors (short form) The British Columbia Medical Journal welcomes letters, articles, and essays.
