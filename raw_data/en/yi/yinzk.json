We are proud to sell Standard Process, Inc. natural supplements and welcome you to complete a [symptom survey](https://www.drfrazetta.com/wps/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/SystemsSurve-Form.pdf) to see where you may be nutritionally deficient. From diet, to purification programs, to whole food supplements, Frazetta Family Chiropractic will be more than able to satisfy your nutritional needs. Over seventy-five years ago, founder Dr. Royal Lee began making whole food supplements based on his belief that good health comes from good nutrition, and the best sources of vitamins and minerals are found in whole foods. Standard Process has continued that tradition. Unlike many other supplement companies, Standard Process is involved in every step of production. By organically growing crops on company-owned farms, utilizing a state-of-the-art manufacturing process, and employing the highest quality control standards, they ensure that their products are of the utmost quality. Their farmland, located in Wisconsin's Kettle Moraine basin, contains nutrient-rich soil. It is here that they organically grow strong, vital plants for use in their whole food supplements. Each year, the crops are rotated and the acreage is adjusted for each crop based on estimated needs of the main production facility. Q. Are all vitamins the same? A. This is an easy one...NO! Most vitamins you buy over the counter are synthetic, which means they are man-made. They do not react the same in your body as whole food vitamins do, which are organically grown. Sometimes synthetic vitamins will help initially, but the longer you take them, the less effective they become and eventually they will deplete your body of other vitamins and minerals that are necessary for function. That leads us to the question, \"What vitamins should I be taking?\" Too often people will read an article about the one-size-fits-all vitamin and jump on the band wagon. Not only are many of these supplements synthetic, there are substances in them that your body does not need. If taken, it can really throw your body chemistry \"out of whack.\" We must be more precise when choosing the supplements our body needs or they may be more harmful than helpful. This is why the company we use, Standard Process Inc., has created the symptom survey form. It helps us identify more precisely what your body needs and what systems of your body need nutritional support. This evaluation is free for anyone who visits our website. Just fill it out and we will see where your deficiencies are and what supplements are right for YOU! You can drop off or mail in your survey to Frazetta Family Chiropractic, 846 Pittsburgh Street, Springdale, PA 15144.
