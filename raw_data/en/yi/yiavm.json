Great as usual! Awesome store and layout and super friendly and helpful This store has so many rad things. I thought my head was going to explode from all the excitement. They helped us pick out some cool birthday gifts for our kids and are genuinely nice and talented people. I'll be back for all the bat stuff and definitely for that toad Fanny pack!!! I will be back for everything! One of my favorite things about this place is how knowledgeable they are about all their specimens. I always leave a little smarter then when I arrived. natur showroom is my new favorite store! Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The selection is great. The hardest part was limiting how much to buy. Since my daughter loves this kind of stuff, I know I will definitely be back. Thank you for all you help!
