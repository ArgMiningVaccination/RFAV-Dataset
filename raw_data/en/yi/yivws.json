The study was initiated in 1999 with the objective of identifying the most promising path to development in light of emerging global and regional changes. The first volume, Can East Asia Compete? , was published in 2002. It pro- vided a compact overview of the relevant strategic issues and future policydirections. Innovative East Asia , the second volume, was published in 2003 and analyzed each of the main issues and consequent policy choices, draw- ing comprehensively from recent empirical research and the findings offirm surveys conducted for the study. Its principal message was thatsustained economic growth in East Asia will rest on the ability to retainthe strengths of the past (stability, openness, investment, and human cap- ital development); to overcome the sources of current weaknesses (in the financial, corporate, judicial, and social sectors); and to implement thechanges required by the evolving economic environment, particularly withregard to technology development. The third volume, Global Production Networking and T echnological Change in East Asia , published in 2004, was the first of two volumes of papers commissioned for the East Asia study .It presented detailed information, analysis, and case studies, showing thatthe economies in East Asia must adapt to the changing character of globalproduction networks and nurture and develop their technological capabil-ities in order to sustain their growth prospects. The fourth volume, Global Change and East Asian Policy Initiatives , also published in 2004, included a separate set of papers that examined some of the key institutional weak-nesses identified in Innovative East Asia . Contributors to this volume explored in depth topics ranging from regional issues arising from xixii PREFACE monetary and financial cooperation, trade, and harmonization to the national issues of public expenditure, corporate and public governance,the legal system, tertiary education, and finance. They also presented an array of policy options of value to East Asian economies. Some, if not all, of these issues are relevant to every country in East Asia. Both of the edit-ed volumes complement Innovative East Asia and are addressed to re- searchers, students, and policy makers. Although the first four volumes in this series presented a macroeco- nomic perspective, Under New Ownership focused on the microeconomics of business organization and state enterprise reform\u2014issues that are of considerable importance for China. The main message of the book wasthat Chinese firms need to pursue strategies that will promote efficiencyand innovation to compete in the global market. Much of the cross- country evidence to date suggests that state-owned firms are slow to adopt such strategies, and because these firms are generally subject to a differentset of incentives than their private counterparts, their managers are lesszealous in implementing those strategies. Chinese state-owned firms arenot exceptions, and if they are to compete in the global markets with otherfirms\u2014especially the established large multinational firms\u2014privatizationis a necessary step to attaining international competitiveness. As we have argued in the previous volumes in this series, future growth in East Asia will increasingly come from the strength of innovative activi-ties instead of factor accumulation. Such innovative activities\u2014especiallyin producer services and the creative industries\u2014are concentrated in high-tech clusters in globally linked cities. This volume explores the growthprospects of six cities in East Asia: Bangkok, Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai,Singapore, and T okyo. The development of such cities is influenced by ongoing structural changes and initiatives by governments and firms. Asuccessful transition from export-oriented manufacturing to a serviceeconomy that is competitive and integrated with the global systems willinvolve a reshaping of the urban landscape so that providers of businessservices and the creative industries perceive it to be value-augmenting fortheir purposes and a basis for competitive advantage. This volume drawson a wide literature and on interviews of firms that were conducted for thisstudy. It suggests how policies and institutions can induce and furnish anurban environment that supports innovative activities. The financial backing of the government of Japan, through its Policy and Human Resources Development Fund, has provided vital support forthis project, as have senior public officials who gave generously oftheir time. We are deeply grateful to Haruhiko The staff of the World Bank's coun- try offices facilitated our fieldwork in East Asia, and we greatly appreciatethe assistance provided by Kirida Bhaopichitr (Bangkok), Jianqing Chen (Beijing), Shuichi Kiyanagi (T okyo), and Peter Stevens (Singapore). We owe special thanks to representatives of many firms whom we inter- viewed in the six cities. These individuals shared their insights and gave generously of their time despite their busy schedules. We extend our thanksalso to Yee-Kyoung Kim, Kaoru Kimura, and Patharaporn Theeratham for conducting the interviews in Seoul, T okyo, and Bangkok. Five background papers commissioned for this book gave us the mate- rials to build on.

Fisher at the World Bank Office of thePublisher smoothly managed the operation from start to finish with a light yet firm touch, which ensured that neither the authors nor the logisticsever had a chance of faltering. We would not have pulled it off withoutthem.PREFACE xiiiABBREVIATIONS 3D Three-dimensional AI Artificial intelligenceBMA Bangkok metropolitan area BMR Bangkok metropolitan region CAS Chinese Academy of ScienceCRT Cathode ray tubeCMOS Complementary metal-oxide semiconductorDNA Deoxyribonucleic acid DVD Digital versatile discEDB Economic Development BoardES Embryonic stemETRI Electronics and T elecommunications Research InstituteEVD Enhanced versatile disc FDI Foreign direct investment FEC Foreign economic cooperationG-8 Institute of Molecular and Cellular BiologyISP Internet service providerIT Information technologyIX Internet exchangeKOCCA Korean Culture and Content Agency xvxvi ABBREVIATIONS LCD Liquid crystal display MIT Massachusetts Institute of T echnologyMMORPG Massively multiplayer online role-playing game MNC Multinational corporation MRI Magnetic resonance imagingMUDI Munich Urban Design InternationalNASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration NIH National Institutes of Health NTSC National T elevision Standard CommitteeNUS National University of SingaporeOECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development PAL Phase alternating lines PC Personal computer R&D Research and developmentrDNA Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acidRFID Radio frequency identificationS&T Science and technologySMEs Small and medium enterprisesTB T uberculosisTD-SCDMA Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access TEU T wenty-foot equivalent unitTIMSS-R Third International Mathematics and Science Study-Repeat UAV Unmanned airborne vehiclesVCD Video compact disc WAPI Wired Authentication and Privacy InfrastructureZGC Zhongguancun High-T ech ZoneThe great cities of the world provide a foretaste of the economic future of societies. T o paraphrase Shakespeare's immortal lines,cities are the stage where all the shaping forces come together, play their parts, and have their exits and entrances. 1From observ- ing a Seoul or a Shanghai or a T okyo, one has a sense of where urban societies are headed, not in any linear fashion, but digressively, with many changes in direction and in the mix of policies and through much creative destruction. Most of humanity is leaving the fields and the farms for good.Most people during this century will find their joys, their sorrows, andtheir fortunes in cities. A growing minority of urbanites will be drawn byor pushed toward the megacities of the world, making many of those cities even larger than they currently are. 2Indeed, the economic pull and cul- tural attractiveness of megacities could intensify\u2014because of faster in- come and employment growth arising from agglomeration effects and the emergence of new industries;3because such cities tend to be the foci of innovation; because they usually take the lead in defining major publicCHAPTER 1 EMERGING CITYSCAPES 1. On the winding history that has led from more than 11,000 years of urbanization to today's postindustrial cities, see Kotkin (2005). 2. Where megacities are poorly managed, deindustrialization, congestion, worsening pollution, poverty, crime, and increasing costs of living could act as a brake on growth, as is apparent in thecase of Mumbai since the 1990s and Rio de Janeiro (Cullen and Levitt 1996). We fully recognizethat the megacities will account for a minority of the urban population. The majority will bemoving to and living in small and medium-size cities (Cohen 2004). 3. Agglomeration economies derive from the scale of production, industrial diversity, innovation spillovers, and deep labor markets. Agglomeration economies in the large cities appear to beparticularly helpful to smaller firms with limited establishment-level technological capabilities.Such firms find it easier to adapt information technology, for example, in a dense urban envi-ronment with many services providers and the opportunities to learn from other firms that havepolicies; because they are the portals leading to the global market and are more open to trade, tourism, and the circulation of knowledge workersfrom overseas; and because they are more tightly linked to other global and regional cities (P . T aylor 2005; P . T aylor and others 2002). 4 East Asia is where, arguably, the forces driving urbanization will be strongest, and economic growth centered on urban areas will continue to outpace the competition (see tables 1.1 and 1.2). By 2025, the United Nations projects that more than 50 percent of East Asia's population will be urban, as against 40 percent in 2000 (Yusuf and Nabeshima 2005).5Out2 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES taken the lead in experimenting with new technology. As Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein (2005, 3) put it, \"Firms act as if internal resources can substitute for the advantages of agglom-eration.\" For a recent overview of agglomeration effects, see Rosenthal and Strange (2004). 4. Yue-man Yeung (2005) describes the emergence of the enormously dynamic network of cities composing the Pearl River Delta, China's export powerhouse, while Henry Wai-chung Yeung(2004) describes how the Chinese corporate and kinship networks that are rooted in SoutheastAsian cities have infused investment, energy, and different forms of governance into thoseeconomies. The chapters in Lo and Yeung (1998) review how cities across the world are re-sponding to openness and examine changes at the sectoral level. 5. In 2006, global urbanization reached the 50 percent mark.Table 1.1 Urbanization Rate in East Asia (percent) Korea, Year China Indonesia Japan Rep. of Malaysia Philippines Thailand Vietnam 1990 27.4 30.6 63.1 73.8 49.8 48.8 29.4 20.3 1995 31.4 61.8 32.2 26.2 Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators database.

Note: For the purposes, of this table, megacities are those with a population of 10 million or more. of a total of 20 megacities in 2003, 6 were in East Asia.6These megacities are projected to expand through the next two decades (see table 1.3), and they will be joined by numerous other large cities, each with populations in the many millions. However, if the megacities are going to lead this field, they will require some specific capabilities. They will need a diversemix of industrial engines with the requisite power to propel these large andcomplex economies. They will need to mobilize fully the local and nation-al reservoirs of human skills, energy, and creativity and, by virtue of their perceived potential, raise capital internally and supplement this internalcapital with investment from external sources. It is almost inconceivable 6. A megacity has a population of 10 million or more. The concentration of people within a sin- gle megacity is apparent through much of East Asia.that a megacity that is isolated from the global system could flourish for long. Hence, openness and integration with the global economy will benear the top of the urban policy menu. As more and more industry migrates to East Asia, the region's cities will determine the tempo of economic activity in this emerging industrial heartland of a globalizing economy. The past and current competitivenessof East Asian industry has derived from the quick assimilation of produc-tion techniques, hard and soft, and a profound readiness to learn. These aptitudes have been reinforced more recently by an equally remarkableability to introduce incremental innovations in shop-floor processes andlogistics that have progressively improved quality, delivery times, andspeed of response to market demands. In high-value products such as elec-tronic components, East Asians have also reduced failure rates (Puga and T refler 2005). Future competitiveness that will help bring per capita in- comes closer to those of the industrial countries now requires a higherlevel of innovativeness in several different spheres, extending from prod-ucts to the organization of firms. In this area, the major cities must takethe lead, because all the elements of the innovation system are located inkey urban centers. These cities are the harbingers of emerging urbaneconomic dynamics. And because of the salience of these cities, theirinfluence will be felt around the world. 7 In this volume, we examine industrial change in six East Asian cities.8 Each is a prime mover within its country, is at the leading edge of policy and structural changes, and is the epicenter of innovation. In each of oursix selected cities, we examine one or two key components of the economic engine\u2014industries that provide a reliable metric of the cities' prospects. T o take the pulse of the energy and creativity of the cities, we will analyzethe development of these industries, their innovativeness and global links,and their potential for generating well-paid jobs. 4 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 7. Hospers (2003, 147-48) divides creative cities into four groups. The birthplaces of innovation are the \"technological innovative cities, in the past places such as Detroit and more recently SanFrancisco and Cambridge, United Kingdom. Those places where a rich culture coexists with vi-brant intellectual activity are the cultural-intellectual cities symbolized by Paris and Vienna intimes past and Boston and T oulouse in the present. Cultural technological cities such as T oron-to, Los Angeles, and Austin combine these two forces to advance technology and promoteparticular strands of culture. Then finally there are technological-organizational cities, such asParis, London, and Antwerp, Belgium, that have found in the design of buildings and in trans-port systems original solutions to problems stemming from large scale urban life.\" 8. Five of these cities are national capitals and are the largest (or, in the case of Beijing, among the three largest) cities in their respective countries. Shanghai, the only exception, is the leadingindustrial, financial, and commercial center in mainland China.Throughout the past nearly five decades, there has been a strongly di- rigiste flavor to development in East Asia.9Governments have directed development and managed markets. In several instances, the public sector spearheaded development and is now only gradually relinquishing its lead- ing role. However, throughout the region, governments continue working closely with the private sector, as is strikingly apparent in the major cities.Thus, the shape of urban industrialization to come is closely intermeshedwith industrial policies and with policies toward globalization. TOWARD A POSTINDUSTRIAL URBAN WORLD In the early 19th century, as technological opportunities and market widened, a wave of industrialization gripped the leading cities of WesternEurope and accelerated the transfer of rural workers to urban areas. Be- tween 1800 and 1913, the urban population increased by a factor of seven. 10 Employment in manufacturing rose from 6 million to 38 million, while close to 35 million people found jobs in the services sector (Bairoch 1988,269). What are now viewed as the traditional manufacturing industries, such as textiles, iron and steel, and machine building, remained at the core of the urban economy for an extended length of time. It was not untilnearly a century and a half later that these cities began crossing a thresh-old into what is frequently described as the postindustrial age. Industrialization came much later to most of East Asia. Japan and a few parts of China were exceptions. 11The rise of modern industry in most ma- jor East Asian urban centers began in earnest as recently as the 1960s. But whereas European cities followed a long, slow trajectory into industrial maturity, their East Asian cousins, after a brief adolescence and whatEMERGING CITYSCAPES 5 9. This topic is a contentious one, with much sniping across the ideological boundaries that sep- arate the dirigiste camp from the territory staked out by the free marketers. See Yusuf (2001) fora review of a substantial fraction of the literature and Amsden (1989), Amsden and Chu (2003),Campos and Root (1996), Kohli (2004), Stiglitz and Yusuf (2001), T abellini (2005), and Wade(1990) for more in-depth discussions. 10. The industrial revolution was the outcome of a cluster of inventions and their commercial- ization in a small number of Western European countries and the United States during 1760 to1830. Among the inventions, the Arkwright water frame, the Hargreaves spinning jenny, and theCrompton mule were among the most revolutionary (McCloskey 1985; Mokyr 1990). 11. Japan began industrializing toward the end of the 19th century, starting with textiles but then moving quickly into iron and steel, engineering industries, and shipbuilding. Chinese industri-alization was concentrated in a few coastal cities, chiefly Shanghai and the Japanese-controlledManchurian region to the northeast (see Yusuf 2005). On the early industrialization of China,see Rawski (1989), and on Japan, see Howe (1996) and Morris-Suzuki (1994).amounts to a mere brush with maturity, are also having to adapt to rapid changes in the industrial composition of their economies. The geographicproduct cycle\u2014the clockspeed 12\u2014which was once measured in decades, is now measured in years. A decade can now embrace several product cyclesin an industry such as electronics\u2014less so in the engineering, air trans- port, and chemicals industries. On the wings of globalization and technological change, the postindus- trial age has arrived in the middle-income urban centers of East Asia. 13 From T okyo to Bangkok, the high tide of traditional industrialism is grad- ually ebbing, as first manufacturing and then some services are beingenticed by lower costs to other locations, some in nearby edge cities, some in the deep hinterland, and some in the developing economies elsewhere in Asia. Many of the industries that remain in the major cities are sheddinglow-skill jobs and becoming more capital intensive. However, activities that register the highest rate of increase in employ- ment are disproportionately concentrated in the large urban centers. In the United States, for example, between 1992 and 2002, the largest increase inemployment was in professional and business services, followed by educa-tion and health services, information services, and leisure and hospitalityservices (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2004). This trend is expected to con-tinue until 2014, with education services leading the pack (Saunders 2005). T ypically, these jobs gravitated toward the major metropolitan areas. Simi- lar trends have surfaced in East Asia, although the degree of concentrationis significantly greater in Japan, where T okyo accounts for close to one-halfof all jobs in information, research, and advertising services. Even higherlevels of concentration are apparent in Seoul and in T aipei. With the increase in professional and information services, the geogra- phy of work in the metropolitan area is also changing. Close to 15 percentof the U.S. workers did a part of their primary job from home for a por-tion of the week, invariably with the aid of a computer and a phone. 14 Four-fifths of those working from home held managerial, professional, and sales jobs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2002, 2005). This pattern is lessprevalent in East Asia, but easier, more user-friendly electronic communi- cation, coupled with the desire to cut down on long commutes from6 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 12. The notion of an industrial and product clockspeed that reflects the intensity and velocity of change is discussed by Fine (1998). 13. Daniel Bell noted in The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism that industrial societies, which had long emphasized goods production, would soon have to adjust to a world in which services dominated economic activities (Bell 1976, 147-48). 14. This trend toward working at home goes hand in hand with the increase in part-time work.distant suburban homes, could very likely lead rapidly to polycentric ur- ban forms that are more efficient, albeit spatially more dispersed. Foremployers, this trend can be advantageous on two counts: (a) smaller in- vestment in downtown office space and (b) greater number of hours worked by employees, who spend less time stuck in traffic. 15 T ogether with the widening use of information and communication technology (ICT) and the restructuring of tasks to maximize the benefits, these trends lead to the emergence of the new industries\u2014and in some cases industrial clusters\u2014that are redefining the allocation of space in cities. They are also leading to a spatial consolidation of business servicesin the leading cities throughout the world. No major city in East Asia is prepared for the departure of manufactur- ing industry, which still is largely the basis of urban prosperity. Although soothing voices are heard forecasting a seamless transition to a new urbanservices economy even more dynamic than the industrial economy that itwould be displacing, cities that are confronting an industrial upheaval farearlier than they anticipated are in for a sea change in the structure of themetropolitan economy and the entire fabric of the urban society. Postindustrialism has many dimensions, each deserving close analysis. Within our urban frame of reference, we have singled out the economicdimension. Social, political, and other facets are equally important, but toencompass them adequately would take us far afield and would dilute ourselected focus. Our point of departure is the central attribute of postin-dustrialism: the relative diminution of manufacturing and the shift in thecomposition of the manufacturing activities that remain. It is this shift\u2014not the cessation of manufacturing altogether\u2014that initiates a fission ofchange that touches every grain of the urban system. Services of all kindsgradually take over as the principal producers and employers. Most man-ufacturing plants and their blue-collar workers are pushed to the marginsof the urban landscape, and in their place come businesses that supplyproducer services of all kinds, myriad retailers, and so-called creative in-dustries. 16The life of the postindustrial city and its inhabitants revolves mainly around the production, purchase, and consumption of services. Manufactured products remain ubiquitous. Most services require manu- factured inputs, such as computers, medical imaging, musical equipment, and telecommunication equipment, and a significant volume of skill- andEMERGING CITYSCAPES 7 15. Still Stuck in Traffic is the title of Downs's (2004) illuminating dissection of a worsening prob- lem in many cities. 16. Creative industries are generally ones whose products or services are covered by intellectual property laws.capital-intensive manufacturing continues to flourish in the city, often adjacent to centers of research. Nevertheless, the bulk of the urban grossdomestic product (GDP) originates in the services sector. In fact, up to one half of the value added in the average manufacturing firm generally comes from in-house or contracted services\u2014is directly or indirectlycreated by the inputs of services, whether in-house or purchased fromknowledge-intensive service providers or the creative industries. Some-thing as ordinary and inexpensive as a pair of jeans is now transformed by the alchemy of designers, marketing experts, public relations specialists,publishers, and others into a fashion statement. A hefty dose of creativedesign, advertising, and efficient logistics can make an ordinary article ofclothing into a high-fashion commodity commanding a global market. In the typical postindustrial city, manufacturing now accounts for a small fraction of the gross product and employment. Even as employmentis scaled back, hours worked in manufacturing are becoming more flexi-ble, because employers avoid hiring new workers and absorb business fluc-tuations by varying time on the job (Glosser and Golden 2005). We willargue later that even this remaining manufacturing activity is vital to thecity's economic health, but the retreat of industry as a producer and em-ployer is seemingly unstoppable. The implications are far reaching, espe-cially for cities with growing and relatively youthful populations. The turntoward postindustrialism can be traced to the changing shape of consumerdemands as incomes rise, to differential gains in productivity among in-dustries, to technological developments, to the declining relative prices ofmanufacturing, to forces that affect urban land use and land pricing, andto the extraordinary proliferation of global value chains that are part andparcel of industrial globalism. The wide diffusion of manufacturing capa- bilities and the organizational capacity to integrate suppliers from distantplaces into a seamless production network is a remarkable innovation thatis profoundly influencing industrial geography within and amongcountries. What does the postindustrial future hold for these cities? Which indus- tries will serve as the new economic axes and sustain income growth?What is the mix of skills, technologies, and institutions that will sustaingrowth momentum? What are the implications of globalization? And willthe state and its industrial and urban policies serve as the principal driver,or will market processes become the main determinants? Plausibleanswers that are grounded in the most informed empirical research inseveral branches of economics, together with numerous interviews in thecities concerned, provide the warp and weft for later chapters. In thischapter, we first need to unroll the postindustrial canvas that we will be8 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESworking on and sketch the picture with broad strokes. In the next chapter, we will paint in some of the details and introduce the reader to the citiesthat will populate our chosen urban landscape. DEMAND ELASTICITIES One of the most resilient stylized facts in economics is the high-incomeelasticity of demand for services. When incomes are low, householdsspend a high proportion of their earnings on food, housing, and clothing. As incomes rise, accompanied by an increase in the opportunities for leisure, the purchase of basic necessities gives way to larger expenditureson manufactured goods and services of all sorts (see figure 1.1). This trendpersists as people move into higher income brackets. It is a pattern ofEMERGING CITYSCAPES 9 Figure 1.1 Trends in Consumption Share, 1950-2004 ShanghaiBeijing Singapore Korea, Rep. of United StatesJapan Thailand0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2003 2002 2001 20041080 6070 50 40 30 20Consumption spent on food, housing, and clothing (%) Sources: China: China Urban Residents Household Income and Expenditure Investigation Materials , various issues, and China Price and Urban Residents Household Income and Expenditure Investigation Statistical Yearbook , various issues.

From figure 1.1, we can see how household spending in the United States went through an up-heaval over a 50-year period. In 1950, one-third of total expenditure was on food, followed by expenditures on housing and clothing. These three essential items absorbed more than half of total household consumption.By 2003, the share of these items had dwindled down to 30 percent, withthe share of food in the household budget dropping from 30 to 15 percentand of clothing from 12 to 5 percent. During the past five decades, the expenditure on medical services, personal business (mostly expendituresassociated with financial services), recreation, education, religion, andwelfare (including day-care services) has been on an upward trend, whilethe expenditure on household furnishings and transportation has been rel-atively stable. Spending on medical services has risen most steeply. This pattern was approximately replicated by Japanese households during 1950 to 2003, although Japanese consumers still spend one-fifth oftheir income on food. However, the consumption shares of food andclothing in total consumption are declining over time, and those of educa-tion, medical services, and recreation are on the rise. The Republic ofKorea is fast approaching the consumption patterns of the United Statesand Japan. Although spending on basic necessities remains high, the con-sumption pattern of China is likely to resemble that of other countries asincome increases. 17The signs of such convergence are already visible among the affluent younger generations of Chinese consumers, most of whom have a college education. The spending patterns of these consumers are similar to patterns seen in industrial countries (\"Golden Boys\" 2004).18 By and large, average household incomes in the leading East Asian cities are higher than in the rest of the country. They have also tended to risemore rapidly, and this steep increase in incomes within a little more than two decades, combined with economic openness, has dramatically trans- formed the structure of the urban economy. 10 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 17. An income of US$5,000 is considered to be the point where discretionary spending takes off. In 2004, 17 percent of urban households in China had an income above US$5,000, and this pro-portion is expected to rise to 90 percent by 2014 (\"Young Consumers\" 2005). Chinese consumersare also gaining similar protections seen in other countries through three laws strengtheningconsumer rights: the Consumer Protection Law, the Law against Unfair T rade, and the Adver-tising Law (Davis 2005). 18. Increasingly, the celebration of Christmas and other occasions as gift exchange opportunities is becoming popular among young, affluent Chinese, leading to a further shift in consumptionpatterns relative to previous generations (\"Ho, Ho, Hao\" 2003).PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH, INDUSTRIAL COMPOSITION, AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION Until recently, labor productivity and growth in manufacturing far ex- ceeded labor productivity and growth in services. As a result, demand formanufactured products can be met with a progressively smaller workforce. Less than 10 percent of total U.S. employment in 2004 was in manufac- turing industries (\"Industrial Metamorphosis\" 2005). The figure was14 percent in the United Kingdom and 18 percent in Japan, though stillover one-fifth in Germany and Italy. The growth of average nonfarm la-bor productivity in the United States between 1973 and 1995 was 1.3 per- cent, while that of services industries was 1 percent or less. Only after 1995did the productivity growth of the services industries and of the overalleconomy reach parity (T riplett and Bosworth 2003). In the past, the lagging productivity of the services industries relative to that of manufacturing was ascribed to lower capital intensity, a slower pace of technological and organizational innovation, and less exposure to com- petition, especially from international sources. Those factors are changingwith the adoption of ICT. Such technologies are beginning to impingestrongly on the productivity of the financial, wholesale, retail, and logisticsindustries. In the United States, these services industries, which are amongthe heaviest users of ICT, were able to improve their productivity dramat-ically since 1995 (T riplett and Bosworth 2003). 19 Services have benefited from a surge in innovation in areas such as fi- nancial trading, inventory management, and e-commerce.20By one esti- mate, two-thirds of the productivity growth in the United States since 1995 was mainly the result of organizational and other innovations in services industries such as retailing that use information technology, and Wal-Mart was a major driving force (McKinsey Global Institute 2001).Other estimates give greater weight to productivity gains in the ICT-intensive manufacturing industries (chapter 3; see also Indjikian and Siegel2005; OECD 2004a). ICT has rendered many previously nontradable services tradable and is helping to further unify not just national but alsoglobal labor markets (Freeman 2005). It has paved the way for the off-shoring of numerous activities, such as engineering, design, and softwaredevelopment, bringing skilled professionals in developing countries suchEMERGING CITYSCAPES 11 19. Seoul's traffic system uses a standardized smart card for fares, greatly contributing to the con- venience of commuters who need to use multiple modes of transportation (\"Smart Way\" 2005). 20. In Korea, 68 percent of stocks are traded online, and 12 percent of retail shopping is con- ducted over the Internet (Shameen 2004).as China and India into direct competition with their counterparts in the advanced economies.21 In parallel, since the 1990s, more and more businesses are pursuing vertical disintegration. When opportunity permits, firms are choosing toexternalize activities and are opting for a flatter organizational structure, with fewer layers and less overhead. ICT is facilitating the management of such dispersed production and is a driving force behind the global valuechains referred to above (Yusuf, Altaf, and Nabeshima 2004). This processenables a firm to prune its staff and to focus on the core activities in whichit has the greatest comparative advantage and from which it can reap the highest returns. 22Other activities are distributed among specialized providers. As Bryson, Daniels, and Warf observe (2004, 79), \"The firm is no longer a unitary organization but a network of organizations in which external economies of scale have replaced the internal economies of scale associated with the Fordist systems of mass production.\" Such vertical disintegration is leading to a finer social and economic di- vision that promotes flexible production technologies and is affecting thelocation of industries in higher-cost urban areas. The advances in ICT and the virtual agglomeration of services permit companies to work withproviders that are spread across the national economy and beyond, often inmany different time zones. Firms engaged in producing software or sup-plying Web services, for example, can sustain round-the-clock operationsby distributing their production activities among several centers, such as Bangalore, T el Aviv, Zurich, and San Francisco. Soon this list could include many other medium-size cities in Asia and throughout the world. The global networking facilitated by ICT favors larger companies that can more easily tap\u2014often at lower cost\u2014production and research skillsfrom around the world 23and can generally command the resources to fi- nance long-term research and development (R&D) and sustain an inter- national brand name. Small and medium-size enterprises rely far more on local resources, and theirs is frequently a local and in-house expertise. Such local knowledge can be an asset in promoting a product or service orin developing a new product. Thus, a local partner is often necessary for aforeign firm seeking to enter the Chinese market, though the preference12 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 21. This trend is quantified in \"Does IT Improve Performance\" (2005). 22. See also Roberts (2004, chapter 5) on the changing organization of the multinational corporation. 23. Carlsson (2006) and Foray (2006) have emphasized the globalization of research and the rel- ative advantages that multinational corporations have in sourcing research expertise from aroundthe world and using the most talented research teams.is for a medium-size or large firm. Small size is a handicap when it comes to reducing unit costs, selling to an international clientele, or building thecapacity to innovate within the firm 24or through outsourcing, because transaction costs and information asymmetries make it more difficult forthe firm to link up with universities or research institutes. There are signs of increasing concentrations in several industries\u2014including retailing, ac- counting, telephony, and electronics\u2014that could lead to a more bimodalindustrial distribution. 25 The major East Asian cities are acquiring strongly dualistic characteris- tics with expanding islands of highly competitive manufacturing indus- tries, coexisting with swaths of industry populated by firms of often suboptimal size and by sheltered inefficient services providers. The larger Asian companies have been slow to adopt a flatter organizational structureand to pursue vertical disintegration. The ICT-led productivity revolutionthat is sweeping through the industrial countries is beginning, but it is stillin the early stages. For instance, labor productivity in Korea's retail sector is only 32 percent of the U.S. level (Baily 1998). Much of the lagging pro-ductivity stems from the fact that 99 percent of retail stores in Korea in1998 were single-unit stores, not belonging to any chains. By contrast,80 percent of stores in the United States are department stores, specialtychain stores, and discounters (Baily 1998). 26 The definite trend already very visible in manufacturing is toward capital intensity, automation, computerization, rising skill coefficients, and outsourcing. Services providers in East Asia were able to resist the pressures because of low labor costs and limited competition, but in the megacities, change is stirring rapidly. T wo of the leading services indus-tries, retailing and finance, are both being transformed by advances incomputerization, digitization, automation, logistics, and communicationsthat were introduced by companies such as Wal-Mart, 27Carrefours,EMERGING CITYSCAPES 13 24. Most small firms do not introduce more than a single new product or service. 25. An analysis of innovativity in seven European countries based on firm-level information on innovative products confirms that larger firms are more innovative on a continuous basis\u2014withthe help of R&D\u2014and that process and product innovation can go hand in hand. Germany wasidentified in this study as the country with the largest share of innovative firms (Mohnen,Mairesse, and Dagenais 2006). 26. Even the productivity of a small number of department and specialty stores in Korea is only 60 percent of similar types of stores in the United States (Baily 1998). 27. Solow (2001) makes the point that the surge in productivity between 1995 and 2000 was the re- sult of management innovations made possible by advances in ICT, with Wal-Mart being the primeexample (\"Wal-Mart Effect\" 2002). The effect of Wal-Mart is also spreading around the world,with imitators springing up in Asia. In India, for example, a half-dozen Wal-Mart-style chains haveemerged, such as Big Bazaar, Westside, Shoppers Stop, and Spencers (\"Here Comes\" 2005).GE Capital, and Citicorp. These industries are substantially reducing the number of workers required while raising the productivity of the ones whoremain, are transferring jobs to other low-wage locations, and are slowly ratcheting up the cognitive content and skill intensity of the work that remains. 28 These developments are spilling over into neighboring subsectors, such as health, which is likely to undergo its own revolution through the interaction of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, information technology (IT), engineering, materials and electronic technologies. In addition to improving the quality of health care, such developments will drasticallyreduce hospital stay while increasing the roles of telecare and telemedicineand will begin to trim administrative costs, especially those arising frombilling, recordkeeping, and sharing of patient records. In the United States, these costs account for 31 cents of every dollar spent on medicalcare (\"Digital Hospital\" 2005; \"No-Computer Virus\" 2005; \"SmootherOperation\" 2005). What will these developments do to the industrial economy of the East Asian city? Labor-intensive light manufacturing will exit the megacities. This exit does not mean that manufacturing is on its way out, but that the viable manufacturing industries will be capital-, skill-, and technology-intensive ones. One offshoot will be a diminution in the number of high-ly paid blue-collar jobs. If those jobs are replaced by more productive onesin new creative industries and services, and if the number of new jobs risesstrongly, the future for the postindustrial city is bright. 29 But the \"if\" is a troublesome reminder of uncertainty. An early glimpse of what might be in store for other cities that are slow to diversify their in- dustrial base as traditional industries fade is provided by Hong Kong (China) which has experienced a sharp dip in the share of manufacturing in GDP from 25 percent in 1985 to 7 percent in 2003. Consequently, de-spite of the growth of services, income distribution in Hong Kong (China)has deteriorated steadily since the early 1970s, with the cumulative shareof the bottom 60 percent of households falling and the top 10 percent en- joying a substantial increase (Zhao, Chan, and Sit 2003). 30Chiu and Lui14 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 28. Gordon (2004b) attributes much of the productivity surge in the United States to ICT-using industries such as retailing and financial services. 29. In the U.S. context, it has often been noted that several cities have, after an interval, exploited the space created by the exodus of industry to launch urban development schemes, which attracthigh-income households, as in SoHo in New York and LoDo in Denver (Siegel 2002). 30. See also Sassen (2001, 2002) on factors contributing to increasing inequality in other major cities.(2004, 1875) trace the \"widening income disparity in Hong Kong to the structural changes brought about by its transformation towards a globalcity. De-industrialization and the rise of [services] supporting these changes all contributed to the worsening income inequality.\" The risk of growth that is not jobless but that generates relatively few new jobs and heavily favors the highly skilled is present throughout East Asia, even in China (Friedmann 2005, 127). 31The disquieting trends in employment elasticities for China are evident from table 1.4. Since 1998-2003, the employment elasticity for manufacturing has been nega- tive. It is also negative, but less so, for secondary industry as a whole. Most striking is the sharp decline in the jobs being created by the tertiary sectorper unit of growth. The elasticity, which was a healthy 0.636 during 1986to 1990 had dropped to 0.270 in 1998 to 2003 (World Bank 2005). For thepostindustrial East Asian cities\u2014and for that matter any major city in the industrial world\u2014the need to refresh and expand the industrial base isurgent and increasing. T echnology, globalization, and the increasinglyfootloose behavior of industries and of multinational corporations havemade it imperative for cities to anticipate continuums of change. In thosecircumstances, it is becoming hazardous to assume that market forces will smoothly orchestrate structural changes across the competing urban cen- ters and, on balance, engineer positive-sum outcomes. The more plausibleEMERGING CITYSCAPES 15 Table 1.4 Employment Elasticity of Output in Sources : Primary, secondary, and tertiary employment data are derived from the employment section of various issues of A Statistical Survey of China . Manufacturing employment data are derived from tables on the number of staff and workers in industry in various issues of the China Statistical Yearbook (National Bureau of Statistics of China various years), except for 1981 data, which are calculated from the employment section of the China Statistical Yearbook . 31. The widening difference between contracted and actually used foreign direct investment sig- nifies the lack of a pool of skilled workers needed by foreign producers; over 80 percent of somehigh-tech products are produced by foreign-invested enterprises (\"China: Labour Market\"2004). One consequence is that the wages of these hotly sought after jobs in multinational cor-porations are rising 6 to 10 percent a year when the overall inflation rate is only 2 percent. How-ever, even with attractive pay and benefits, the turnover rates of Chinese professionals are about11 percent (\"China's People Problem\" 2005).inference is that the economic integration and fluidity of movement introduced by globalization have made it more urgent for metropolitancenters to be closely tracking industrial changes, scrutinizing the actions of their competitors, and planning their own moves well in advance. Postindustrial cities now need their strategies. TECHNOLOGY AT THE ROOT The swelling demand for services and the growth of industrial productivi- ty has many causes, and this chapter is not the place to elaborate on thosecauses. What we want to emphasize is (a) that the key determinant of both trends is technology and (b) that technology can bring jobs to urban areas as well as take them elsewhere. Advances in technology\u2014especially in IT\u2014have enormously expanded the menu of services that are available to us andhave created entirely new wants. Some of those wants now border on ne-cessities. Many new services\u2014for instance, in the field of communications and in the realm of entertainment\u2014are tightly interlaced with manufac-tured products such as the now ubiquitous mobile phones, so that urban-ites consume \"bundled\" goods and services. The purveyors of those bun-dles, such as NTT DoCoMo in Japan or Apple, are finding that the profitsaccrue more from the innovative services component than from the equally innovative hardware. 32For example, 36 percent of Japanese users of the Internet through mobile phones accessed for-fee contents. The most com- monly purchased items were ring tones (84 percent), images for wallpaper (43 percent), music (22 percent), and games (20 percent). Each transaction typically cost less than \u00a5500, with yearly spending per user averaging\u00a52,658 (Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs Posts, andT elecommunications 2003). 33Even in the United States, where mobile phones are used more sparingly for purposes other than as phones, 63 per- cent of mobile phone users ages between 18 and 27 now send text messages using their mobile phones (\"Study: 'T exting'\" 2005).34China's more than 416 million mobile phone users already sent 132 billion text messages in16 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 32. Nearly 44 million mobile phones were sold in Japan in 2004. (\"Japanese Mobile Phone\" 2005). 33. Although trailing in popularity behind ring tones and music downloads, reading books on cell phones is catching on in China, Japan, and Korea (\"Mobile Page T urner\" 2005). 34. The use of \"texting\" is highly correlated with age. Only 31 percent of mobile phone users between 28 and 39 years old send any text messages, and those over 60 years old rarely send any(\"Study: 'T exting'\" 2005).the first four months of 2006 (Zhao 2006). The race is intensifying, not only to introduce innovations in hardware but also to multiply the range ofservices offered by tapping latent wants or creating entirely new ones. Starting with the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom more than two centuries ago, the story of industry is inextricable from that of technology. T echnology has continually introduced new products throughepochal innovations such as the steam engine, electricity, the internal com-bustion engine, synthetic fibers, the integrated circuit, robotics, and the Internet, each of which brought huge waves of change in industrial process-es extending over decades. The full effects of the integrated circuit and theInternet have yet to be felt, and those of biotechnology are still over thehorizon; however, the early experience with the diffusion of ICT is that itis accelerating the pace of creative destruction (Chun and others 2004). Three types of process innovations are particularly relevant for our story. First are those that have displaced human labor by harnessing othersources of energy\u2014mainly hydrocarbon-based energy. Water, electricity,and the internal combustion engine fall into this category. Second are theinnovations that have substituted capital equipment and primitive formsof artificial intelligence for human operators. Such innovations range fromforklifts to various kinds of industrial robots, 35to computerized monitor- ing equipment, to diagnostic programs, to speech recognition software. Third, and most recently, are the enormous gains in logistics and commu- nication technology that are enabling companies to change the geography of manufacturing by exploiting the diminution of distance to substitutecheaper labor in the hinterland of the country or in other nations forhigher-paid urban workers. Those technological steps have also resultedin an increase in the ratio of skilled workers in the total industrial labor force, although this increase is by no means a steady or uniform trend.Some of the most advanced process technologies in the consumerelectronics and auto industries continue to employ large numbers of semi-skilled or unskilled workers, who perform narrowly defined, repetitive,and specialized tasks on vast assembly lines. But on balance, process tech- nologies are becoming more human capital intensive. Manufacturing firms are coming to recognize and capitalize on the complementarities among manufactured products and services. Leading firms such as IBM continue to produce mainframe computers and inte-grated circuits (31 percent of IBM's turnover is from hardware), but nowEMERGING CITYSCAPES 17 35. Japan is the leading user of industrial robots, with an installed base of 348,734 units (UNECE 2004).the bulk of their profits are derived from IT, software, and related man- agement services (\"Business's Digital Black Cloud\" 2005). General Elec-tric, a leading producer of locomotives, now markets haulage services to railway companies rather than selling its engines. Some companies, such as Sun Microsystems and Nike, do not directly engage in production at allbut focus on design, R&D, system integration, marketing, and after-salessupport. Ford and General Motors are active in financial services and in-surance, businesses that dovetail with their mainstream operations. Sony, Samsung, and Nokia are all seeking to enlarge the entertainment marketand the services that they provide through their hardware. Hardware canbe quickly commodified, but entertainment offers a larger stream of rents.Schindler, one of the leading producers of elevators, anticipates that by theend of the decade only 10 percent of its workforce will be in manufactur- ing; the rest will be providing services. In the automobile business, design is increasingly critical. The role of BMW's much expanded design teamhas been frequently noted. \"Rather than engineers being fully responsiblefor the design of cars, designers, market researchers, and marketing ex-perts are instructing engineers in what they should design\" (Bryson,Daniels, and Warf 2004, 57). In a buyers' market with low entry barriers,\"[m]aybe the most important producer services directly involved in prod-uct innovation are design companies. . . . The use of design had improvedproducts and service quality, improved image, and increased turnover andprofitability\" (Bryson, Daniels, and Warf 2004, 68). 36 The activities that have displaced manufacturing in the central areas of the city are labor- and often skill-intensive. Their productivity and innov- ativeness depends on the exchange of ideas and tacit knowledge, often through face-to-face contact, which is facilitated by clustering in the cen- tral areas of a city, as observed by Leamer and Storper (2001). Producerservices\u2014for instance, financial and legal ones\u2014fall into this category, asdo the creative industries such as publishing, multimedia, design, andentertainment. Silicon Alley arose from such a grouping of business18 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 36. Whether it is apparel or flat panel televisions or cell phones or cars, the hotly contested glob- al marketplace is making design a key to competitiveness. Successful firms such as BMW areable to strike a balance between art and commerce that leaves them profitable but also distin-guishes them as a premium brand in the eyes of consumers by virtue of a unique style that shinesthrough every finely crafted product (Bangle 2001, 47). Not only does the design help raise thesales of the product, it also helps recruit promising workers. BMW is ranked as the top choice ofemployer by U.S. undergraduates. Apple, which has been missing from this list for a long time,made it back to the top 15 employers after the introduction of the iPod (\"In Search of the IdealEmployer\" 2005).services in New York City (Indergaard 2004), and the future of robotics development in T okyo depends on a network of researchers and produc-ers clustered in two contiguous prefectures. Indergaard (2004, 5) observes, Silicon Alley was the latest round in the long struggle to reinvent New York as a postindustrial city\u2014a process that elite property interests began to pro-mote while factories still dominated Lower Manhattan. In fact, large-scaledeindustrialization of Lower Manhattan over the last four decades was notonly the result of changes within industrial sectors, but also the product of commercial redevelopment (and related rises in real estate prices) that dis-lodged manufacturers. Consequently, New York, like many cities, has be-come increasingly dependent on cultural industries and producer servicesthat produce or manipulate symbols. Indergaard (2004, 8) continues, The commercial idea behind Silicon Alley was that the core problem (and opportunity) for Internet business was not developing technology per se,but creating and distributing new modes of expression that use Internettechnology. The Internet economy was said to be a new media and commu-nications business where the main avenue for creating value was developing creative business applications. The germinating of these clusters and their physical embedding in Lower Manhattan was the work of venture capitalists, a few major corpo- rations, and key real estate developers. According to Indergaard (2004, 7), \"These early industry-builders focused on creating spaces\u2014social as well as physical\u2014wherein connections could be woven between the web pio-neers and various business interests.\" He describes the venture capitalistsas \"architects of change who brought together the new media entrepre-neurs and Manhattan monied classes\" (60). Meanwhile, the real estate developers saw in Silicon Alley a means of filling \"empty office buildings in the Financial District, where vacancy rates exceeded 20 percent in the early 1990s. . . . This strategy was all themore attractive when the new media was becoming identified as the firstnew industry to form in the city in half a century. Their provision of sub- sidized wired space in fourteen buildings played a major role in causing some seven hundred tech firms to settle Downtown (Indergaard 2004, 7).Moreover, the \"cultural mobilization of new media districts complement-ed the financial mobilization. The districts not only produced visions ofepic forces, but also artifacts attesting to the material reality of a new kindof firm: loft workplaces, a distinctive social scene, and employees withquirky looks and attitudes\" (Indergaard 2004, 59).EMERGING CITYSCAPES 19As the Silicon Alley experience illustrates, suppliers of producer servic- es rely heavily on the expertise and reputations of professionals. From law firms, investment banks, and venture capitalists to providers of account- ing, consulting, publishing, multimedia, and advertising services, all depend on the knowledge, skills, contacts, and standing of theirstaffs. Hence, in an urban economy dominated by services, highly skilledprofessionals\u2014especially ones that have accumulated a measure of reputa-tional capital\u2014are coming to play an increasingly decisive role. This so- called creative class is becoming the hinge of the new urban economy(Florida 2002). Such professionals are among the more mobile\u2014both ge-ographically and occupationally\u2014and also the more demanding con-sumers of urban services and amenities. A high proportion of \"creativeworkers\" are concentrated in the large metropolitan areas that are rich in amenities and that provide access to housing and social services that are of good quality and are attractively priced. 37The most vibrant cities tend to attract these creative workers not just from the surrounding countries, but from around the world (see figure 1.2).38Where a concentration of skilled workers can be sustained and augmented from local world-class universi-ties, cities can experience economic resilience and virtuous industrial spi- rals. The skill-driven recovery of Boston's economy described by Glaeser (2005a) is one example. People with higher education are more likely tostart up a new company and, on balance, will hire more skilled workers,thereby strengthening the human capital resource base of the urban area(Colombo, Delmastro, and Grilli 2004). Jane Jacobs saw early how diversity was the motor of great American cities. She described how the mixing of talents and the upward spiral can continue indefinitely. In the Jacobs schema, economies derive from theway in which \"people with specialties can further dynamic improvementsif they jostle together with people of other specialties within a company. Or companies with specialties jostle together with other companies with- in a versatile city. But when a whole city specializes and trades with otherspecialized cities, then that locked-in pattern of static efficiency is a recipefor stasis and long term decline\" (Ellerman 2005, 64-65).20 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 37. T erry Nichols Clark (2004) lists a number of \"natural\" and \"constructed\" amenities that con- tribute to the attractiveness of a city. The former includes water area, temperate summer, andtopographic variation. The latter includes operas, research libraries, and coffee bars. 38. The mosaic index measures the diversity of the immigrant population. Using this metric, East Asian cities do not fare well, highlighting the fact that most of the foreign population comesfrom only a handful of countries. Patterns of land use guided by land prices in urban areas are reinforcing the push exerted by technologies on industries. All cities are subject to rent gradients, with prices declining with distance from city centers, which encompass the choicest pieces of real estate and are the focus of activities commanding the highest prices.39A hundred years ago, the leading cities in the West were thickly populated with manufacturing industry, and the remnants of this once strong army can still be found in Shanghai, Beijing, Bangkok, and Seoul. But rising urban land prices, competition from other uses for valuable downtown real estate, and new zoning regulations thatwere introduced by municipal authorities to capitalize on higher potentialland values and to improve the physical environment in CITYSCAPES 21 1.5 1.0 0.5 0 /H110020.5 Source: Benton-Short, Price, and Friedman 2004. Note: The mosaic index measures the diversity of the immigrant population. The larger the number, the more diverse the immigrant population is. 39. This pattern can be made worse by deliberate policy actions. For instance, only 0.2 percent of available land in Korea is designated as a commercial zone, forcing a concentration of popu-lation in Seoul (Baily 1998).areas have combined to push industries that do not depend on the central city location to the suburbs and beyond. The preferred one-floor layoutfor modern factories, which requires more space, and the importance of efficient logistics for just-in-time delivery and distribution of products also are pulling industry to places where land is plentiful and wheremultimodal transport services are readily available. As infrastructure im-proves, options are multiplying\u2014and they span the globe. The displacement and migration of manufacturing industries, the spreading of services, and the emergence of activities rooted in new tech- nologies and wants occurred at a leisurely pace throughout much of thefirst 70 years of the 20th century. But this pace turned into a gallop start-ing in the 1980s. ICT\u2014in particular the Internet\u2014and the associatedglobalization have had a big hand in this acceleration. In a matter of years, major cities in the higher-income countries completed their transition to postindustrialism, and newly industrializing countries that are still severaldecades behind the industrial leaders are finding this model difficult toresist. We believe that the accelerating trend toward postindustrial urbansocieties in East Asia has derived additional impetus from two develop-ments that compound the influence of technological change: (a) the dis-solving of trade barriers and (b) decentralizing tendencies that are shiftingthe weight of policy-making responsibility to urban centers, therebygiving them more autonomy to chart their development paths. CITIES IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE Globalization is creating an international environment that is integrating at many levels, primarily through the major cities.40It is forcing urban economies to seek efficiency gains and to recognize that industrial geog-raphy is fluid and changeable, because many technologies are codified and diffusing quickly and the labor market no longer stops at the boundaries of a region or a nation. Cities are also having to move gingerly toward envi-ronments that promote innovativeness through openness to talented peo-ple and to fresh ideas. There is no tested formula, although Florida (2002)has put forward an intriguing recipe that highlights the importance of teaching and research institutions, of diversity, of recreational and cultural22 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 40. The latest round of integration, which accelerated in the 1980s, parallels an earlier round that occurred roughly three decades before World War I. The ongoing globalization is pro-ceeding much further, and the effect on urban areas is greater (Nayyar 2006; A. T aylor 2006).amenities, of urban infrastructure and services, and of location.41 These are plausible building blocks that attempt to identify the DNA of the New Yorks, San Franciscos, Austins, Bostons, and Seattles of the world. The fastest-growing cities in the United States have other attributes as well\u2014 good and affordable housing, high-quality schooling, health and other ur-ban services, low crime, and first-rate IT and transport facilities, alongwith low levels of environmental pollution. 42Globalization has served to highlight, if not actually give rise to, a pecking order of world cities, re- gional cities, and lower-tier cities that are distinguished by a number of characteristics. It has stirred an arms race among East Asian cities that see a higher-order status\u2014and a brand name\u2014as the means of attracting thenext generation of industries to ensure continuing prosperity. The partial unraveling of the centralized state has led to other develop- ments: greater reliance on market signals, but also a deconcentration of administrative and fiscal authority (World Bank 1999). The responsibilityfor making policy is becoming multilevel in China as much as in theUnited States. Increasingly, it is the city mayor who joins forces with cen-tral and often provincial governments and makes policy to cope withexternalities and missing markets, to provide public goods, to promote in- dustrial change, and to boost employment. Some megacities have acquired more latitude to manage their affairs, but they and the central governmentalso confront the need to take developmental initiatives with longer-runimplications. The successful ones are gaining better access to additionalresources from foreign direct investment, fiscal effort, bond financing,and private participation, to finance local development. 43At the same time, they are having to worry about their standing in the global financial marketplace.EMERGING CITYSCAPES 23 41. One such city is Austin, T exas, which offers an equable climate, numerous outdoor activities, universities, and the cultural amenities sought by creative workers (\"Why Everyone LovesAustin\" 2005). 42. In a recent survey, Minneapolis was identified as the leader among principal postindustrial high-technology urban centers in the United States, with reference to a number of indicatorsranging from the number of technology-intensive companies, to intelligent transport solutions,to Energy Star buildings (\"T echnopolis Found\" 2005). 43. In China, fiscal decentralization is occurring grudgingly and haphazardly, with the result that resource assignments are frequently insufficient to cover the newly inherited expenditures andthat subnational governments struggle to balance their books, often using extrabudgetarysources. Chinese cities are faced with fiscal adjustment to align long-term expenditure responsi-bilities with revenues (Dabla-Norris 2004; World Bank 2002). The vast array of policyinstruments mobilized by state governments in the United States to attract or retain industry aredescribed and analyzed by Jenkins, Leicht, and Wendt (2006).Thus, the factors leading to globalization and the associated flows of trade and of resources have spurred a parallel \"localization\" (World Bank 1999). Willy-nilly, leading East Asian cities are entering the uncertain seas of postindustrialism with few reliable charts to navigate by. Many subna- tional governments are having to build the administrative capacity, thefinancial management skills, and the institutions of governance to effi-ciently manage the transition. However, they are learning quickly, helpedby a tradition of industrial policy making. For them, the demands of the new world of postindustrialization call for an adaptation of policy makingto deal with new global exigencies and for implementation at metropoli-tan levels and with respect to a changed mix of industrial activities. THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME? It is rash to make confident predictions, because social upheavals, unfore- seen technological developments, and regional or global political crises, ashave happened too frequently in the 20th century, can stall or reverse trends or can send the postindustrial world down unanticipated tangents. 44 However, barring such events, the postindustrial metropolis in East Asia\u2014 or for that matter anywhere in the world\u2014will be drawing its economiclifeblood from a blend of activities in which manufacturing will retain a key role, though admittedly a minor one in terms of sheer scale. Other ac- tivities are on track to enlarge their roles, including services of all kinds,which are constantly adjusting to the changing demographics and workrhythms of cities. Very likely, these services will be exposed to the fullforce of technological advance, and some of the most venerable and labor- intensive ones, such as health, education, retail, and logistics, will experi-ence substantial gains in productivity, thereby freeing workers for otherjobs, assuming that such jobs materialize. The implications for urban labormarkets, in particular, are immense. The postindustrial labor market inEast Asia's megacities will need to contend with pressures from two directions. First, in most of these cities, the workforce will be growing\u2014through natural increase, lengthening life expectancies, further entry of women into the labor force, and in-migration. The influx of workers fromelsewhere, especially of the skilled and entrepreneurial ones, will be an24 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 44. Four plausible technological cum social scenarios for the global society are sketched by Glen and Gordon (2004).important source of energy and creativity.45T wo or three decades from now, such demographic change will taper as a consequence of much re- duced fertility in recent years, but that is already a longtime horizon. In Japan, the male population began declining in 2004,46and China's popula- tion, which reached 1.3 billion in 2005, will soon begin to stabilize, though the urban share of the population will continue to grow in China and in much of East Asia. Second, these cities will be fully exposed to the economic pressures arising from national and global integration. Labor-displacing and in- creasingly skill-intensive technologies will eat away at most routine, cleri-cal, and repetitive jobs with limited cognitive content. Broad swaths of blue- and white-collar jobs are certain to be nudged to extinction by IT.No doubt new ones will spring up in their place. T echnologies that destroysome jobs can create others, but often these jobs are very different and re-quire other skills not readily acquired by laid-off, middle-age workers. Forinstance, no one knows how the millions of retail workers released by the labor-displacing \"Wal-Mart effect\" will be absorbed. East Asia may con- tinue to benefit from the export of work from higher-income countries,but it is difficult to be sure. Very likely, leisure time will grow. The number of hours worked has de- clined in Japan and Korea following a trend that surfaced in the industrialcountries some time ago. The tilting relationship between work and recre-ation can be illustrated by a few statistics from selected countries. For anurban worker in the United States, the average workweek stretched tomore than 70 hours in 1830. By 2002, it was down to 41 hours\u2014the normin many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentcountries by 1970\u2014while weekly earnings had risen by a factor of nine.Similarly, the average housewife, who would put in four hours per day ofhousework in 1929, now will do less than two hours (Greenwood andVandenbroucke 2005). The average American male engaged in 61 hours of market and nonmarket work each week in 1965. The average womanspent 54 hours working. By 2003, men worked eight hours fewer per week,and women six hours fewer, resulting in an increase in leisure time of 11 toEMERGING CITYSCAPES 25 45. Hall (2000) associates the creativity of cities such as London with their openness to young migrants from all over the world. It is also worth noting that the economic development ofShanghai over a hundred years, starting in the mid-19th century, is directly attributable to theinflux of entrepreneurial migrants. 46. Japan is not alone. Europe's demographic circumstances are very similar, and Korea is fast approaching this stage (Lowe-Lee 2003; \"Population Ageing\" 2005).13 percent (Aguiar and Hurst 2006).47A similar downward trend has been evident across the world. Hours worked have fallen by 11 percent since 1991 in Japan, by 10 percent in France, and by 5 percent in Korea (\"Real Reasons\" 2005). Rising incomes and fewer hours of work have led to a par- allel rise in expenditures on recreation, from 3 percent of personal con-sumption in the United States in 1900 to 8.5 percent in 2001 (Greenwoodand Vandenbroucke 2005). In many industrial countries, the share of part-time workers is increasing. In Japan, more than 25 percent of workers are part-time workers (\"Part-Time Workers\" 2005). More leisure time allowspeople to acquire and pursue many new interests, which induce the growthof existing urban industries and spawn entirely new ones as well. 48 Perhaps the most striking increase in leisure time is occurring in the transition economies\u2014in particular, China. The average urban resident had just 2 hours and 21 minutes of leisure per day in 1980. T en years lat- er, leisure time had doubled, but more importantly, leisure time was now under the control of the individual and not the work unit ( danwei ). A sig- nificant share of this time was initially spent watching television; however,Friedmann (2005, 79-80) observes that the Chinese urbanite is learningfast. There are now \"thousands of hobby associations from stamp collect- ing to breeding fish . . . and crickets. Millions of readers eagerly snap upthe skyrocketing number of publications. And wave after wave of newenthusiasms [have] swept across China, such as qigong fever, tourism 26 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 47. This conventional view has been challenged by Ramey and Francis (2006), who maintain that per capita leisure time in the United States was unchanged between 1900 and 2000\u2014it was6,657 hours per year a century ago and is 6,634 hours in the early 21st century. They computeleisure time by subtracting market work, schoolwork, commuting to work, and housework.They include personal care time in leisure and view the time spent sleeping as a matter of choice.The increase in schoolwork is the variable that biases their results downward. 48. One corollary to the rising productivity of tertiary industries is the spread of self-service ac- tivities, which eat into the leisure time of consumers. Activities ranging from retailing to travelare transferring more and more of the work to the consumer, whether this work is checking outand bagging groceries or searching for deals and making travel arrangements. Some of thistransfer of responsibilities to the consumer and the household that is being expedited by ICTand the Internet is leading to better informed consumers and buyers of insurance, medical care,autos, and financial instruments. Information is flowing more freely than ever before, and theconsumer and investor (potentially, at least) has the upper hand. But without a doubt, the divi-sion of labor between service providers and users is shifting, and in the process, many urban jobsare likely to vanish. Down the road, this change has implications for the health sector through-out East Asia, as the population ages. Unless international migration augments the supply ofhealth workers or technological advances reduce the need for nursing and other services, care-giving by family members\u2014mainly women\u2014will make large claims on time (Huws 2003).fever, keeping fit fever, and dressmaking fever, as people [have] indulged their new freedom.\" With more time, money, and household space,Chinese households can also indulge their long-suppressed urge to shop. In the cramped, Spartan, and frugal living conditions of the early 1980s, per capita living space was a bare 8 square meters; by 2005, it had risen to 25 square meters (Wang 2003, National Bureau of Statistics of China2005). Be that as it may, the most vital concerns for postindustrial East Asian cities are the industries to sustain their hitherto headlong income growth, the nature of the jobs that such industries may provide, and thekinds of skills that workers will require. Urban training institutions andjob machines backed by ICT that improve the level of skills and the ef-ficiency of the labor market by matching workers with appropriate job openings would help ensure rising living standards and social stability (Freeman 2002; Lindsay 2005). Job machines\u2014even high-tech ones\u2014that generate meager employment could be the start of wideninginequalities and the immiserization of the majority. 49The resilient and dynamic city is more likely to be a city richly supplied with skills (Glaeser and Saiz 2003). In his study describing a century of change in a midsize American city, Douglas Rae (2003, 7) observes, Capitalism drives growth by remorselessly refusing to preserve the past. . . . No place\u2014city, suburb, hamlet, or farmstead\u2014is secure against the emer-gence of a new economic geography that drains vital populations and in-vestments in the space of a few decades. In seeking ever fresh forms ofproduction, ever larger markets, ever higher returns on investment, capital- ism routinely destroys older technologies, older plants\u2014and in so doing,profoundly transforms the communities that have formed around them. Rae goes on to describe how New Haven, Connecticut, an important American city in the 1920s, has spiraled into decrepitude and seeminglyirremediable urban blight because it failed to replace industrial activities that faded away. While analyzing what is in store for East Asia's major cities, we intend to emphasize the creative rather than the destructive side of industrial change. Whether East Asian cities are able to nurture a generation ofEMERGING CITYSCAPES 27 49. Growing inequality of incomes in China, in Japan, and even in Hong Kong (China) is a source of growing concern, because such inequality will undermine not just welfare but alsosocial and political stability. industries that interlace high-tech manufacturing with knowledge- intensive services will determine how these cities fare. Industries such asbiotechnology, IT, multimedia, robotics, and fashion are among the prom- ising candidates that we examine in the book. This new phase of industri- alization leads into uncharted territory. The challenge for the megacitiesis to augment and realize their dynamic comparative advantages. By doingso, they will generate growth, vitally needed jobs, and momentum for theentire economy.28 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESOutside of Japan, only a small handful of cities are\u2014or will shortly be\u2014entering the postindustrial stage. The small num-ber of these cities, however, belies their importance. T en years ago, naming a single one would have been difficult. In the early 1990s, as noted in chapter 1, East Asian development was still focused on building manufacturing capability in a few strategically located urban areas.Now, some light manufacturing and resource-based industries are begin-ning to leave the major cities, and the economic spotlight is turning toward more advanced manufacturing and, in particular, toward services. Becausethe transition is in its early phase, postindustrial cities in East Asia consti-tute a hierarchy. At the apex stands T okyo, in certain respects an atypicalpostindustrial metropolis, followed by Singapore, Bangkok, Seoul, Beijing,and Shanghai. These cities are the dramatis personae of our story, and hence, each needs to be introduced and its inclusion in the postindustrial hierarchy explained. TOKYO T okyo clearly leads this field. It is a world city more populous than New York and London, the only true comparators, and larger in economicscale. Also, T okyo, with a gross domestic product (GDP) equal to almost one-fifth of Japan's total national product, is the locus for Japan's vast banking industry and deep capital markets, though it lacks the globalheft of New York and London in equity and foreign exchange trading. 1 Unlike London and New York, however, T okyo offers a more powerfulCHAPTER 2 MEGACITY PROFILES 1. T okyo's specialization is principally in the trading of bonds.lens for viewing the evolution and prospects of postindustrial cities in East Asia. The recent trajectory of those cities resembles that of T okyo in the1970s and 1980s, which has retained a sizable manufacturing sector in the outlying prefectures even as services have increased their share of the ur- ban production in the core areas. T okyo's origins lie in a castle town called Edo, established by the Uesu- gi family in the mid-15th century. During the 17th century, T okugawaIeyasu completed the unification of Japan begun by Oda Nobunaga and T oyotomi Hideyoshi and made Edo the seat of his shogunate, althoughKyoto\u2014where the emperor lived\u2014remained the capital. Under thelong-running T okugawa dynasty, Japan's political as well as the economiccenter of gravity shifted toward Edo. At the start of the Meiji era in 1868,the new emperor formally moved the capital to Edo and renamed it T okyo, or Eastern Capital. T okyo was transformed into Japan's leading industrial city. Despite the massive destruction wreaked by air raids during World War II, T okyo recovered within a decade because enough of its humancapital and social infrastructure survived and, amazingly, the industrialgeography of Japan remained unchanged, a phenomenon that has beenrecently documented by Davis and Weinstein (2002). 2Interestingly, the urban geography of T okyo also did not change much. The city of Edo was divided into two parts: the Yamanote, or high city, which spread out across the Kanto plateau, contained the homes of the daimyo and an assortment of temples, while the nearby and much more crowded Shitamachi, or low city, was where the commoners lived. The streets of Edo formed an inter-locking maze around Edo castle, which made it difficult for invaders tofind their way to the city center. The twisted tangle of streets and alleys was re-created when T okyo was reconstructed in the 1940s and 1950s.The streets still curved and meandered, and they lacked names and a log-ical system of numbering to identify homes (Richie 1992, 55). By the late 1950s, a broad base of manufacturing industries had reemerged that asserted Japan's position in the international trading system and accounted for more than one-third of the GDP of the T okyo30 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 2. Similarly, when plague struck London in 1665 to 1666, nearly a quarter to a third of the pop- ulation was struck down. But despite extraordinary rates of mortality, urban craft and manufac-turing industries continued to function even as the ranks of workers and businesspeople weregravely thinned out. When the plague was over, recovery was rapid (see Moote and Moote2004). Likewise, the 9/11 attack on New York did not lead to the initially feared exit of firms,although some have dispersed their operations so as to minimize the disruption that any futureattacks could cause (\"After the Fall\" 2005). metropolitan area, which embraced some five contiguous prefectures sur- rounding T okyo. The share of industry peaked in the early 1970s and sincethen has been on the decline under the pressure of forces described in chapter 1. This slide accelerated from the latter half of the 1980s, when the appreciation of the yen that resulted from the Plaza Accord among theGroup of Eight (G-8) countries and skyrocketing real estate prices in theT okyo area led to a progressive transfer of manufacturing plants to otherparts of Japan and to Southeast Asia. 3 Nearly 20 years later, the population of T okyo continues expanding, mainly by absorbing migrants from other parts of Japan. This population growth is contributing to the economic growth of the urban region, as is the accumulation of human capital. T okyo's economy also gains from the increasing scale of the metropolitan market, the synergy among the mul-tiple nodes of a polycentric urban structure, and the advantages bestowedby industrial diversity. 4T okyo has all the lineaments of the postindustrial city that is distinctively East Asian and arguably serves as a reliable guide to what other cities in the region could experience. Manufacturing indus- try in the central districts of T okyo now produces just 10 percent of GDP , compared with over 20 percent in the early 1990s, whereas services ac-count for over three-fourths and utilities for the balance. In the greaterT okyo area, the share of manufacturing was 13 percent in 2002. Thesebroad aggregates are but a small numerical tip of a complex, many-layered iceberg with a fascinating past. Japan's economic performance continuesto depend on a small number of highly competitive automotive, engi-neering, metallurgical, and electronics subsectors. The extraordinaryproductivity and innovativeness of those industries have more thancounterbalanced the weaker performance of other subsectors, and for the foreseeable future, export-led manufacturing will remain Japan's principal sectoral source of growth. This fact draws attention to T okyo's role inJapan's industrial system, highlighting the interaction between city andindustry and pointing to one of the principal vulnerabilities of the Japanese economy. The competitiveness of Japan's leading manufacturingMEGACITY PROFILES 31 3. The grouping of some Japanese firms into keiretsu may have accelerated the pace at which in- dustry transferred out because suppliers tended to follow the lead firms abroad (see, for instance, Blonigen, Ellis, and Fausten 2005). 4. On market size and productivity, see Davis and Weinstein (2001). They estimate that the pro- ductivity gains can be as much as 3.5 percent from a doubling in area. On the scope for synergyin polycentric urban regions, see Meijers (2005). The advantages of diversity were empiricallydemonstrated by Glaeser and others (1992) and since then has also been shown by other re-searchers. See Rosenthal and Strange (2004) for a review of this literature.32 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES industries, which are largely centered on T okyo, underpins Japan's eco- nomic prowess; were the efficiency and innovativeness of those industriesto falter, Japan would be plunged into severe difficulties. This industrial system consists of five complementary components. First and foremost are the leading multinational corporations (MNCs) themselves, their own production facilities, those of their main suppliers,their headquarters, and their research labs. 5T okyo has a commanding lead over other cities in terms of the concentration of large firms. More than a third are located in T okyo, compared with a little over one-tenth in Osaka, the second-largest concentration (Bureau of Industrial and Labor Affairs 2005). A multitude of subcontractors and smaller businesses is the supporting cast\u2014the second component. Some are linked closely to one or a fewMNCs; others sell directly to consumers and households in the urban marketplace. The longstanding competitiveness of the leading Japanesefirms derives in no small part from their relations with subcontractors thatwork closely with the industrial corporations to research, design, andproduce components (Smitka 1991). These groupings of firms, calledkeiretsu, are widely seen as a cornerstone of Japan's industrial strength. T okyo's suburban ward of Ota-ku, 6for example, is home to 6,000 manu- facturing firms specializing in machinery and metal working. These firms serve as subcontractors to larger firms (Fujita and Hill 2005). Orders that individual contractors cannot fill are farmed out to neighboring firms. This strategy has resulted in a cross-hatching of vertical (from the largerfirms) and horizontal (among subcontractors themselves) subcontractingarrangements. Many of the small factories in Ota-ku were established byentrepreneurs during the 1960s when the Japanese economy was taking off. Of all the new start-ups between 1960 and 1985, 90 percent were inthe machine tools sector. Ota-ku is the only place in Japan where the entireprocess of making an industrial machine can be done in one area. Many ofthese establishments specialize in few processes in which they excel, 5. Also, T okyo is where the majority of foreign firms prefer to locate. About 60 percent of the offices of foreign firms are in the T okyo area (Bureau of Industrial and Labor Affairs 2005). 6. Ota-ku is a rather small ward, with a land area of only 54 square kilometers, about one-fortieth of T okyo's total area. During the Edo period, the area specialized in agricultural products andfishing supplies. Only in the 1920s and 1930s did manufacturing industry start to take root inOta-ku. This development can be traced to the expansion of manufacturing activities outwardfrom other areas in T okyo and Yokohama and the rapid increase in military procurement.Although much of Ota-ku was destroyed during the Allied bombing of T okyo, the factories wererebuilt during the special procurement for the Korean War and with the reclamation of T okyoBay to isolate often-polluting factories from the residential districts (Whittaker 1997).MEGACITY PROFILES 33 although they do take orders that may be outside of their expertise to broaden their capabilities and to supplement their own line of business(Whittaker 1997). The urban labor market is a third building block. T okyo's market is vast and richly supplied with skills, which makes it hugely attractive for busi- ness firms, especially in the high-tech and creative industries. This marketin turn is fed from the natural growth of the population and by immigrantsfrom other parts of Japan plus a small number from abroad. The skills the workers bring with them depend on a host of teaching institutions andtraining received on the job. 7Many of Japan's leading public and private universities are located in T okyo, and aside from their critical role in edu- cating the workforce, these institutions are a source of innovation and technology transfer through their research, their consulting, and the informal contacts between faculties and business entities (Jiang andHarayama 2005; F . Kodama and Suzuki 2005; T. Kodama 2005). 8As Japanese industry becomes more capital and technology intensive, the quality and variety of skills available through the urban labor market are becoming an important determinant of how industrial capability evolves, how reliably it supports industrial competitiveness across a spectrum ofactivities, and how economically resilient the T okyo region remains. 9 The fourth component comprises the several levels of government\u2014 central, prefectural, and municipal\u2014whose regulatory hand grasps, or at least grazes, most major and many minor elements of the urban economy. No doubt the regulatory hand is less obtrusive than in the past, but the reach of government regulation remains pervasive and the influence ofpolicy and of institutions is palpable at the macro level and often extendsall the way to the most micro passageways of business. 10Government policy strongly influences both urban development and industrial change in the T okyo region. The fifth and final component is the buying public itself. The front rank of consumers of the products and services produced by T okyo's 7. In Japan, with its long tradition of tenured employment for the core labor force of the larger firms, the main source of firm-specific skills is on-the-job training and formal training by thefirm, which expects to retain most of its workers. 8. University-industry linkages are discussed in more detail by Jiang and Harayama (2005) and F . Kodama and Suzuki (2005). 9. Glaeser (2005a) attributes the recovery of Boston's economy in the 1980s and the performance since then to the supply of skills from local universities and the stock of skilled workers in the area. 10. The regulatory guiding hand has acquired a lighter touch since the late 1980s, but the Japanese state still extensively governs the market and guides economic activity (see Carlile andTilton 2005; Lincoln 2001).34 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES businesses are well-to-do and discriminating buyers with a keen eye for novelty, quality, and design. Even firms that market their products globallyand perhaps sell the bulk of what they manufacture abroad still find that a product's reception in the domestic market can be a good indicator of wider success. Moreover, the 28 million-strong consumers in the T okyo metro-politan area not only provide a highly lucrative market but also are a sourceof valuable customer feedback that enables companies to modify, improve,or simply weed out new product offerings. In addition, these consumers lend the impetus for customizing of products that is opening not only newopportunities for mass customization but also incentives for cultivatingniche tastes that can prove far more financially rewarding if pursuedthrough effective e-marketing. By putting these five elements together, wecan view the dynamics of the T okyo economy and see where postindustri- alism is leading. Having a foothold of some kind in T okyo is advantageous for business firms, especially the larger ones. This factor explains why so many corpo- rations have located their headquarters in T okyo and why they continuetrickling in from other major cities, such as Osaka and Kyoto. Firms mightwant to place their headquarters in T okyo for many reasons. T okyo is theprincipal metropolitan market and clearly the trendsetter for the rest ofthe country. Frequent formal as well as informal contacts with the centralgovernment's regulatory agencies are viewed as desirable and beneficial byboth the business community and officialdom. Proximity to public agen-cies reduces transaction costs. T okyo is also at a crossroads for the globaleconomy. For firms that are thinking strategically and looking beyond theconfines of the Japanese market, T okyo is the appropriate internationalgateway. Although company head offices have gravitated to T okyo to be near key government agencies and knowledge-intensive business services, as well as to benefit from the readier availability of qualified personnel, their pres-ence contributes to the knowledge intensity of the urban economy. Themodern MNC is a highly complex organism that places heavy demands onthe head office to gather, process, and disseminate information with refer-ence to an overall strategy. In fulfilling all those functions, head offices area major force in the urban system that feed off information streaming infrom local and international sources while injecting high-value informa-tion of their own into the system. They also have the budgets and author-ity to sustain numerous well-paid jobs. 11 11. See Jakobsen and Onsager's (2005) analysis of the head offices of Norwegian companies.MEGACITY PROFILES 35 As more and more firms locate their headquarters in T okyo, the pres- sure on others to join them has intensified. It is not just a matter of image. Proximity facilitates face-to-face communication, both casual and formal, as well as decision making. Socializing after hours and a regular round of golf with a business partner or competitor cement business and personalrelationships. T o a greater degree than in the West, the restaurant and thegolf course are an integral part of the space in which business is consum-mated. Furthermore, the agglomeration of headquarters draws in its wake numerous other service providers, creating clusters that deliver gains inefficiency for the users and positive spillovers for the participating firms.Firms providing marketing, advertising, and legal and accounting servicesall have tended to colocate with the major MNCs. T okyo's water trade ( mizushobai ) is rightly famous. This subculture of entertainment emerged in the 18th century, when Edo, as T okyo was thencalled, was Japan's military capital and home to thousands of samurai andtheir retainers. 12Kabuki theater flourished, as did other common and exotic forms of revelry (Screech 1999). The water trade covers a vast archipelago of bars, eateries, cabarets, and clubs in Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Roppongi\u2014 ranging from the tiny to the cavernous\u2014and in its recesses are multiple echoes from the past. \"In the bustle and color of a few water trade quartersin T okyo,\" writes Morley (1985, 189), \"one could still for a brief momentenjoy the illusion of standing on a street in Edo.\" Through its multiple sur-faces and enduring underlying codes, the water trade has enabled a vital current of T okyo's life to maintain \"constancy despite change, permanencedespite vicissitudes of individual fate\" (Morley 1985, 190). For all these rea-sons, T okyo continues to exert a pull on companies despite the higher con-gestion and overhead costs of locating there. Agglomeration of corporate research facilities has paralleled the coales- cence of headquarters. The presence in the T okyo metropolitan area ofmany of Japan's leading universities and research institutes has only re-inforced the incentives for companies that depend on innovation to remaincompetitive. 13The T okyo area has a comparative advantage in research that feeds into the export of services as well as of technology-intensive 12. The concentration of daimyo and their retainers in Edo was mandated from 1622 onward under the sankinkotai (alternate attendance system). This system required the daimyo to keep their families in Edo as hostages and to come to Edo in alternate years to pay homage to theshogun ( Jansen 2000). On the Edo of the 17th and 18th centuries, see Nou\u00ebt (1990). 13. Seventeen percent of universities (both public and private) are located in T okyo, as are one- fourth of undergraduate students, 26 percent of graduate students, and 27 percent of faculties(MEXT 2004).goods.14With research, the gains from proximity to leading institutes and universities are, if anything, greater. Institutes and universities are a source of talent and, in many instances, serve as the crucibles within which im- portant basic research is conducted. Moreover, highly skilled knowledge workers are drawn to the open, cosmopolitan, and culturally rich environ-ment that T okyo provides\u2014the same environment that is conduciveto making informal contacts and transacting business. For these reasons,many of Japan's technology-intensive companies have preferred to keep some of their leading research facilities in the metropolitan area, and theyhave been joined by other companies in search of deep labor markets forscientific and engineering skills. Although much of the applied researchwith commercial potential is conducted in corporate research labs, univer-sities are the training grounds for researchers and are active on the fron- tiers of key research fields. Furthermore, university professors provide consulting services and serve as the nodes for informal research networks,mentoring the work of their former students, coauthoring papers withcorporate researchers, and serving as gatekeepers for the filtering and cir-culation of knowledge (F . Kodama and Suzuki 2005). It is becoming evident that, even though the Internet has dramatically telescoped distance, the latest scientific knowledge has an important tacitdimension. It diffuses slowly and then mainly through word of mouthamong members of close-knit and highly specialized communities ofknowledge workers who are in frequent contact with one another throughconferences and informal meetings. 15 Other advantages accrue from concentrating research activities in the T okyo area. They derive from the multifaceted nature of the most signifi- cant technological advances. Whether it is in automobiles, consumer elec- tronics, medical devices and implants, or food processing, innovation more often than not entails a coordinated step forward straddling several36 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 14. See Kiyota (2005) on the research context of Japan's trade in services. 15. A number of studies have explicitly looked at the distance that knowledge travels through dif- ferent channels. A study by James Adams (2002) finds that knowledge transfers from universitiestend to be concentrated within 200 miles. However, the distance of technology transfer seems tobe affected by both the quality of university research and the size and sophistication of researchand development activities of firms. The larger and more sophisticated research and developmentfacilities tend to cooperate with universities farther away, and they are willing to tap universitieseven though these institutions might be located 900 miles away or more on average. A study inthe Netherlands shows a much shorter distance of 40 kilometers for technology transfer fromuniversities (van der Panne 2005), and for Poland, a study shows only 25 kilometers for theknowledge spillovers from foreign direct investment (Halpern and Murakozy 2005). When tech-nology diffusion is viewed as a global phenomenon, the half-life distance is about 1,200 kilo-meters (Keller 2002). MEGACITY PROFILES 37 disciplines. Electronics and software are embedded in many automobile components and, in fact, account for close to one-third of the value of asedan. Among the most profitable technological advances are navigation systems, in which Japanese companies have a lead. 16Implants such as heart pacemakers and insulin pumps combine the expertise of medical special- ists with that of engineers and scientists working on materials and elec- tronics. Being able to tap such diverse fields of scientific knowledge and production experience, which no single corporation or research center caneasily marshal, is a great advantage. In the T okyo metropolitan area, locat-ing the technical skills to fulfill myriad requirements is relatively easy, as isfinding firms that are able to design, produce prototypes, and manufacture an extraordinarily wide variety of components and complete products.The environment is ideal for routinized innovation because so many morenew ideas can be realized in a tangible form, tinkered with, tested, refined,and then marketed to T okyo's affluent consumers and dynamic firms. As a marketplace, T okyo has distinctive attributes that distinguish it from other Japanese cities. First are the sheer size and the average level ofhousehold income. On both counts, T okyo definitely holds the edge, andyear by year since the 1970s, the margin in T okyo's favor has widened.Second, T okyo has for more than a century \"combined East and West,past and present\" with style and verve, which has sharpened the sophisti-cation of consumers (Richie 1992, 68). Beyond that, T okyo's consumers are unusually willing to push the boundaries of fashion, to expand the range of wants by seizing on a prod-uct, and to initiate the buzz that starts a trend or launches a new fad. Forclothing, accessories, and electronic consumer products, T okyo is themecca for shoppers looking for the latest fashions and technologies and,by the same token, for producers waiting to try out their latest offering.Harajuku, Shibuya, and Aoyama are where T okyo's young and well-heeledconsumers congregate, sample the newest fashions in clothing and acces- sories, and pass judgment. For instance, Shibuya station, where six differ-ent train lines meet, caters to 2.2 million passengers per day and has morethan 900 retail stores within the train station itself, with close to 600restaurants and bars just outside the train station (Fujita and Hill 2005). 17 16. The demand for car navigation systems in Japan is high, especially in T okyo because the city contains many winding and curved roads without any logical naming system. It is quite differentfrom cities in the United States or Beijing that are laid out the form of a grid. 17. Most of T okyo's 23 districts blossomed around these major rail and metro stations. By generating traffic, the intersection of several lines triggered retail, commercial, and residentialdevelopment. Shinjuku station is the busiest station in Japan with 3.5 million people using thestation every day (http://www.city.shinjuku.tokyo.jp/about/about_tokei.html).38 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES T en percent of all electronics sales and a rising volume of sales of video games and software in Japan occur in Akihabara, which has come to beknown as \"Electric T own.\" 18The strength of this district lies in its wide product offerings, ranging from the newest finished product to the small-est parts imaginable, such as transistors and even vacuum tubes (Fujita and Hill 2005). Until 1995, more than 50 percent of all personal computers sold in Japan were through Akihabara. This sprawling electronics bazaaris where a vast array of products and components jostle for attention andwhere the pioneering shoppers\u2014the ones who are willing to experimentwith new products and to pay premium prices\u2014play a decisive role. Producers need these intensively competitive and demanding markets thatgive them rapid and valuable feedback. Akihabara, for example, is a vitalpart of the innovation system for electronic products, such as digital cam-eras and now video games, which are the lifeblood of the Japanese elec-tronics industry. The success of many innovations can be traced to the interaction be- tween producers and customers that leads to the refinement of a product orsubstantial modification to suit latent or engendered wants. The so-calledantennae markets of T okyo provide firms with intelligence on which prod-ucts are likely to succeed and what modifications could further improve theprospects of a commodity or a service. Japanese culture, the fads propagatedby Japanese teenagers congregating along T akeshita Street in Harajukuand Omote-Sando Avenue in Aoyama, 19and the choices of electronics aficionados now have a global appeal, so T okyo is an important site for the initial \"soft launch\" and the debugging of a product. By colocating head- quarters, research, production, and marketing in the T okyo area, a com- pany can stimulate innovation and accelerate the commercialization of themore promising products that emerge from the research labs. If an itemcommands a broad following in T okyo, it can be aimed at other markets. The prolonged stagnation of the Japanese economy during the 1990s\u2014 the lost decade\u2014has led to a hollowing out of industry and has raised questions about T okyo's future. Can this complex system be sustained asother cities, particularly in China, broaden their appeal; as the Chineseeconomy pulls abreast of and overtakes Japan's; as more and more Japanesecompanies shift their production to other parts of East Asia; and as the 18. Akihabara is also becoming a \"ghetto for geeks.\" The otaku , or nerds, have begun congre- gating there in even larger numbers looking for role-playing games, Japanese animation, and manga comics (\"In T okyo\" 2005). 19. Harajuku became associated with avant-garde fashion following the 1964 Olympics inT okyo.MEGACITY PROFILES 39 composition of T okyo's population tilts toward older age groups? The an- swer depends on the dynamism of certain established industries, such asrobotics and animation, which are sensing opportunities but must move quickly to grasp them. Little doubt exists that T okyo must be prepared for a long spell of creative destruction. Continuing global dominance byT okyo's existing industries requires combining innovativeness with con-tinuous refining of manufacturing capability in core areas, inspired design,and the honing of marketing skills. Firms such as Sony, Canon, Matsushita, Fanuc, and others are struggling to find a viable mix of those ingredientsand the lean organizational form to support it. Not all of the current sta-ble of industries will survive; to fill the gaps left by the ones that exit, ex-isting business will need to expand, and new industries will need to arise.They will define T okyo's economic future. SINGAPORE In the 14th century, the kingdom of Majaphit occupied the island of T emasek and renamed it Singapore (from the Malaysian terms for lioncity). This island remained a vassal of the kingdom of Malacca until early in the 16th century, after which it dwindled into a meeting place for pirates and other human flotsam or orang laut (sea people) (Rowe 2005). Sir Stamford Raffles, the former governor of Java and Sumatra, endedand reversed Singapore's downslide when he seized on its strategicimportance to establish a British trading station in January 1819. He anticipated that the station's location would have a high payoff. Raffleswas right. By 1869, the opening of the Suez Canal dramatically com-pressed the duration of voyages to Europe while the spread of tin miningand the plantation-based production of rubber in Singapore's immediatehinterland led to the rapid growth of trade in those two staples. As traffic through Singapore's port expanded, it pulled in other entrep\u00f4t trade from around the region, and the island became a magnet to immigrants, mainlyfrom China but also from India. According to a European observer,Singapore in 1879 had the \"air of a Chinese town with a foreign settle-ment\" (Huff 1994, 25). A half-century later, Singapore was home to thelargest concentration of overseas Chinese. Their energy and commercialskills multiplied Singapore's network of trading links with other parts of theregion and consolidated its role as Southeast Asia's leading entrep\u00f4t. When the British withdrew from their colonial possessions in the Malayan peninsula in 1959, they placed Singapore, which had alreadybeen separated from Malaya in 1946, on the road to its present status by40 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES incorporating it as the self-governing state of Singapore. Four years later, on September 16, 1963, the city-state became part of the Federation ofMalaysia, following prolonged behind-the-scenes negotiations involving T unku Abdul Rahman, the Malaysian premier; the British colonial office, which had earlier formulated a \"grand design\" for the region; Lee KuanYew, the young leader of the fledgling state; and the leaders of Sarawak,North Borneo, and Brunei Darussalam (K. Lee 2000). This marriage soondissolved; however, it and the political currents buffeting Singapore's relations with Malaysia exerted a significant formative influence on thepolitical economy of the city. T oday, Singapore, in its own tropical air-conditioned way, is as neat and orderly as T okyo. The city-state self-consciously pursues creative destruc-tion with the government at the forefront of the process, but unlike T okyo, Singapore has fewer industrial options, and creative dynamism is an objective that has remained tantalizingly beyond the reach of its techno-cratic policies. Still, Singapore's brief economic history is little short ofspectacular, and unlike other cities in East Asia, the city-state is planningcarefully for the postindustrial future. In just 40 years, Singapore hasemerged as one of the world's most affluent countries, with a per capitaGDP of US$25,000. By comparison, when the island-state separated fromthe Federation of Malaysia in 1965, average incomes were a meagerUS$2,675 (constant 2000 U.S. dollars), and with an adult literacy rate ofabout 50 percent, the newly independent nation appeared to have fewprospects (C. Chang 1976). Perceiving the enormity of the challenge, LeeKuan Yew initially despaired, but then under his leadership, the People'sAction Party moved quickly to improve the human resources and exploitthe locational advantages of Singapore. By dint of inventive and forward- looking economic policies and a single-minded commitment to economicprogress, the Singapore government invested heavily in education, de-vised schemes to maximize the level of individual savings by expanding theCentral Provident Fund, 20modernized transport and urban infrastructure, offered attractive fiscal incentives, and made an all-out bid to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) that would create jobs and transfer tech- nology. Faced with few competitors in the early 1970s, Singapore found that its recipe succeeded beyond all expectations. Political stability and thegovernment's commitment to export-led growth based on manufacturingindustry brought in foreign companies seeking production platforms in 20. Those schemes required compulsory monthly contributions by each employee and employer (S. Lee 1976).MEGACITY PROFILES 41 Southeast Asia. Singapore's tax benefits, increasingly efficient port facili- ties, and location in the Straits of Malacca further compounded theadvantages of what became a literate, disciplined, English-speaking workforce. 21 By efficiently implementing education and training policies that aug- mented the supply of skills, by carefully carpentering the institutions of a market economy, by investing strategically in logistics infrastructure\u2014the software as well as the hardware\u2014to keep pace with emerging technolo- gies, and by implementing a multitude of actions aimed at improving thebusiness climate, Singapore's economic managers induced real GDP togrow by an average rate of 8 percent between 1970 and 1990. By then,Singapore's economic credentials, prosperity, and reputation as a leading business center in East Asia were firmly established. Moreover, starting inthe latter half of the 1980s, Singapore had begun leveraging its expandingbase of skills\u2014local and imported\u2014to diversify into products and servicesin which the domestic value added was higher, by implementing measuresto raise labor costs and by aggressively seeking FDI in high-tech industry. Manufacture of fashion garments displaced that of cheaper textiles, and the research, design, manufacture, and testing of parts for hard disk drives(of which Singapore was the world's largest producer in 2005) as well as ofaudio components began edging out the assembly of televisions and smallconsumer electronic products (McKendrick, Doner, and Haggard 2000).Singapore-based builders began specializing in oil rigs, of which theisland-state is now the largest producer, and petroleum refining expanded,pushing Singapore to third place in the international lineup (\"Singapore:Reform Needed\" 2005). Singapore also began developing a market for fi-nancial and other producer services, following in the footsteps of HongKong (China). Such diversification, directed by the government's indus-trial and technology policies, has allowed Singapore to maintain its growthmomentum through the early years of the 21st century, with only a briefhiatus in the immediate aftermath of the East Asian crisis of 1997-98. Nearly 40 years after its precarious beginnings, Singapore has an urbaneconomic system that is among the most competitive in the SoutheastAsian region. 21. The port facility was inherited from the colonial era, when Singapore served as the hub of the regional entrep\u00f4t trade and was a major base for the British fleet. The British defense um-brella was finally withdrawn in 1971. T oday, the port of Singapore is considered one of the mostefficient, if not the most efficient, and it is subject to lowest political risk in the Southeast Asianregion (T sai and Su 2005).42 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Singapore is not a megacity or a world city,22but it is certainly one of the leading global cities. Singapore has a fraction of the population of a Jakarta or a Bangkok or a Shanghai, but its GDP greatly exceeds those of the first two and still is ahead of Shanghai's. Singapore illustrates how an industrial strategy pursued single-mindedly by a strong state with anhonest and skillful bureaucracy can achieve remarkable results when com-plemented by economic openness and an unusually dynamic regionalenvironment. As manufacturing industry begins fleeing Singapore, how- ever, the limits of the earlier strategy are becoming more evident, as arethe constraints on Singapore's future growth. Singapore's locational advantages are being whittled down by four changes, although it was the world's second busiest container port in 2005after Hong Kong (China), with a throughput of 23 million 20-foot equiv- alent units (TEUs) (\"How Hong Kong Stays King\" 2006). First, compet- ing ports and airports have emerged in nearby Malaysia that are almostequal in efficiency and that offer lower prices. T anjung Pelepas, just a hun-dred miles to the north, quotes loading and unloading rates for containersthat are two-thirds of those charged by Singapore's port authority. 23Sec- ond, dramatic improvements in the efficiency of container ports and air- ports, some of them spearheaded by Singapore, have reduced the share of logistics cost in the prices of final goods; hence further reductions in han- dling and facilitation charges confer less advantage. Third, East Asia's eco-nomic center of gravity has shifted northward, partly because of China'sascendance and partly because Singapore is deriving less of a boost fromthe two largest economies in the neighborhood and facing sterner compe- tition from Malaysia. Indonesia has lost some of its economic luster and isgrowing more slowly. The economy of the Philippines, while continuingto drift forward, has never been\u2014and shows no signs of becoming\u2014adriving force in the region. Thus, Singapore's immediate hinterland is lesssupportive to the development of the city-state than it used to be in terms of demand for services and manufactures. Down the road, India could be- come a thriving market, but by the same token, as we discuss in chapter 4,Indian industries and cities will also compete against Singapore. 22. Singapore is highly connected to other cities and is positioned as a regional command cen- ter with sufficient financial service presence (P . T aylor and others 2002). 23. For instance, two leading shipping firms, Evergreen and Maersk, have shifted their opera- tions to the port of T anjung Pelepas from Singapore, a move that worried the Singaporeanauthorities, who were concerned about Singapore's future as a leading port city (T an and Phang2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 43 Fourth and finally, tight management of the economy and society suc- ceeded all too well in curbing population growth and any vestiges of un- ruly social behavior and provided stable employment for the majority of workers. The price of this success is a nearly static and aging population that is notoriously risk averse. Singapore needs entrepreneurs with a nosefor innovative products and the knack for thriving in the global market-place. Singapore needs researchers who will challenge \"normal\" scienceand associate Singapore's name with creative products. Instead, it has a superabundance of able technocrats with lofty ambitions and disciplinedmanagers who, in a civilized environment, have achieved remarkableresults. State-of-the-art services and urban infrastructure have served Singapore well. Combined with an efficient regulatory environment and low taxes, they have been a big draw for businesses seeking an attractive urban locale for their regional headquarters. T ourists, mainly from nearbyAsian countries, are enticed by Singapore's orderliness, but only for a briefstay\u201460 percent stay for two days or less. By maintaining standards ofservices and continuously modernizing the infrastructure, Singapore couldhold onto the headquarters business and the tourist trade. 24Yet other cities are catching up fast, offering health and education services of nearly equiv- alent quality at lower prices and a relatively crime-free environment, all of which attract corporate headquarters. Cities such as Bangkok and Shanghai also provide a far more vibrant urban milieu, a business culturethat encourages greater initiative, and a bustling economic hinterland. Singapore's openness to trade is increasingly being matched by its com- petitors as multilateral and regional free trade agreements dismantle bar- riers in Asia. Other cities have made less progress, however, in paringtransaction costs for businesses. In this respect, Singapore retains a lead,which it is attempting to widen by introducing procedures that make iteasier to harness user-friendly e-government. In fact, the quality of gover-nance remains one of Singapore's most enduring attractions, which, for many foreign corporations, partially offsets the higher cost of operating in the city-state. Singapore's own leaders and many observers believe that Singapore's future depends on the quality and innovativeness of the workforce. All ofthe factors noted previously will contribute, even though Singapore nolonger enjoys a commanding lead in transport infrastructure or in the 24. With the legalization of gambling casinos, Singapore hopes to enlarge its clientele of visitors and induce them to stay longer.44 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES degree of openness or with respect to the social environment. India is overtaking Singapore in certain services and Internet sales; even CreativeT echnology, Singapore's own world-renowned producer of sound cards, is moving production to China. Human capital, however, is what will tip the scale in favor of continuing robust economic performance. Although muchof its workforce is likely to be homegrown, Singapore probably cannotavoid becoming more reliant on foreign talent. This human capital willdrive technological change and productivity in new industries such as biotechnology. Because of Singapore's size and the nature of its hinterland,the future of the city-state rests with industries that do not depend on scaleeconomies to be profitable and on niche activities that leverage technolo-gy and design. Unlike T okyo, Singapore does not have the springboard ofan innovation system anchored in world-class corporations or a many- faceted manufacturing capability. Singapore has cultivated efficiency to good effect; now it must complement that efficiency with innovativenessthat results in sustained commercial success. BANGKOK Where Singapore is compact, gleaming, and meticulously regulated, Bangkok, a thousand miles to the north, is sprawling, congested, untidy,and more laissez-faire. Bangkok's modern face began to emerge only in the latter part of the 20th century. It was a village in the 16th century, which was designated the capital in 1782. 25Late in the 19th century, Bangkok was a small administrative and trading center crisscrossed by canals.26Sampans and ox carts were the principal modes of conveyance. Although Bangkok was a cosmopolitan city with a large Chinese andSoutheast Asian population and significant commercial links with other parts of East Asia (Askew 2002), expatriates compared it unfavorably to Singapore as well as Hong Kong and Shanghai in China. By the middle of the 20th century, Bangkok's population was in the re- gion of 1 million, but topographically the city had changed little from thecompact, horizontal, luxuriantly tropical place of 50 years earlier, with the canal system and floating markets still largely intact. Since then, motor-ization and the associated construction of roads have erased this feature of 25. The name Bangkok denotes the water hamlet of the wild plum tree (Askew 2002). 26. The ubiquitous canals, which owe their existence to state and local initiative, assisted com- merce, irrigation, and transport of troops for defense (Askew 2002).MEGACITY PROFILES 45 the city and have permitted the emergence of a sprawling suburbanized structure that urban planners anticipated in the 1960s and sought tominimize. More recently, elevated expressways have tightened the grip of the automobile, worsened air pollution, and further subtracted from the remaining charm of the downtown areas\u2014even though only 6 to 7 per-cent of the Bangkok metropolitan area (BMA) is devoted to roads andparking and a costly mass transit system is now in operation. 27A few small lush islands from the past remain, but the green and graceful city in old pictures is no more. As Van Beek (1999, 120) observes, \"The city skyline has changed dramatically, with sacred spires dwarfed by secular towers of commerce. Look east from the Golden Mount across the rooftops of theold city and see a jagged mountain range of skyscrapers, a transformationreflecting a philosophical shift in values.\" Ever since export-oriented industrialization commenced in the mid- 1980s, the BMA, aside from being Thailand's administrative center, has become the nation's economic heartland. Bangkok's somewhat chaoticgrowth over the past three decades amply reflects the dramatic industrial-ization of the Thai economy and the relatively localized ambit of industri-al change in Thailand. Close to a third of Thailand's GDP is produced in the BMA and to a large extent consumed by Thailand's affluent middle class, which has congregated in the city. Much of the FDI that has flowedinto the automotive sector (particularly in the Eastern Seaboard Industri-al Estate) (D. Webster 2004) and electronic firms (in Ayutthaya) to pro-duce components is concentrated in the corridor extending from Bangkokto the Eastern Seaboard. But change is in the air. Efforts by the government to disperse indus- try, coupled with congestion in the BMA, are inducing firms to move tothe fringes of the Bangkok metropolitan region (BMR) and beyond.However, the advantages of industrial agglomeration are such that firmsoften choose to remain and many that relocate do not go far. Bangkokalso gains from the abundance of social and cultural amenities that haveaccumulated over the years and reinforced the city's distinctiveness. Noother urban center in Thailand comes close, and the gap is not narrowing. In line with trends elsewhere in East Asia, where the major cities are theprincipal destinations of foreign investment, Bangkok's amenities, as well 27. The BMA is nested within the much larger Bangkok metro region (with an area of 1,569 square kilometers), which consists of the BMA and five adjacent provinces: NakonPathom, D. Webster 2004).46 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES as its cultural openness and excellent air transport links with the rest of the world,28have attracted FDI to the BMR together with more than 800,000 expatriate workers. These flows contribute to the clustering ofindustrial activity because suppliers of components and services follow the foreign investors (as, for example, in the case of the Japanese auto in- dustry), creating a snowball effect that then pulls in other investment\u2014private as well as public\u2014in infrastructure and supporting services. 29 The BMR has a high concentration of manufacturing industry; in the periurban areas of the BMA, 63 percent of the gross product is derived from manufacturing.30Much of it is medium- or low-technology industry. In the higher-tech, export industries, the domestic value added is typicallylow. For instance, Bangkok has not challenged Singapore in the research, prototyping, and testing of hard drives, and it is facing tough competition from China in the production and assembly of the latest generation ofelectronic products. If future prosperity depends on adding greater valuein manufacturing and services, Bangkok's innovation system is clearly notyet in a position to deliver results. The BMA 's longer-term industrial prospects are much less clear if man- ufacturing activities relocate to the neighboring provinces. Moreover, the limited evidence available suggests that the economic space created bytheir departure may not be filled on a sufficient scale by high-value addingproducer services as has happened in some other megacities in East Asia. For example, the financial, accounting, and legal services providers are ex- panding to meet the needs of local industry, but Bangkok is a long wayfrom becoming a regional provider of business services and will face severecompetition from Singapore and Hong Kong (China), which also have ahead start in enhancing the English-language skills of the workforce andin attracting multinational service providers. However, Bangkok doescompete with Singapore and Hong Kong (China) in the aviation, media,and advertising industries that have flocked to Bangkok and account formuch of the growth of the commercial sector's considerable success in thisarea (Muller 2005). Although tertiary-level education and technical insti-tutions have multiplied, the level and quality of skills imparted still lag. 28. By 2005, Bangkok was the principal air transport hub in Southeast Asia, having edged out Singapore. 29. See T akayasu and Mori (2004) on Japanese FDI in the Thai auto industry and the pattern of such contracting. 30. For the BMR as a whole, manufacturing accounted for 27 percent of GDP in 1990 (Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund 1996).MEGACITY PROFILES 47 Economic change in Bangkok might follow a different path with the formation of a number of industrial and services clusters catering to multiple, relatively narrow niches of several regional or global markets, the so-called long-tail markets (Anderson 2006). Among the industries that could buttress Bangkok's future economic performance, four deservespecial attention, because together they could differentiate the city fromothers in the region and keep alive its economic momentum. Production of natural fiber-based luxury garments is a traditional in- dustry that could grow on a substantial scale. The beginnings of such an industry already exist, grounded in Thai silk weaving, but a luxury goodsindustry requires, aside from the quality of materials, distinctive designsand branding. Developing local design capacity is a necessary first step.Initially design could be outsourced, but for the luxury garments and ac- cessories industries to take root in Bangkok, the skills need to be deep- ened. Local designers need to work closely with craftspeople and weaversto produce items with a strong global or regional appeal. A fruitful inter-play of locally sourced materials, local skills, and design could be the basisfor Thai luxury brands that are able to command premium prices in inter-national markets. The Jim Thompson brand, with its chain of stores,although American owned, is a step toward creating a niche for Thai ma-terials and garments, but Thompson has yet to acquire significant namerecognition much beyond Thailand and its immediate neighbors, unlikethe French and Italian brands. The opportunity is now at hand for Thaiproducers to create and market products with a broad appeal that endures.The international luxury brands are already putting their bets on thename-brand-conscious shoppers, who are multiplying in East Asia. LikeMilan in Italy, Bangkok could aim at becoming a center of that industry and the focus of intersecting clusters that produce materials as well assome specialized manufacturing equipment in close coordination with de-signers and a global marketing industry. Jewelry is a related industry that is centered on Bangkok. It has a long history and origins in the mining of gemstones in Thailand as well as someof the neighboring countries. 31Over time, Thailand has acquired skills in the heat treating of gemstones; sorting, cutting, and marketing of stones; metal fabrication; and design that is unique to the region. As with the jew- elry business in other cities, such as New York, Antwerp, T el Aviv, and Mumbai, jewelry firms are family owned; the business depends on the 31. Earlier, the Bangkok jewelry business was dominated by ethnic groups from the Indian sub- continent, but ownership is now more diversified (Askew 2002).48 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES bonds of trust among a close-knit group of participants, and most firms are clustered in a couple of neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. Thejewelry business thrives in Thailand, but Thai styles and brand names are barely known in the region and have made no impression at all on West- ern markets despite substantial exports and the massive number of visitorswho have been exposed to the offerings of the industry. The weakness, aswith the garments, might well be in the design, which caters to the localmarket but has not caught global attention. Unlike H. Stern from Brazil, no Thai firm has attempted either to design for a rich international clien-tele or to market its jewelry in the Fifth Avenues of the world's major cities.Thai design is not yet associated with exclusivity for which people mightpay premium prices. Yet both garments and jewelry have the potential tomove upscale and to serve as the foundations of a luxury goods sector such as that which, for example, buttresses the prosperity of Paris (Scott 2000b). T ourism is an industry that, with the right policies, has a bright future. It is not so much an urban cluster as a set of complementary services that cover parts of the city. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of interna-tional visitors to Bangkok rose from 3.5 million to 7 million. The impor-tance of this industry, which is a large employer and supports 94 registeredhotels, could increase. Although transport and hotel services producersare at the forefront of beneficiaries, many other providers, such as restau-rants and myriad retail establishments, benefit from tourist spending. Asignificant slice of Bangkok's GDP , perhaps as much as 5 percent, is likelyto derive from these interlocking activities. Currently, however, the aver-age visitor spends fewer than two days in Bangkok, even when the averagelength of stay in Thailand is eight days. Much depends on investmentsthat enhance the attractions of Bangkok for the long-staying, the high- spending tourist or convention participant or the \"medical\" tourist. 32The quality and efficiency of the hotel infrastructure is only a part of the in- vestment. For example, the Banyan T ree chain is one example of an in- digenous upscale hotel business emphasizing the luxurious spa experience that is spreading throughout East Asia. Developing neighborhoods ornearby sites for tourists to visit will be equally important, as will be thequality of the urban environment. 32. Bangkok was able to take advantage of the higher cost of medical services in Singapore and offer such procedures as heart bypass operations, cosmetic surgery, and chemotherapy at signif-icantly lower rates (\"Glow in the Dark\" 2005; T an and Phang 2005). For instance, one-thirdof patients at Bumrungrad Hospital are foreigners, contributing 42 percent of the revenues(\"Foreign Patients\" 2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 49 If one Thai product has won widespread acclaim, it is the cuisine. Be- cause Thai migrants diffused less widely than Chinese, or even Japanese, the cuisine is not as well known, but it has a secure foothold in Western countries and in developing regions as well. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Thai food-processing industry is the fourth candidate on our list ofsubsectors with long-term potential in the Bangkok metropolitan econo-my. Thailand is already a significant exporter of rice, fruit, meat, feed, andprocessed foods. CP , one of the leading firms in the country, started out in the foodstuffs sector and thereafter diversified. CP and other Thai firmsare integrated into global agribusiness networks, and the export ofprocessed and semiprocessed foodstuffs earns US$10 billion annually(USDA 2003). 33Processed foodstuff is a growth industry with stable prospects. It is research and marketing intensive, and it promises signifi- cant local value added in both manufacturing and services. Moreover, food processing and agro industries are relatively labor intensive and hos- pitable to a mix of firms, especially small firms.34These industries have a limited footprint, but they can be the basis for expansion, particularly through investment in research, marketing, equipment, and skills. Bangkok is not the place where a food-processing cluster could be revived; instead it is where the upstream work on research, marketing, product de-velopment, and testing can be concentrated. The proliferation of schoolsand programs that offer locals and foreigners training in Thai cuisine isone initiative that could accelerate the globalization of Thai food products and possibly become the basis of Bangkok-based international restaurantchains. French chefs such as Robuchon and Ducasse have begun estab-lishing global chains. Thai chefs could follow this lead by offering themore varied (fusion offerings) and upscale dining experiences alreadybeing tested in restaurants in the trendy parts of Bangkok (\"They Came\" 2006). In the rush to build electronics and auto industries and create financial hubs, one often forgets that the growth possibilities in some traditional industries are far from exhausted. Those industries support numerousbackward and forward links and can catalyze technological development 33. Thailand is not only the largest food exporter in Southeast Asia but also a major global food exporter. Thailand is the largest exporter of frozen shrimp, canned pineapples, and pineapplejuice and concentrates; the second-largest exporter of seafood; and one of the top 10 exportersof frozen chicken (USDA 2003). 34. Thailand has more than 10,000 firms in the food-processing industry, and 80 percent of them are small firms (USDA 2005).50 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES in a number of areas. The luxury goods sector, composed of jewelry and fashion garments, which we examine in chapter 7, has the potential of be-coming a leading sector for the BMA economy. SEOUL Seoul's strategic location within the transport network of the Koreanpeninsula has been long recognized. In 1394, the unifying Yi dynasty se-lected the spot on the Han River as their seoul, which is the Korean term for capital city. 35From then onward, under a succession of rulers, Seoul has remained the leading urban center for the peninsula as a whole,through the early 1940s and since 1945 for the Republic of Korea. The Korean War, which ended in an uneasy armistice in July 1953, left Seoul in ruins. 36Virtually the entire physical infrastructure, housing, and commercial real estate had to be reconstructed from scratch\u2014not to men-tion the industry that has since provided the economic basis for recovery. The Republic of Korea is a charter member of the group of four East Asian Tigers, whose economic achievements since the mid-1960s are thestuff of legend and fill some of the most hopeful chapters in the recent an-nals of development economics. The Korean \"miracle,\" now entering itsfifth decade, can be described with little exaggeration as a miracle that oc- curred in and around Seoul. Korea's industrialization that transitioned inthe latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s into rapid, export-led growthcommenced mainly in the capital region. Between 1986 and 1993, theeconomy of the capital region grew at an average rate of 10.6 percent,whereas national GDP grew by 9.1 percent per year. Thus, the lion's share of Korea's industrial capacity remains concentrated in an area within a 50-mile radius of downtown Seoul. Despite concerted efforts by successive Korean governments to dis- perse industry and the population for strategic reasons and in the interestof broader regional development, about one-fifth of the population\u2014nearly 10.5 million people\u2014resides in Seoul city, which also still generatesmore than one-fifth of the GDP . 37The capital region housed 22.5 million 35. Another name for Seoul is Hanseong, which denotes a fortified city on the Han River. 36. Close to one-third of all buildings in Seoul were destroyed (Kwon and Kim 2001).37. For instance, the Korean government implemented the Industrial Placement and Factory Construction Act in 1977 and the Seoul Metropolitan Readjustment Plan in 1984 to discouragenew establishments that could intensify the concentration of population in the Seoul area (Shinand Byeon 2001).MEGACITY PROFILES 51 people in 2003 and produced almost one-half of the national product (OECD 2005). More important, many of Korea's future growth industriesare in Seoul city or its immediate vicinity. Korea's electronics, informa- tion technology (IT), multimedia, telecommunications, and embryonic biotechnology industries are all in the capital region, as are the designand development centers for the auto industry. The bulk of Korea'sbusiness services have agglomerated in Seoul, not the least because itis Korea's only global city, with a concentration of corporate headquar- ters, universities, and research facilities. Almost 80 percent of employ-ment is in services, and 87 percent of all businesses are in the servicessector (OECD 2005). In 2002, 52 percent of the IT-related firms, themajority of firms in the digital-content subsector, and 41 percent offinance and insurance services were located in Seoul (OECD 2005; Shin and Byeon 2001). And in Inchon, adjacent to Seoul, is Korea's budding free economic zone, which is seeking to become the transport hub for thenortheast Asian region. 38 As household incomes have risen, Seoul's consumer economy has be- gun resembling that of T okyo, with a similarly demanding clientele seek- ing innovative products of high quality. In fact, Seoul is emerging as another T okyo (Seoul Development Institute and Nomura Research Insti- tute 2003) and as a potential test market for new products of MNCs, inparticular high-end technology-based products. One indication of this de-velopment is the average shelf life of mobile phone models in Korea,which is approximately 18 months. Yongsan, the largest electronic and electric goods distribution district in Korea, is beginning to resemble Akihabara in T okyo. Many electronics stores run their online shoppingmalls in Yongsan, where rapid and valuable feedback on product innova-tion is listed on a real-time basis. This online interaction between pro-ducers and customers, which is becoming a key to the success of many innovations, is unique to Korea because of the high penetration rate of broadband connections. Seoul has one of the nation's highest onlineshopping rates, with one in five Internet-connected households regular-ly shopping online. Customer reviews of products are critical and reflectthe customers growing expertise. This online feedback from consumersprovides firms with information for upgrading and modifying theirproducts. The Myeongdong district, which attracts 1.5 million to 2 million visi- tors per day and up to 2.5 million during weekends, is where females in 38. Inside the free economic zone, a new city\u2014Songdo\u2014is being constructed to provide a venue for the corporate headquarters of firms using Inchon's transport facilities.52 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES their teens and 20s congregate. Despite high rents, many fashion houses have their outlets in this area because such outlets serve as antennae totrack consumer tastes. Adjacent to Myeongdong are some of the largest upscale department stores, with shops selling luxury-brand goods. A tradi- tional inexpensive market is located in the Namdaemun district. Locational advantages and a highly dirigiste government industrial policy generated the centripetal forces that induced the clustering of in-dustry in the Seoul region. With the business sector taking its cues from the state and being forcefully motivated by government financial, fiscal,and trade-related incentives, proximity to the center of power inevitablybecame an advantage. A culture that assigned importance to personal re-lations and face-to-face contact also encouraged firms to relocate at leasttheir headquarters, if not their production facilities, in Seoul to be close to government agencies, which often micromanaged the development process in the private sphere as much as in the public sphere (Amsden1989). When the Korean export phenomenon began gathering momentum, buyers flocked to the country. They came mainly to Seoul because Seoulwas Korea's portal to the international economy. Production facilities closeto Seoul were easier for foreigners to visit and easier to export from. 39No doubt the huge Korean and U.S. military presence in and around Seoul provided a much-needed sense of security in a country that maintained a tenuous armed peace with its belligerent neighbor to the north. A side benefit of the militarization of Seoul was that it generated demand forsupplies and for services. Defense spending pumped money into Seoul'seconomy, which was good for business\u2014not to mention the growth of anextensive services economy. By the end of the 1980s, Seoul had evolved into a leading city with a large and competitive manufacturing sector that generated not only much of the growth but also a broad-based, albeit inefficient, services sectorcomposed in the main of small-scale businesses. Since then, rising wagesand overhead costs have combined with the government's regional and en- vironmental policies to bring about an exodus of manufacturing from Seoul city. Some of this industry has dispersed into the fringe metropoli-tan suburbs, some has moved to other provincial cities, and a small butgrowing share has now begun moving abroad. Korean FDI is flowing toChina, to Southeast Asia, and into the building of automotive plants and 39. Even as recently as 2001, Seoul accounted for nearly 19 percent of total exports, which was down to 13.5 percent in 2004 (OECD 2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 53 40. Although Korea is the most wired country in the world, it is also investing heavily in wire- less technologies. T elecommunications carriers worldwide have deployed wireless hotspots atpopular public venues where laptop users can surf the Internet at high speed. Korean firms areinvesting in this infrastructure, with K T's NESpot alone offering service at more than 23,000locations nationwide by the end of 2004. Some 375,000 Koreans subscribe to the service as aUS$10 add-on to their wired Internet or mobile phone subscription.factories producing electronics in the United States and the countries of the European Union. Because nature\u2014as well as the state\u2014abhors a vac-uum, the economic space vacated by manufacturing is being colonized by services drawn by market forces powerfully abetted by policy initiatives of the state. Among them, IT-related, digital content, multimedia, and fi-nancial services are the expanding the fastest. They are being actively pro-moted by the government, which has made Seoul into one of Asia's mostwired cities to stimulate demand for IT services. 40Koreans can use their mobile phones to pay for everything from coffee at caf\u00e9s and snacks at convenience stores to large purchases at department stores, either in per- son or online. The Korean version of m-commerce refers to financial transactions taking place on- and offline, via mobile terminals. More than470,000 locations nationwide will accept m-payments. Users can also usetheir mobile phones to pay for public transit. They simply scan their mo-bile phone over the receiver, and the money is debited. In addition, with mobile online banking, users can transfer money through mobile settle-ment banks in near real-time transactions. The objective of the government and leading chaebol (that is, con- glomerates), such as Samsung, LG, and SK, is to strengthen Korea'sleadership in electronic components, design technology, and new IT- supported services. Financial services are another objective, and logistics a third. These latter two services are fairly typical sectoral aspirations ofmajor cities in East Asia. However, the question for Seoul, as for as othercities in the region, remains whether sufficient demand will materializeto absorb the potential capacity and whether Seoul's IT-, finance-, andlogistics-related activities will fill the gaps left by the retreat of manufac-turing. A number of considerations need to be balanced here. On the positive side is the size and continuing diversity of Seoul's urban economy. Some-what like T okyo, Seoul retains the higher-tech ends of the manufacturingsector\u2014in particular, the electronics, multimedia, and telecommunica-tions industries\u2014and it is cultivating the biotech sector. The city is rich inskills, with by far the most dynamic labor market in Korea supplied by the54 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES country's leading educational institutions. And virtually all the Korean chaebol operate from Seoul. Thus, the advantages of agglomeration are highly concentrated in the Seoul region. Moreover, Korea's status as a major trading economy generates a substantial ready-made demand for logistics services. Offsetting those apparent advantages is the relative inefficiency of the service sectors in Korea, which have been sheltered not just from interna-tional competition but also from FDI. As a result, most services\u2014from banking to wholesaling\u2014are not globally or even regionally competitive.In many instances the operating scale of firms is well below optimal. Someof the leading providers of financial business and IT services are affiliatedwith the chaebol . Although such affiliation provides access to an internal market for capital and skills and can serve as a buffer against unforeseen shocks, the diversified chaebol are rarely able to provide their many activi- ties with the strategic focus and the managerial inputs so vital for growth in productivity, innovativeness, and\u2014through those\u2014competitiveness inoverseas markets. By remaining wary of FDI and foreign control over local industry, be it manufacturing, finance, or retailing, Korean industrial firms, banks, ac-counting firms, wholesalers, and other services providers have also neg-lected an important channel for the transfer of technology and skills andhave limited domestic market competition from this source. Since 1997,however, FDI has begun flowing into the services sector, with Seoul at-tracting 60 percent of the total (OECD 2005). Among Beijing, Shanghai, and T okyo, limited space exists for a fourth mega urban economy offering a similar range of tradable and now in-creasingly footloose services without the cushion of a large domestic mar- ket (OECD 2005, 58). Seoul is not as dependent as Singapore on exportsfor survival, but more than 70 percent of Seoul's exports are drawn fromjust the subsectors of electronics (31 percent), textiles (23 percent), andmachinery (17 percent). A Seoul that relied mainly on services would needto be as export oriented as it was in the past, and although electronics re-mains a profitable export, most services do not make the grade as yet. Afew promising points of light exist, such as movies and online games,which we discuss in chapter 6, but these industries need to grow and tomultiply. Recognizing that a postindustrial Seoul must explore a broader set of options and that multimedia deserves special attention, the governmentlaunched an urban industrial strategy equal in scope to those of Beijing,Shanghai, and Singapore. Three projects are especially noteworthy andMEGACITY PROFILES 55 have considerable potential: Guro Digital Valley, Digital Media City, and the development of the video games and moviemaking industries. Theseprojects are all part of a scheme to introduce new clusters to the Seoul urban region. Guro Digital Valley is a new name for the Guro Export Industrial Complex, which in the 1960s and 1970s was the industrial center of Seoul that manufactured electronic components and assembled electricappliances. Since its launch in 1997, Guro Digital Valley is facilitating start-up companies with venture capital. An estimated 3,100 firms em-ploying close to 50,000 workers were housed in the industrial complex in2005, many specializing in IT and design-related activities. The govern-ment plans to further develop the complex into a home for variousInternet and software-related start-ups in tandem with T eheran Valley (Gangnam venture town) in southern Seoul. The Digital Media City project, started in the late 1990s under former mayor Goh Kun, is attempting to make Seoul the high-tech industry's axis. Digital Media City seeks to carefully interweave broadband tech-nologies to spark innovations that could give rise to clusters of high-techcompanies. It occupies 570,000 square meters in the 6.6 million squaremeters of Sang-am Millennium T own. The chaebol , however, are not pursuing complementary strategies that will give a definitive direction to Seoul's development. Although severalproducers of electronics, such as LG and Samsung, are currently amongthe world leaders, they are moving some of their production out of theSeoul area to lower-cost sites. More production is sure to follow. The baseof high-tech manufacturing in the Seoul region is not sufficiently broadfor this process to continue for long without the city's fortunes being af- fected. T okyo can derive substantial mileage from a matrix of high-tech in-dustry, research and development (R&D) headquarters' activities, andhundreds of efficient suppliers of state-of-the-art components. Seoul lacksdepth and technological expertise in the components industry, a legacy ofthe chaebol tendency to favor vertical integration over subcontracting. Whether in electronics or automobiles, Korea is no match for Japan at theupper end of the technological spectrum or at the lower labor-intensiveend for China. Despite the Korean government's aspiration to be an R&D hub in Asia, Seoul Development Institute and Nomura Research Institute reportedthat only a very few foreign firms among the top 100 global companies hadestablished an R&D center in Seoul by 2004 (Seoul Development Insti-tute and Nomura Research Institute 2003): Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel,56 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Microsoft, and Siemens.41Microsoft's research center in Korea is develop- ing technologies for wireless devices in Seoul, with plans of investing up to US$30 million over the next three years. Moreover, spinoff companies, whether from universities or the large chaebols and MNCs, that can bring a steady flow of new technologies into the Seoul economy are relatively few, although they are heavily concen- trated in Seoul. In particular, along with the government policies support-ing new \"venture firms,\" 73 percent of all venture firms are concentrated in the Seoul metropolitan area, and 47 percent are located inside Seoul. 42 By districts, the Gangnam area (the southeast part of Seoul) accommo- dates 57 percent, whereas the southwest part containing Guro DigitalValley houses 21 percent. The Gangnam area offers a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure, has access to convenient transportation networks, and has begun attracting corporate headquarters, which are themajor customers. How many of these new firms will introduce technologies that can com- mand an international market, as distinct from local niche markets, will have an important bearing on Seoul's prospects. The economic futureof the urban region will hinge on, for instance, the multimedia firms thatare aggressively competing in the national market and establish a firmfoothold overseas. BEIJING Kublai Khan made Beijing the capital of the Yuan dynasty in the latter half of the 13th century. The city was named Dadu, and the Mongol rulers im-posed a spatial orientation and a grid layout with the emperor's palace at the center. Beijing evolved under the Ming and Qing dynasties through the 19th century and then under the short-lived Nationalist regime in the 41. Intel's R&D center in Korea focuses on advanced wireless communications technology, high-quality media coding, and next-generation platforms for content distribution and con-sumption. Intel has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Electronics andT elecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). Intel and ETRI have agreed to jointly developnew technologies related to multistream media distribution over home networks, homeautomation, and next-generation home servers (http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20040308corp.htm). Whether this venture actually links with and reinforces techno-logical advances in Korean high-tech manufacturing is an open question. 42. Much of the venture capital flows into mezzanine-level financing because the Korean ven- ture capital industry is reluctant to support start-ups and is not yet mature enough to provide thenecessary coaching, contacts, and managerial assistance (Sohn and Kenney 2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 57 first half of the 20th century. In 1948, after a brief siege, the Nationalist general Fu Zuoyi surrendered the city to the People's Liberation Army.Hutchings (2001, 44) writes that \"Beijing, its grandeur much faded but its imperial form still essentially intact despite the ravages of revolution, oc- cupation and modernization, quietly received its new ruler.\" Regrettably, perhaps, plans devised in the 1940s and in the beginning of the 1950s to keep the graceful old walled city with its many temples 43in- tact and to build a new city to the west were shelved. Thus, first the walls and gates of Beijing were removed by the road builders. More slowly, many of the old buildings came down. And now most of the hutongs are being erased to make way for another clump of \"drab and utilitarian\" multistory blocks, definitely more functional but bereft of the cultural trappings thatdignified Imperial Beijing (S. Chang 1998). The city that has arisen bearsno resemblance to the Imperial Beijing, whose dimensions and texture and flavor can be glimpsed in old, sepia-tinted photographs. Until well into the 1980s, Beijing remained largely an administrative center with a sizable industrial base. Shougang Steel was the biggest singleindustrial enterprise. In addition, enterprises produced machinery, textilesand petrochemicals, and food and beverages. The government was the main employer, and the government was responsible for much of the eco- nomic activity. The pulse of change began to quicken from the mid-1990s as China's reform moved into a higher gear, and with the reform came an increasingflow of domestic and foreign investment into consumer electronics andIT. The Ninth Five-Year Plan initiated the privatization of smaller state-owned enterprises and acknowledged the key role of the private sector. Italso committed China to actively developing technology-intensive indus-tries by leveraging the domestic innovation system and increased spendingon R&D. The former has injected new vigor into industrial change. Thelatter has provided a new focus for this change. Beijing will host the Olympic Games in 2008. In preparation for this event, which has become a rite of passage for East Asian cities, Beijing'salready rapid urban development is being accelerated further. The growth of housing stock and commercial real estate is expanding at a feverish clip,as is the transportation infrastructure to lessen the congestion caused by anestimated 2.6 million autos (in 2005), projected to reach 3.6 million in 2008(Wang 2006). An ambitious tree-planting program in Beijing and in Hebei 43. Susan Naquin (2005) provides the most detailed account of the temples of Imperial Beijing and of the vanished urban ambience.is attempting to partially efface the brown and dusty image of the city and control the sandstorms that sweep across it, and a determined effort is be-ing made to contain pollution by upgrading the stock of cars, which is growing at double-digit rates, and by relocating some factories and regu- lating others. 44 Beijing's development now has three sectoral drivers. First and fore- most are the services associated with governments, both central and mu- nicipal. Second are the producer and other commercial services that have proliferated as Beijing has grown larger and more prosperous and has em- braced the market economy. Although China currently has no intention ofgrooming Beijing to become a financial center, being the capital has givenBeijing prominence in the Chinese economy and has attracted foreignbanks. As a consequence, Beijing now vies with Shanghai as the preferred location for providers of legal, accounting, advertising, marketing, andconsulting services. Fifteen years ago, Beijing had nothing resembling a central business district; now clusters of glass towers are appearing in parts of the citywhere business firms have begun congregating, and some of the biggest names in the international architectural design industry, such as Rem Koolhaas, Jacques Herzog, and Will Alsop, are engaged in creating theskyline for Beijing's emerging commercial sector. Creative industries in areas such as electronics, software, video games, biotechnology, and nanotechnology are a third, newly acquired driver.Recognizing that it has less hope of competing in its traditional, mainstaytextile and food-processing industries, Beijing has rightly aimed at thehigher-technology end of the spectrum that can draw on the strongestbase of universities in China. In making a bid to become the high-tech in-dustrial capital of China, Beijing has also begun attracting FDI in researchcenters. Firms such as Microsoft, Siemens, and Cisco are eager to estab-lish a foothold in China's budding innovation system and to employ the58 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 44. Currently, the Chinese emission standards are equivalent to the European standards in 1994. Much of Beijing's pollution comes from automobiles. For instance, 92 percent of carbon monoxide, 94 percent of hydrocarbons, and 68 percent of sulfur oxides are traceable to auto emis-sions. Reducing pollution from auto emissions requires improving the quality of fuel, becausepart of the reason for the high emissions is the high content of sulfur in Chinese gasoline com-pared with gasoline used in developed countries (\"China to Quench\" 2005; Gallagher 2006).T ougher fuel efficiency requirements are expected to be introduced in 2007, partly in preparationfor the Olympics in 2008 (\"China to Quench\" 2005). In addition, use of alternative energy sourcesis being actively pursued. Currently, 3 million square meters of buildings in Beijing have adoptedgeothermal energy technology, and this number is expected to rise to about 20 million squaremeters by 2010. By adopting this technology, Beijing should be able to cut carbon dioxide emis-sions by 280,000 tons and sulfur dioxide emissions by 2,640 tons (\"Beijing Digs Deep\" 2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 59 talent that is available in the Beijing area at a fraction of the cost in their home countries. Among the industries being groomed, electronics\u2014withits short product cycles and relatively quick payback\u2014is more likely to generate the gains in production and employment Beijing is seeking. This industry is the topic of chapter 9. Starting with Zhongguancun Science Park in the Haidian district adja- cent to Beijing University, the central government has now designated ar-eas across the metropolitan region for high-tech industry in the hope that start-ups, FDI, and spinoffs from the major universities and firms will giverise to several interlinked and dynamic clusters. In support of this strategy,the central government is offering generous tax incentives, risk capital,space for firms to set up production and research facilities, and a business-friendly regulatory environment. For Chinese researchers overseas, whom the government would like to lure back, a package of inducements in- cludes housing, lab facilities, research funding, and seed capital for start-ups. The government is also becoming aware that an attractive physicaland cultural environment, good housing, and school and medical facilitiesare necessary conditions for the development of high-tech industry. Thelatter three present less of a challenge and are easier to provide. WhereBeijing lags and may continue to lag is with respect to the environment\u2014physical and cultural. The cultural ambience is immeasurably improvedover what it was a decade ago. But the physical environment, especially airpollution, is proving recalcitrant. Even if industrial pollution is curbed,the rising tide of cars threatens to undo the gains. Beijing's strategy resembles that of Singapore on an even larger scale. In both cities, the government has a dominant role, and development isbeing orchestrated in detail by the state, with lavish expenditure on im- proving the physical infrastructure and increasing the supply of skills.Both cities are pinning their hopes on high-end producer services andcreative industries to serve as leading sectors, with the government sectorproviding a stable base of demand. In Beijing as much as in Singapore,there is a keen realization that a footloose army of knowledge workerswill determine the success of a strategy that is technology driven and re-quires an open environment conducive to creative destruction. In bothcountries, governments are struggling to craft environments that willchallenge and hold the creative class (see Florida 2005). Some evidenceindicates that the incentives are working, with Beijing and Singaporebenefiting from \"brain gain.\" Not just nationals but also foreigners havegravitated to these cities and have augmented the skilled workforce.Meanwhile, MNCs have invested in R&D facilities, thereby adding tothe capacity to innovate.Nevertheless, neither Singapore nor Beijing has yet been able to come to terms with the need for openness, for a competitive market environ- ment in which not just the entry but also the exit of firms is subject to few constraints, and for an entrepreneurial culture with a healthy appetite for risk taking as well as a tolerance for the failure of many start-ups. Theopenness to ideas and with it the legal protections afforded to the right offree speech that is intrinsic to a creative society remain an issue. Entry offirms is subject to few hurdles in Beijing and fewer still in Singapore. Exit is another matter. Firms that are state owned or supported have a penchantfor lingering on with the help of the banking system long after they plungeinto the red. Beijing is acquiring a reputation for entrepreneurship and risktaking, but such behavior remains exceptional in Singapore despite muchgovernment effort; neither society has embraced the inevitability of failure by the majority of new businesses or has erased the stigma associated with failure, although Beijing, on balance, provides a more forgiving environ-ment. Shanghai is akin to Beijing in this respect. SHANGHAI Each of the five cities we have traversed has a claim to eminence, but all eyes are on Shanghai. For the other cities, Shanghai is the one to watchand to compete against. In the early decades of the 20th century, long be- fore the term global city was coined, Shanghai already enjoyed that reputa- tion. A fishing village in the 10th century and a county seat from the 11th, Shanghai's fortunes rose steadily once it became an important node of thetrading network radiating out from the port city of Ningbo. 45By the mid- 19th century, Shanghai had surpassed Canton to become China's foremost trading city. Following the T reaty of Nanking in 1842 that ended the Opium War, Shanghai became the leading treaty port, acquiring within a few decades the largest foreign community in East Asia. An unusually var-iegated cosmopolitanism and openness produced a memorable culturalexuberance, perhaps more exotic than that sweeping Weimar Berlin in the1920s, while the development of modern industry, mushrooming foreign trade, and trafficking in drugs made the city wealthier but also stoked so-cial turbulence. Shanghai's fame, verging on notoriety, through the early60 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 45. Shanghai's early history and development through the mid-19th century is described by Johnson (1995).MEGACITY PROFILES 61 1930s was well deserved.46The city was the urban icon of the Far East, and it is this iconic status that the new Shanghai is seeking to regain after a long, monochrome interregnum during which the city was isolated from the international community and subsisted only as one of China's several industrial engines. The revival began in the early 1990s; it was spearheaded by an ambi- tious plan to widen Shanghai's economic focus by radically expanding thescale of Shanghai's business and commercial activities and by developing a 523-square-kilometer area in Pudong on the other side of the HuangpuRiver. 47This strategy goes hand in hand with a many-pronged effort to redirect resources into higher-technology industries and producer serv- ices and to recapture the urban glamour of the old Shanghai through an architectural makeover that is attempting to erase four decades of acquired drabness. Determined leaders with capital who are subject to relatively few institutional checks can move mountains. In a little more than 10 years,visually, Shanghai has changed out of almost all recognition and in the process has acquired a skyline rivaling New York's\u2014and one as distinctive.More than 3,000 buildings taller than 18 stories have been constructedsince the mid-1990s. Moreover, an attempt is being made to redevelop thegrandeur of the majestic buildings lining the Bund and some of the oldvillas, such as the Hangshan Moller Villa, now a boutique hotel. Near the old French concession, American architect Benjamin Wood had attempted to recapture Shanghai's past through a development called Xintiandi(New Heaven and Earth). In this cluster of mid-19th century, three-storyShikumen townhouses, lining alleyways are scores of boutiques, caf\u00e9s, andnightclubs \"created so that people in China can experience the same finelywrought balance of theme park and shopping mall that increasingly passesfor upscale urban life in the United States\" (\"Shanghai Surprise\" 2005). 46. The period literature describes Shanghai variously as the \"pearl of the East\" and the \"Paris of the East.\" It depicts a nascent industrial and commercial society composed of urban commu-nities from across China and the world for which Shanghai offered a scarce freedom and diverseopportunities if they were willing to accept the squalor, the risks, and the predatory gangs, suchas the famous Green Gang. On this colorful period, see Lu (1999), Martin (1996), Sergeant(1991), and Wakeman (1995). 47. The idea of developing Pudong germinated through the research done by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences in 1983 to 1985 under the leadership of Wang Daohan, who wasthen the mayor. The project was formally proposed to the central government in 1986, and theideas were discussed in numerous conferences during 1986 to 1988. Finally, in 1990, a consen-sus was reached, and the Pudong scheme was approved on April 18, beginning the renaissanceof Shanghai. See also Yatsko (2001).The change is not only skin deep. The physical infrastructure of the city in the form of bridges, tunnels, ring roads, and underground metro net-work, as well as water and sewerage systems, is expanding in step, causing the city to sink by 2 centimeters per year (Yusuf and Wu 2002). Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport is now complemented by a second, muchlarger international airport in Pudong that is linked to the downtownarea by a state-of-the-art Maglev rail line. Similarly, the capacity ofWaigaoqiao port will be augmented by a vast new 50-berth offshore port taking shape on Yongshan islands in Hangzhou Bay. This port will beconnected to the Nanhui district in Shanghai by a recently completed27-kilometer-long bridge, which constitutes the first phase of thisY 10 billion project (\"China: Leading City Needs\" 2005). 48 Cultural software is also evolving, cautiously at first and now exuber- antly, to fill the huge physical shell that is being created. The cultural revival is seeking a uniqueness that can win back the global renown Shanghai once enjoyed, this time as one of the world's leading postindus- trial cities. Under the planned economic system, Shanghai evolved into a closed, industrial city that was home to virtually every kind of manufacturing ac-tivity. The great challenge for the emerging Shanghai is to carve out and expand those industrial segments that are likely to be viable over the longterm and to divest itself of activities that would be a drag on the metro-politan economy. T o the activities salvaged from the inherited economicbase must be added emerging technology-intensive industries andbusiness services that will contribute to the prosperity of a postindustrial future. Shanghai resembles T okyo in the 1960s in that its industrial capability is very deep. Much like T okyo, Shanghai derives productivity gains from ag- glomeration economies, and the rapid development of the city's hinterlandis giving rise to demand for business and logistics services that Shanghaiis increasingly well positioned to supply. By 2005, Shanghai's population,including more than 4 million migrants, already exceeded 19 million. Infact, the true scale of what is now a multicentric metropolitan region ismuch larger. This metropolitan region extends as a continuous belt fromNingbo and Hangzhou in Zhejiang, through Shanghai, all the way toNanjing in Jiangsu, encompassing Wuxi and Suzhou along the way. It is an62 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 48. Yangshan port will take the pressure off Shanghai port, which in 2005 will handle 17.5 mil- lion TEUs and 400 million tons of cargo. Yangshan, which began operation in late 2005, has thestable 15-meter depth the Shanghai port lacks and would be able to handle 20 million TEUs by2020 when all 52 berths have been completed (\"You Must Expand!\" 2005). MEGACITY PROFILES 63 urban region with a total population of 55 million. If the hinterland is as- sumed instead to be the Yangtze Delta area within a day's drive fromShanghai, then the population is in excess of 100 million and far exceeds that of the hinterlands of T okyo, Seoul, and Bangkok (Leman 2002). Recently Shanghai celebrated, with considerable satisfaction, the 15th anniversary of the Pudong project. By all accounts, Shanghai is clawing its way back to near the top of the global hierarchy of cities, and for the oth-er major centers in East Asia, it is the metropolitan region to be reckoned with. Will this headlong rush forward continue, and is the direction rea-sonably well defined? In the absence of a rigorous study, casual empiricismsuggests that Shanghai's growth is driven in large part by state-directedcapital investment, particularly in infrastructure and real estate, but also inmanufacturing and some of the service industries. The huge outlay of cap- ital is helping to realize a vision conceived by planners in the 1980s and continuously annotated since. The plan calls for an architecturally impos-ing city that embraces five distinct functions: those of a manufacturingbase, a financial center, a focus for cultural activities, a center for researchand high-tech development, and a logistics hub for the region as well asChina's principal link with other global cities. Each of those functions hasbeen conceived and integrated into the overall plan by splicing the key at-tributes of successful cities around the world. Thus, Shanghai is busily in-vesting in six pillar industries\u2014transportation, 49steel, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and chemicals50\u2014because recent experience suggests that these industries have registered a robust performance. By the same token, Shanghai is shuttering or relocating to the hinterland textiles and other light industries, which are no longer competitive. Whether this metropolitan industrial policy is coordinated with similar industrial policies being pursued elsewhere in China or informed by par- allel industrial experiences from around the region is not apparent. Thepolicy assumes that the Shanghai region has or can acquire a comparative advantage in all these industries, but few grounds exist for comfortably be-lieving that the selected assortment of promising industries, ranging frommedium to high technology, will provide the durable industrial foundation 49. Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, through its joint ventures with Volkswagen and General Motors, is the largest producer of automobiles in China. When the Chanxing shipyardhas been completed, it will be the largest in the world, with a capacity of 12 million tons. 50. A major new industrial park is taking shape at Caohejing in western Shanghai. A 900,000-ton ethylene plant will begin production in 2005. BASF opened the world's largest polytetramethyl-ene ether glycol plant in March 2005 and is building a second facility to produce this material,which is used for elastic spandex (\"Manufacturing on the Move?\" 2005).that Shanghai is seeking a decade and more into the future. In fact, trans- portation, steel, and chemicals, at least, would seem out of place in thepostindustrial stage of urban development. And the other subsectors will have to struggle hard to remain profitable. From a forward-looking per- spective, Shanghai's industrial policy looks questionable. The realism of the ambition to become a major financial center is also open to question. Commercial real estate, which Shanghai has thrown upin abundance, is only a small part of what it takes for a city to join the ranks of the world's leading financial powerhouses. Much more important is thelevel of industrial maturity, the volume and quality of professional skills,the extent to which those attributes are buttressed by tested regulatory in-stitutions, the experience of the participants, and the emergence of durabletraditions that provide the glue of trust. 51In recent years, Shanghai's stock market has performed poorly because corporate governance is weak, dis- closure is inadequate, and malpractices remain rife\u2014all pointing to the in- adequacy of monitoring institutions and organizations that enforce rules.52 Shanghai's location will also affect market demand for financial services, because competition exists from other existing or emerging financial cen- ters in the vicinity. Hong Kong (China), Singapore, and T okyo are three cities with a large presence of globally linked financial firms (P . T aylor 2005).53These three cities are already in the position to challenge London and New York. Moreover, questions exist regarding the global supply of financial services. Is an impending glut possible? Is consolidation in fewer key locations a possibility given developments in IT?64 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 51. Most of the brokerage firms in Shanghai (about 130) are said to be insolvent (\"Marginalised Market\" 2005). The firms have been slow to accumulate the necessary skills and technology be-cause, so far, market forces and institutions have exerted a minimal influence on the working ofthe stock market. T o develop those capabilities, the firms may need to find foreign partners andbe allowed to invest in foreign shares (\"Marginalised Market\" 2005). Life insurers do not earnmuch return either. They are required to invest mainly in Chinese banks and government bondswith at most 15 percent of investment in equities, and they are barred from investing in foreignequities (\"Off with a Bang\" 2003). 52. The nontradable shares account for two-thirds of the US$400 billion market value of firms listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange. Lack of much activity in the equity market ispreventing other financial developments, such as derivatives and corporate bond trading(\"Hangover Cure\" 2005). On May 1, 2005, China's Securities Regulatory Commission issuedguidelines to convert the nontradable shares. The conversion must be approved, and anyonepurchasing the stocks will not be able to sell for one year (\"Hangover Cure\" 2005). The pilotscheme covered 46 firms, and following its initial success, the conversion process has now beenextended to cover all 1,300 firms, although the actual conversion process is likely to take a longtime to ensure price stability (\"China: Share Sale\" 2005). 53. Hong Kong (China) and Singapore both have a large number of insurance providers, al- though only firms in Hong Kong (China) are globally connected significantly (P . T aylor 2005).MEGACITY PROFILES 65 These considerations and questions raise doubts over the plan to build an East Asian Wall Street in Pudong, as distinct from a regional financial center that serves the considerable requirements of the Yangtze Valley Basin, with a population of 600 million that produces two-thirds of China's GDP . Even this more limited objective could take time becauseof the condition of China's banks and the limited progress with reform-ing and privatizing the state sector. Furthermore, the regulatoryinfrastructure that is vital to the functioning of financial markets is in its infancy with much tempering of the rules ahead, not to mention a pro-found strengthening of the legal system to implement the rules (Perkins2004). Other issues exist as well. With a well-established financial marketin T okyo and in Hong Kong (China) and smaller markets also in Seouland in T aipei, can East Asia accommodate another market in Shanghai? If so, how large could it grow and what would be the nature of its specialization, with T okyo already well entrenched in the bond market?More narrowly, from Shanghai's standpoint, how much of a boostwould it provide to metropolitan GDP over the longer term, especiallywhen the long-run trend for the employment in New York's financial sec-tor is downward, reflecting the consolidation of firms (\"After theFall\" 2005)? 54 From official statements, the objective of acquiring a piece of the glob- al financial business is one element of the larger objective of delivering two-thirds more of GDP from services within the next decade. This tar- get is derived from historical averages. Major cities in industrial countries depend on services for much of their income; therefore, Shanghai's econ-omy is being made more services intensive, with financial services in theforefront, followed by other producers and commercial services. Is thismodel the best for Shanghai, and should Shanghai forcefully pursue a rap- id planned transition of the economy? The unsettling aspect of this monumental urban project is that an in- dustrial policy and a policy to dramatically increase the weight of theservices sector in Shanghai's economy are being attempted alongside twoother expensive and ambitious schemes: (a) to combine in one city the cul- tural vigor of a London with the creative industries that flourish in San Francisco and (b) to construct a multimodal transportation networkspanning the Yangtze Delta area with Shanghai as its apex\u2014a projectbigger than Rotterdam and Antwerp combined. 54. Employment in the financial sector typically is highly cyclical. In New York, the financial sector added 34,000 new jobs during the boom years of 1995 to 2000, but quickly lost all of thosenewly created jobs after the crash of stock market (\"After the Fall\" 2005).No precise figure measures the magnitude of the investment that has been poured into these several projects. The cumulative gross investment since 1990 is equal to about US$300 billion (see table 2.1), and the tangi- ble evidence of this spending is everywhere: in the new auto factories in Anting; in the chemical plants in Shihua town; in new financial skyscrap-ers; in the recently expanded ports; in the cultural centers and the severalscience parks, such as the 25-square-kilometer Zhanjiang, where operations; and inthe science parks of Jiaotong and Fudan universities. Whether the skills, the software, and the institutions can be quickly as- sembled to derive the economic payoff that will make this great Shanghaiexperiment into a self-sustaining process that leads to a global city is much less obvious. Just as no precedent exists for Singapore's attempt to implant a biotech industry through brute financial force, so, too, one searches invain for any past example of a city that moved purposefully to accomplishsix complex objectives and to fuse them into an organic, smoothly func-tioning whole. New York, for example, has achieved the rank of a worldcity, but in many senses that rank is a hollow achievement. The city has66 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 2.1 Gross Investment in Shanghai (US$ billion) Year Investment 1990 4.7 1991 4.9 Bureau of Statistics of China 2005; Shanghai Municipal Statistical Bureau 2004.MEGACITY PROFILES 67 gradually lost its base of manufacturing industry.55It is no longer an im- portant logistics hub. New York is the leading financial center and is richly endowed with producer services; arguably its creative industries are among the most dynamic in the world. The city can be proud of its uni- versities and hospitals, and the cultural infrastructure draws millions oftourists. Yet New York teeters on the edge of financial crisis. Its physicalinfrastructure and public services are no more than adequate, given thelevel of income, and the city confronts income inequality and a level of relative poverty that would be considered intolerable in Shanghai today(Glaeser 2005c). Ambition, drive, focus, and financing can produce dramatic results\u2014if overextension can be avoided. The ambition and drive of Shanghai's au-thorities to make Shanghai into a world city are very much in evidence. But the breadth of the ambition suggests a blurring of focus. Shanghai has demonstrated a comparative advantage in manufacturing industries, intransportation logistics, and, more recently, in construction and engineer-ing services. The three together provide an integrated basis for a thrivingurban industrial economy. How they can coexist with a dominant clusterof producer services, a growing creative industry, and a variegated indus-try supplying cultural products and services is impossible to ascertain. Noother city besides possibly T okyo embraces the range of activities Shang-hai is tackling simultaneously, and in T okyo's case, the city followed acertain progression, a gaining of experience, and a process of industrialadjustment during which some industries exited only to be replaced byothers. A lot of creative destruction of a broadly positive nature was in ev-idence, which depended on Japan's manufacturing capability and an inno-vation system centered in T okyo. Those changes were also influenced by international circumstances, which allowed space for a more gradualtransition. Shanghai's planned approach is of a very different cut from T okyo's. A complex whole made up of many parts is being assembled all at once withlittle thought to sequencing or market forces or comparative advantage.Not much attention is being given to changing world supply andtechnological circumstances, which makes it much harder to gauge thelonger-term viability of manufacturing industries now being expanded inShanghai. The demand for these industries might well be forthcoming to 55. New York once had the largest urban manufacturing sector in the United States, with close to 1 million workers in the 1960s, mainly in the garment and printing industries (\"After the Fall\"2005). the extent being assumed. By the same token, it may materialize only in part. Many other competitors are jockeying for the same choice markets\u2014and not only the cities included in this volume. Are autos and banking the industries that will sustain Shanghai's prosperity? Is construction? We are particularly struck by the scale, links, and technological reach of the con-struction industry and explore some of its potential in chapter 8. Un-doubtedly, policy makers and investors must make bets, but with a carefulassessment of potential and a weighing of the odds. In the pell-mell rush to develop, these niceties might not be given their due. CONCLUSION T okyo, Singapore, Bangkok, Seoul, Beijing, and Shanghai are among the six most important global cities in East Asia. They are on the threshold ofa postindustrial era. Each city is marked by its own unique industrial his- tory, which has imparted a mix of capabilities. How those capabilities are mobilized will determine whether the next chapter on the life of thesecities is one about economic achievement of a high order or of a middlingkind, or whether it is a paean to decline. Much depends on the industrieson which the mantle of leadership comes to rest. It is difficult to predict which industries will take up the challenge and actually deliver. However,we have nominated some contenders with plausible credentials, and inlater chapters we will assess those credentials.68 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESPostindustrial cities cannot dispense with industry if they are to con- tinue as successful economies. But it is the message of this bookthat they will need a change of horses\u2014and in fact more powerful horses\u2014because the next leg of development is steeper. This change does not mean that all labor-intensive manufacturing activities are disbarred\u2014after all, fashion garments can certainly thrive under postin-dustrialism. It means only that skill- and technology-intensive industriesare more likely to sustain competitiveness in an urban milieu in which wage costs are high and rising, skilled workers are relatively abundant, and theinfrastructure for design and technology development either has alreadytaken root or can be brought into existence through policy actions. Each city in our sample benefits from\u2014but must improve on\u2014six attrib- utes, which we will describe and compare across the cities in this chapter: 1. Size, which gives rise to agglomeration economies 2. Broad industrial base, which can serve as the foundation for postindus- trial development 3. Large and skilled workforce, which effectively fuels industrial change4. Urban innovation system composed of universities and research insti- tutes, which can lead or support industrial evolution and competitiveness 5. Urban information technology (IT) infrastructure, which can undergird industrial advance by enhancing productivity and spurring technologicalimprovement in industries ranging from retailing to logistics 6. Urban amenities such as public services, green spaces, and low levels of pollution, which contribute to the livability of a city These attributes, individually or taken together, are not sufficient con- ditions for rapid economic growth in a postindustrial environment; however, they are the hallmarks of successful postindustrial cities. Weshould also note at this point that the available indicators offer at best aCHAPTER 3 DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURINGcoarse-grained picture of the attributes that count. Nevertheless, we be- lieve that they usefully underscore urban preparedness for a transition topostindustrialism and give a sense for the range of potential options avail- able to our selected East Asian cities. POPULATION The optimal city size has eluded researchers, if we assume that an optimal condition is defined in economic terms with respect to economic growthand factor productivities and also with respect to costs arising from congestion and the demand for space. Small, ill-managed cities can be in- efficient and unlivable, as can large ones. But if a city achieves a broadlysatisfactory level of management\u2014which includes fiscal and financialmanagement and the adequate provision of services\u2014and of governance,it is not easy to define an upper limit of population when there are no binding constraints imposed by the availability of land and water. Someresearch on China suggests that labor productivity is maximized in citieswith populations in the region of 5 million (Henderson 2004a, 2004b).But evidence also points to constant and even increasing returns to scale.In principle, if one were to believe these findings, then there is no apparent upper bound on performance as long as services can be efficiently provided and congestion costs are kept in check, possibly through efficient trafficplanning and a polycentric urban structure. The concentration of people within a single city is apparent through much of East Asia. \"The population of [the greater] T okyo . . . has risen from 15.6 percent of Japan's population to 25.2 percent, T aipei from13.3 percent to 27.7 percent of T aiwan's population, and Seoul from8.4 percent to 22.0 percent\" (Rowe 2005, 25). All six of the East Asian citiesin our sample are large or very large by global standards. Even Singapore,the smallest city, has a population of 4.2 million, which is higher than thatof Ireland. Beijing, Shanghai, and T okyo each have a population exceeding10 million (see table 3.1). One must remember that in the case of T okyoand Bangkok, the table refers to the core districts only and not to the metroarea, which is far more populous. If scale and agglomeration economies are important, then the bigger cities clearly give firms an edge. By being ableto serve an urban market of 10 million customers, the size of a small coun-try, companies can reap the benefits of scale economies and can minimizethe costs of transportation and marketing. Except for Singapore, the sam-ple cities offer markets of between 10 million and 20 million people if therelevant boundaries of the city are taken to be the metropolitan area.70 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESDISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 71 Again, if size matters, then future trends favor Beijing and Shanghai. Both cities have been growing steadily, mainly because of immigration, with urban fertility being exceedingly low. Moreover, given the relatively low level of urbanization in China (42 percent in 2004), the attractiveness of those cities for migrants, and the cities' small share of the national pop-ulation (at about 1 percent as against more than 9 percent for T okyo andBangkok), each city could add 10 million or more people within the nexttwo decades. Aside from scale economies, the advantage of such influx is that it would dampen the aging of the workforce and provide those citieswith a supply of relatively youthful, entrepreneurial migrants whowould bring energy and ideas and stimulate consumption (Bloom andWilliamson 1997). As figure 3.1 shows, the demographic profile is most favorable for Bangkok, Beijing, and Shanghai, with the largest cohorts being in the15-19 through 45-49 age groups. In the other cities, the 1990s witnessedan increase in the weight of older cohorts. Seoul, Singapore, and T okyowill still expand, but more slowly because their rural hinterlands have beenlargely depleted (see table 3.2). Bangkok could attract rural migrants, butthey might go to the distant suburbs and the Eastern Seaboard. Neverthe-less, the Bangkok metro region is far from having exhausted its growthpotential. The projection for future immigration also does not suggestthat those cities will grow rapidly through this channel. The UnitedNations forecasts that net migration to Singapore will drop to zero by2030, after an average intake of 50,000 people per year in 2000 to 2005(\"South-East Asia: Population Ageing\" 2004). Similarly, the projection forThailand is that immigration is expected to decline to 4,000 per year be-tween 2025 and 2050, down from 6,000 per year between 2000 and 2025 (\"South-East Asia: Population Ageing\" 2004). 1Table 3.1 City Population and Share of National Population, 2003 Attribute Bangkok Beijing Seoul Shanghai Singapore Tokyo Size (thousands of people) 5,885 14,560 10,277 13,418 4,185 12,310 Share of 1.13 21.45 1.04 100 9.65 Sources: Bangkok: Bangkok Metropolitan Administration various years.

Tokyo 1980 2000 In addition, lower fertility rates and lengthening life expectancy in these countries will affect the growth of these cities. All five countries now have fertility rates that are below replacement levels. Meanwhile, with im- provements in health, people can expect to live longer. A person born in Asia in 1900 would expect to live on average until the age of 28. By 2001,life expectancy in Asia had risen to 67 years (Riley 2005). Life expectancyis substantially higher in East Asia and is still inching upward. Japan hasthe highest life expectancy in the world for women (85.3 years) and the third highest for men (78.4 years). By 2025, the life expectancy for womenand men in Japan is expected to reach 89.4 years and 83.9 years, respec-tively (\"Japan: Population T rends\" 2005). The average life expectancy inthe Republic of Korea in 2000 was 75.9 years, and it is expected to increaseto 81.5 years in 2030 (\"Preparing for a Mature Society\" 2004). Reflecting the national trends, the populations in these cities are also graying (see figure 3.1). The median age of a Japanese citizen is 43.1 yearsold. One in five Japanese is over the age of 65, and some 5 percent are overthe age of 80 (\"Japan: Population T rends\" 2005). In 2000, 7.2 percent of the population in Korea was over 65 years old. This figure will haveclimbed to 14.4 percent by 2019, and to 23.1 percent by 2026 (\"South Korea: Ageing\" 2005). The proportion of the economically active popula- tion (15 to 64 years old) is expected to peak in the late 2010s and then startto decline. China will begin to catch up by 2027, when 14 percent of itspopulation will be 65 years or older (\"China: Demographic T rends\" 2004).Japan moved from having one of the youngest populations among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)countries to one of the oldest in 15 years (\"Japan: Population T rends\"2005). The United Kingdom took 80 years to change from an adult to anaged society; China will do so in 20-plus years (\"China: DemographicT rends\" 2004). The effect of such aging on the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) will be a reduction in GDP growth rates of about 0.25 to 0.75 per-cent in Japan and Europe (\"Preparing for a Mature Society\" 2004). Similareffects can be expected in the other East Asian cities.74 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 3.2 Net Migration (Foreign and Domestic) to Six Cities in East Asia, 1980-2003 Type of City migration 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2003 Bangkok Foreign \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Domestic 499,700 427,500 519,900 415,800 443,000 \u2014 Beijing Foreign \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Domestic 52,000 0 37,944 63,000 89,000 141,100 Seoul Foreign \u2014 \u2014Domestic \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 /H11002321,898 /H1100281,122 \u2014 Shanghai Metropolitan Administration various years (figures from Registration Record, Bureau of Registration Administration, Ministry of Interior).

As East Asian countries have in-dustrialized, an ever larger share of the GDP is generated by urban-based secondary and tertiary industries. Because the productivity per worker in these sectors far exceeds productivity in agriculture, the percentage ofGDP derived from urban activities is well in excess of the share of the pop-ulation. For instance, although only 42 percent of China's population isclassified as urban, 88 percent of the GDP is generated through nonfarm activities, the bulk of which are located in urban areas. Given the magni-tude of urban factor productivity, it is not surprising, therefore, that all sixcities are prominent contributors to the national product. Bangkok topsthe list with a 36 percent share in 2000, which reflects the high degree ofurban and industrial concentration in Thailand (see table 3.3). Seoul, with a quarter of the national product, is a close second. Both of those cities have benefited from virtuous spirals resulting from the agglomeration andclustering of industries and, in particular, the high concentration of man-ufacturing activities that are closely linked with the growth of productivity,a phenomenon that is known as Verdoorn's Law . 2The notable difference between Bangkok and Seoul is that Bangkok's share of GDP peaked inDISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 75 Table 3.3 Cities' Share of National GDP , 1985-2003 (percentage) City 1985 1990 1995 2000 2003 Bangkok 35.94 40.5 39.08 36.31 \u2014 Beijing 2.1 2.7 2.4 2.8 3.1 Seoul 24.9 25.3 24.9 24.0 24.1Shanghai 5.2 4.1 4.2 5.1 5.3Singapore 100 100 100 100 100 Tokyo \u2014 17.6 16.1 16.6 16.8 Sources: Bangkok: Bangkok Metropolitan Administration various years.

Verdoorn's Law states that the manufacturing sector is subject to substantial increasing re- turns to scale; hence, the growth of productivity in manufacturing is an endogenous result of thegrowth of output.

Data for Tokyo are from 2002. 1990 and since then has been declining as industry moves out of the Bangkok metro area and is not replaced by services with higher valueadded per capita. Seoul, on the other hand, appears to have successfully maintained its share of GDP in the face of substantial migration of manu- facturing industries and changes in the sectoral composition of economicactivities (see table 3.4). 3 T okyo's share of GDP is commensurate with its rank in Japan's urban hierarchy and its percentage of GDP has been approximately stable since 1990. In China, the country's size and its policy of restricting migration to the urban areas, which is only now being dismantled, have prevented the emergence of many large cities. Nevertheless, Beijing and Shanghai havequickly moved into the ranks of the world's most populous cities, even 3. The growth of cities in the United States is tied to the composition of industries in cities. Cities with many new industries that tend to rely on skilled workers grow much faster. Theexistence of those industries in a city is influenced by the local availability of skilled workers(Simon 2005).DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 77 though each accounts for only a little over 1 percent of the nation's population. High urban productivity, attributable in large part to the con-centration of manufacturing industry in Shanghai, accounts for that city's 6 percent share of GDP , whereas Beijing's much smaller share reflects the greater intensity of services activities associated with the centralgovernment. T okyo and Singapore are the two leaders with respect to per capita GDP (see table 3.5). However, the total GDP of the T okyo metropolis in 2002 was more than twice the combined total of the five others (seetable 3.6). Seoul ranks second for total GDP , almost twice the level ofShanghai in fourth place.

The apparent decline in the share of manufacturing has been exacerbated by the fall in the relative prices of manufactured goods. Thus, the share of GDP belies the actual change inthe volume and scale of manufacturing activities.were roughly comparable in size in 2003, Beijing's growth rate during the five years preceding 2003 was almost twice that of Bangkok. By 2010, ifnot earlier, it will become the fifth ranked urban economy within this group. Already, Beijing and Bangkok are almost half the size of the econ- omy of Pakistan, and their GDP is substantially larger than that of mostAfrican countries. The key to the rapid growth experienced by the six urban centers between 1980 and 1990\u2014growth that was sustained by all but T okyo through 2000\u2014is the interaction among industrial structure, size, andoutward orientation. The focus on the manufacturing sector promotedthe absorption of technology from domestic and foreign sourcesand raised factor productivity. The size of the cities gave rise to the ag-glomeration economies and made it easier for producers, who initially relied on the domestic market, to achieve scale economies. Openness to trade further widened the market, ensured demand, intensified competi-tive pressures on firms, and in at least four of the six cases\u2014Seoul andT okyo are the exceptions\u2014pulled in foreign direct investment. T ypically, urban areas are richly provided with services, and the six cities are no exceptions. However, manufacturing loomed large in the 1980s, ac-counting for between 30 and 40 percent of the GDP even in T okyo, whichwas at a mature stage of industrialization. The share of manufacturingpeaked in the first half of the 1990s and stabilized in Shanghai and Beijingat 50 and 36 percent, respectively, while declining gradually in the othercities, to be replaced by services. 5The share of services saw tremendous growth in Beijing, increasing from 27 to 62 percent in just over 20 years. Beijing's broad economic structure is quite similar to that of Singapore, where the services sector also accounts for about two-thirds of the city economy. T okyo is by far the most services-intensive city, with 83 percentof its economic activities stemming from that sector in 2002. During thattime period, we can see the forces of change at work, with the footprint ofmanufacturing shrinking because of the migration of industry, the reduc- tion in the relative prices of manufactured products, and the falling coef-ficient of employment for manufacturing industry as a whole. In the most recent period for which data are available\u2014through 2004\u2014 the absolute value of manufacturing is still rising in all but T okyo. Thepace has slowed in Bangkok, Seoul, and Singapore as the sectoral empha- sis of development has begun shifting. In Beijing and Shanghai, however,DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 79 there is no evidence of a letup as the government, while switching some attention to higher-tech industries, continues to invest in manufacturingto stave off a hollowing out of industry. A comparison between T okyo and Shanghai can help highlight the sub- sectoral characteristics of the transition from manufacturing as the leading sector during the industrial phase of development to services in thepostindustrial stage. Thus, the mix of industry can change even in themanufacturing-led phase, as is happening in Shanghai. Even though man- ufacturing accounted for about half of Shanghai's GDP in 2004, the city'scomposition was shifting rapidly toward more capital and skill-intensiveproduction activities. Starting in the early 1990s, T okyo's GDP growth slowed, and the slow- down persisted into the next decade. Although decomposing the various causes of the slowdown is empirically quite difficult, we can see that a good part of the slowdown was the consequence of macroeconomic fac-tors that affected the entire Japanese economy and inevitably impinged onT okyo. However, structural changes associated with postindustrialism arealso slowing the tempo of economic activity. The shrinking role of manu-facturing has reduced the impetus to productivity and to overall growththat the sector can impart. Many of the services that drive the urban econ-omy and that could offset the smaller contribution of manufacturing pro-ductivity are technologically sluggish and have shown meager gains inproductivity. T ogether, these developments have acted as a brake ongrowth (Nordhaus 2006). T wo scenarios, among many, are most plausible. In one, the T okyo economy continues to shed manufacturing jobs, and more industry relo-cates to areas where wages and overhead costs are lower. There is, in ad- dition, a continuing trickle of services being outsourced and a persistenttechnological stagnation in much of the services sector. This scenario is arecipe for medium-term stagnation and long-run decline. A second, more positive scenario can also be read into the industrial sta- tistics. In that view, the share of manufacturing activities stays broadlyconstant or even increases somewhat because of the innovativeness ofthe electronics, IT and robotics, materials, and transport industries.Manufacturing productivity rises steadily, and spillovers benefit otheractivities. Side by side, there is an upsurge in productivity growth in keyservices, such as retail, wholesale, finance, logistics, health, education, andconstruction, with back-office services where the value added is modestbeing sent offshore. With the spread of IT into services, the scope of pro-ductivity improvements is substantial, as evidenced by a wealth of empiri-cal findings from OECD countries. IT, computers, and digitization can80 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES trigger a productivity spiral, inducing the rational redesign of procedures and processes, a delayering of organizations, and an efficient and timelyuse of great volumes of market information. 6 In this scenario, the increasing share of telecommunications, financial, and nonfinancial services, as well as other business services, is a positivedevelopment. If such services link with and reinforce technological ad- vances in manufacturing, growth in T okyo could rise to the levels attained in the early 1990s, if not the late 1980s. Shanghai is in a position to sustain a much higher rate of growth than T okyo. Past trends suggest that an industrial structure that is weighted to-ward manufacturing will be pushed further and faster by productivity and technological changes. However, IT and innovations in processes as wellas in the organization of firms have opened the door to a postindustrialrenaissance in the growth of services. Furthermore, the bias in manufac-turing toward capital and skill intensity, miniaturization of certain types ofproducts, greater reliance on multidisciplinary technologies for product development, and shorter product cycles can breathe new life into high- technology urban manufacturing activities. A postindustrial T okyo withbroad research and manufacturing capabilities is well suited for this role.Shanghai could be, too, possibly a decade from now. HUMAN CAPITAL Without capital, cities cannot build factories, housing, or infrastructure. But without suitable human resources, cities cannot be productive andinnovative or, to put it in different terms, competitive and prosperous. As cities move toward a postindustrial stage, the reliance on human re- sources only increases 7because most of the infrastructure is in place and capital is not generally the binding constraint on growth\u2014it can be raised locally or borrowed from elsewhere. But the quality of the human capital can be pivotal. As Glaeser (2005b, 596) states, \"Skilled people are the key to urban success.\" An empirical analysis of industrial skill intensity in U.S.cities comes to the plausible conclusion that cities beginning from a posi-tion of human capital abundance are more likely to gain in terms of skills,because in such cities more of the new starts will be by entrepreneurs who 6. When IT is merely grafted onto an existing system with processes designed for the preelec- tronic era, the full benefits from computerization and the Internet are difficult to realize, andgains in reducing transaction costs are modest (Rose 2004). 7. See Glaeser and Mare (2001) and Glaeser and Saiz (2003). DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 81 have high levels of education, who will be technologically more advanced, and who will employ a higher proportion of skilled workers. Thus, \"towhosoever hath, to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance.\" 8 And we have the makings of a virtuous spiral that would augment agglom-eration economies by deepening the pool of skills (Berry and Glaeser2005). The literature repeatedly underscores three characteristics. One is youthful dynamism and entrepreneurial risk taking. They are the source of energy, new starts, productivity in the workplace, and high savings thatare transformed into complementary physical capital. A second is the levelof skill and how rapidly the composition of skills can be varied in responseto market demands. A third is creativity, which is associated with skills and level of education, but whereas skills are correlated with productivity andefficiency, creativity is linked to innovation. Clearly, a global city needs a blend of all three characteristics\u2014however, cities that are closer to the postindustrial end of the spectrum are moredependent on the innovativeness of the workforce. At that point in the life cycle, prosperity hinges on better ideas and products rather than on production skills. We hasten to add that the two are not by any meansmutually exclusive. Highly trained people are also the ones more likely tobe innovative. By the same token, the younger age cohorts are on averagemore brimful of ideas. The distinction we would like to draw from thevarious possible blends is that the postindustrial city is less reliant onthe skilled and semiskilled blue-collar production workers, because manyassembly line jobs, whether in manufacturing or in services such as back-office services, have moved away. 9The greatest added value comes, there- fore, from knowledge workers or, as Florida (2002, 2005) describes them, members of a \"creative class.\" Knowledge workers are not the only sources of ideas that generate commercial outcomes or other urban spillover effects, but they have emerged as a major source\u2014especially inthe leading cities. The creativity of knowledge workers is loosely correlated with the workers' level of education, with the heterogeneity and size of the com- munity of such workers, and with the openness of the urban culture to newideas and their circulation. However, the creativity of urban communitiesis an inexact science, with plenty of plausible hypotheses but none that has 8. Matthew 13:12 (King James Version). 9. The manufacturing assembly lines may have gone, but their legacy lingers. After the repre- sentatives of Wipro, one of India's leading IT firms, visited the T oyota subsidiary in Bangaloreto learn about the T oyota Production System, they adopted some of the lessons learned such asthe rearranging of office space to resemble an assembly line. This rearrangement increased thelabor productivity by more than 40 percent (\"T aking a Page\" 2005).82 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES been rigorously proven.10Similarly, the factors responsible for translating urban creativity into consistent commercial advances are fairly hard to pin down, although three types of nuclei are regularly linked to the commer- cial success of innovations. These three are large universities with a strong emphasis on research, major corporations that are technology oriented,and venture capitalists and other providers of business services that serveas handmaidens to the creative industries. However, for the nuclei to ful-fill their role, there is the need for entrepreneurs who can cause clusters of firms to congeal by raising capital from local and external sources and byhelping build the institutions that add to the stickiness of certain urbanlocations for industrial clusters (Feldman, Francis, and Bercovitz 2005;Markusen 1996). The attractions of the industrial cluster are augmentedby the endogenous tendency toward self-perpetuation if not growth. One of the ways self-perpetuation can occur is through the training of new entrepreneurs by existing firms. Having acquired skills and insider knowl-edge, these budding entrepreneurs can go on to set up their own firms,sometimes with the help of contacts in the venture capital industry or withthe backing of their previous employers. As Guiso and Schivardi (2005)note, learning by doing is a key to becoming an entrepreneur. The large,open cities are more likely to harbor and attract people who have anaccumulation of diverse experience, which is noted as being a hallmark ofentrepreneurs (Lazear 2002). The significance of openness is equally im-portant at the level of the firm, although the two are surely interrelated.Research in Europe appears to demonstrate that firms adopting moreopen technology strategies tend to be closer to technology frontiersbecause they are more likely to interact with university-based researchersand overseas universities (Laursen and Salter 2004; Monjon and Waelbroeck 2003) Of course, open cities with most of the ingredients present can still fail to be both innovative and prosperous in economic terms because the pol-icy environment is unfavorable. And there is no doubt that high transac-tion costs and adverse macroeconomic circumstances can undermineurban dynamism\u2014although in the East Asian context, regulatory 10. Creativity is a delicate plant not readily planned into existence. Mommaas (2004, 52) remarks that the \"famous creative quarters such as 1900s Montmartre, 1960 Rive Gauche, and 1970s Sottowere never planned as such. Instead they developed more or less spontaneously out of favorableconditions only identified retrospectively, conditions which were, in many ways related to theirstatus as marginal spaces. Also many of them had a rather transient character. Their cultural suc-cess triggered social, economic, and institutional processes which struck at the roots of their verysuccess as alternative spaces of creativity and innovation.\" The story of Silicon Alley in New Yorkis a recent instance of the waxing and then the partial waning of a creative cluster.DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 83 impediments, limited protection of intellectual property, and weak legal regimes have not generally proven to be serious obstacles to industrial de-velopment. Still, all these issues are of minor or diminishing importance in our six cities, which brings the focus back to the nature of the human re- sources that those cities command or will command. Broadly in line with expectations, the vast majority of school-age chil- dren have been receiving at least primary education in all six cities goingback to 1980. Predictably, the percentage is highest in T okyo and some- what lower in Bangkok. However, by the 1990s, the scores were virtuallyidentical across the cities. Predictably also, the numbers receiving collegeeducation were low everywhere in the early 1980s, although Japan at40 percent was respectable by the standards of the day. Those percentagesbegan climbing steeply in the 1990s and are higher in Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, and Singapore. 11They show that the majority of workers in these cities have basic and even secondary schooling, and a significant proportion have received higher level training. These figures, of course, do not include recent migrants, but their numbers as a share of the total urban population are large only in a few major cities such as Beijing andShanghai. Even the Beijing metro area hardly registers much net in-migration, and the small trickle of migration to the three other citiesincludes numbers of workers with secondary or more education and industrial skills. Of equal importance is the level and composition of skills. In this re- gard, five of the cities are richly endowed in at least industrial skills thathave accumulated and deepened over several decades. By all accounts,T okyo's labor market is highly efficient and provides employers with a wide spectrum of manufacturing and services sectors. Seoul and Singapore are strong in some areas of manufacturing and producer services. Thestrengths of Beijing and Shanghai are concentrated more in manufactur-ing; however, both cities are rapidly deepening their labor marketsfor services. 12Bangkok trails the other cities with respect to level and 11. In China, there were 3.4 million university graduates in 2005, and the number was expected to be 4.1 million in 2006 (Ministry of Education 2005, 2006). 12. Every year, 300,000 or so engineers graduate from China's universities (\"China's Challenge\" 2005). From 30,000 in 1980, the number of scientists and graduates with technical qualificationsclimbed to 1.3 million by 2004 (\"Long March\" 2005). Chinese universities produced morethan 200,000 graduates in computer and information systems in 2004 (\"We've Got the SolidGrounding\" 2005). There is no shortage of software engineers in China. More than half ofthe 1,800 researchers who work for Lucent T echnologies in China are software engineers.However, most Chinese software firms still lack much of the capital, management, and market-ing skills to compete against established international software firms (\"Open Source\" 2005).84 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES diversity of skills because of its narrower base of production activities and its weaker infrastructure for training. T o a remarkable extent, the labor markets of Bangkok and Singapore are being bolstered by the inflows of expatriate workers. That openness is closely associated with economic growth and creativity, as has been widelynoted by, among others, Florida (2005) and Hall (1998) in the context ofcities. Measuring openness is tricky; however, there is some consensusaround the share of the urban population that is foreign born. Urban diversity, as measured by the number of foreign-born workers in a U.S.city, has been shown by Ottaviano and Peri (2004) to enhance the overallproductivity of U.S.-born workers and income accruing through rents.Florida (2005) reports on some of the estimates, in particular the mosaicindex by Benton-Short and Associates (see chapter 1 and Benton-Short, Price, and Friedman 2004). The mosaic index shows that cities such as New York, T oronto, and Dubai are in the lead (figure 1.2). In fact, 8 of thetop 20 cities are in North America, and all but 6 of the remaining ones arein Europe. This situation might change with the entry of some East Asiancities. A very high percentage of researchers in Singapore are expatriates,and Bangkok relies on expatriates for mid- and high-end technical skillsacross many industries. Seoul and T okyo have far smaller communities ofexpatriates, most falling into the managerial and technical categories. InBeijing and Shanghai, the number of expatriates with technical and man-agerial skills is growing fast, with a swelling inflow from around East Asia,Europe, and the United States. More than 90,000 foreigners worked in Beijing in 2004. The presence of so many foreign workers adds an extra dimension to the labor marketsin each of the cities, but those workers are probably contributing most to local innovation in Bangkok and Singapore for two reasons. First, thenumbers are much larger in absolute terms and as a proportion of theskilled urban workforce. Second, many of those workers, particularly inSingapore, are engaged in local research or are affiliated with local institu-tions and businesses. Hence, their direct contribution to urban creativeindustries and to other activities is greater. In the other cities, many expa-triates work for foreign companies in managerial or technical positions,with the majority in a small group of producer services. Because of lan-guage barriers, their interaction with locals and their effect on the localeconomy is necessarily smaller. This situation may change in Beijing andShanghai as more and more foreign-owned research facilities spring upand local English-language skills improve, but so far, the big benefits tolabor markets in the leading Chinese cities derive from the reflux ofChinese nationals who had settled abroad.DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 85 Although the labor markets of Seoul and T okyo are richly supplied with a wide mix of skills, for a whole host of reasons having to do with culture, language, and opportunities for foreigners, these cities have not induced the circulation of knowledge workers from abroad that would contribute significantly to diversity. If heterogeneity of outlooks, frames of reference,ideas, and lifestyles are vital to a many-faceted and enduring creativity,then for all their current strengths, these cities risk falling behind in therace to become innovative. URBAN INNOVATION SYSTEM The labor market\u2014in particular the market for skilled and technical workers\u2014is central to the urban innovation system, but there are otherparts to the apparatus of creativity as well. One of those parts comprises research institutes and universities that conduct research and development (R&D). Several of the cities are richly endowed with such institutions.T able 3.7 shows that while T okyo leads the field in terms of the number ofuniversities. However, the Chinese cities marshal large numbers of re-search entities. Shanghai is a host to 839 research institutes, and there are 267 in Beijing (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2001). 13In recent years, the Singapore government has been promoting R&D activities and, as a consequence, the number of research institutes in the city has increased from 21 in 1990 to 37 in 2000. Firms that engage in R&D are a 13. The number of research institutes in these two cities is in decline following the restructur- ing of public research institutes.

In most countries, they conduct two-thirds or more of all the research and inevitably lead thecommercialization of findings. Data on the number of firms doing re- search at the municipal level are lacking, as are statistics on corporate R&D at the local level. T able 3.8 presents national statistics on patents ap-plied for by a number of East Asian economies and granted in the UnitedStates and should more or less faithfully convey the situation in cities. How well the innovation system performs is measured indirectly by in- dicators such as productivity growth at the national or sectoral levels and the competitiveness of exports. More directly, the performance is reflectedin the output of patents, new products, and scientific articles. Those out-puts are all inexact metrics, especially new products, the characteristics ofwhich are fairly subjective. Moreover, most patents and scientific articles do not have commercial outcomes or significant technological spillovers, and the element of discovery in patents and what a patent representsin terms of scientific investment varies widely among industries such aspharmaceuticals and electronics. Nonetheless, those indicators, alongsidethe data on skilled and scientific workers, help to construct a picture ofinnovative capacity, and the statistics on patents and scientific publicationsare a crude measure of innovative output. They are complementedby actual macroeconomic outcomes. Those economies that have highratios of skilled workers and R&D personnel in the total labor force, thatinvest at least 2 percent of GDP in R&D, and that generate the largestnumber of patents are also among the economies that register a steadyTable 3.8 Number of Patents Granted in the United States, by Economy of Origin, 1964-2004 Economy 1995 2000 2001 2002 2003 311 2,565Singapore 53 218 296 410 427 449 2,547China 62 119 195 289 297 404 2,115Malaysia 7 42 39 55 50 80 436Philippines 4 2 12 14 22 21 266Thailand 8 15 24 44 25 18 223Indonesia 4 6 4794 1 5 5 Vietnam 0 0 0001 1 2 Source: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cst_utl.htm).DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 87 increase in total factor productivity and have sustained industrial compet- itiveness in key areas.14Japan clearly leads the pack with more than 35,000 patents granted in 2004, while T aiwan (China) and Korea received closeto 6,000 patents and 4,500 patents, respectively. Patents granted to resi- dents of Singapore and China in 2004 were still low in number: 449 and 404, respectively. The recent surge in patenting by Korea and T aiwan(China) reflects technological prowess in export-oriented manufacturingsectors and is responsible for the remarkable market penetration by firmssuch as Samsung, LG Electronics, TSMC, Hon Hai Precision, Asustek, Mitac, and Quanta. 15 In the lineup of cities, T okyo is the heavyweight by a wide margin, irre- spective of which indicator is selected. Whether it is the number of uni- versities or the number of patents, T okyo stands apart from the other cities, which is not surprising given Japan's lead over the other countries and its unusually prolific innovation system. Although T okyo is home to14 percent of national universities and 19 percent of private universities(overall, 17 percent of universities), it accounts for close to one-fourth ofundergraduate students, 26 percent of graduate students, and 27 percent of faculties in Japan (MEXT 2004). 16In terms of patents, almost one-half of all the patent applications filed by Japanese residents are from T okyo (175,234 applications from T okyo out of 362,711 total applications), which is why two-thirds of all Japanese attorneys are in T okyo.17 Reflecting the concentration of universities and other higher education institutions in T okyo, university start-ups are also concentrated in T okyo. It has 26 percent of such ventures, while Osaka, with the second largest concentration, has about 7 percent (Bureau of Industrial and Labor Affairs 2005). 14. A paper by Ciccone and Papaioannou (2005) shows that countries with an abundance of human capital adopted more skill-intensive industries and grew more rapidly in the 1980sand 1990s. 15. In 1980, only eight patents were granted to the residents of Korea. This number has steadily increased to more than 4,000 patents in 2004. Most Korean patents are granted for electronicsand computer-related technology. These sectors accounted for 63 percent of patents in 1998. Inaddition, much of the patenting activities are by major chaebols such as Samsung, LG Electron- ics, and Hyundai (Hu and Jaffe 2003). 16. Only one-third of undergraduates who study in T okyo graduated from high schools in T okyo. The remaining students come from other prefectures. 17. There are close to 3,500 patent attorneys in T okyo, accounting for 63 percent of all patent attorneys in Japan (Japan Patent Office 2004). 88 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 18. All the top-ranked Japanese universities are national universities, except for Keio, which is a private university. For almost two decades, Japan has invested nearly 3 percent of GDP in R&D to promote technology absorption and innovation. This high level of investment is apparent in the numbers on T okyo, which stands at the apex of the innovation system. Among the other five highlighted cities, there is strong evidence of intensive efforts at technological catch-up, withthe exception of Bangkok, which is lagging behind in the technology race.In China, Korea, and Singapore, rising expenditures on R&D and skillsdevelopment are funneling resources into the innovation systems of their leading cities, whether into public universities and research institutes orinto private research entities. The top universities in East and South Asia, ranked mainly by their re- search output, are dominated by universities in Japan (see table 3.9). 18 Some of them are also included among the top 100 in a worldwide ranking. They are followed by the top universities from Singapore, Korea, T aiwan(China), China, and Hong Kong (China). Notably missing from the list are universities from other Southeast Asian economies, which are not even listed in the top 500 for the world as ranked by Shanghai JiaotongUniversity. T okyo hosts three of the top-ranking Japanese universities: T okyo University, T okyo Institute of T echnology, and Keio University. Beijing has two of the top Chinese universities: T singhua University and BeijingUniversity. Similarly, Korea's premier universities are located in Seoul. In these East Asian cities, public spending on the innovation system is both complementing and drawing in private investment. The biggestgains are apparent in Beijing and Shanghai, which, starting from a low base, are ratcheting up expenditures on R&D, the training of science and technology workers, and patenting. Both cities have been assisted by theinflow of qualified Chinese researchers trained abroad and by governmentpolicies that have induced foreign companies to plow resources into R&Dfacilities. The quality of the research skills and the value of the patentsnow being generated might still not be up to the standards of industrialcountries; however, with continuing investment and learning, the qualityshould improve. Finland, for instance, went from being a technologicalbackwater in the late 1960s to becoming, through government investmentin the innovation system and complementary corporate effort, one ofEurope's technological leaders in IT and biotechnology. Finland increasedits number of universities from 3 in 1967 to 20 in 2001 and built up clustersDISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 89 of high-tech companies in the Helsinki-Espoo-Vanta-T ampere region, in Oulu, and in T urku (Castells and Ince 2003). In the absence of tried recipes, building an innovation system that but- tresses commercial prosperity must inevitably remain a gamble. Investing in high-level skills is seemingly an absolute necessity for postindustrialcities. This investment needs to be supplemented by spending on research,which harnesses those skills. The share of R&D in Beijing is 6 percent,while that of Shanghai and Singapore is only 2 percent each, although inTable 3.9 Top Universities in East and South Asia, 2005 East and South Asia National Rank Institution World Rank Economy Rank 1 Tokyo University 20 Japan 1 2 Kyoto University 22 Japan 2 3 Osaka University 62 Japan 34 Tohoku University 73 Japan 45 Tokyo Institute of 93 Japan 5 Technology 6-11 Hokkaido University 101-52 Japan 6-96-11 University 101-52 Japan 6-96-11 National University 101-52 Singapore 1 of Singapore 6-11 Seoul National University 101-52 Korea 16-11 Tsukuba University 101-52 Japan 6-9 12-22 National 153-202 (China) 1 University 12-22 Tsinghua University 153-202 China 112-22 Chinese University 203-300 Hong Kong (China) 1-3 Hong Kong 12-22 Hiroshima University 203-300 Japan 10-1312-22 Hong Kong University of 203-300 Hong Kong (China) 1-3 Science and Technology 12-22 Keio 203-300 Japan Beijing University 203-300 China University Hong Kong 203-300 Hong Kong (China) 1-312-22 Yonsei University 203-300 Korea 2 23-47 Indian Institute of Science 301-400 India 1 Source: Adapted from Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiaotong University (http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/ rank/2005/ARWU2005_TopAsia.htm). Note: Spanned rankings mean that a tie exists or that the rankings were determined only as a span.both cities the absolute expenditure on R&D has been growing much faster with the overall rise in city GDP (National Bureau of Statistics ofChina 2001). Whether the outlay of human capital and R&D results in an adequate payoff depends both on the strategic choices with respect to the areas of research, incentives, and institutional mechanisms that lead to theexploitation of promising innovations and on a big dose of luck. In laterchapters, we describe some of the industries that appear at this juncture todeserve the attention of researchers, recognizing that in attempting to identify technology winners, one will inevitably make mistakes. Yet thereare no options. The game must be played and expensive bets be placed.Inevitably, only a few wagers will prove to have been right, but as everyventure capitalist and every business firm knows, the pain of failure is partof the game. INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE No discussion of the innovation system can now be complete without a careful glance at the physical IT infrastructure. Innovation was always de-pendent on access to information and the filtering of the information to isolate the required building blocks of knowledge. The volume of infor- mation has exploded, and the urban innovation system must be able to tapinto the vast and expanding stock of knowledge generated, local as wellas global. 19Effective research is inseparable from the traffic in scientific information among knowledge workers, and such exchanges depend on an infrastructure comprising computers and telecom equipment. Such an in- frastructure is the vascular network of an IT system. Initial tentativeness over whether IT contributes to economic perform- ance has mostly dissipated as evidence accumulates showing that invest- ment in IT explains some of the increase in total factor productivity. ITinvestment typically accounted for between 0.3 and 0.8 percentage points90 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 19. Numerous studies have examined the effect of the growing stock of knowledge on innova- tion. Because knowledge generation is a cumulative process, as the existing stock of knowledgeincreases, it becomes harder to master the existing stock in order to add to that supply. One con-sequence is that it now takes longer to gain a Ph.D. Furthermore, the age at which significantdiscoveries are made is now eight years later than at the beginning of the 20th century (Jones2005a, 2005b). Thus, innovation may be harder to come by. In fact, starting from the 15thcentury, the rate of innovation peaked in the mid-19th century and has been slowly decliningsince (Huebner 2005).DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 91 of growth in GDP from1990 to2000, although the contributions were much higher in certain subperiods (see table 3.10) (OECD 2004b).20 Moreover, the part explained by IT is expanding, especially within themegacity context, not to mention the new markets created by the emer-gence of IT and the wide adoption of broadband connections. Graham and Marvin (2000, 72, 77) observe that \"most IT applications are largely metropolitan phenomena . . . and telemediated flows operate to sustainvery local relations [and] teleworking.\" As a consequence, the importanceattached to computers skills, the development and application of software,and the continuous upgrading of the telecommunications infrastructure to keep in step with new technologies has taken on extreme importance. Theexperience in European and U.S. cities, which is now being replicated inEast Asia, shows that a well-developed communications network is criticalin attracting high-technology investment. 21 A postindustrial city dependent on knowledge-based industries for eco- nomic survival must give due attention to the progressive deepening of IT skills in the workforce and complement those skills with a modern telecommunications system. Anything less risks being left out of the knowledge and production network. 20. The contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to economic growth can be broken down into contributions from ICT-producing sectors and ICT-using sectors.With the rapid increase in the quality of ICT products, the production sector has contributedsignificantly to growth. In the United States, the labor productivity growth of the ICT-producing industry between 1990 and 2001 was 8.7 percent. The ICT-using sectors (mainly re-tail, wholesale, and financial services) also grew rapidly at 4.7 percent during the same period.The difference in growth in the latter sectors set the United States and Europe on differentgrowth trajectories, although Gordon (2004b) attributes this divergence to other institutionalfactors in Europe. Also, the physical investment in IT needs to be complemented by training inIT and by organizational changes and improved management so as to fully use IT (\"Does ITImprove\" 2005; Indjikian and Siegel 2005). 21. Harwit (2005) describes the development of the IT infrastructure in Shanghai and discusses the conditions that could promote future advances.Table 3.10 Contribution of IT Investment in GDP Per Capita Growth, 1990-2000 (percentage points) Country 1990-95 1996-2000 Japan 0.1-0.2 0.4-0.5 Korea 1.4 1.2 0.9-1.0 Source: Adapted from OECD 2004b.92 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Realizing this need, governments in Seoul and Singapore have pushed computerization and have invested heavily in telecom facilities.22To a lesser degree, the other cities are also attempting to increase the leverage derived from a state-of-the-art telecom network. A few indicators can highlight the level of IT development that has occurred and the incredible rapidity with which the new technology has moved to the forefront ofurban priorities. The number of computers as a ratio of the urban population tells one part of the story. Seoul and Singapore are pinning some of their hopes on the spread of computer literacy, with the other cities following butprogress being slowest in Bangkok. Other critical indicators are the num-ber of telephone land lines, although this figure is less important than thenumber of cellular phone users. Mobile telephony has overtaken its land-bound cousin and appears to be the wave of the future. 23Access to high-speed data lines is an index of speed, convenience, and volume of information that can be distributed and opens up new venues for media distribution and shopping as fiber-optics and other broadband connec- tions become more widespread.24China has surpassed Japan with 34 mil- lion broadband lines installed, second only to the United States in 2005 (Reardon 2005).25Although a large number, it represents only 3 percent of the Chinese households, and there is scope for much more expansion. Inboth Beijing and Shanghai, one-third of the population (about 4 million) used the Internet regularly at the end of 2004. In Korea, broadband pen- etration reaches 75 percent of households (Economist Intelligence Unit2005). In all the cities, money is being poured into ever more capaciouspipes for transporting information, including wireless connections. In terms of physical infrastructure, access, and pricing, Seoul and Singapore are in the lead. The rate at which facilities are being created coupled with advances in technology suggests that the physical telecommunications infrastructure will not be a significant constraint on 22. Korea is typically regarded as the most wired country in the world, with 78 percent of house- holds connected through broadband connections. Some factors, such as the concentration ofurban residents in high-rises, facilitated the rollout of broadband connections, and price regula-tions have contributed to the affordability of such connections (Shameen 2004). In addition,Korea also has 35 percent of all wireless hot spots in East Asia (Shameen 2004). 23. Shanghai had more than 11 million cellular phone users in 2004 (Harwit 2005).24. In Korea, 12 percent of shopping takes place online (Economist Intelligence Unit 2005).25. The number of subscribers in China is now close to 40 million (Economist Intelligence Unit 2006). The number of broadband installations in Japan in 2003 was 17.2 million (EconomistIntelligence Unit 2005). It was 12 million in Korea (Shameen 2004). In contrast, less than 5 per-cent of Thais in 2003 had Internet access, and there were only 200,000 broadband lines(Shameen 2004).DISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 93 the productivity of the innovation system in any of the six cities. The con- straints will arise from the capability of the researchers and firms to createusable knowledge from the virtually limitless volume of information that has suddenly been brought within reach of anyone with a personal com- puter and an Internet connection. Although infrastructure investment is an important first step, taking advantage of the availability of such infrastructure depends on the businessand regulatory environment and the existence of supporting industries. T able 3.11 shows the e-readiness ranking of East Asian economies basedon a composite index of various factors. The ranking did not change dra-matically between 2004 and 2005, although Hong Kong (China) andSingapore swapped the top places. Japan saw its ranking move up by fourplaces, mainly through an improvement in network security, while Korea's ranking declined by four places because of weaker network security and a lack of entrepreneurship (Economist Intelligence Unit 2005). Among cities in Japan, T okyo has the highest density of broadband con- nections with 38 percent of households subscribing to such a service. (Thenational average is 27 percent; see table 3.12 for further details about con-nections in Japan.) Losing patience with the slow rollout of affordablebroadband connections by the incumbent local telephone and cable com-panies, many municipalities in the United States are now investing inbroadband infrastructure and offering it to residents, a direction cities inAsian countries might also take.

Cities that are attempting to increase the share in urban GDP ofskill-intensive creative industries will need a particular ambiance. They will require an environment that suits a workforce heavily weighted to- ward individuals with tertiary education who are mostly in the upper in-come deciles and are geographically mobile. Members of this creativeclass, as Florida (2002) has categorized them, are seeking an assortment ofurban attributes. The quality and cost of housing, health services, and schooling and the incidence of crime make up one set of concerns, whichare uppermost for any group of workers and not just the technically qual-ified. 27However, for knowledge workers, Florida maintains that the recreational amenities, the cleanliness of the environment, and the state of the physical infrastructure (transportation and telecommunications, for example) also loom large. Finding quantitative indicators of those attributes for the East Asian cities is a tall order. A small scattering of statistics and impressions must suf- fice. The cost-of-living index, which gives most weight to housing, is steepfor several of the selected cities. Bangkok is at the lower end of the spec- trum. At the opposite end is T okyo, which is the most expensive city in theworld (\"Cost of Living Index\" 2005). 28Seoul predictably is second from the top, followed closely by Singapore and Shanghai, where housing costs have been rising sharply. Bangkok's relative price advantage has made it a favorite for expatriates living in East Asia. Many maintain a permanent apartment in Bangkok and use it as a base for business ventures in Chinaand other parts of East Asia. Housing and other services are cheaper inBangkok, and the city's bustle and exuberance ( joie de vivre ) is a big draw for itinerant knowledge workers. Bangkok's openness to foreigners and its di- versity also gives it an edge over the other cities in this important respect. 29 27. The decline in the crime rate significantly enhanced New York's \"livability.\" In 1990, there were 2,290 murders in the city. By 2004, the number had dropped to 566 (\"T own of the T alk\"2005). 28. Living in T okyo is more than 40 percent more expensive than living in New York, while the cost in Bangkok is 40 percent lower than in New York (\"Cost of Living Index\" 2005). 29. Bangalore, the center of India's foray into the global software industry, seems to be moving toward clamping down on entertainment venues, which gives zest to Bangalore's night life. Forinstance, the dance floor of T aika, a Thai-themed restaurant and bar in Bangalore, used to bepacked with more than 500 people, many of them engineers, consultants, and call-centeremployees in Bangalore. However, following the passage of the Licensing and Controlling ofPublic Entertainment Order in July 2005, the dance floor has been empty. The law itself doesnot ban dancing, but it introduces stricter safety, building, and lighting requirements such thatnone of the 60 applicants so far have been granted a license (\"Often Footloose\" 2005).96 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 3.14 Mathematics Scores from TIMSS-R, 1999 Higher than international Economy Math score Math rank average?

East Asian schools emphasize rote learning and strict class dis-cipline. Students receive a thorough grounding in mathematics and thesciences on which new ideas can be built. But creativity is not a strongpoint of the East Asian countries. Singapore and now Bangkok have begun offering world-class medical services and have become major destinations for medical tourism. Health care services in Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, and T okyo are also of a highDISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 97 order. Moreover, costs are moderate relative to Europe and the United States if the aggregate outlay as a percentage of GDP is an approximateguide (see figure 3.2). Rates of urban crime in East Asian cities are toward the lower end of the international spectrum, although in several cities the incidence of crime has risen as those cities have grown in size. Size and the influx of migrantsare correlated with crime, which might explain the increase in propertycrime in Beijing and Shanghai over the past decade (Messner, Liu, and Karstedt 2005). Nonetheless, these cities are safe by the standards of globalmegacities. T able 3.16 provides a ranking based on what are usually con-servative official statistics, showing Beijing as the city with the lowestcrime rate and Seoul as the one with the highest. 30 Among other environmental indicators, air pollution is one on which good standardized data are available.

The other cities have managed to check\u2014or, in the case of T okyo, reverse\u2014the deterioration in air quality, but standardsare in the moderate range even in Singapore, in part because of smoke from fires in nearby Sumatra that are used to clear the land under the remaining forest cover for oil palm cultivation. All six cities now have world-class shopping and dining facilities. Beijing and Shanghai, both of which only a decade ago were drab industrial citieswith no charm and little to offer by way of culture, have improved dramatically. Bangkok and T okyo, each in its own way, hold the pole posi-tions. For recreation and culture, the Chinese cities are catching up fast,although their parks, green spaces and outdoor recreation, climate, andcongestion are and probably will remain problem areas. Bangkok, Seoul,and Singapore have dedicated urban parkland, but these areas cannot count as major attractions. In sum, each of the cities is a star in the national context. Even by international standards, they merit high scores on all counts except air quality and traffic congestion. For the international knowledge worker,the issues might be ones of openness and the familiarity of the locals withEnglish. Most Singaporeans are bilingual in English and Mandarin or anative tongue; Bangkok is more open and freewheeling. The other fourcities are less user friendly to foreigners. INVESTING IN GROWTH, ATTRACTING TALENT As the transition to postindustrialism gathers momentum, city govern- ments and national governments are coming to recognize that differentstrategies are needed. Although capital and infrastructure will continue toDISAPPEARING MANUFACTURING 99 contribute to economic growth, blends favoring venture capital and infra- structure for recreational amenities deserve more emphasis. Furthermore,as the hold of manufacturing on the six cities weakens further, talent- and creativity-feeding services and high-tech industries are emerging as the drivers of growth in the leading cities. Those services and industriesare linked to the quality of the innovation system and its openness. Andthe openness attracts talent depending on the quality of the urban experi-ence that is offered.Since about the early 1950s, the field of medicine has been trans- formed by revolutions, first in the field of bioengineering andmore recently in biogenetics. The bioengineering revolution in- troduced new imaging equipment, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, into everyday use; made a wide range of medical implants, from valves to pacemakers, available for patients; andbrought devices such as the heart-lung machine and apparatus for he-modialysis into hospitals and clinics. This revolution is being renewed by advances in biogenetics, which promise new and more potent drugs andreplacement parts that exactly mimic the enzymes and organs of the hu-man body (Citron and Nerem 2004). With so much excitement in the air, the lure of the health products and services industries for a postindustrial city can be almost irresistible. It is widely assumed that, as incomes rise, so too will the demand for health care\u2014and possibly much more than is proportional\u2014as people seek toimprove the quality of what are increasingly longer life spans (Murphy andT opel 2005). 1Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the United States spends the most on health care\u2014more than 16 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005.2The Asia region, by comparison, spends only 6 percent of its GDPCHAPTER 4 DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 1. Murphy and T opel (2005) argue that longevity has yielded enormous gains, which they esti- mate to equal US$1.2 million per person during the 20th century. According to them, a 1 percentfall in cancer mortality would be worth US$500 billion. 2. In spite of this vast expenditure, 45 million lack medical insurance and 52 million are being supported by a limping Medicaid program (P . Webster 2006). At current rates of growth, U.S.spending on health care is projected to reach close to 19 percent of GDP by 2014.

If we lookahead, the trend is most definitely going to be upward (\"Health Spending\" 2003). Nowhere are these tendencies more striking than in the major cities, where incomes are also higher on average and where sedentarylifestyles are making more people susceptible to chronic ailments. Modernmedicine frequently cannot cure these maladies of advancing age, but it isameliorating them, which allows those with access to the latest drugs and medical technologies to enjoy a much healthier older age. 3The availabili- ty of new medications and procedures has been made possible by a readi- ness on the part of individuals\u2014and the wealthier societies\u2014to cover the cost of ever more sophisticated health care. That readiness has contributed to the high and consistent profitability of the pharmaceutical industryworldwide during the past two decades. With the number of people in the upper age groups expected to rise sharply in the coming decades and with the deciphering of the human genome having potentially multiplied the avenues for attacking diseasesand partially negating the process of aging, the biomedical industry is anatural candidate for a postindustrial metropolis looking for a growth en-gine. Biotechnology affects many other industrial fields, such as medicine,informatics, 4materials science, agriculture, and engineering, and these in- tersections can magnify the gains. For instance, the rising demand for health care means that there is an expanding market for new biogenetic drugs, for bioengineered implants or replacement body parts, and for bioinformatics that make possible the computerized processing of data ondeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. The marriage of data-processing are responsible for this increase, which to a greater or lesser extent will also exert an upward pressure on the currently much lower rates of spending in other countries. The first is theincreasing prevalence of lifestyle conditions and age-related chronic conditions, combined withthe lowering of thresholds for medical intervention (for example, for blood pressure andcholesterol). The second is the advent of new and often costly treatments (Heffler and others2005; Reinhardt, Hussey, and Anderson 2004; Thorpe 2005). Whether a rationing of such treat-ments might need to be enforced in even the wealthiest countries is a question being debated,and if it comes to pass, there will be feedback effects on the level and direction of research anddevelopment. 3. For the contribution of new medications toward extending life expectancies in the United States and for a cost-benefit analysis of their advances, see Lichtenberg (2002, 2004) andLichtenberg and Virabhak (2002). 4. Developments in information technology that facilitate electronic keeping of medical records, online health education, and some level of patient-doctor interaction have the potential of sav-ing an immense amount of resources\u2014up to US$165 billion annually in the United Statesaccording to one estimate.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 103104 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES capacity with much more penetrating medical diagnostics promises to improve the prediction of disease in later life and to prompt early remedialaction to prevent chronic diseases that are expensive to treat (\"Prognosis of Healthy Profits\" 2006). T ransgenic technologies are revolutionizing crop production, the nutritive content of food crops, and food processing.And organic light-emitting diodes for flat screen televisions and organicdiodes for lasers are among the fruitful outcomes of the marriage ofbiology and electronics. This technology can enormously increase the ef- ficiency with which energy is converted into light. 5Biotechnology may not be as subject to scale economies as some of the more traditional industries, nor does it benefit from the network economies that have boosted the sales of Internet- and telecommunications-related products; however, it could provide fertile ground for many more niche products,making it especially attractive to firms in countries where local or regionalmarkets are smaller. BIOTECHNOLOGY RISING The recent, relatively short history of the biotechnology industry, mainly in the United States, encourages metropolitan scale economies to aspiretoward a homegrown biotech sector that can compete in the global mar- ketplace. T o understand why Singapore is willing to place large bets on cultivating a world-class biotechnology industry, a process that could takea decade or more, we need to familiarize ourselves with the recipethat policy makers are reading. This recipe is an unusual one in that itplaces an advanced science-based industry potentially within the reach of a small, late-starting economy that lacks both a long tradition of academ-ic research in organic chemistry and indigenous corporate researchand development (R&D) and marketing capabilities in the field ofpharmaceuticals. The essentials of biotechnology are taught in leading schools through- out the world, but biotechnology as a viable industry has taken root inonly a handful of urban economies richly endowed with universities andresearch centers. The leading contenders among those economies areBoston, Massachusetts; San Diego and San Francisco, California; the 5. Standard incandescent bulbs convert only 10 percent of the energy supplied into light. Fluorescent bulbs convert 70 percent. Organic light-emitting diodes could convert even more(\"Organic LEDs\" 2005).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 105 Washington, D.C., area; and the Research T riangle in North Carolina. Smaller clusters have sprung up in Finland, France, India, Switzerland,and the United Kingdom. 6Nevertheless, it is the U.S. experience that entices late-starting economies. Progress in biotechnology and its several affiliated subdisciplines, more so than advances in other fields such as electronics and engineering, is closely linked to basic scientific research. The roots of biotechnology lie inuniversity labs. In fact, the production of chemicals is the earliest science-based industry, and owes its origins to the research done in German uni-versities in the late 19th century. 7This research made Germany the world's leading producer of chemical products, and the findings that emerged from university and corporate labs through the early decades of the 20th century kept Germany at the forefront of innovation in the field of chem- icals.8It was the fruitfulness of research conducted in the U.S. universities in the 1920s that prompted pharmaceutical companies to invest in their own laboratories and to enter into collaboration with universities.9Over time, this relationship has deepened and become more complementary;universities, generally with substantial financial backing from the state, concentrate on the vital basic research, and companies devote more of their energies to the downstream work of isolating promising moleculesand engage in their development and marketing for targeted maladies.Where medical biotechnology has traveled from the lab and entered thecommercial arena, it is by virtue of the mediating role played by senior scientists. The icon of the biotechnology sector\u2014Genentech\u2014was found-ed by a scientist at the University of California-Berkeley, who made 6. T wo interesting and relevant examples of budding clusters are in T urku, Finland, and in Pune, India. In the case of T urku, the emergence of a cluster is based not only on investment in researchin the university sector but also on the prior existence in the area of pharmaceutical, materials,and food-processing industries (Srinivas and Viljamaa 2003). The cluster in Pune depends onthe existence of the National Chemical Laboratory (Basant and Chandra 2005). 7. Felix Hoffman's synthesizing of acetylsalicylic acid in the laboratories of the German dye maker Bayer was arguably the event that gave rise to the pharmaceutical industry (Santos 2003).The dyestuffs industry was located adjacent to the silk and textile industries in France andGermany, which is why some of the early discoveries were in cities such as Basel, Switzerland,which lies on the crossroads of France and Germany (Pisano 2002). 8. Germany also emerged as a leader in the pharmaceutical industry. However, during the past decade, Germany's fragmented pharmaceutical industry, with its many medium-size firms, isfacing difficulties competing with the giant multinational corporations that dominate the busi-ness (\"T oo Little, T oo Late\" 2006). 9. Mowery (1990) traces the spread of corporate research to the U.S. government's antitrust policies that encouraged firms to seek profitable avenues for diversification.106 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES recombinant DNA a reality, and his venture capitalist partner.10This pat- tern has persisted. All too frequently the gems of the biotech world are being discovered in the university labs, and because the invariably time- consuming process of commercialization often calls for continuing scien- tific inputs, academic researchers are generally the ones who give birth tobiotech firms, frequently in conjunction with a financial sponsor. In other words, a local biotech industry or a major research institute such as the Scripps and Salk Institutes in San Diego and the National In- stitutes of Health (NIH) in Washington, D.C., 11is inseparable from a leading research university with a focus on the life sciences, such as the University of California-San Diego, the University of San Francisco, and Johns Hopkins University. As just one example, the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore have 2 major universities and 26 otherinstitutions offering a basic degree in bioscience or more (Feldman andFrancis 2003). The industry tends to be localized because uncodifiedknowledge at the scientific frontier diffuses slowly and mainly through face-to-face exchanges. The entry and clustering of firms is relatively moreimportant in the biotech subsector because growth is more dependent onthe inflow of new firms and less on the growth of existing ones. Moreover,small biotech firms are more reliant on other firms, on universities, and ona support infrastructure (Niosi and Banik 2005; Van der Voort and De Jong 2004; Zhang and Patel 2005). Although the leading university is one part of the picture, the success of such a university in triggering the development of a biotech cluster rests in no small part on the presence of star scientists with an entrepreneurialbent, whose labs are the loci of significant discoveries, who attract talentedresearchers and funding, and whose reputations are supported by a longlist of frequently cited articles. When it comes to commercialization ofscientific findings and the financing of nascent start-ups, reputation andthe record of publications clearly count in finding backers and winningcredibility in the marketplace (Niosi and Banik 2005; Smilor and others2005; Zhang and Patel 2005). Because star scientists need an environment that is conducive to re- search and its commercialization, a third element must be added to the 10. Before the discovery of recombinant DNA (rDNA), it was not possible to manufacture proteins or large molecule-based compounds in quantity. Hence, most drugs were based onorganic compounds and the assembly of simple small molecules, with the exceptions being asmall number of antibiotics. However, rDNA and advances in monoclonal antibodies and com-binatorial chemistry have greatly widened the scope for drug development (Pisano 2002). 11. See Biotechnology Information Institute (1994).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 107 recipe, again from a reading of the U.S. experience. Prolonged and costly research on biotechnology cannot be supported from the resources of auniversity alone, or even from the lavish support of foundations in the United States. It needs government backing on an extensive scale, and the National Science Foundation and NIH have funded 75 percent of thebasic research in the life sciences, paving the way for a succession of path-breaking discoveries. 12In addition, the life sciences also receive funding from the Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, Depart- ment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institute of Standards and T echnology (Feldman and Francis 2003). Nearly three-fourths of all papers cited in industrial patentdocuments were financed by the U.S. federal government (Narin,Hamilton, and Olivastro 1997). But the government has done much morethan simply provide the grants that have fueled decades of fundamental research. T o spur industrial activity, it has encouraged universities to li-cense and patent federally funded research through a series of legislativeinitiatives, among which the Stevenson-Wydler and the Bayh-Dole Actsof 1980 were the landmark steps. In turn, universities have encouragedstaff members to be innovative and enterprising by helping them to license and patent their findings, by encouraging consulting, by setting up university-owned businesses, by embarking on a variety of collaborativearrangements with researchers in private institutes and throughout theworld, and by being flexible in assigning teaching obligations\u2014and gener-ous with granting leave as well\u2014so that faculty can pursue research projects. Capping all of this government support and institutional incentives is the system for protecting intellectual property. In a field such as biotech-nology, where many years, if not decades, separate the discovery at the sci-entific bench from a commercial product, affordably priced and crediblyenforced patent protection is essential for translating scientific discoveriesinto innovations, some of which might ultimately lead to viable productsand even to blockbuster drugs. The story of biotechnology in the United States would be incomplete without reference to five other crucial handmaidens. First, and foremost, is risk capital. Drug discovery is expensive, and it takes a long and painstak-ing search through molecule libraries to identify candidate molecules andto go from discovery to regulatory approval (Santos 2003). In the UnitedStates, only 5 out of 250 compounds graduate from clinical to human trial 12. The public funding that became available in large amounts after the 1970s in the United States imparted a strong impetus to biotech developments (Pisano 2002).108 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES phases (Danzon, Nicholson, and Pereira 2005). The estimates of the cost of developing new drugs in the United States can be as much as US$1 bil-lion (in 2000 dollars) (C. Adams and Brantner 2004; DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski 2003). 13A biotech start-up with a promising idea must find patient capital for the teething years, when the start-up is burning cash. Financing comes from government bodies such as the Small Business In- novation Research program or state-level agencies and venture capitalists that see the need to support firms from inception, possibly through themezzanine stage. Undergirding these sources are public institutions thathave made the venture capital industry\u2014including angel investors\u2014in itsmany manifestations a vast and dynamic force in the United States\u2014a force, moreover, that is inextricably associated with technological advancesin information technology, electronics, and biotechnology. Second, large corporations\u2014in particular pharmaceutical giants\u2014play a role that is somewhat complementary to that of venture capitalists in theUnited States. Aside from spending vast sums on R&D themselves, the big pharmaceutical companies have more often than not taken a biotech product to fruition using their immense development and marketingcapabilities. In the process, by buying up small biotech companies, theyhave richly rewarded the scientist entrepreneurs and their initial financiersby providing one of two essential keys to the incentive system, the otherbeing the initial public offering on the financial market. 14 Third, budding biotech companies need financing, but they also need space for their laboratories and initial-batch production facilities.15These facilities can often be of a specialized nature not readily available through the commercial sector. In the key biotech centers in the United States, the problem has been tackled by way of incubators, mostly set up by universi- ties or state governments and by the creation of science parks, whichinclude the requisite specialized facilities. Science parks may be set upeither by universities or by municipalities, with or without the participation 13. However, there are large variations among drugs for different symptoms and among differ- ent firms. For instance, the average cost of new drugs for HIV/AIDS is US$479 million, whilethat for rheumatoid arthritis is US$936 million. Some firms spend only US$500 million or so ondevelopment of a new drug, while other firms may spend upward of US$2 billion (C. Adams andBrantner 2004). Serious questions have been raised by Light and Warburton (2005) as to howthese costs are calculated, including the opportunity cost of capital committed. 14. The big pharmaceutical firms are key players, if not in exploration, then in the exploitation of new findings (Cooke 2005; Santos 2003). 15. In fact, the supply of new biotechnology-engineered medicines has been constrained by shortages of highly specialized production capacity (\"Demand Far Outstrips Supply\" 2002).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 109 of private developers. Such arrangements have enabled biotech firms, both start-ups and more mature firms, to find the accommodation that matchestheir requirements at each stage of their development. 16 Fourth, biotech firms that are taking aim at the medical marketplace must fine-tune and test their products. They require real-time feedbackfrom the users and ultimate recipients of their products and need clues to guide the development of a piece of equipment or a drug delivery system or to direct the targeting of a molecule. Such feedback is facilitated by theproximity of a network of hospitals\u2014preferably teaching hospitals such asthose in San Francisco and Boston\u2014that are geared to conduct researchexperimentation and are staffed with professionals motivated to push the boundaries of medical science. Biotech companies can emerge and evenflourish in a variety of environments. However, the nature of their busi-ness is such that an adjacent, strong hospital complex is a great asset, andall the notable biotech clusters in the United States\u2014for example, the onein Washington, D.C., metropolitan area \u2014benefit from the presence of a hospital network that is supportive of medical innovation. Fifth, biotech firms rely on an array of other research and professional service providers, including suppliers of reagents and test kits, lawyers,headhunters, management consultants, marketing specialists, and manyothers. 17The collective efforts of these varied professionals are critical to the occasional success of the exotic offerings of the biotechnology industry. T ypically, these elite professionals seek an environment that suits their tastes and is congruent with their incomes and lifestyles. Hence, the geog- raphy of the biotech industry in the United States is determined not just bythe presence of world-class research universities and hospital centers butalso by where certain kinds of professional elites, angel investors, venturecapitalists, and the biotech entrepreneurs themselves want to live. Invari- ably, they prefer metropolitan areas in some of the choicest locations\u2014ones that are richly endowed with recreational amenities; high-qualityhousing, schooling, and public services; and relatively mild weather. Thereare many world-class universities in the United States that have failed to at-tract biotech clusters or any industrial clusters. Sometimes these clusters form elsewhere because of a university philosophy that deliberately eschews commercial involvement and focuses exclusively on academic 16. See Walcott (1999) on the role of developers and the transport network in the development of the biotechnology industry around Atlanta, Georgia. 17. In fact, services companies catering to the needs of the NIH and local hospitals provided a springboard for the development of the biotech industry in the Washington, D.C., metropolitanarea (Feldman and Francis 2003).110 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES achievements, as in the case of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland (Feldman and Martin 2004). More often, as in the case of YaleUniversity, the University of Pennsylvania, and Carnegie Mellon Univer- sity, it is because the urban surroundings and mix of amenities simply do not attract the assortment of talented people who are the makings of adynamic biotech industry (O'Mara 2005). New Haven, Connecticut, wasonce a thriving and attractive city\u2014the 16th-ranked industrial city in theUnited States as recently as 1950. T oday, it is an impoverished and blighted urban area that can derive no energy or commercial boost from thepresence of the second-ranked university in the United States (Rae 2003).Similarly, the lack of space for industry and the concentration of low-income households in the immediate neighborhood have prevented theUniversity of Pennsylvania from catalyzing a cluster of high-tech firms in its Philadelphia locale. Broadly, this summary shows how the biotechnology industry sim- mered into existence in the United States. In just 25 years, the industry has advanced from Genentech in 1979 to 1,500 firms, including some verylarge ones such as Biogen Idec, Amgen, and Chiron. The industry nowemploys 187,500 people and has a turnover of US$46 billion. It attractedUS$4.9 billion in venture capital in 2004, and it generates more than 7,000patents annually. 18Biotechnology is a hive of activity in the United States. The institutions\u2014and individuals\u2014that are plowing billions of dollars into the industry clearly believe that its long-run prospects are exception- ally bright. But the dark and open secret is that most biotech firms make no profit; they burn through investors' cash in pursuit of wonder drugsand exotic medical implants, but so far their commercial success is meager. BIO-SINGAPORE Singapore has swallowed the promise and is systematically implementing the U.S. model on a scale appropriate for its size.19In its efforts to diversify industry and move up the technology ladder, the government views 18. Biotechnology Industry Organization, \"Biotechnology Industry Facts,\" (http://www.bio .org/speeches/pubs/er/statistics.asp). 19. A study of technological prowess and innovativity in eight OECD countries shows that the smaller ones, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, are in the lead and that biotech is a fertilesource of innovations (OECD 2006). Ireland, with a population comparable to Singapore's3.9 million, is also pursuing a pharmaceuticals cum biotech cluster (\"Dublin Thinks\" 2003), as isFinland in the vicinity of T urku.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 111 biotechnology as the industrial driver with the best job and export prospects, given Singapore's resource base, the emerging demands forhealth care in the Southeast Asian region, and the industry's continuing, possibly growing need for innovating smaller players. Having built tertiary-level teaching institutions for nearly three decades, Singapore now has the capacity to train researchers and expose them to basic research in the university environment. There is now a poolof local talent, and plans are being implemented to make it grow. The National University of Singapore has embraced the model of an entrepre-neurial university (\u00e0 la the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology) and hasintroduced courses to instill the entrepreneurial spirit in its graduates(Etzkowitz 2002; Wong 2006a). Moreover, public health and hospitalfacilities are well equipped and efficiently staffed. The hospital infrastruc- ture, whether or not it is affiliated with universities, is a source of demand for products, offers arenas for testing new therapies, and makes it possiblefor researchers to practice medicine part time, giving them valuablepractical knowledge. The Singapore government has begun investing instate-of-the-art laboratory facilities and bidding for experienced foreignresearchers, including star scientists. The city-state has established astrong production base for pharmaceuticals. It has set up incubators tosupply the space and some of the patient risk capital to help new firms tomake a start, and the government is offering large foreign firms attractivefiscal incentives in the hope that they could become the source of spinoffsand the axes for a cluster. Singapore's robust legal system and efficientcourts underpin rules protecting intellectual property rights that areamong the best designed and most effectively enforced in Asia. Last but not least, in Southeast and South Asia, the market for block- buster medications is on the rise as the ailments of affluence, such as cancer, heart disease, and obesity (\"Of Mice and Men\" 2003), becomemore widespread. At the same time, there are also many substantial nichemarkets for drugs and vaccines to treat conditions specific to the region,including a number of infectious diseases endemic to tropical regions.This niche could be profitable for Singapore because only 1 percent of the1,400 new drugs approved for commercial purposes during 1975 to 1999were for tropical diseases, which afflict the vast majority of the world'spopulation and kill millions each year. In large part, that lack of tropicaldisease-oriented drugs is because the major companies see little profit andmany risks from investing in medications for people with limited buyingpower (Farlow 2005; Kremer 2000). Their reluctance to enter those thinmarkets opens the door for smaller companies that are less encumberedwith overhead and high expectations regarding profits and that have the112 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES staying power and can mobilize the talent. These are not trifling condi- tions, but they also challenge companies to evolve technologies and seekbreakthroughs (\"Exotic Pursuits\" 2003).

They present challenges for researchers in Southeast Asia, with the avianflu emerging as a peculiarly deadly threat in 2005 and 2006 (\"Vietnam'sWar\" 2005). However, more than researchers face challenges because thefinancing of the development and the pricing and purchasing of the vac-cines for widespread use all pose difficult hurdles for firms, insurers, and governments (see Coleman and others 2005; Hinman 2005; Kremer 2000; Pauly 2005). Novartis in Singapore focusingon dengue fever and multidrug-resistant TB. 20These smaller markets offer opportunities for new start-ups from a Singaporean cluster. Are the chances for newcomers to the biomedical and pharmaceutical industry improving, or are the odds against commercial success lengthen- ing? Certainly the declining number of first- or second-in-class drugs, theproliferation of copycat drugs, the limited offerings of the leadingbiomedical companies, and the human and financial toll inflicted by block-buster drugs, such as Vioxx, that have caused complications, raise concerns. 21Moreover, the purportedly rising costs of development and testing of new drugs and the increasing resistance to the rising retail costs of drugs all argue against Singapore's industrial strategy. Still, there is another side to the picture, which is appreciably brighter. There are three reasons for viewing the glass as being half full. First is the persistent evidence that small start-ups, many by university-basedresearchers, are a major conduit for discoveries in the medical field. Thosestart-ups frequently must join forces with the giants to test and market their findings, but they are the sources of the products. Second, recentfindings raise questions about the claims made that bringing a drug to themarket can take 12 years or more and can cost between US$800 millionand US$1.5 billion. Light and Warburton (2005) estimate that oncecapital costs are readjusted and the initial contribution of academic 20.

Customizing drugs for smaller target groupswith specific genetic characteristics will further reduce the outlay Finally\" 2005; \"Drugs Get Smart\" 2005; Based on international experience and Singapore's own track record with the electronics industry, the case for targeting the biotech industry is, in principle, a good one. The government is carefully assembling the individual ingredients with fairly lavish upfront expenditures. What are the chances that the effort will succeed, and can biotechnology fulfillthe needs of the island-state for a reliable engine of growth and employ-ment? T o answer that, we first need to review what has been achieved todate and then examine the odds that the government and industry must overcome. Scaling the Heights of Biotech The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals in Singapore was initiated by Glaxo which, in 1982, established an operation to produce the activeingredient for Zantac. A few other investments followed, which prepared the ground for the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology (IMCB), founded in 1987 (Finegold, Wong, and Cheah 2004), and for the Biopro-cessing T echnology Center Incubator Unit some 10 years later (\"Of Miceand Men\" 2003). Since then, the biomedical and pharmaceutical industry has emerged as the fourth pillar of the Singapore economy, along with electronics, chemicals, and engineering, with output from that industry amountingto S$12 billion and value added was S$7 billion in 2003 (see table 4.1)(\"Singapore's Man\" 2004). 23The target for 2015 is set at US$15 billion (\"Irresistible Force\" 2005). In 2004, biomedical manufacturing, including pharmaceuticals and medical technology, accounted for 2.6 percent of employment, 9.1 percent of output, and 21.3 percent of the value added in total manufacturing (see table 4.2). This industry is a capital-intensive 22. The use of genomic markers being developed by the science of pharmacogenomics to deter- mine drug response will, if successful, significantly cut costs (Vernon and Hughen 2005). 23. Much of the manufacturing of these drugs is done by the major pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, and GlaxoSmithKline (\"Singapore: Pharma Industry\" 2004).114 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 24. The opportunities for small but significant advances in implantable devices are legion. Thus, the effectiveness of cardiac pacemakers has been steadily enhanced by the introduction of dualchamber devices and rate response algorithms and by improvements in the implantability ofsensors for optimal response (T rohman, Kim, and Pinski 2004). However, the problem withone, with average capital per worker of close to S$1 million in 2003 and with average output per firm of S$255 million, both significantly higherthan the average for all manufacturing in Singapore (Wong 2005). The government's strategy is to create an entire value chain in Singapore rather than to focus on just one aspect of the biotech complex. If it suc- ceeds, far more of the value adding and employment benefits can beinternalized. Among the subcomponents of the biotech sector thatSingapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) wants to develop are biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, 24health care services,Table 4.1 Output and Value Added of the Singapore Biomedical Industry, 1997-2004 (S$ million) Year Manufacturing output Value added 1997 2,600 1,900 1998 4,000 2,700 1999 \u2014 /H11005not available.

The strategy is being put through its paces on some land set aside for this purpose near the National Universityof Singapore and its medical facilities. Biopolis An investment of US$286 million has resulted in a complex of sevenconnected buildings called Biopolis 25that houses five public institutes spe- cializing in fields such as informatics, bioengineering, and cell biology (seetable 4.3). Biopolis sits on 18.5 hectares within a much larger develop- ment, which is called One North Science Park covers more than 200 hectares (\"Game Is On\" 2004; T an and Phang 2005). 26Underneath Guidant's pacemakers also points to the risks of these devices and the associated liability costs. Cochlear implants and various kinds of \"electronic pills,\" implantable pumps, and electrodes arealso coming into wider (\"Eat Your Own\" 2003; \"Listen\" 2005). Some companies specializ-ing in imaging, such as Olympus and Canon, are teaming up with biotech firms to devise tech-niques for cancer detection (\"Cangen Finds Niche\" 2005). 25. The building of One North Science Park is modeled after Silicon Valley (Koh and Wong 2005). Singapore is quick off the mark to build the physical infrastructure for new clusters in thehope that the businesses that will populate those clusters will materialize, whether from abroador from within the local economy. T wo other recent examples are the S$667 million EsplanadeTheatres on the Bay, which were constructed in 2002 to \"put Singapore on the map for arts andcultural tourism\" (Yeoh 2005, 949). The other complex is Suntec City, a S$2 billion project tobuild a services and entertainment complex housed in five office towers, a mall, and an exhibi-tion center. Whether the high value adding activities can be attracted and made to put downroots is debatable, but the physical environment has been created with careful attention to detail. 26. The Singapore government plans to invest S$15 billion to develop One North as the R&D center for scientists and researchers in three industries: biomedical science, information tech-nology, and media (T an and Phang 2005).Table 4.3 Biomedical Public Research Institutes in Singapore, December 2002 Year Size of Number of Number of Institute established staff publications patents filed Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology 1987 380 987 206 Bioprocess Internship Programme 1990 126 67 3 Genome Institute of Singapore 2000 112 4 3 Bioinformatics Institute 2001 40 0 0 Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology 2002 53 2 9 Source: Parayil 2005.116 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the complex lies a vivarium, which houses a quarter-million mice for re- search purposes (\"Of Mice and Men\" 2003). The vivarium opened inOctober 2003. Unlike many other science parks, Biopolis is designed to provide a place where biomedical researchers can \"work, live, play, and learn,\" complete with offices, condominiums, and shopping and enter-tainment facilities (Parayil 2005). Recognizing that biomedical researchersneed to be in close contact with their peers around the world, the design-ers of the complex equipped it with the latest telecommunications facili- ties, thus permitting fast Internet connection with other main researchcenters. Hence, Singapore-based researchers have the computing powerthey need to analyze molecules and models and to explore genetic combi-nations using grid computing (\"Of Mice and Men\" 2003). By 2005, a frac-tion of the complex was occupied with a small sprinkling of restaurants and shops. The planners envisage an eventual community of 2,000 re- searchers in the seven buildings (T an and Phang 2005). In an effort to replicate their successful strategy of attracting global electronics firms to Singapore, EDB is pulling all the stops to draw thepharmaceutical and biomedical giants to Singapore and to make Biopolisthe leading biotech center of Southeast Asia. Through EDB's efforts,foreign direct investment in biomedical science in 2001 reachedUS$483 million, a growth of 6 percent compared with the previous year(\"Can Money T urn\" 2005). The companies that have invested in produc-tion capacity or research include S*Bio, Merlion, and Lilly Systems Biol-ogy, among others. S*Bio is a joint venture between Chiron and EDB todevelop products for cancer and for infectious diseases that are endemic inAsia (Wong, Ho, and Singh 2005). Merlion was originally a joint venturewith Glaxo and EDB that was spun off as an independent entity following the merger of Glaxo Wellcome with SmithKlineBeecham to formGlaxoSmithKline. It inherited a vast library of more than 450,000 naturalcompounds, which can be mined to identify natural compounds for newdrugs. By leveraging this collection, Merlion has entered into collabora-tion with firms such as Merck, British Biotech, and NovImmune (Wong,Ho, and Singh 2005). Schering-Plough has invested close to S$1 billon inSingapore, as has GlaxoSmithKlein, and Pfizer has plowed S$600 millioninto a facility to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (Parayil 2005).Lilly Systems Biology, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly, has an R&Dcenter staffed by 50 scientists to explore computational tools for drugdiscovery. Similarly, the Novartis Institute for T ropical Diseases has 60 re-searchers working on treatments for infectious diseases common in theregion. And a Japanese pharmaceutical company, Chugai Pharmaceutical,has initiated a small venture called PharmaLogical Research with DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 117 10 researchers (\"Can Money T urn\" 2005; Wong, Ho, and Singh 2005). Virtually all of the 40 or so pharmaceutical manufacturing firms inSingapore are majority foreign owned (Wong 2005). T o strengthen its appeal for the pharmaceutical companies, Singapore is also marketing the island-state's hospital infrastructure. The hospitals in Singapore offer access to a multiracial population as a potential site forclinical trials. Local hospitals attract wealthy patients from Indonesiaand Malaysia (\"Can Money T urn\" 2005) 27and are subject to an efficient regulatory regime that can facilitate clinical trials. This effort is being buttressed by a joint venture with Johns Hopkins University to set up the International Medical Center with Singapore's National University Hospital, which will provide patient care and conduct clinical trials in on-cology (Wong, Ho, and Singh 2005). The plan also includes moving theCenter for Molecular Medicine, with its 150 researchers, closer toNational University Hospital to take advantage of the existence of a teach- ing hospital. The Center for Molecular Medicine will include a facility tomass produce stem cells for clinical research (\"Irresistible Force\" 2005).Firms such as Pharmacia and Novo Nordisk are exploring the advantagesof conducting trials in Singapore, as is GlaxoSmithKline, which opened apreclinical facility in Biopolis to study Alzheimer's disease (\"Eastern Rebirth\" 2005; Wong, Ho, and Singh 2005). However, the number of clinical trials conducted by those firms is still small, partly because de-mography and geography limit the scale and number of the trials. Of thethree phases of the clinical trials for new drugs, phase I and II trials can bemore easily conducted in Singapore (see table 4.4). But the small size of 27. On this front, Singapore faces competition from other countries, notably Thailand and Malaysia (T an and Phang 2005).Table 4.4 Three Phases of Clinical Trials Phase Description I Based on a small number of volunteers (healthy or sometimes with specific diseases) to test for safe dosages, absorption, distribution, metabolic effects, excretion, and toxicity.

III Based on a large number of patients to establish efficacy and to test for side effects. Typically, this phase involves thousands of patients. Source: DiMasi, Hansen, and Grabowski 2003. Note: In the case of the United States, a phase I clinical trial is often conducted outside of the country.118 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the population\u2014and hence the incidence of particular ailments that a drug targets\u2014may pose a difficulty for conducting phase III clinical trials,which involve thousands of patients with a common medical condition. In this area, Singapore is facing competition from countries such as India and China, where the population size enables researchers to more easily iden-tify a target group of patients and the costs of clinical trials are lower(\"India Emerges\" 2004). 28 Inevitably, not all the efforts to attract multinational corporations (MNCs) have worked. For instance, SurroMed, a U.S. firm specializing in molecular barcoding technology, opened a US$25 million R&D cen- ter in 2001, with financing from EDB, but the center was dissolved in 2003 (Wong, Ho, and Singh 2005). There are other reasons why tangibleevidence of progress has been slow to collect. One reasonably consistentfinding across a number of industrial countries is that publicly funded re-search or research in the leading public laboratories complements rather than substitutes for research done by private entities. At the same time,larger firms appear to derive much more benefit from the spilloversgenerated by this research and through direct links with government labs.Moreover, firms in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnologyfields have been among the ones most likely to work closely and advanta- geously with public research institutes (Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh 2002; David, Hall, and T oole 1999; Veugelers and Cassiman 2005). Thus,Singapore's investment in public research institutes could be the basis forcollaboration with the private sector. However, the presence of large for-eign firms will begin to pay off only if they move some of their basic andearly-stage development work to Singapore rather than keeping it closerto their head offices. So far, there is no sign that any firms have done so,because Singapore is still very far from having built up a sizable core ofresearchers. Furthermore, residual fears exist regarding the loss of intel-lectual property, which is especially valuable and vulnerable to loss in thepharmaceutical industry. Such fears induce firms to compartmentalize 28. For instance, when Germany's Mucos Pharma GmbH wanted to find 650 patients out of 750 for a clinical trial in India, it visited only five hospitals and took only 18 months to identify thosepatients. By comparison, the firm took 36 months and visited 22 hospitals to identify the re-maining 100 patients in Europe (\"India Emerges\" 2004). Conducting trials in China could beeven cheaper and more efficient. A recently completed trial for an anticlotting drug called Plavixby Bristol-Myers Squibb involved 45,852 patients in 1,250 Chinese hospitals. That trial cost afew million dollars and was expedited by close support from doctors and by the provision ofhigh-quality data (COMMIT 2005). More than 2 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed inChina each year\u2014enough to find volunteers for new cancer treatment drugs. The cost of clini-cal trials in China is about one-tenth of that in the United States (\"Cancer T reatment\" 2006).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 119 their research and to secure their most vital investigations and intellectual property (Dietz, Lin, and Yang 2005). And after two years, Biopolis stillhas a deserted air. There are more tenants, but not much \"buzz\" or sense that it is one of those privileged places where big things are going to happen. That could change. Star Scientists Alongside its effort to induce foreign direct investment into biotech- nology, the government is also sparing no effort to assemble a team of starscientists to lead the current research and to serve as attractors for other talented people. The lure is ample funding, advanced facilities, a liberal regulatory regime, and the opportunity to engage in stem cell research,which is subject to more stringent checks in Europe and the United States.This program has notched up some early successes. 29Jackie Ying, formerly a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology (MIT), now heads the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology of the Agency for Science, T echnology, and Research. One of her neighbors in Biopolis is Alan Colman, who worked on cloning Dolly the sheep and now heads aresearch team in ES Cell International that makes insulin-producing cellsfrom stem cells, with human clinical trials anticipated to start in 2006(\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005). Similar work by Bernat Soria on insulin has been ongoing in Singapore since 2002, with the support of the JuvenileDiabetes Research Foundation in the United States. Soria's research wasoriginally conducted in Spain, but the regulatory ban on further work per-suaded him to move to Singapore to pursue his research (\"Asia Jockeys\"2005). 30Soria has been joined by Axel Ulrich from the Max Planck Insti- tute in Martinsreid, Germany, who is a leading authority on the treatment of cancer and diabetes and who heads the Onco Genome lab in Biopolis. The interest in insulin-producing cells in Asia is immense because Asia has the largest concentration of diabetics in the world (Parayil 2005). Otherleading lights who have taken up residence in Singapore include SydneyBrenner, a Nobel Laureate in medicine; Edison Liu, former director ofthe U.S. National Cancer Institute; David Lane, one of the codiscoverers 29. Singapore is top ranked among small countries for its ability to attract talent from around the world, according to the World Competitiveness Report (Koh and Wong 2005). The reliance on for- eign talent stems from the fact that only a few Singapore citizens are working or studying in thebiotechnology field (\"Can Money T urn\" 2005). 30. Although the Spanish government has since relaxed the regulation of stem cell research, Soria intends to stay in Singapore (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005).120 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES of the p53 cancer gene;31Ian McNeice, an oncologist from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; and Yoshiaki Ito, one of the pioneers of chemical carcinogens who is recognized for his research on the Runx genes (Finegold, Wong, and Cheah 2004). In attempting to become a leading commercial force in the field of biotechnology, Singapore has an advantage over other countries, especial- ly those in East Asia. The official language is English, which facilitatescommunication among the team members when researchers come from different countries. For instance, a 25-person research team at ES CellInternational includes researchers from 15 different countries (\"AsiaJockeys\" 2005). Without having English as the working language, theircollaboration would have been quite difficult to manage. Anecdotalevidence suggests that, for this reason, many recent Ph.D. graduates in Europe consider Singapore to be one of the places where they would be willing to work. However, Singapore needs a stable critical mass of scien-tists in this field and the ability to retain them until there is a more plenti-ful supply of homegrown scientists, some of whom have the requisiteexperience and entrepreneurship (\"Can Money T urn\" 2005). Currentlyonly 8.2 percent of researchers working at various government researchinstitutes are citizens of Singapore with Ph.D.s (T an and Phang 2005). Ofthe 35 principal investigators at the IMCB, only one is a citizen ofSingapore. Moreover, patents granted in Singapore to Singapore resi-dents, while rising, are miniscule compared with the number of patentsgranted to nonresidents (see table 4.5). 32Although foreign researchers provide a temporary stopgap and might be a partial solution, for the longer term, the depth of basic science and the scale of the effort needed to move forward at the commercial level demand a far greater input of domestic knowledge workers, as is the case in Finland, Ireland, and Israel. Manpower Planning The scarcity of homegrown talent has not escaped the planners. Singapore is trying to enlarge the domestic pool of science and techn-ology personnel by encouraging enrollment in biotech-related fields both from within Singapore and from abroad. T o expand domestic training, Nanyang T echnology University opened the School of BiologicalSciences and has invested in state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. 31. The p53 cancer gene is used in a gene therapy for cancer patients in China, the only coun- try where such treatment is available (\"Cancer T reatment\" 2006). 32. Charter Semiconductor is the only domestic firm among the top 10 filers of patent applica- tions in Singapore.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 121 In 2003, the Agency for Science, T echnology, and Research budgeted US$286 million in scholarships for doctorate students in biomedical sci-ences who are willing to commit to working in Singapore for up to eight years upon completing their studies (\"Of Mice and Men\" 2003). In addition, the school curriculum at tertiary and secondary levels has beenmodified to provide the younger generation more opportunities to studythe life sciences (Koh and Wong 2005). All those efforts are soundinvestments, but the payoff lies at least a decade or more in the future (\"Singapore Aims\" 2005). The quality of university research in biotechnology also needs improv- ing if Singapore is to become a regional biotechnology cluster. Suchquality, especially with regard to basic research, was not essential for theelectronics industry where applied research and sustained on-the-job training proved sufficient. But biotechnology is a more demanding field, and the research threshold needs to be set higher. Singapore is relying onthe strength of its established and well-known university, the NationalUniversity of Singapore (NUS), to set up either a satellite school oralliances so as to quickly develop research capability in the biomedical sci-ences. The alliances being cultivated are with Johns Hopkins University,MIT, Duke University, Columbia University, and the Indian Institutes ofT echnology (Finegold, Wong, and Cheah 2004). Moreover, a thrivinghomegrown cluster also needs a steady supply of entrepreneurs, and forthese, Singapore is deepening on a number of training programs at theNUS. 33Table 4.5 Breakdown of Patents Granted in Singapore, 1995-2004 Patents granted to Patents granted Domestic share of Year Singapore residents to nonresidents Total patents granted (%) 1995 20 1,730 1,750 1.1 1996 30 3,300 3,330 0.9 1997 20 3,100 400 5,580 5,980 6.7 Source: Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (http://www.ipos.gov.sg/). 33. Feldman and Francis (2003) emphasize the role of entrepreneurship in the context of cluster development in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.122 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Regulatory Regime In East Asia, Singapore's highly streamlined regulatory system is a byword for efficiency and incorruptibility. The regulation of the biotechnologyindustry is no exception. A single agency, the Health Sciences Authority, defines the rules and orchestrates business activity. Recognizing the commercial potential and scientific significance of stem cell research, Singapore has adopted a more liberal stance than have some Western countries. 34The current regime allows extraction of stem cells from aborted fetuses, and human embryos can be cloned and kept for up to 14 days to produce stem cells for therapeutic purposes (\"Of Mice and Men\" 2003). ES Cell International, which was cofounded by Ariff Bongso from NUS and Monash University, owns 6 of 78 human embry-onic stem (ES) cell lines listed on NIH's Stem Cell Registry in 2002 andhas supplied more than 140 ES cell lines to researchers around the world(\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005). Bongso successfully created human ES cells using human feeder cells and nutrients rather than mouse feeder layers in 2002.This achievement is significant because, by doing so, researchers can nowuse those cell lines for clinical trials, whereas researchers using animal-based cells cannot (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005). 35 Finance In the early 1980s, EDB set up a venture capital office in the United States to invest in promising dedicated biotechnology firms. The initial purpose 34. In other countries, the regulatory hurdles to conduct stem cell research are quite high. In the United States, research in this field needs to be funded by nonfederal sources, although suchrules are changing because of strong public sentiment in favor of broadening research. InEurope, because of the diverse historical and religious backgrounds, only a small portion\u2014\u20ac130 million\u2014of the research budget allocated by the European Union agencies in Brussels was devoted to stem cell research between 2002 and 2005, and only \u20ac13 million will be available for human embryo research out of a research budget of \u20ac17.5 billion for 2002 to 2006 (\"Politics May Move\" 2005). One indicator of the opportunities for the determined newcomer to the businessof health care is that barely 1 percent of the global expenditures on pharmaceuticals are devotedto research on the diseases afflicting the vast majority of the world's population and killingmillions each year. 35. The earlier method of relying on mouse feeder layers for the propagation of human ES cells risks introducing animal pathogens; hence, it is not suitable for human clinical trials (\"AsiaJockeys\" 2005). It seems that the few stem cell lines that are approved in the United States arecontaminated with animal cells. This contamination could invalidate the existing and future re-search based on these cell lines (\"Approved Stem Cell\" 2005). The only way to ensure that stemcell lines are animal-free is to use newer ones without relying on the mouse feeder. However, atthis point, only stem cells existing as of 2001 are usable in the United States for research sup-ported by federal funding (\"Approved Stem Cell\" 2005).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 123 of this office was to learn about the biotechnology industry through in- vesting. Later on, firms were targeted on the basis of their willingness toestablish R&D facilities in Singapore in return for an injection of funds by EDB (Finegold, Wong, and Cheah 2004). For instance, S*Bio was created through equity participation of Chiron, while EDB invested in Chiron inthe United States (Finegold, Wong, and Cheah 2004). Although the venture capital industry has since grown considerably through the entry of foreign firms (Kenney, Han, and T anaka 2004), the reluctance of private venture capitalists to invest in biotech start-ups ledthe Singapore government to establish a biomedical venture fund calledBio One Capital, with assets of US$700 million, under EDB. EDB alsomanages the US$600 million Biomedical Sciences Investment Fund,which invests in pharmaceutical and biomedical ventures in Singapore and abroad (\"Singapore: Pharma Industry\" 2004). By 2002, US$150 million had been invested in 50 companies (Koh and Wong 2005). Currently, there are more than 100 venture capital firms in Singapore. However, 20 percent of the capital originates from the government (T anand Phang 2005), and venture capital firms depend heavily on subsidiesfrom the government to survive. 36A key reason for this dependence is the small number and size of the deals available in Singapore. Although some firms operate regionally, the pickings are modest. Without a large pool of potential start-ups or opportunities for mezzanine-level and advanced-stage financing, private venture capitalists will have difficultythriving in the Singapore environment, and the government will havedifficulty exiting from the business, especially if it wishes to continuesupporting the biotech and other high-tech industries. (Kenney, Han, and T anaka 2004). Whether private venture capitalists will finance these firms for 10 years or more is questionable, especially when most venture capitalists inSingapore have invested mainly in electronics or in traditional manufac-turing industries for which the exit time is only two to three years. Unless the government is prepared to provide the bulk of long-term risk capital, firms will need a definite business plan in order to sustain a steady revenue 36. The Singapore government has actively promoted the venture capital industry by offering tax and other incentives to attract foreign venture capitalists from around the world, in additionto encouraging the entry of local firms (Kenney, Han, and T anaka 2004). In the early 1980s, itset up Vertex Management and EDB Ventures. In the late 1990s, it invested US$1 billion in aT echnopreneurship Investment Fund to persuade leading global venture capitalists to useSingapore as their regional hub (T an and Phang 2005). Vertex Management was spun off fromSingapore T echnologies, government-owned industrial conglomerate (Kenney, Han, andT anaka 2004).124 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES flow. In the absence of such plans, few spinoffs will survive. In fact, this has been the experience with spinoffs in Singapore. Currently, there are onlya limited number of surviving biotechnology spinoff firms from NUS, Lynk Biotechnologies being possibly the most successful. Lynk Biotech- nologies survived the early teething stage because it was able to generateearnings from the sale of cosmetics and nondrug health products, whichcover a part of the cost of drug development. Biotechnology Competitors Whether Singapore can take a lead in the contested field is debatable, given the volume of funding on stem cell research now forthcoming inCalifornia and other states in the United States. 37In addition, the recent setback experienced by stem cell research in the Republic of Korea raisestroubling questions and has provided ammunition to many who are op- posed to such research. 38Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk's team at Seoul National University claimed to have isolated ES cells from cloned human cells (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005) and later created stem cells that matched the DNA of donors. This technique, once perfected, could have made it possible to grow replacement tissues without worrying about rejection by the im-mune system, which is common with implants (\"Stem Cells: Big Step\"2005; \"Without Apology\" 2005). 39But the findings published by the 37. Because of the ban on new stem cell research using federal funding, the state of California has allocated US$3 billion (US$300 million for the next 10 years) for the research on stem cellsin California (Zhang and Patel 2005). The total R&D expenditure on biomedical research in theUnited States was US$94 billion in 2004, of which 57 percent came from private firms and28 percent from NIH. (Moses and others 2005). 38. The age of the female donor matters for the efficient production of an ES cell line. Oocytes from women in their 30s yield on average one ES cell line for every 30 attempts at production,whereas only 13 tries are needed to obtain a cell line from younger women. Considering thateach donation typically produces 10 oocytes, this finding is significant (\"Korean T eam Speeds\"2005). Because of the scarcity of eggs and of the health risks associated with extracting eggs,scientists are searching for alternative materials suitable for cloning, including growing eggsin vitro and using eggs from other animals (\"Mining the Secrets\" 2006). 39. Although more work is needed, Dr. Yuri Verlinsky of the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago, Illinois, was able to create patient-matched stem cells without relying on therapeuticcloning. If this finding is verified, it will bypass the ethical question surrounding the destructionof embryos associated with therapeutic cloning and will be easier than Dr. Hwang's method(\"Double T riumph\" 2005). The reason for therapeutic cloning is to create replacement organsthat will not be rejected by the immune system. However, with the controversies surroundingstem cell research, some scientists are refocusing their efforts on a better understanding of therejection of foreign organs and ways in which to trick the immune system into accepting thosedonated organs (\"Do We Even Need Eggs?\" 2006).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 125 Korean team were shown to have been fabricated. Thus, the challenge facing stem cell researchers is now more daunting, but the work is pro-ceeding apace. Currently, more than 300 researchers are working on stem cell research in Korea (\"East Asia Powers Ahead\" 2005). More than US$10 billion is likely to be invested in biotechnology activities by Koreain the next five years (Koh and Wong 2005), far more than the investmentplanned by Singapore. 40 China is another competitor with an expanding biotech program initi- ated during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) (Wang and T ong 2005). The Beijing Genome Institute, with just US$50 million in public funding, has contributed significantly to the Human Genome Project and has sequenced rice, chicken, pig, and other genomes. It is now regarded as oneof the top five sequencing and bioinformatics centers worldwide.(\"Eastern Rebirth\" 2005). The competition from China takes the form ofsome 300 firms that are engaged in a subfield of molecular biology and that serve a domestic market valued at US$2.4 billion in 2004, plus makecontributions to the exports of reagents and other products. The govern-ment is devoting close to US$600 million to R&D, mainly focused inBeijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. This effort is building capability, andone Shenzhen-based firm, SiBiono GeneT ech, has been certified by the authorities to market a gene-based anticancer drug, Gendicine, that at- tempts to suppress tumor formation by injecting a gene into the body(\"Cancer T reatment\" 2006; \"Emerging Biotech Giant?\" 2005). 41China's pharmaceutical sector is huge, with a turnover of US$54 billion in 2004. After the United States, it is the second biggest producer of ingredients, and it exported US$4 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2004 (\"Phar- maceuticals Sector\" 2005). India's US$9 billion pharmaceutical industry isa second competitor with 4 percent of the global market for generics, agrowing pipeline of drugs, and multiplying links with MNCs (\"CopycatsNo More\" 2005). Between 300 and 400 Chinese researchers with Ph.D.s are engaged in stem cell research, with at least 80 of them studying ES cells. Although 40. That investment by Korea is in addition to the past and ongoing research programs, some of which are the Biotech 2000 program (1994-2007), with a US$20 billion budget; The 21st Cen-tury Frontier R&D (1999-2009), with a US$3.5 billion budget; the Development of HybridBiomaterials and Its Application T echnology (2000-09), with W 45 billion; and the BiomedicalT echnology Development Project (2002-09), with W 685 billion. 41. The founder of SiBiono GeneT ech, Zhaohui Peng, worked at the University of California-Los Angeles medical school and at a biotech start-up in San Diego before he returnedto China to start his own company. The seed money of US$300,000 was provided by theShenzhen government (\"Cancer T reatment\" 2006).126 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES lack of information makes it difficult to gauge the progress made by scientists in China, the country has a major advantage over Singapore inits capacity to lure back researchers who were trained in Europe and the United States. 42CapitalBio, a firm located in the Zhongguancun Life Science Park, is emerging as a world leader in biochips, a device used for biological testing and medical diagnostics that marries biotechnology and electronics. That firm, which was established in 2000,43is already exporting to the United States. (\"Science and T echnology: Scientists\" 2005).44 Researchers at the Industrial T echnology Research Institute in T aiwan (China) are also working on insulin-producing cells (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005).Six of the researchers at Academia Sincia have returned from Australia, Europe, and the United States to engage in stem cell research closer to their home region (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005). India is a recent entrant, butalready start-ups are beginning to blossom in Bangalore and Pune. Intellectual Property Protection Singapore offers good intellectual property protection. The government has upgraded its Registry of T rade Marks and Patents to IntellectualProperty Office of Singapore in 2001 (T an and Phang 2005). This effort is a major advance because high-tech industries, including the biotechnology and especially the pharmaceutical industry, are sensitive to the effectiveenforcement of intellectual property rights. The enforcement of intellec-tual property rights is not perceived to be as strong in other countries suchas China. For instance, a patent on Viagra by Pfizer was invalidated in China in 2004 because the application did not include sufficient data.Pfizer, however, claims that such information was never required nor requested when its application was filed in 1994. In this kind of 42. For instance, Sheng Hui Zhen, a researcher at Shanghai Second Medical University, worked at NIH for 11 years before returning to China to head a 50-person research team on stem cells.The team is funded mainly by the municipal government of Shanghai (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005). 43. CapitalBio was spun off from the National Engineering Research Center for Biochip T ech- nology (\"Eastern Rebirth\" 2005). It was founded in 2000 by Jing Cheng, who was a scientist atNanogen Inc. in San Diego. With its biochip, CapitalBio has been selected to screen athletes atthe 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Using just 25 chips, CapitalBio can check 10,000 samples in a day(\"Can China Innovate?\" 2005; \"World of Opportunities\" 2005). 44. The wages of newly graduated researchers in China are about one-fourth the U.S. levels, although many firms offer much higher compensation to attract researchers. That is whatCapitalBio has done to attract some of their senior scientists from abroad, especially Chineseexpatriates (\"Science and T echnology: Scientists\" 2005).DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 127 environment, Pfizer has expressed caution against future expansion of research work in China (\"Can China Innovate?\" 2005). READING THE BIOTECH TEA LEAVES Singapore's strategy to create a commercially viable biotech industry isfaithfully adhering to a script that has been tested in the United States.Given that no other country in the region has established a dominant position in medical biotechnology as yet, Singapore is hoping to gain first- mover advantages in the region in competition against Korean andChinese researchers, who are also pushing the frontiers in similar areas(Parayil 2005). Singapore's strategy builds on an acquired capability in themanufacture of electronics components and in the development, debug- ging, testing, and prototype production of high-tech electronics parts.That capability has bolstered confidence in the efficacy of industrialpolicies in the Singapore context, has established the basics of an R&D in-frastructure, and has encouraged the authorities to fix their sights on moreambitious targets. Singapore's technocrats believe that a San Diego-type of medical biotechnology cluster can be called into existence in Southeast Asiathrough carefully choreographed policies, backed by a large infusion ofstate-provided resources. Their methodical pursuit of a clear objective hascertainly borne some fruit in that many of the building blocks are now inplace. The working space is there, teams of scientists are being assembled,MNCs have flocked to Singapore, the incentive regime is one of thestrongest anywhere, and there is venture capital from public sources ontap for start-up firms and others. Bit by bit, the considerable investment inhuman capital and R&D is leading to more scientific publications andpatents, and a critical mass of research talent is taking shape in Biopolis.The expenditure on R&D has steadily increased from 0.3 percent of GDPin 1991 to 2.2 percent by 2003, one-third of which comes from foreignfirms' R&D operations in Singapore (Wong 2005). 45The share of biotech- nology in overall R&D has increased from 5 percent in the 1990s to more than 10 percent in the period from 2000 to 2003(Wong 2005). From 1999 to 2001, Singapore ranked 11th, ahead of France, Germany, and Japan in the number of published science and engineering articles, with 590 papersper 1 million inhabitants (see table 4.6), as against 433 such papers in 1998 45. Foreign firms account for 60 percent of private R&D spending (Wong 2005).128 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 4.6 Output of Science and Engineering Articles by Economy (number per 1 million inhabitants) Rank Economy 1999-2001 1 Switzerland 1,165.0 2 Sweden 1,139.3 3 Israel 1,055.24 Finland 960.55 Denmark 932.26 United Kingdom 821.97 Netherlands 800.58 794.29 States 10 Norway Singapore France Germany 429.917 382.718 Italy 371.419 Taiwan (China) 330.320 Czech Republic 241.421 Korea, Rep. of 206.822 Portugal 191.323 Poland 139.924 Russian Federation 116.4 Worldwide average 108.8 Source: National Science Board 2004. (Koh and Wong 2005). But the share of biotech patents granted by the U.S. Patent and T rade Office has not kept pace with the increase in inputs.The share of biomedical patents actually declined from 2.7 percent before 2000 to less than 1.8 percent in the period from 2000 to 2003. The dra- matic increase in inputs has yet to be matched by commensurate outcomes(Wong 2005). Furthermore, the entrepreneurial spirit is still weak in Singapore. It ranks 19th out of 21 countries in Global Entrepreneurship Monitor stud- ies covering the period from 2000 to 2002 (Koh and Wong 2005). Notonly is the pool of entrepreneurs in Singapore relatively small, but thenumber of people who are prepared to join these new ventures is alsosmall. Many prefer to work for the government or for established MNCsrather than for companies offering less job security (Wong, Ho, and SinghDECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 129 2005). The relaxation of a number of regulations to stimulate entrepre- neurship, such as allowing the public housing apartments to be used as of-fice and commercial space, has made little difference (T an and Phang 2005). Furthermore, the link between universities and businesses remains weak. Only 2.6 percent of university R&D was funded from privatesources (Koh and Wong 2005). There are grounds for optimism, 46but they must be heavily qualified for a number of reasons. The optimism, as we noted above, stems from the signs that the pharmaceutical industry is entering a new phase; the fo- cus is shifting from blockbuster drugs to medications that target much narrower markets, each generating, at most, just tens of millions of dollarseach year. The new wave of drugs might target infectious diseases that arethe bane of the poor, mainly in lower-income countries, or might tacklerare illnesses or be tailored to the needs of individuals with a specific genetic profile. 47Such drugs or vaccines could cost less to research, develop, and market than the blockbuster drugs and could thereby facilitate entry of smaller companies germinating in countries such as Singapore. In effect, the assumption is that the recent era, which wit- nessed the steady consolidation of the pharmaceutical and biotechindustries, may be in for a pause or even a reversal, and that both techno-logical and market development will promote the entry of smaller-scale,boutique providers. Alternatively, one might see the spread of comple- mentary relationships between small biotech companies that take the leadin innovation, whether of drugs, vaccines, or medical devices, and largepharmaceutical companies that assist with the financing, development,testing certification, and global marketing of such products. 48Advertising now absorbs more funds than R&D, and Pfizer, for example, is the fourth-largest advertiser in the United States, spending almost 46. Currently, there are more than 20 dedicated biotechnology firms in Singapore. Seven years ago, there were none. Along with the emergence of those firms, independent contract researchorganizations have also started to set up R&D facilities in Singapore (Wong 2005). 47. The size of the target population matters because clinical trials are becoming more complex and expensive. Pfizer, for instance, spent US$2.1 billion to test one of its new drugs for heart dis-ease (\"Pfizer's Funk\" 2005). 48. Even though Pfizer is testing a drug to raise \"good\" cholesterol (HDL, or high-density lipoprotein) levels at the cost of US$800 million, it is also buying a small biotech firm that isdeveloping another HDL-raising drug at US$1.3 billion (\"Pfizer's Funk\" 2005). Eli Lilly has asubsidiary that runs a Web site listing some of the problems drug makers are tackling and offer-ing rewards for solutions. Eli Lilly has more than 25,000 registered research teams around theworld vying for the rewards, which range from US$10,000 to US$100,000 (\"Big T rouble\" 2003).130 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES US$17 billion in 2004, twice the amount spent on R&D (\"Pfizer's Funk\" 2005).49Such an apparently fruitful relationship between pharmaceutical and biotech companies can currently be observed between Roche andBiogen Idec. Roche holds a 53 percent stake in Biogen Idec, but it guides Biogen Idec with a relatively light touch. A similar relationship exists be- tween Roche and Genentech, in which the pharmaceutical giant has a 60percent share. Roche also entered into an arrangement with the biotechcompany Antisoma for an option on one of its anticancer drugs. Similar-ly, GlaxoSmithKline entered into product agreements with Exelixis, also for anticancer drugs (\"Big Pharma\" 2002). Industrial change that accommodates a thriving boutique segment catering to niche markets in Southeast and South Asia\u2014and where possi-ble, global niche markets as well\u2014would be advantageous for firms inSingapore and for firms in other industrial countries. In fact, if such change does transpire, it would accelerate the pace of innovation and the intensity of competition. Furthermore, a reading of recent trends suggests that societies and pri- vate individuals will continue, at least in the medium run, to give priorityto medical expenses and to provide a ready market for the offerings of thebiomedical industry. In other words, expenditures on medical services maycontinue to displace other expenditures, reflecting a high income elasticityand a low price elasticity of demand. 50In this scenario, if the promise of the life sciences is realized, even in part, countries such as Singapore that have invested substantially in the biotech infrastructure and in specialized human capital stand to make large gains, as long as their homegrown firms produce a steady stream of commercially successful products in the bio-medical and related fields. The magnitude of the benefits will depend on 49. The largest advertisers in the United States are General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Time Warner, in descending order (\"Pfizer's Funk\" 2005). Drug companies in Europe and theUnited States also spend lavishly on marketing to doctors, employing tens of thousands of rep-resentatives and using other incentives. That expenditure in the United States amounted toUS$9.4 billion in 2002 (\"Pushing Pills\" 2003). 50. A number of the chronic diseases that are the focus of so much research are the partial con- sequence of dysfunctional lifestyles. As the costs of health care mushroom, the calculus is boundto favor a change in lifestyles over ever-greater reliance on partial cures and therapeutic inter-vention. The U.S. experience starkly illustrates the limits of medical spending in lengthening lifespans or reducing morbidity. The costliness of medical care is putting routine insurance beyondthe reach of a sizable minority, the R&D on new drugs is running into decreasing returns evenas it raises the costs of drugs used, and life expectancy threatens to decline rather than increaseas a result of lifestyle choices that are seemingly impervious to advances in health care, to levelsof education, and to the easier access to information on the causes as well as the consequences ofchronic diseases.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 131 the local value added, the employment generated, and the spillover effects from the industry, as well as from the somewhat specialized innovationsystem that is being put in place. The Singapore authorities are betting on such a payoff and are banking on a biomedical cluster that complements the electronics industry and other high-tech activities while enhancing the prospects of Singapore'shospital services industry. The odds are that Singapore could achieve adegree of success, possibly not on the scale of a San Francisco, but respectable nevertheless. However, there are risks of a fizzle, and theyarise from the characteristics of the biomedical industry and the factors in-fluencing the demand for health services. The big questions for Singapore and for other countries in East Asia that are grooming medical-biotech industries are whether the deciphering of the genome and the flock of specialized fields it has spawned will pro- duce future earnings comparable to the returns obtained by the majorpharmaceutical and biotech companies in recent years. If so, what kind offirms will reap the highest rewards and under what circumstances? Andcan this industry provide the makings of a cluster that will be a significantdriver of growth, mainly through exports, and that will generate the vol-ume of employment that Singapore's economy is seeking? For a number of reasons, it is far from obvious, as yet, that medical biotechnology is likely to deliver high and sustained profits for a sufficientnumber of entering firms. The experience of the most successful firms,such as Amgen and Biogen, is by no means unequivocally positive, despitethe huge profits garnered by their bioengineered drugs. Their achieve-ments have been few and are based on prolonged research to address a fewimportant medical conditions. In Amgen's case, the condition was the anemia that in particular afflicts patients who undergo kidney dialysis(Goozner 2004). The pipeline of new drugs is relatively meager given the amounts in- vested in research, 51the drugs now being introduced are of a more limited therapeutic value, and the largest biomedical firms have been the most prolific. This situation may exist because of learning and of scale economies in such research, but even Amgen has had few new offerings, 51. Alliance and consolidation are becoming critical in keeping the pipeline full. For instance, half of the new drugs in the pipeline that are produced by Amgen, the biggest independentbiotech company, with revenues of US$11 billion in 2004, are the result of Amgen's alliances andmergers with others (\"Amgen Works\" 2005). Roche has a controlling stake in Genentech, andNovartis is maneuvering to take over Chiron (\"Amgen Works\" 2005; Raises\" 2005).Sugen, the developer of a first-in-class anticancer drug was taken over by Pfizer (\"Spiritof a Startup\" 2005).132 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES although it and its sister firms, such as Genentech, are promising break- through medications for cancer and osteoporosis. Despite an ever-deeperunderstanding of biogenetic processes, the drug companies are also discovering that neither simulation of the actual working of drugs on hu- man cells nor multistage testing can conclusively identify all side effects ofand adverse interactions with other drugs or substances an individualmight be exposed to. New, expensively produced, high-profile drugs arebeing withdrawn\u2014or their prescription severely light (\"Another Ailing\" 2005; \"Genentech'sLessons\" 2005). Thus, the whole process of conducting tests and winningapproval in industrial countries with the most lucrative markets is not be-coming easier. Although nearly US$85 billion was invested in the U.S.biotech industry during 1998 to 2003 and sectoral revenues amounted to US$46 billion in 2003, the industry is struggling (Pfeffer 2005). One way forward for newcomers might be to concentrate on biomaterials, whereregulatory hurdles may be lower than for drugs. By building up the capa-bilities in this area first, Singapore may be able to make more headwaylater in biopharmaceuticals and genetic medicines (Parayil 2005). Thecurrent focus on cancer-related drugs, which is highly contested area andthick with regulations, might be less rewarding. T wo other developments now in train threaten to depress longer-term profitability. The lesser of the two is the length of patent protectionprovided to vital drugs for conditions such as AIDS and, in this context,the increasing threat from generics. Such protection is effectively down to10 years, and there is less assurance now that important life-saving discov-eries will not enjoy the length of protection they once did. The other and uppermost concern for the pharmaceutical and biotech- nology industries derives from the very success of medical advances to date and how these interact with rising longevity to steadily increase thecosts of health care. In the industrial countries, health-related spending isalready averaging close to 10 percent of GDP . New and generally moreexpensive drugs, combined with advanced procedures, which are also fre-quently costlier than the ones they displace, are inexorably pushing upmedical costs (Lichtenberg 2001). As the population ages and chronicdiseases become more widespread, exacerbated by the global obesityepidemic, 52the curve of medical expenditures will very probably steepen 52. See Chou, Saffer, and Grossman and James (2005); and \"Provocative Study\" (2005). According to the International Obesity T askforce referred to byHaslam and James (2005), 1.1 billion people worldwide were overweight, and of these, 312 mil-lion were obese.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 133 further. By themselves, these expenditures might be supportable, but in conjunction with rising pension and welfare benefits for the elderly, soci-eties will face some difficult choices. 53Among such choices will certainly be those regarding the use of expensive therapies to extend long and eco-nomically unproductive life spans by another few years and to ameliorate debilitating chronic diseases. Those therapies will constantly raise the technological ante at prices that would generate high profits forthe biotech companies and compensate them for the risks they incur andtheir substantial R&D outlay. 54 The risks derive from the following four sources. First is the question of scale. Inevitably, the resources\u2014human capital and material\u2014that Singapore can expend on biomedical R&D and commercialization are a small fraction of what the major corporate entities and countries such as the United States are investing in their efforts to find the right moleculeor innovation, especially so in the field of oncology. In the biomedicalfield, much hangs on the quality and depth of basic research, on thebreadth of investigation, and on the lucky break. Singapore's resource constraint forces the country to target a narrow range of options, depend-ing in part on the scientific talent it can attract. That constraint reducesthe likelihood of anything more than the episodic discovery and makes ithard to think in terms of a continuously replenished pipeline of productsfrom a stream of new entrants or from incumbent firms that grow in size. Given that millions of compounds are screened and only a tiny few are ever developed into drugs, having a large pool of firms of different sizesengaging in such search and development activities is advantageous until abetter technology to identify promising compounds at the initial stageemerges. 55In fact, the experience with the electronics industry, which has a nearly 25-year history in Singapore, suggests that a stream of 53. Without a significant reform of pension and health care costs, the public outlays on those costs could raise the public debt in France, Germany, and the United States to more than 200 per-cent of GDP by 2050 (\"Debt Threat\" 2005). 54. It is instructive to know that in 1935, when the U.S. Social Security Law was signed, the life expectancy at birth was 58 years for men and 62 years for women. Only 54 percent of men and61 percent of women alive at that time were able to survive until the age of 65 to collect SocialSecurity (\"Seventy Years of Plenty\" 2005). 55. Danzon, Nicholson, and Pereira (2005) find that an alliance between a small and a large firm is conducive to successful phase II and III clinical trials. But unlike in other industries, repeatedinteractions between small and large firms are fairly scarce, because the smaller firms tend to behighly specialized and, once the successful alliance comes to an end, the larger firms seek outother firms that may enable the larger firms to expand into new territories (Roijakkers,Hagedoorn, and van Kranenburg 2005).134 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES innovations is difficult to generate, given corporate R&D capability, the scale of Singapore's innovation system, and the pool of entrepreneurialtalent. Second, the intense emphasis on commercialization of research find- ings noted by Professor Yoshiaki Ito has its drawbacks. It can detract from the necessary attention to basic research that feeds innovation, and labscould become closed societies jealously guarding their intellectualproperty rather than continuing the open and collegial atmosphere of the typical campus (\"Asia Jockeys\" 2005; Koh and Wong 2005). A stress onthe commercial worth of research could also adversely affect the qualityand orientation of teaching universities. Moreover, the star researcherswho Singapore has attracted include a number of oncologists, which (asnoted above) has biased research toward anticancer drugs. That bias might not be to Singapore's advantage, because the largest markets for those drugs are in industrial countries. Third, a heavy dependence on foreign researchers and on the research labs of MNCs has its drawbacks. Star scientists are a footloose group, andthe departure of one can trigger the breakup of a team and the emigrationof other key members. Yoshiaki Ito was able to bring 10 of his keyresearchers when he moved from Kyoto to Singapore. A similar move outof Singapore by a leading scientist could result in an exodus that wouldquickly erase the capability of an institute. The spillovers from MNC re-search labs are also uncertain. The evidence that a relationship betweenitinerant teams of foreign researchers and MNC research facilities willlead to enough spinoffs to form a leading sector is simply not there. So far,generous financing, provision of state-of-the-art facilities, and a relativelylenient regulatory environment have enabled Singapore to attract these foreign scientists. However, questions still remain about how long the for-eigners will stay in Singapore after their initial stint and how longSingapore will be able to sustain its attraction for such people, especiallyas countries such as China and India develop further. Singapore is writingthe case law on this particular initiative. For the biomedical industry toserve as a growth pole calls for innovation, industrial initiatives, and cor-porate marketing capabilities in a number of interlinked subfields thatdraw on an array of scientific disciplines. 56Whether Singapore can piece together such an expansive world-class innovation system is unclear. 56. For instance, even though prototypes of equipment can be created in Singapore, actual pro- duction takes place elsewhere, delaying the deployment of such equipment. Similarly, some spe-cialized inputs need to be imported, and it takes more time to obtain those inputs in Singaporethan in countries such as Japan.DECIPHERING THE DNA OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY 135 Fourth, the one lesson that the short history of the life sciences has driven home is that there is a lengthy lag between remarkable scientific discovery and some eventual practical outcome. In the United States, the elapsed time from drug discovery to approval typically ranges from 12 to 15 years (Danzon, Nicholson, and Pereira 2005). So far, the pharma-ceutical giants and venture capitalists have shown patience and great per-sistence, because the eventual prizes from the occasional winner have beenstaggeringly large. But if the number of winners starts to dwindle, then the willingness to commit the volume of patient capital that is needed will besorely tested. Such a tendency has been noted. The number of drugslaunched by the pharmaceutical giants in the United States fell from 59per year during 1998 to 2002 to 50 per year during 2002 to 2004, andmany of these drugs were variants of existing drugs. 57 Nevertheless, there are some bright spots here for the biotechnology sector: one-third of the 50 to 60 therapeutics launched in the United States during 2003 were from biotech companies, as against one-fourth in 2001 and 7 percent in 1998 (\"Demand Far Outstrips Supply\" 2002); on average, treatment for chronic conditions using biotech drugs is less cost-ly than treatment using small-molecule pharmaceutical drugs; and thepace of innovation in biotechnology is quickening (Pfeffer 2005, 115).Although the risks are undeniable, it is possible to end on this positive note. 57. About 40 percent of R&D is spent on research to extend the usefulness of the existing drugs, rather than developing new ones (\"Big T rouble\" 2003). Such strategies work if a firm is the ownerof the underlying patent, but otherwise, firms will face significant hurdles. This fact is especiallytrue for newer firms, which may not have enough patent portfolios to trade with their competitors.Neither robotics nor animation are new industries, but advancing technologies, emerging applications, and changing preferencesare giving each of those fields a new and potentially much larger role in the postindustrial city. 1Both industries emerged in T okyo some decades ago, yet they have occupied relatively small economic niches. Robotics mainly served a handful of manufacturing industries, such as automobile assembly, whereas animation provided the grist for comic books, cartoons, collectibles, and small knickknacks. Now, the footprint ofboth industries, as measured by forward and backward links, seems set toexpand. Moreover, the products of these industries (but robotics more sothan animation) could become as intrinsic to daily urban existence as the Internet and in as short a span of time. 2Why robotics and animation? What is T okyo's comparative advantage with respect to those industries? And why are such industries important for T okyo's industrial future? The case for robotics stems from the huge increase in the applicability of robotic technologies that have arisen from advances in information technology, electronics, mechanical engineering, nanotechnology, andartificial intelligence (AI). Such advances, coupled with major stridesspearheaded by Japanese firms in the miniaturization of equipment and the integration of systems, are enabling elements of the robot concept toinfiltrate diverse aspects of urban life. For an aging population, variouskinds of robotic devices can assist with housekeeping, 3movement, homeCHAPTER 5 MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 1.

For leisure and recreational purposes, humanoid robots have the potential of becoming more companionable and less demanding playmates than other kinds of pets. The mechanical, sensor, optical, remote-control, and AI technologies being progressively refined by the robotics industry have applications in space exploration (the Mars Rover) and the medical field (in surgery, re-mote surgery, and physical therapy for recuperating patients, for are critical to the functioning, maintenance, and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and robots are being perfected to assist with disaster relief in places where, for instance, a snakelike device that has the degrees of freedom to bend in many directions is needed to burrow through debris to locate survivors. Starting with the use of roboticequipment for clearing minefields, the utility of unmanned vehicles andsensor technology for surveillance and for smart projectiles is now widelyappreciated. Unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs), armed unmanned ground vehicles, and underwater vehicles 6are being embraced by the military in several countries, and the use of UAVs for monitoring fires and weather conditions is being actively explored. As the technology im- proves and becomes more reliable, the use of UAVs for long-distance operations\u2014monitoring, surveillance, transporting cargo, or attackinglow-value, high-risk targets\u2014is bound to become widespread. 7MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 139 4. Currently, 25 percent of the Japanese population is at least 65 years old, and that proportion is expected to increase to 33 percent by 2040. Because the smaller cohort of younger peoplecould dampen the demand for home security, many firms in Japan are developing guard robotsfor the elderly (\"Robot Guards\" 2005). 5. The next big step, which is at the experimental stage, will be a marriage of robotics with neu- roscience that would allow individuals to manipulate a robotic arm, for example, through im-pulses passed through electrodes planted in the brain. Researchers at Northeastern Universityare attempting the transmission of electrochemical impulses from the chest to a robotic arm(\"Bionic Sensation\" 2006). At the University of Pittsburgh, neural impulses from monkeys haveachieved this objective through the mediation of a specially programmed computer (\"Food forThought\" 2005). 6. Under contract from the U.S. Navy, a number of companies, including Lockheed Martin, Bluefin Robotics, and Nekton Research, are building autonomous underwater vehicles for con-ducting surveillance, hunting mines, and inspecting vessels. 7. Establishing standards and rules for certification is ongoing so that UAVs can function as a part of civil aviation (\"Atlantic Harmony\" 2005; \"Common Purpose\" 2005). Because of differ-ent demand conditions, robots that perform dangerous and dirty duties are developed more inthe United States, especially in connection with military applications and space programs(see Wilson 2005). The United States plans to spend between US$9 billion and US$10 billionon UAV programs for ground attack and electronic warfare purposes (\"New Vision\" 2006). Incontrast, robots in Japan are developed by electronics firms and are aimed at consumers.140 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES The revolutions in electronic hardware and programming have also transformed animation. Computer-generated or computer-modulated an- imation is now woven into movies and other programs, the demand for which is certain to go on rising in line with increased leisure time. It is a staple in advertising and being put to inventive use by the education in-dustry for a variety of classroom purposes as well as for the purposes ofdistance-learning programs. Even though we have touched on only a fraction of the uses to which robotics and animation technologies are being put, those examples should suffice to convey their emerging salience and the likelihood of their widen-ing utility during the course of this century. Thus, a city that achieves andsustains a comparative advantage in those technological domains stands toreap large gains through the production and marketing of goods and services with high added value. However, the nature of the robotics and animation industries is peculiarly complex and requires an unusualcombination of technical skills, research facilities, and manufacturing ca-pability. Robotics, in particular, straddles so many technical specializationsthat a world-class innovative industry is inseparable from an agglomera-tion of activities spanning many different technical disciplines, togetherwith a well-honed corporate capability to perceive commercial possibil-ities and manage and integrate findings from across a spectrum oftechnologies. The importance of diverse and highly evolved technologicalcapabilities encapsulating much tacit knowledge and their agglomerationwithin a metropolitan area that facilitates frequent face-to-face communi-cation cannot be emphasized enough. Robotics and animation, both ofwhich depend on creativity at or near the frontiers of multiple scientificsubfields, need a particularly rich urban milieu to flourish. T okyo has accumulated those diverse capabilities and, surprisingly, the relatively structured social environment has promoted a kind of disci- plined creativity that has produced a succession of disruptive innovationssuch as the Walkman and the PlayStation 2. T okyo is the birthplace ofAstro Boy, which has a talismanic significance for robotics and for Japaneseanime. Can the city maintain its lead, and can those activities achieve thescale of the consumer electronics industry, for instance? That is, of course,the big question, because the history of technology is rarely linear; never-theless, first-mover advantages can maintain or even widen an initial leadwith suitable investment in capabilities. Astro Boy had a tremendous effect on Japanese society. Until then, anime was confined to the sporadic production of a few feature films andshort animated cartoons. Astro Boy's immediate popularity paved the wayto serial animation programming on television. But this pioneering workMEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 141 has exerted an influence well beyond Japan's animation industry. Astro Boy and its robotic progeny, such as Mazinger Z, Raideen, and the modu-lar robot in Getta Robot, also aroused interest in robotics in Japan. 8 One characteristic of some of these animations is that they portray a robotliving with people and supporting human companions physically as well asemotionally. Thus, exposure to Astro Boy and other similar anime charac- ters has prepared the Japanese for a world in which humans and humanoid robots can coexist. 9The increasing rootedness of such positive images has stimulated and shaped the Japanese personal robot industry, and they are responsible for the creative and human-friendly products such as Sony's dog-shaped robot, Aibo, which was introduced in 1999,10and Honda's humanoid, Ashimo. The interest in animation shows no sign of waning in Japan. In fact, this fragment of Japanese culture has struck a chord worldwide and has pro- duced rising exports. The estimated market share of Japanese animation inthe world is about 65 percent (DCAj 2004). This dominance was recentlyunderscored when Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away was awarded the 75th Academy Award for long animation in 2003 and the Golden Bear Award at the Berlin International Movie Festival in 2002. 11Mamoru Oshii's Innocence was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2004. Pok\u00e9mon , Digimon , and Yu-Gi-Oh are household words in the United States, and the penetration of anime in Europe is such that the Italian National Railway Company used a Japanese animation character in one ofits advertisements (DCAj 2003). The interest in robotics has been gaining momentum as advances in in- formation technology make possible the incorporation of more and more of the attributes of an Astro Boy in a functioning robot. The 2005 AichiExpo in Nagoya is \"manned\" by robots performing a variety of functions:they guide visitors and clean the facilities. T oyota's Partner robots,which can play the trumpet, have opened a trapdoor into the world ofentertainment. 8. Another such character, which has been on television since 1979, is Doraemon, a versatile robotic cat from the future that comes to the assistance of a hapless youngster. 9. In the United States and worldwide, the Star Wars movies portrayed robots in a favorable light. R2D2 and C3PO were among the stars of those six films and were striking for their play- fulness and companionability. They were modeled on two characters from a 1958 Kurosawamovie, The Hidden Fortress. 10. Since Aibo's introduction, Sony has sold 150,000 units, but in 2006 it announced thediscontinuation of future development and sale of Aibo (Borland 2006). 11. Miyazaki, whose films include My Neighbor T otoro and Princess Mononoke, released yet another mysterious, fantasy-based animated film, Howl's Moving Castle, in 2005.Many manufactured goods are becoming commoditized through the codifying of technology, and globalization intensifies competition. Japan, therefore, needs to derive its prosperity from new industries by continu- ously extending the frontiers of comparative advantage. Anime and robot industries are among the two candidate industries that could supplant in-dustries migrating out of Japan. Because both industries are skill intensiveand require close interfirm cooperation as well as research inputs fromuniversities and specialized institutes, T okyo is inevitably where much of the action is going to occur. ROBOT INDUSTRY Japan's robot industry is the world leader, and the Japanese manufacturing sector is the largest user of industrial robots. But the industry is in transi-tion. Until recently, the main function of robots was to improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes by replacing workers in certain repetitive jobs and other jobs considered undesirable by human workers.Since the 1990s, however, robots are increasingly being designed for newpurposes, including entertainment, and the sensors as well as other tech-nologies being developed for robots are being put to related uses, such as the creation of the \"smart house.\" In the future, this diversification is likelyto continue, and the share of the industrial robots will shrink (although inabsolute terms, their numbers will remain substantial). By 2025, themarkets for commercial and entertainment robots could rival that forhousehold durables. Evolution of the Robot Industry Following the invention of the basic robotic technologies in the United States, Japan began importing the early Versatran, Unimate, and T ralferindustrial robots from the United States in 1967. Just three years later, Kawasaki Heavy Industry (KHI) was able to introduce a domestic Unimate principally for the purposes of spot welding and paint spraying.Interestingly, one of the pioneering users of industrial robot technologywas Nissan's Zama plant in the Kanagawa prefecture close to T okyo. Overseven years, KHI and Nissan worked together on the application and maintenance of robots and the perfection of the technology. Researchersand engineers from KHI collaborated with their Nissan counterparts andthe Zama plant. The process pulled in and was enriched by the participa-tion of other subcontractors, and it underlined the degree to which the142 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESMEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 143 close interaction of the several key players in the T okyo area contributed to the manifold requirements that enhanced practical application, whichgreatly expanded market demand. By 1980, more than 130 Japanese com- panies were engaged in the manufacture of robots\u201468 in the T okyo area\u2014and their extensive use had spread not just to the other auto manu-facturers, such as T oyota, Honda, and Suzuki, but also to many other kindsof assemblers (Hasegawa 1981; Long-T erm Credit Bank of Japan 1981;Sadamoto 1981). The number of industrial robots increased from the 1970s onward, in line with the increased demand for cars, reaching 93,000,or approximately 70 percent of the world total, in 1985. Since 1990, how-ever, as a result of the downsizing and restructuring of companies as wellas the transfer of production overseas to lower-wage locations, demand forindustrial robots in Japan has stagnated and now is mainly for replacement parts rather than for additions to the stock. Industrial Robots. The current estimate of the stock of industrial robots worldwide is 850,000, and this number is projected to increase to more than 1 million units by 2008 (see table 5.1).12Japan has 356,000 operating industrial robots, or about 329 robots per 10,000 manufacturing employ-ees in Japan, whereas in second-ranked Germany, the ratio is 162 per 10,000 (UNECE 2005). Worldwide, the automotive sector is the heaviest user, followed by the electronics and semiconductor industries, which are engaged in precision manufacturing. In those industries, there is often more than one robot perten production workers (the densities are similar in Japan, Italy, and Germany) (UNECE 2004).Table 5.1 Stock of Industrial Robots at Year-End, 2002-08 2002 2003 2004 2005. a. Estimated 12. The estimate is based on an average life of 12 years for these robots. If the average service life of robots is 15 years, as some studies find, more than 1.1 million units of robots were inoperation in 2004 (UNECE 2005).144 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES The productivity and the quality of robots have been improving over the years, yet as with computers and other electronic products, the real prices have been on the decline. A robot bought in 2003 cost only one- fourth of a similar but technologically less advanced type of robot in 1990. Meanwhile, industrial wages have been increasing. As a result, in theUnited States, the relative price of robots (indexed on 1990 prices) tolabor cost fell from 100 in 1990 to 28 in 2003. Although data for othercountries are not available, the decline in relative prices is a fairly univer- sal phenomenon (UNECE 2004). The domestic shipment of industrial robots dropped sharply in 1992, and since then it has been hovering at about 4,000 to 5,000 units yearly,mainly to replace existing robots, which have a useful life of between 8 and10 years. However, the exports of industrial robots have been rising since 1990 and now account for more than 50 percent of the total shipments by Japanese firms (see figure 5.1). Decreasing domestic demand and relative prices have reduced the num- ber of firms in the industry. Of those remaining, only four firms specializein industrial robots ( Japan Machinery Federation and Japan Robot Asso-ciation 2001). These firms, together with three firms from the electric andmachinery industry, currently dominate the Japanese market. Fanuc, thelargest, is the 23rd-most-valuable company in Japan and also the leadingglobal producer of electronic controls (\"Green T ea\" 2003). The industry Figure 5.1 Shipments of Industrial Robots, 1990-2003 domestic export total0 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003100,000 90,000 80,000 70,000 60,000 50,000 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000number of units Source: Japan Robot Association (http://www.jara.jp).MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 145 is even more concentrated in other countries. The United States has only one firm that specializes in industrial robots, and Europe has just six.( Japan Robot Association 2000). Aside from demand factors and the complexity of the technology in- volved, the increasing size and concentration of firms are associated with the provision of after-sales services to buyers, which the larger firms canmore reliably supply over an extended time frame. Other Kinds of Robots. Increasingly, robots have found uses outside the factory, especially in service industries. Up to 25,000 robots installed worldwide in 2004 supplied \"professional services.\"13Underwater robots accounted for 21 percent of those robots, followed by robots for cleaning(14 percent), laboratory work (14 percent), demolition and construction (13 percent), medical purposes (11 percent), 14mobile robot platforms (11 percent), agricultural work (9 percent), and public safety (defense, rescue, and security) (5 percent) (UNECE 2005).15The forecast for 2005 to 2008 13. This fact is contrary to the arguments made by Gordon (2004a). Firms are sparing no effort to replace low-end service jobs with robots. Investment banks, for example, now routinely useautomated traders (\"March of Robo-T raders\" 2005). One way of increasing the demand for in-dustrial robots is to find an alternative use outside the factory floor. One such example is to useindustrial robots in amusement parks. Industrial robots can support heavy weights, can swingtheir arms in many directions, and are programmable to simulate different movements seen inroller coasters (\"Factory Robots\" 2005). The German firm Kuka has broadened its productrange from industrial robots for car assemblers to include robots for theme parks and entertain-ment purposes. By dint of careful design, its offerings such as the Robocoaster are becomingubiquitous in amusement parks, making Kuka the world's fourth-largest manufacturer of robotsafter Fanuc and Motoman of Japan and ABB (\"T aking Robots\" 2005). 14. Robots have three typical applications in the medical field. The first is to deliver documents, drugs, and other materials within the hospital. The second is to assist doctors and surgeons inimproving the accuracy of medical and surgical procedures. For instance, robots are being de-veloped to take blood samples (\"Robot in the Right Vein\" 1999), to automatically mix necessaryingredients in custom syringes (\"Robo-Pharmacist\" 2005), to conduct heart surgery (remotelycontrolled by a surgeon) (\"da Vinci Mode\" 2004), and to perform breast examinations (remotelycontrolled) (\"Robot Hand\" 2005). Third, robots can be used for physical therapy to improve re-habilitation, such as Anklebot, which was developed at Massachusetts Institute of T echnology(MIT), and to provide exoskeletons for the weak and disabled as well as for soldiers and fire-fighters who need to lift heavy loads (E. Thomson 2005; Guizzo and Goldstein 2005). 15. A number of robots are in development for use in Iraq by the U.S. military. iRobot's PackBots, which can dispose of improvised explosive devices and serve as scouts, are widely usedin Iraq and Afghanistan (Hines 2005). iRobot is developing a semiautonomous supply vehicle forthe U.S. military with John Deere (Kanellos 2004b). A robot with a machine gun remotelycontrolled by a soldier may be deployed in a battlefield in the future (Kanellos 2004a). iRobothas also developed a prototype system to assist troops by pinpointing incoming rounds fromrifles and mortars (\"iRobot Unveils\" 2005). The U.S. Department of Defense has givenUS$26.4 million to Carnegie Mellon University and defense contractors to develop a robotic146 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES is that 50,000 new service robots will be installed, with the strong growth coming from humanoid robots, laboratory robots, underwater systems,public safety, cleaning, and mobile robot platform. The growth in demand for medical robots is slower than anticipated (UNECE 2004). 16 The robots most commonly used by households are floor-cleaning ro- bots and lawnmowing robots.17T ogether, they accounted for 1.2 million units worldwide in 2004. Since then, the number has climbed steeply. According to Helen Greiner, the chair and cofounder of iRobot, the com- pany sold 1.5 million units of the Roomba vacuum cleaner in less than two years.18This rate of sales growth is much faster than that for any previous generation of new gadgets. For instance, it took six years to sell 1 million black-and-white television sets and four years to sell 1 million mobile phones (Hines 2005). Robots in household use are projected to reach 7 mil- lion units by 2008. Domestic robots (vacuum cleaner, lawnmower, windowcleaner, and so forth) are expected to account for 4.5 million units, and en-tertainment and leisure robots (such as the Wakamaru from MitsubishiHeavy Industry, the PaPeRo from NEC, and Promet from the Advanced Industrial Science and T echnology Institute at T sukuba and KawadaIndustry) and a number of toy robots for the balance (UNECE 2005). 19 The variance in market forecasts is predictably large, ranging from US$5 billion in 2005 to between US$17 billion (\"Robotic Pioneers\" 2004) and US$60 billion in 2010, with a total of 56 million units sold (\"Ready to Buy\" 2004). The overall robot market in Japan is forecast to be \u00a58 trillion by 2025, with households generating 50 percent of the demand, a rising proportion of which will be for robots that assist the elderly military vehicle. The Department of Defense plans to have at least one-third of all combat vehicles operating under robot control by 2010 (Kanellos 2005). T o achieve this goal of solvingtechnological problems associated with high-speed travel over unfamiliar terrain by a robotic ve-hicle, the Department of Defense in 2004 introduced a race called Grand Challenge with anaward of US$1 million. The 2004 event resulted in the best vehicle traveling only 7 miles on a144-mile course simulating the terrain in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, a year later, GrandChallenge 2005 saw four teams finish the race within the allotted time, which greatly exceededexpectations. Many of the teams were from universities and had private sponsors. The teamfrom Stanford won the race and the US$2 million award, followed by vehicles from CarnegieMellon University (Gibbs 2006; \"Stanford Wins\" 2005). 16. A wide range of robotic devices ranging from the bizarre to the ingenious are on display in the lavishly illustrated volume edited by Menzel and D'Aluisio (2000). 17. They are produced by Friendly Robotics, among others.18. At the core of this machine is an \"Aware\" system that enables the machine to move around in complex or changing environments. 19. See \"How Humanoids Won\" (2006). Lego announced its next-generation robotic kits based on its Lego building block (T erdiman 2006).(see figure 5.2).20According to a survey by Nikkei, consumers expect ro- bots to house-sit or guard the residence, to clean, and to help with other household chores while costing less than \u00a5300,000, a price comparable to other household electronics (Matsuhira and Ogawa 2004). These forecasts are for certain categories of robotic devices, some of which, such as industrial robots, are a known quantity while others, such as helper robots, are still being developed. The basic functions and expec-tations of household goods such as washing machines are the same across different households (T anie 2004). For household robots, however, suchfunctions are still not clear-cut. Honda, which is actively engaged inresearching the potential of robots, is conscious that people buy a carbecause they easily see the use for it and they perceive the value in owningit. For household robots, consumers have yet to be convinced that they would be worth owning. Part of this lag is simply because robotic tech- nologies for household use are breaking new ground, and as yet, designersare unable to devise a product that can cope with the complexity of workthat consumers expect robots to perform at an affordable price.

General Motors now offers as an option a \"Sit-N-Lift\" power seat that uses a robotic arm to assist elderly passengers (\"Ready to Buy\" 2004). A number of products, such as an automaticspoon, have been developed and tested to assist the elderly in continuing to live independently.MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 147148 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES a \"bipedal robot costs more than a Ferrari\" (\"How Humanoids Won\" 2006). Hence, simple-function robots such as Roomba are winning a wideracceptance because they are moderately priced, the consumer knows what the robot can do, and the robot can deliver the desired functions. Although household and leisure-related robots are attracting the most attention, the largest eventual markets for robotic technologies might well be in the health, transportation, defense, 21and security fields. For those applications, the embedded software, electromechanical components, var- ious kinds of sensors, communication devices, and voice recognition equipment now being developed in the T okyo region will be major in- puts even if the final product is designed and assembled elsewhere. In fact,the embedded software market for robots, for which firms in T okyo arewell placed to compete, is expected to grow by more than 9 percent peryear to reach US$138 billion by 2007 (\"Ready to Buy\" 2004). The demand for many types of electronic components is also likely to expand; where robotic applications require mobility, for example, image sensors and extremely robust electromechanical devices will be in strongdemand. Those opportunities are but a few of the many available forT okyo-based firms. But first, a host of technological hurdles must be tack- led. In this regard, T okyo has many advantages over other cities because of the concentration of university and corporate research facilities as well asthe numerous subcontractors who can design and manufacture compo-nents to exacting specifications. Technological Challenges Many technological challenges still exist, including the difficulties of enabling robots to recognize surrounding features, making them mobile,designing them to interact with people, and devising ways for them to be controlled. Recognition of the Surroundings. One of the major shortcomings of current household and other types of humanoid robots (which is common to some other robotic applications) is that the current sensors and AI technologies embedded in robots is not mature enough to enable robots 21. The development of armed and unarmed UAVs is proceeding apace, and the potential for civilian uses is also being more actively explored. See \"Commercial Futures\" (2001), \"UnmannedAerial Vehicles\" (2004), and \"Unmanned Ventures\" (2005). The National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration (NASA) is also developing general types of robots to assist astronauts in space.NASA hopes that such robots can accompany astronauts on shuttle flights soon (\"NASAConcocting Robots\" 2005).MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 149 to take account of relevant features of the surrounding environment (Ozaki and Hashimoto 2004). For instance, although robots can \"see\"through their optical inputs (in many cases using the same technology as in a digital camera), 22after the image is inputted, the robot still needs to identify the objects viewed, to determine the distance to the object, to recognize the nature of the object, and to know from its instruction set how to interact with the object.23It needs, moreover, touch sensors on its \"hands\" and \"feet\" and sensors to enable it to achieve balance, coordinate movement, and sustain orientation. Most people can quickly assess the surrounding environment and know how to interact (or react to the situation). Thus, for a robot (that is, device) to be truly useful in a household or other setting for which such productsare being developed (such as defense and medical purposes), it needs suchsituational awareness\u2014and some rudimentary social skills. The possible way to cope with the first requirement would be to embed radio frequencyidentification (RFID) chips into objects the robots will come into contactwith; these chips will provide the robot with all the information it requires.Although RFID technology is evolving, this approach might be cumber-some and have other complications as well. Hence, alternative approaches are being explored. Social skills call for advances in AI and learning capabilities. Because of the complexity of the software required simply to be \"cognizant\" of the surroundings, many firms need to collaborate to extend 22. For a robot to have a fast reaction time, the optical inputs need to be of high speed. Most ac- tuators can be controlled at a millisecond level. The conventional video input is only 30 framesper second, a rather slow flow of information. If a quicker reaction is required, then faster videoinput is necessary to improve the speed and accuracy of the reaction by the robot. Otherwise, therobot's reaction will be based on extrapolation from limited inputs (Okada, Oaki, and Kondoh2004). New technologies allow experimental robots to update information 60 times per secondand to achieve better situational awareness through \"closed feedback loops\" (Wilson 2005, 98).Vision sensors are relatively fragile, confused by changes in lighting and rendered unreliable byvibration. Robots can supplement line-of-sight vision systems with thermal and hyperspectralimaging devices and laser range finders. 23. Suppose a robot is required to close a door. First, it must scan the room and identify where the door is. T o do so, it must know what \"door\" is. Then, when it identifies where the door is, itneeds to determine how to get there while avoiding various obstacles on the way, such as tablesand chairs. When it is at the door, the robot must determine how to close it (is it \"pull\" or\"push\"?) with appropriate force. Closing a window is much more difficult because it can meanmoving the window pane down (or up), sliding it sideways, or closing it like the door. Of course,using appropriate force is necessary not to shatter the glass. Even more complicated, the mate-rials of which the object is made change the mode of interaction. For instance, chairs can bemade from metal, wood, bamboo, plastics, and paper. Of course, one would not try to sit on thechair made of paper, but how would a robot know it is made of paper? 150 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the utility of a robot. T wo ways of achieving this goal exist. One is through the joint development of a product. The other is to make the architectureof the robot somewhat open so that different components can be added, much as is done with a personal computer (PC). Hooking up a monitor to a PC is rather easily done by plugging it in, which gives consumers muchmore freedom to select among monitors. PC makers need not be con-cerned with the various options users may choose, as long as they designdevices to which other standardized components can be easily added. This approach has made the PC a highly flexible device. Robots need to be ableto achieve flexibility and expandability similar to that of a PC that willpermit easily adding or swapping components. We will come back to thispoint later. Sensor technology is another major hurdle for all manner of uses. A robot designed to entertain through interaction with humans needs tocommunicate. T o do so, such a robot must identify who it is talking to,what they are talking about, and what the moods of its interlocutor are,plus be able to express itself in a \"natural\" way. T o achieve all thosefunctions, a robot would require a good sensor (optical input device) forface recognition (similar to a digital camera), software for rapidly recog-nizing key facial features, voice recognition (and voice-to-text capability),some understanding of a person's mood from the tone of voice (someelements of psychology are needed), an understanding of what is an ac-ceptable behavior (some element of sociology), and of course, good AIsoftware. 24If physical contact with humans is a part of their function, such robots need some tactile feedback mechanisms. Once again, the experi- ence with industrial robots provides a foundation for future advance, and research on materials with sensory capacity is lighting the way forward. At this stage, firms in T okyo are working on specific aspects of recogni- tion technology, such as voice recognition and the following types of facial recognition: Recognizing faces from different angles Recognizing faces under different lighting Recognizing faces when multiple faces are visible Recognizing faces when some portion is obstructed Recognizing faces of different sizes The current technology is adequate for recognizing a single face, located at a predetermined distance from the optical input, under optimal 24. In some instances, especially using evolutionary computing, AI can come up with solutions that are highly innovative (\"Thinking Machines\" 2000).MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 151 lighting. Such a facial recognition system is already used as an entry se- curity measure (for instance, at T oshiba). The entry security system is agood example of the perfect conditions for facial recognition because the lighting can be controlled (in many cases the location is indoors), users can be instructed to stand at a predetermined distance and face in theright direction, and the database of the face is already inputted into thecomputer. However, for a robot to be able to interact with humans, itneeds to be able to recognize faces under varying conditions. It also needs to recognize the person of immediate interest (for instance someone whois talking to the robot) among many visible people. Furthermore, once itidentifies the objects of interest, the robot needs to be able to track themand isolate them from other objects (Koga, Suzuki, and Yamaguchi 2004). The difficulties with voice recognition under a variety of circumstances are also manifold but are also being whittled down little by little. Themain difficulty associated with voice recognition is, first, to recognizesound as voice separate from the other noises and, second, to do so withouta dedicated input to alleviate this problem. Once a voice is isolated, the ro-bot needs to understand who the speaker is and the content of the speech.Firms are still working on these technologies to make robotic applicationsmore useful. Mobility. The shift from industrial use to other purposes also confronts problems associated with the mobility of robots. Industrial robots are mostly immobile, fixed installations along the conveyer belt, although some mobile (often guided) robots are used mainly for delivery within a factory or warehouse on a fixed route marked with guiding lines. Inaddition, safety concerns are mainly met by specifying a perimeter thatpeople are prohibited from entering to minimize the risks from robotmalfunction. For many other uses, however, robots need to be mobile. The type of mobility depends on the application: caterpillars or wheels are appropriate for autonomous vehicle-type robots such as the ones being developed formilitary and disaster relief purposes, while quadruped or biped mobility ismore appropriate for animal- or humanlike robots. 25 25. A key concept for bipedal robots, zero-moment point, was developed by a Yugoslavian researcher, Miomir Vukobratovich, who was a close friend of Ichiro Kato, the pioneer of Japan- ese robotic research in mechatronics, at Waseda University (Menzel and D'Aluisio 2000).Researchers at MIT have a robot called T oddler that can learn to walk in 20 minutes (\"DesignLets Robot Walk\" 2005). Firms are attempting the difficult feat of creating something resem-bling humans partly on the basis of the assumption that these machines will be better acceptedif they look similar to us (Menzel and D'Aluisio 2000). This tendency is also reflected in the152 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES If a robot is mobile, it needs to have various sensors to gauge distance and to avoid obstacles in its path, as well as various gyroscopes and ac- celerometers for maintaining balance and orientation when in motion. Various types of sensors can be used, such as infrared, temperature, and vibration. The experience accumulated from industrial robots is a usefulguide for the advanced equipment now being developed, but this technol-ogy has a long road ahead of it. Command and Control. How are robots to be controlled? Currently, most commands to robots are sent electronically either with wires or wire- lessly. For unmanned ground or airborne vehicles, secure and fail-safe communication mechanisms are critical, and research on these devices continues. For house-sitting types of robots, the predominant mode ofsending commands is through cell phones, and in this case, as well, thetechnology is likely to evolve. First-generation robots needed to be reprogrammed if a change in their function was required. New programs now permit robots to be taught and to learn. The now discontinued final version of Sony's Aibo model hassuch learning capability. 26The capacity to plan, to anticipate responses and contingencies, and to look ahead are all being refined, and some of the chess-playing programs provide a glimpse of what is now feasible. The re- search on this function, which is vital for the further development of ro- botics and of AI, is being done through a RobotCub, a collaborative effortamong 16 labs in Europe, Japan, and the United States (\"Men Are fromMars\" 2005). One interesting scenario conjured up by the Ministry ofEconomy, T rade, and Industry in Japan is to use the Internet and follow strategies similar to open-source software or other highly customizablesoftware to increase the utility of robots. 27As long as many users are choice of pets. Dogs do not really begin to resemble their owners; rather, owners tend to choose dogs that resemble them (\"Love Me\" 2005). However, close resemblance can also highlight thelimitations of robots. The lesson from the limited production of NeCoRo (cat robot) by Omronwas that users felt disappointed when it could not behave like a live cat, even though NeCoRolooked like a living cat. Building on that experience, the National Institute of Advanced Indus-trial Science and T echnology in Japan developed Paro (a therapy robot), which is modeled aftera seal, an animal not as familiar to Japanese users as cats. About 500 of these robots have beensold at several thousand dollars each (\"How Humanoids Won\" 2006). 26. A robot designed by the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, California, has been able to ac- quire the abilities of an 18-month-old baby through a process of exploring and learning (\"BrainBox\" 2005). 27. Many computer games allow customization through modification of some aspects of the game by using tools supplied by the game developers. Similarly, some software, such as winamp(for MP3 playback), Opera (for Web browsing), and Firefox (for Web browsing), can be cus-tomized with extensions offered by users.MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 153 willing to teach robots new functions and they are willing to share such knowledge with others, this approach could have considerable potentialfor certain kinds of robotic applications. However, this specific type of robot would need to be connected to the Internet, gather information, and update itself automatically. \"Smarter\" robots that have the software andthe neural circuitry to be able to learn will command a far wider marketand have numerous applications. They would provide a strong boost tothe industry and the research establishment in the T okyo area and strengthen local comparative advantage. Main Players and Complementarities Broadly speaking, four types of firms are in the robotics field in Japan; they come from various backgrounds that have diversified into robotics byleveraging their strengths in other fields. The first group consists of firms producing industrial robots. The second group is drawn from consumer electronics. The third group comes from the automotive sector. Thefourth group comprises research institutes supported by venture capital-ists. The firms from the industrial robotics arena rely on their experiencewith factory automation. The main strength of those firms lies in sensor technology and tactile feedback. The electronics firms are building ontheir strength in miniaturization, packaging of equipment, energy effi-ciency, power supplies, and design. The point of departure for automotivefirms is their mastery of mechanical engineering and the technologies im-pinging on mobility. The last group of firms tends to specialize in aspects of communication (AI, facial expression, integration with information technology) and special-purpose robots (military, security, rescue). The new breed of more sophisticated robots will be an amalgam of sev- eral complex and rapidly evolving technologies. As we stated earlier,T okyo's comparative advantage in this field derives from the presence inthe metropolitan area of the many players 28(see table 5.2) that are con- tributing to the separate strands of technology as well as of firms that can knit these strands together into commercially viable packages.29No single 28. Because most of these firms develop robots as an experimental activity, exploring new possi- bilities, the location of their operations tends to be close to the main office, which in mostinstances is in the T okyo area. For instance, the research and development for Ashimo by Hondais done in Wako city (Saitama prefecture, north of T okyo), separate from the R&D for mainautomotive research. 29. In the United States, most of the robotic research is conducted with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Menzel and D'Aluisio 2000). In Japan, much ofthe research is done by private corporations. 154 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES firm can internalize all the technologies\u2014success will rest on partnerships and alliances with other firms and with research institutions. Links with universities such as Waseda (Humanoid Robotics Institute) and T okyo Institute of T echnology are multiplying, and more and more firms are entering into alliances to spread the costs of research and devel-opment (R&D) and to benefit from an open research environment. But atendency remains among the major developers to limit their dependenceon other firms, slowing progress and the growth of a robotics cluster in T okyo. The relative scarcity of research funding for robotics in general is also squeezing R&D on long-term projects. This limitation has resulted in atendency to focus on software development rather than on hardware be-cause such research activities are less expensive (Japan Robot Association 2000). From the perspective of industrial change in T okyo, the robotics industry offers robust growth prospects, but given the technological andmarket uncertainties, the fate of the industry might depend on policyaction in a number of areas. Stimulating the demand for nonindustrial robots\u2014especially for medical, military, security, and space-related applications\u2014would be oneuseful step ( Japan Machinery Federation and Japan Robot Association2001). For example, the funding provided by the U.S. government for theTable 5.2 Firms Involved in Robotics, by Robot Type Services Entertainment Medical Industrial Tmsuk (security robots, both commercial and residential) Sougo Keibi Hoshou (security, commercial) Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (house- BOY AND FRIENDS 155 development of next-generation medical and military equipment based on robotic technology is an important spur. Some of this work is done by thedefense industry, some is commissioned to universities, and some is done through open competitive tendering. Similarly, support by public agencies for space exploration is helping push the frontiers of robotics by promot-ing innovation and subsequent spillover to consumers. Because this field isstill in its infancy, many robots are created without any common platformin which firms can build certain modules. Hence, the setting of standards, possibly with government mediation, in close consultation with the indus-try, would be another significant step with important antecedents. Therapid diffusion of the PC did not occur until the interface was standardizedso that firms specializing in individual components were able to emergeand many new firms were attracted to the PC industry as assemblers of the PC or as component suppliers. At this time, such interchangeability of key components among particular types of robots is not possible. For instance,if an interface (both at the hardware and software level) was standardized,a firm could specialize in producing the bipedal module and another firmcould produce wheel-based modules. With standardization, different userswould need to change only the lower body parts for the robot to bewheeled or biped, depending on need. Additional standards and regulations will be required in the interests of safety and to build safeguards for the sake of security. As with any productsin the market, robots used in commercial and household settings wouldneed to satisfy safety regulations appropriate for this emerging technologybut designed not to deter the development of the industry. The consensusemerging in Japan is that safety issues need to be assessed according to thefrequency of direct contact with human beings. For a robot that has mini- mal contact with humans (most entertainment and household-appliancetype robots), a version of the current safety regulations for household ap-pliances, electronics, and toys can be used as the basis, with modificationsas needed. As direct contact with humans increases, however, the safetystandards will need to be raised substantially to avoid potential harmcaused by robotic malfunction. For instance, malfunctions of care robotsassisting people with disabilities will pose much higher risks than those ofa robot vacuum cleaner. This issue will become especially important whenmobile robots with sufficient AI are used in public places. 30 30. Another important issue is the question of liability in case of damages caused by malfunction. Is it the manufacturer's responsibility? Or because these robots will be highly customizable andprogrammable by the end-users, is it the user's responsibility? Or is it the robot's responsibility156 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES For certain kinds of robots, safety concerns can be alleviated by setting weight restrictions so that, were a robot to topple, it would cause little harm to people and surrounding objects (\"Chat with Roomba\" 2004). The required miniaturization and lightweight yet sturdy body will entail ad- vanced technologies in material sciences and mechanical and electronicengineering. Building in redundancy can also lessen the risks associatedwith failures of motors or of systems. Adequate and regularly updated safeguards will be needed to avert the intrusion of malicious software, especially into the systems of robots that are expected to be always connected to some form of a network. Likewise,securing the information stored in the robot to protect the privacy of theusers would be equally as important as protecting computers and wouldinvolve very similar standards and software integrity. Do We Need Mobile Robots? For certain household purposes, humanoid robots might be unnecessary. Instead, robotic attributes can be and are being built into houses, and thisdevelopment, too, will require changing the codes for housing as well as for commercial properties. A \"robotic house\" using equipment now being developed by Japanese firms could control electronic appliances and pro-vide security. Through the addition of many sensors and input and outputdevices, the coffeemaker in the kitchen could be turned on by a voice com-mand in the bedroom. T o accomplish this task, the computer must know where the instruction originated, differentiate the voice from other noises,process the instruction, and then\u2014if confirmation is necessary\u2014reportback by directing the output (in this case, \"yes, it is done\") to the source ofthe instruction. The directional output is necessary to avoid echoes and toensure that the voice of the computer is not heard by others within the room. A smart house needs to have multiple listening stations to determine where the voice came from and multidirectional speakers that will focus aresponse to a certain person within a room. Multiple cameras will enablethe computer to know where the person is (Mizoguchi 2004). Whereas in the future, homes can be designed to incorporate such fea- tures, the existing stock of housing will need to be retrofitted with wiring if a robot is given sufficient autonomy and learning capability? Currently, the responsibility for the first and the third would be the manufacturer's, but once robots become more complex andtheir learning skills more advanced, the liability is less clear-cut. These arguments may soundfar-fetched, but in fact, they are being actively discussed among policy makers in Japan and byrobot-ethicists (\"T rust Me\" 2006). Without clearly defined rules and the possibility of buying in-surance against robot-related accidents, development of the robotics industry will be slowed.MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 157 sensors and controllers to accommodate a move toward this kind of truly \"smart\" home. Mobile robots that have multiple capabilities and consider-able dexterity could be a substitute and eliminate the need for a large ad- ditional capital investment in the home. Because making the mobile robot useful will have similar requirements to creating smart homes, by devel-oping those robots first, firms can acquire experience and the technologi-cal capabilities that can later be incorporated into the smart house of thefuture. Many firms (computer, software, consumer electronics, telecommuni- cations, cable, and Internet companies) are looking at a more narrowly de- fined \"digital home\" as the potential growth area. One optimistic estimateputs the market for digital homes at US$250 billion in the United Statesalone and US$1 trillion worldwide by the end of the decade (\"Science Fiction?\" 2005). 31 The distinctive feature of a digital home is that all the appliances and electronic gadgets are connected and contents can be shared seamlessly across different devices. For instance, movies can be downloaded and streamed to different machines in various rooms.32This technology will move the distribution of goods from the physical to the electronic level. However, consumer demand for this kind of service is still low. One of the major obstacles is the complexity of the technology for making it work. Consumers do not buy systems the way firms do. Consumers buy goodsseparately and individually, and they need to be able to hook everything upeasily without any help. Currently, this option is not available. T wo majorproblems loom: file formats (including codecs for videos) and digital rights management. T oo many incompatible formats exist in the market forconsumers to choose from, and these standards are not guaranteed to lastforever, a major difference when compared to physical goods such asCDs and DVDs that are based on a single global standard. 33In addition, 31. Some of these ideas are not new. As early as 1900, the Ladies' Home Journal predicted that music would be delivered to homes through telephone lines and that refrigerators and central heating and cooling would be widespread (\"Time to Put\" 2005). The value of the total housingstock in the Untied States in 2005 was US$19 trillion. 32. Sony Pictures Digital has had a movie download service, Movielink, for several years, but with little success (\"Download This\" 2005). Even the most popular music download service,iT une, accounts for only 1 to 2 percent of the total music sales (\"Time to Put\" 2005). 33. Currently there are two competing (and incompatible) standards for the next generation of DVD: HD-DVD and Blu-ray. Equipment and contents based on both standards are coming tomarket supported by two camps of manufactures and movie studios, reminiscent of the earlydays for video recorders (VHS versus Betamax). Many expect the initial diffusion of next-generation DVD to be slow because of the lack of single standard, unlike the case for CDs andDVDs that were introduced as a single global standard from the beginning.158 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 34. Many future engineers were inspired by these anime. A group of engineers has developed an 11-foot robot controlled by a human pilot much like in the anime.the general complexity of computer-related products in the marketplace presents a problem (\"Time to Put\" 2005). The only successful product ofthis type is TiVo, which is basically a computer but hides all the complex- ity and presents consumers with simple, easy-to-navigate menus for oper- ation (\"T echnophobia\" 2005). The backward and forward links of robotics are both deep and diverse. These links make robotics especially suitable for a postindustrial T okyo.But for those links to materialize fully and exert their pull on the local economy, markets will need to be created, many thorny technologicalproblems solved, standards agreed to, and regulatory hurdles crossed. ANIME INDUSTRY The modern form of manga (a distinctively Japanese form of cartoons) catering to all age groups was popularized by artists such as Osama T ezuka starting in the late 1940s. Since then it has become staple reading for both male and female readers. An episode in a manga resembles a television show or a movie that is frozen onto the page with conversations continuing over several pages that \"focus on subtle emotional changes in the charac-ters' faces\" (Patten 2004, 236; Carey 2006). The manga comics are tailor- made for animation, which made an appearance in the mid-1950s under the aegis of the T oei Animation Company, whose star animator launchedDoodling Kitty in 1957. Animation found its stride in the early 1960s with Speed Racer and a weekly series called Astro Boy that debuted on New Year's Day in 1963. This series was followed by many others, each featuring\"a mechanical warrior controlled by a human warrior to defend Earth against invading space monsters\" (Patten 2004, 280). Astro Boy led to Gigantor to Z to Great Mazinger, UFO Robot Grandizer, SpaceBattleship Yamato, Brave Raideen, Mobile Suits Gundam, and others. 34 The hit movie Akira , screened in 1988, opened new vistas, making anime a source of inspiration for producers, most recently of the Matrix series andKill Bill . Relative to robotics, the animation industry occupies less economic space in T okyo. Nevertheless, it is a creative industry with a promising fu- ture in Japan and globally. The products of the animation industry can bedivided into three categories: animation for theatrical release; televisionanimation; and software based on the first two, including sales of videos and DVDs.MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 159 In 2005, the total turnover of the animation industry in Japan was close to US$2 billion, an increase over the previous year. T wo factors were re- sponsible for the double-digit growth. One was the box office success achieved by Miyazuki's Spirited Away andHowl's Moving Castle , Steamboy and Mamoru Oshii's Innocence . The second was the transition from videocassettes to DVDs.35Of the 642 movies shown at Japanese theaters in 2003, 133 were animation films (DCAj 2004).36If licensing business and character merchandising are added to the first three categories, the total market size was more than US$18 billion.The estimated total box office receipts and DVD sales of anime films worldwide in 2005 was US$2.5 billion. When all the games, toys, and associated products are included, sales in Japan alone exceeded US$18 bil-lion (\"Anime Biz\" 2005). Moreover, in 2003, Japan earned US$4.35 billionin merchandise sales and royalties from animation from the United Statesalone. In view of the turnover of the industry, it is surprising that most pro- ducers are small to medium size. Some 440 studios exist. The biggest, T oei Animation, has 10 percent of the total market, and the share of the sixlargest firms is just 15 to 18 percent (see table 5.3). The smallest are justcottage-industry-size operations with a handful of people catering to the television business. T ypically for an industry such as this one, only about a tenth of the productions bring in significant profits, and the margins are 35. Reproduction of videocassettes accounted for 2 million DVDs. 36. The number of films includes both domestic and imported films.Table 5.3 Anime Productions of Six Largest Firms in Japan, 1997-2003 Firm 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 1,300 2,100 3,000 firms 26,252 2004.160 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES modest by the standards of media business in the United States (\"Anime Biz\" 2005). Given the nature of the output, each project involves the participation of several entities. The production committee that initiates the project in- cludes a television broadcasting company, a public relations agency, a pro-ducer of toys, and the firm responsible for anime production. Makers oftoys are important participants in the committee because the marketing ofcharacters in various forms is a lucrative revenue stream for the animation industry (see figure 5.3). At the stage of actual production, the animeproduction firm takes charge and outsources some of the processes to sub-constructors (figure 5.4). For instance, typically eight frames are requiredto produce a second of moving sequence. 37In Japan, animations are still mostly hand drawn and colored, which are highly labor-intensive processes, each frame taking at least half an hour to produce. For given moving sequences, frames are classified into two categories: keyandin- between . Key frames are drawn by the lead animator and define the impor- tant moments within a motion, whereas in-between frames are fillers to make the motion smooth. For instance, key frames will specify the startingFigure 5.3 Market Size of Animation Industry (Theater, Television, Software), 1990-2003 0250 150200 100 50turnover (\u00a5 billion) 163.7 165.1 151.9159.3 Institute 2005. 37. This number is much less than the number of frames used in films (24 frames per second) and videos (30 frames per second). The lower number of frames is used to cut the cost. A half-hour episode of anime costs US$100,000 on average (DCAj 2004).161Figure 5.4 Market Structure of Animation Industry in Japan Producing Distributing Planning Producing committee or joint producer Television broadcasting companies, movie companyPublic relations agency (sponsor) Toy company, game company (original) Publisher, game software companyAnime production Anime production(subcontractor)Broadcasting company(television animation)Distributing agency(theater animation) Retailers Rental shops Source: JETRO 2005. 162 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES and stopping point of a waving hand, and in-between frames will depict the hands in between those two points. Most animation production firms out-source the in-between cels\u2014increasingly to other countries, such as China, the Republic of Korea, and the Philippines\u2014sometimes along with the coloring of those cels. For example, the film and television programs basedon Yu-Gi-Oh were drawn by artists working for the Dangwoo AnimationCo. in Korea. T oei Animation digitizes its drawings (key cels) and sendsthem to a vendor in Manila, which draws and colors the in-between cels and does the filming. T ezuka Production outsources its in-between celsand coloring to China to take advantage of lower labor costs. The trendtoward outsourcing together with the adoption of digital technology hasled to a reduction in the number of animators in the industry, from 3,500to 3,000 in 2005, in spite of increasing turnover. 38Despite the labor- intensive production process, anime sequences are cheaper to produce than cartoons because they have far fewer frames. Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Movie cost US$5 million to make compared with US$30 million for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie . Urban Geography of Firms Of the 430 anime production firms in Japan, 359 companies are located inT okyo, with 40 percent in two wards: Nerima and Suginami (see table 5.4).Of the total number of anime production firms, about 50 are main pro- duction firms, mostly located in T okyo. The remaining firms subcontract specific processes within the animation production sequences. The animation industry germinated in Nerima with the establishment of T oei Animation, which also produced the first theatrical feature-lengthfilm, The White Snake . The first television animation, Astro Boy by Mushi Production, established by Osamu T ezuka, was also produced in Nerima. Thus Nerima is often called the cradle of Japanese animation. Suginamihosts the second-largest concentration of animation companies, about 70.Both wards have established policies that promote and support the anima-tion industry. In May 2004, the Suginami local government opened an Animation Museum that offers visitors a comprehensive overview of the history of the subject. 38. Animation promises to be big business worldwide, and more of it could quickly migrate from Japan to China and India, for example. In 2004, India's animation business already had a turnoverof US$550 million and it employed 27,000 professionals in 2001. By one estimate those num-bers could swell manifold in the next few years (\"On the World's\" 2005).MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 163 T okyo's attraction for the animation industry is the strength of its story- telling traditions, both within Japan and within Asia. There are 4,000 publishing firms, with 200 to 300 publishing regularly. They are the main outlets for manga , on which many animations are based.39About one-third of all magazines publish only manga (there are 277 cartoon magazines) and more than two-thirds of all paperback sales are of manga (DCAj 2003).40 Cartoonists are clustered in T okyo because of the concentration of theTable 5.4 Location of Animation Firms in 23 Wards of Tokyo Ward Number of firms Source: Dentsu Communication Institute 2005. 39. The movie industry in Japan is also closely tied to the publishing industry. T okyo is a host to all major publishers and, through frequent contacts with them, a movie studio can get a first lookat upcoming novels, which could be used as the original story for a movie. When a promisingstory is identified, it needs to be adapted for a screenplay. Such writers are also all locatedin T okyo. And other supporting crews, such as recording and sound technicians, are availablein T okyo. 40. Japanese publishers have licensed more than 10,000 titles of Japanese manga in East Asia (DCAj 2003).164 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES publishing firms, availability of assistants, and large local market for self-publishers.41 With increasing digitization, more of the actual production of anima- tion sequences will likely move overseas, as is happening with manufac-turing industries. Nevertheless, the creative core of the industry, which generates the ideas and is responsible for planning and production of key sequences, could stay in Japan, mainly in T okyo. If animation is able toenlarge its share of the entertainment business in Japan and increase itsglobal following, every likelihood exists that turnover and employment incertain segments of the business could rise. The increasing attendance at the annual anime festival in Washington, D.C.\u2014the Katsucon\u2014suggeststhat anime is resonating with audiences far and wide. 42However, a contin- uing increase in popularity and the global clientele will depend on steady inflow of talent, improvement in the content quality of products, and skillful marketing. Management and marketing talent will be especially critical for the in- dustry to realize its global potential. But because most studio bosses are artists, the animation industry in Japan worries that it is short of peoplewho understand the changing tastes, intellectual property rights manage- ment, legal systems, and financing in the major foreign markets. For thisreason, Japanese animation products are rarely marketed outside of Japanwithout significant success in Japan first, although the situation has startedto change slightly in recent years. 43And no Japanese studio has yet produced a blockbuster to compare with Finding Nemo . The shortage of technical skills has its source in the inadequacy of tertiary-level courses on animation and media content, management, legal topics, and overseas marketing tailored for the anime industry.44In 41. The lead cartoonist comes up with a story and then decides on the layouts of each panel and draws in the outline of the characters with pencils. Assistants mainly fill in the details. Thisprocess used to be highly labor intensive, but gradually it is being digitized. Unlike the anima-tion industry, however, the cartoon industry has not engaged in global activities yet. 42. Yu-Gi-Oh and Pok\u00e9mon are among the most popular cartoon series, and Pok\u00e9mon is shown in 69 countries. The U.S. retail sales of manga comics amounted to US$625 million in 2004 (\"It's . . Profitm\u00f3n!\" 2005).43. For instance, Innocence by Production I.G. (the animation firm that produced the animated sequence for Kill Bill: Vol. 1 ) is the first Japanese animation slated for global distribution at the stage of production (Ashahi.com) and Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Movie was distributed only outside Japan. 44. Japan is now attracting a large number of foreign students, mainly from Asia, to study ani- mation and technologies used in video games. Those students tend to stay and subsequentlywork for animation and video game producers (\"Japan Emerges as Pop\" 2005).MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 165 addition, with respect to international business, creative producers knowledgeable about foreign markets and specialists on overseas copy-right laws are also scarce. Although 75 tertiary-level institutes with 400 faculty members teach courses on visual content, the number of students graduated and the diversity of subjects taught pales in comparison with theUnited States and other East Asian countries (DCAj 2004). The UnitedStates has several hundred film schools at tertiary level with 4,000 instruc-tors and 70,000 students. The education covers not only production but also management (DCAj 2004). In Korea, more than 300 institutes spe-cialize in training on animation and cartoons (DCAj 2004). In China,4,000 students are being trained at the Beijing Film Institute alone, in ad-dition to others graduating from T singhua University and the ShanghaiIndustrial T echnology University. Moreover, a National Animation School was established in 2001 (DCAj 2004). The University of T okyo is now attempting to fill this void by creating a department specifically totrain people who can take on production and management (DCAj 2004).The T okyo metropolitan government has held a T okyo InternationalAnime Fair every year since 2002 to encourage Japanese animators tonetwork with business. Digital Hollywood, a for-profit school to nurturepeople in the contents industry, has been in operation since 1994 withmore than 30,000 graduates (DCAj 2004). The current relationship between the media firms and the animation firms also handicaps the industry. T ypically, producers belong to the dis-tribution arms of media firms, and they identify a particular type of ani-mation to be broadcast and subcontract the creation of such animation toanimation production firms. Because of this structure, financing is limitedto the expected revenue stream from their main distribution methods, and producers tend not to explore other means of distributing the animation,such as over the Internet, which directly threatens their existing distribu-tion channels (DCAj 2004). Enlargement of the supply of skills will need to be complemented by greater attention to content to attract younger people from around theworld while holding onto older audiences. Because the new content hastended to be thinner, firms are having less success in attracting the youngergeneration who have not been exposed to the original work. At the sametime, in Japan, less space is allocated for television programs aimed atyounger people, because the average age of television viewers is on therise. Thus, firms will need to be more innovative while sustaining theessential esoteric, complex fantasy-based content that is at the heart ofanime's appeal. They will need to be able to market more effectively in166 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Japan and abroad if T okyo's animation industry is to sustain, if not en- hance, its growth.45 A NEW DAWN? The robotics and animation industries have momentum, but theirs is ahesitant and still uncertain advance. No confident prediction can be made,but grounds exist for cautious hope and the makings of two major indus- trial clusters for T okyo. Many firms in T okyo are using the idea of pro- ducing humanoid robots to motivate their researchers, many of whomgrew up watching robot-themed anime. Finding solutions for the specificfunctions of different types of robots and integrating components, whichdraw on multiple disciplines, pose many challenges. But those challenges cannot be avoided. Firms are hoping that research in robotics will yielduseful and profitable by-products that they can incorporate in otherproducts or use as standalone products. For instance, visual recognitionsystems developed for robots can be used for security systems, voice recog-nition technologies can be incorporated in many consumer and other products, and sensor technology is being used for obstacle-avoidance sys- tems for automobiles. Because of the likely safety concerns, the weight ofrobots will be restricted, which means that many parts will need to be lightas well as durable, energy efficient, and able to work with lighter batteries.Those requirements will lead to further miniaturization, the developmentof new materials, and better and lighter batteries, all of which can beapplied to other goods. The application of the technologies developed for robots to existing or new products seems to be the main near-term goal of many of the firmsengaged in robotics research. For this and other reasons, those firms tendto produce robots entirely in-house, without much collaboration withother firms and research institutes, including universities. A more openand ambitious approach will be needed. Because many of the firms alreadyhave R&D facilities in the T okyo area, robotics research is concentrating in T okyo to take advantage of the existing production and research facili-ties and skills available there. The animation industry is using the recent advances in information and communication technology to increase its overseas productions. Thistrend is likely to continue, and the source of T okyo's strength as the 45. Similarly, many movies are now aimed at an older generation of Japanese viewers.MEET ASTRO BOY AND FRIENDS 167 originator of animation will depend on the people who create the original stories, on the people who manage the production processes, on theanimators for the key cels, and on people who can market the products worldwide. Although with the increase in the production volume, more animators may be needed, it is in the business services part of their opera-tion that many firms urgently need to increase staffing. If they can do so,the global demand should be forthcoming. T okyo needs highly skilled workers for robotics. These people will be mainly drawn from the natural and social science disciplines; for the ani- mation industry, they will come from the professional schools, fromtheotaku subculture, and from professional business services. 46Whether T okyo can retain and strengthen its current advantage depends on whether the metropolis can either produce locally or attract from elsewhere the desired combination of skills. 46. T okyo also needs to attract the young. Many successful cartoonists started out their careers in their late teens by entering contests hosted by the publishers. Such contests are still the pre-dominant form of starting one's career as a cartoonist, along with direct submission of works tothe publisher.Not much more than a decade ago, Seoul was an industrial city par excellence. Manufacturing was the lifeblood of the city, andkey services were geared toward meeting the needs of industry. Manufacturing remains central to the Republic of Korea's pros- perity, and autos, transport equipment, electronic components, mobile handsets, and machinery constitute the principal exports. But the manu-facturing industry has largely moved out of Seoul and a new industrialecology is emerging at an amazingly rapid pace. Vestiges of old-style man- ufacturing can still be found in the Guro industrial district in southernSeoul, with its producers of machinery and textiles, its printing houses,and its food-processing firms now being superseded by firms specializingin information and communication technology (ICT). T o the south of thecity is a cluster of high-tech manufacturing in the Suwon area, where Samsung's headquarters and laboratories are located (Park 2005). But for the most part, the economy of Seoul revolves around producer servicesand creative industries. The downtown area, including Jongno-gu, now houses corporate headquarters and major retail outlets. Like New York, it is also thecenter of the publishing industry. Some of the leading universities andresearch institutes have located in Dongdaemun, in the northern part ofthe city. Across the river in Yoido, one finds the National Assembly, theoffices of the three major broadcasting companies, and a concentrationof Seoul's many newspaper businesses. The information technology(IT) and multimedia industries and the venture capitalists and providersof other business services are responsible for the affluence of Guro,Seocho, and Kangnam districts in the southeastern part of the city, par-ticularly in the vicinity of T eheran Street, now the center of T eheran Valley (Park 2005; Sohn and Kenney 2005). Kangnam is also where themovie and videogame industries have begun to ripen as a result ofCHAPTER 6 FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES170 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES RUSSIAN FEDERATIONSEOUL, REPUBLIC OF KOREAIBRD 34886 JULY 2006 NATIONAL CAPITAL CAPITAL URBAN EXTENT CHINA DEM.

Among the nascent cultural and creative industries, the media and con- tent industries stand out. They constitute a small cluster so far, but it is a cluster with many links and considerable potential, as is apparent from theexperiences of New York and Los Angeles (see chapter 2). It is a type ofcluster, moreover, that thrives in large cities with an abundance of diverseskills, \"thick\" labor markets, and a plentitude of supporting producer ser- vices. The media industry relies heavily on a host of other industries forfinancing and for legal, marketing, advertising, and IT services. It is also acapital-intensive industry that looks to the manufacturers of electronicsand telecommunications equipment and the writers of software for essen-tial inputs. In effect, a successful media industry can become an axis for the urban economy. In recent years, a number of Korean films have won prestigious inter- national awards and are generating substantial export earnings. Producers of videogames, especially online games, are doing equally well. The mas-sively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), such asLineage and City of Hero by NCSoft and The Legend of Mir byWeMade Entertainment, are played by hundreds of thousands of sub-scribing players around the world every day\u2014especially in China, whereon occasion up to 600,000 people log on simultaneously to play TheLegend of Mir (H. Lee, Oh, and Shim 2005). As the ranks of manufacturing industries thin out, the Seoul metro area is pinning its economic hopes on a broad range of services, in particular ona number of creative industries that draw on the cultural resources of thecity, other technology-intensive industries, and the IT infrastructure. As we describe below, Seoul has the advantage that a large part of Korea's expertisein electronics and telecommunications is concentrated in the metropolitanarea. This expertise includes the major universities and research institutes.In addition, the country's lavish investment in IT hardware has providedhouseholds in Seoul with broadband Internet access that is second to noneand that triggered the proliferation of IT-based services. 1 Can those factors support a globally competitive multimedia industry on a significant scale? The Korean government and the Seoul municipal- ity certainly think so. They have the backing of several large conglomer- ates, which have plowed capital into electronics and telecommunications and are keen to expand into downstream services. Moreover, the past few 1. See Korea Internet White Paper (National Computerization Agency 2001).172 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES years have raised the industry's hopes. Korean films have enthused audi- ences overseas, and videogame developers have notched up some earlysuccesses. Whether those successes lead to a further clustering of talent and industry in Seoul and establish the reputation of Korean producers abroad is highly conjectural. In this chapter, we examine the state of themultimedia industry in Seoul and the changes that are sweeping throughthe longer-term prospects of Korean producers in the global marketplace. THE FILM INDUSTRY'S DEVELOPMENT IN KOREA Since the end of the 19th century, production capital, directors, and film technicians from Japan were largely responsible for the initial flowering ofthe film industry in Korea. From the early 20th century until 1945, pro- duction and distribution of films were wholly in Japanese hands. At the end of the World War II, film-related equipment and facilities (mainly inSeoul) were transferred to the Korean authorities. The outbreak of the Korean War in the 1950s and the damage it in- flicted on Seoul led to the temporary dispersion of film production to other cities: Busan, Daegu, Jinhae, and Masan. After the bullets stoppedflying and the Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953, filmmakers re-turned to Seoul. The end of the war ushered in a golden era of growth forthe Korean film industry, extending to the late 1960s. Thereafter, tight regulation of industry and unflagging censorship of the media by authorities led to stagnation through the early 1990s, despitequota restrictions on foreign films that persisted until the early 1980s. 2The popularity of television also contributed to a decrease in film production as 2. Article 16 of the Motion Picture Law of 1962 specified that to import foreign films, Korean distributors needed to export four movies and earn at least US$20,000. In addition, any domes-tic films that were shown at least 60 days in overseas markets were given cash awards. Specificlegal restrictions were imposed on Japanese imports (Rosen 2003). The new Motion Picture Law of 1985 (amended in 1987) dissolved the import-export link and allowed foreign companies to produce and distribute films directly in Korea. In the past,movies were imported through Los Angeles-based Korean buyers, importers, regional distribu-tors, and exhibitors. Although imports were allowed, the screen quota remained, with at least40 percent of screen time allocated to Korean films (146 days). This period was shortened to106 days in 1996 (Rosen 2003). Restrictions remain on the dubbing of foreign movies and localadvertising for foreign retransmission channels. These are part of the Korean BroadcastingCommission's guidelines for implementing the Broadcasting Act. France has a similar quotasystem, as do a number of other countries. Among the 33 economies studied by Marvasti andCanterbery (2005), France and Italy are the most protectionist with regard to the movie in-dustry; Korea ranked sixth, along with Argentina and Mexico.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 173 well as in theater attendance. Women in their 30s and 40s, the majority of the moviegoing audience for local films, took to viewing television. Theindustry's plight worsened further when color television was introduced at the beginning of the 1980s. 3The recovery of the film industry over the past decade and its localization in Seoul is largely the result of government policies to reverse the ebbing popularity of Korean films and of efforts under way to transform the composition of Seoul's economy. The Korean quota system was put in place in 1969 to prevent domina- tion of the domestic market by U.S. films, to maintain cultural diversity, and to balance and regulate exchange between cultures (Marvasti andCanterbery 2005). This system has gone through a number of revisions. The current system, introduced in July 2006, requires that at least 73 daysof the year be allocated to domestically made movies, a ruling that will in-crease the competitive pressure from foreign films and reinforce the trendtoward higher-quality Korean movies (\"South Korea/US: Film Quotas\"2006) (see table 6.1). 4 The big turnaround of the domestic film industry came in 1999, when several new directors who were trained in the West and familiar with new techniques became active filmmakers (Rosen 2003). At the same time, funding from the chaebol dried up, and venture capitalists became an im- portant source of financing. The new capital proved a godsend, because the production cost of a feature film had increased from an average of 3. When color television was introduced in the United States, theater attendance also decreased. But at the same time, television generated an aftermarket for old movies (Waterman 2005). 4. It should be noted that protection did not contribute to the success of Hollywood. The United States has had no protective or supportive measures for the movie industry (Marvasti andCanterbery 2005), except at the end of World War II, when Hollywood movies were exportedto Europe as part of the Marshall Plan package of assistance (\"Paris, T exas\" 2003).Table 6.1 Domestic Market Shares of Korean and Foreign Films, 1991-2004 Korean films Foreign films Year (W hundred million) (W hundred million) Korean film share (%) 1991 321 1,263 20.3 1995 Council 2004.US$769,000 in 1995 to US$1.7 million in 2000. More important, the marketing cost had also risen, from US$77,000 to US$500,000. Nearlyhalf of all venture capitalists exited the movie industry by 2002, after a series of high-profile flops of big-budget movies, so funds from this source are on the ebb (Rosen 2003). Early-stage venture capital is generally scarcein Korea (Sohn and Kenney 2005). Although the quota was central to the government's policy toward the film industry, a number of other policy initiatives have also proven impor- tant. The Korean Film Council was founded in 1973 as a government-supported body to develop the Korean film industry. With the industry'ssupport, it has taken the lead in establishing film festivals that have placedKorea on the map in the world of moviemaking. Film festivals are a signof credible commitment by the government to promote the industry and to reach mainstream viewers abroad, not just a specialized audience with a taste for exotic fare and a willingness to sit through a dubbed or subtitledfilm. (That market is extremely limited.) The government invested in the Seoul Studio Complex, now in the Kangnam district of Seoul, where some of the best-known Korean moviesof recent years have been shot. This US$60 million facility contains990 square meters of studio space for underwater shooting and specialphotography; a props room; studios for art design, sound, and visual ef-fects; and an outdoor movie set. Like Universal Studios in Los Angeles thecomplex also caters to tourists, who are an additional source of income. In 2002 the government established the Seoul Film Commission to serve as an efficient support system and to assist in designing an urban en-vironment conducive to the development of the film industry in Seoul.The commission assists in obtaining permission (or serves as liaison) for location shooting. It makes available police and fire personnel as well asresources for traffic broadcasting and promotion to mitigate public griev-ances; arranges parking space with Seoul City or the subcontractors ofSeoul City; and maintains an extensive directory of resources for prepro-duction, production, postproduction, equipment, and public relations anddistribution requirements. All films are eligible as long as they apply forsupport from the commission. MAKING AND SCREENING MOVIES IN SEOUL In 2004, the Korean film industry made steady progress. Locally produced films captured 60 percent of the earnings from the domestic market,compared with 53 percent in 2003 and 35 percent in 2000 (table 6.1).174 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESFUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 175 These earnings reflected an increase in the number of films\u2014from 59 in 2000 to 82 in 2004\u2014as well as gains in cinematography and content5that have made these movies even more popular among local moviegoers\u2014anda match for movies from Hollywood, which dominate in many other coun- tries (see tables 6.2 and 6.3). 6Because of the government's efforts to develop the creative industries in Seoul, more than 90 percent of film production 5. In the early 1990s, the ticket prices for foreign films were typically 5 or 6 percent higher than those for domestic films. However, in the past few years, the difference has narrowed to less than1 percent. 6. Hollywood has not always been dominant. At the beginning of the 20th century, two-thirds of films shown around the world were of French origin. By the end of the century, 80 percent ofthe movies in Europe were of U.S. origin, while European movies accounted for less than0.5 percent of the movies in the United States (\"Paris, T exas\" 2003). In fact, many foreignproducers moved to Hollywood. Nevertheless, perhaps because of extensive support from thestate, France remains a major producer, releasing up to 200 features each year. In 2005, 73 mil-lion people worldwide viewed these movies, and March of the Penguins, originally a French film, was a great in hit in the United States (\"Channel Hopping\" 2006).Table 6.2 Number of Films Produced and Imported by Korea, 1991-2004 Produced films as Year Produced films Imported films share of total (%) 1991 121 309 28.1 1995 64 378 14.5 2000 59 404 12.12001 65 339 15.52002 78 262 22.72003 80 271 22.8 2004 82 285 22.3 Source: Korean Film Council 2004.

The popularity of films impinged on the supply of theaters and screens, which decreased until 1998; a turnaround commenced in 1999, when multi- plex construction began in earnest (Rosen 2003). Since then, although thenumber of theaters has continued falling, the number of screens has risento four per site (table 6.4). The advantage of multiplexes for theater own-ers is that they can offer movies that appeal to a broad spectrum of tastes, feeding the demand for a diverse mix of movies and promoting both theindustry's development and the penetration by movies made by Holly-wood (Scott 2004). A similar trend occurred in the United States. In 1980,there were 17,675 screens; the number of screens has increased to 36,264at 6,979 sites, with an average of 5.2 per theater (Scott 2004). The intensification of the government's support has a lot to do with the suddenness of the changes in the industry. Ever on the alert for new ex-ports to replace maturing ones and to replace industries that are migratingto other economies, the Korean government has recognized that culturalcontent (or cultural products) can be successfully exported if it can acquirean international appeal. The government believes that cultural contentcan contribute to economic growth, not marginally but significantly\u2014somuch so that the Korean Culture and Content Agency (KOCCA), 7a public organization under the Ministry of Culture and T ourism, has fixed its sights on making Korea a cultural industry powerhouse, among the top 7. KOCCA, established in 2001, promotes activities relevant to the development of the Korean cultural content business, including animation, music, characters (for licensed merchandising),comics, mobile and Internet content, and educational material. It also facilitates the involvementof Korean companies in joint ventures and partnerships.Table 6.4 Attendance and Number of Theaters and Screens in Korea by Year, 1991-2004 Total Population admissions Screens per Year (million) (million) Theaters Screens theater 1991 43.3 52.2 762 762 1.0 1995 45.1 45.1 577 577 1.0 1997 46.0 47.5 Source: Korean Film Council 2004.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 177 five globally, according to its vision and goal statement. Achieving this status will contribute to achieving the government's per capita incometarget of US$20,000. Seoul, which has the largest concentration of facili- ties, creative people, and services, is to spearhead this effort. T o this end, KOCCA has made cultural production part of the national economic blueprint. It is organized as a private corporation run by skilled managers recruited from the private sector. KOCCA 's aim is not only topromote Korean cultural products abroad, but also to nurture talent and creativity by offering grants and loans as well as by investing in creativeprojects. The short-term results have been positive: production value hasincreased and cultural content is now more diversified. Seoul is on theroad to becoming a center of production for the creative industries. The government's investment and the easing of regulatory constraints are paying off. Since 1992, the lifting of the censorship imposed by themilitary government in the late 1960s has enabled directors to increase thepolitical and sexual content in their movies, thus contributing to the surgeof creative energy (Rosen 2003). The freer climate led to the success ofmovies such as Shiri , which confronted some of the issues arising from the division of the peninsula, a theme that would have been prohibited underthe previous regime (Rosen 2003). 8 Other movies followed. One of the most profitable Korean films to screen in the United States was T ae Guik Gi , which grossed a little more than US$1 million at the U.S. box office and about US$70 million glo- bally. Another large export market for Korean movies is Japan. A total of US$3.2 million was paid for the distribution rights to A Bittersweet Life in Japan. Show East's film April Snow is said to have been presold to a Japan distribution company for between US$7 million and US$8 million. It willbe released in China, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Korea, T aiwan (China), and Thailand at almost the same time; Show East claimsthat it will be the biggest simultaneous release for an Asian film. Sony Pic-tures T elevision International has entered into a distribution agreementwith CJ Entertainment, a Korean producer and distributor. The dealinvolves Sony handling the Asian television distribution rights to two movies, but there are also plans for Sony to participate in local production. Without such exports, the Korean movie industry would have lost morethan US$20 million in 2004 (\"Asian Alliance\" 2004). 9 8. Some restrictions remain, such as the requirement to portray the military in a positive light (Rosen 2003). 9. Surprisingly, exports have become the major source of revenue for Hollywood also since the international success of Titanic in 1997. In 2005, box office sales in the United States amounted 178 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Korean films have struck a chord in Japan and in China as well, because they are based on human interest stories that are not culturally specific. They enjoy the same advantages as action movies and comedies focused on physical slapstick, because their appeal is relatively uniform across cul- tures. Korean movies are also appreciated in China, because they offerlighter fare than the often highly didactic movies produced locally (Cowen2002). Since 2000, the export of Korean films has increased dramatically,mainly to Asia and Europe (table 6.5), with each film earning much more than in the 1990s, although exports in 2001 and 2002 seem to be of lesserquality than those in 2000 and 2003 (table 6.6). In 2004, Korean filmmakers won major prizes at prestigious interna- tional film festivals in Berlin, Cannes, and Venice. Park Chan-Wook wonthe Grand Prix, second to the main prize of the Palme d'Or, for Old Boy at Cannes. Kim Ki-duk won best director awards in Berlin for Samaritan Girl and in Venice for 3-Iron . The King and the Clown won critical acclaim in 2005 and has enjoyed considerable commercial success. But more thanbeing recognized for their merit by film festival judges with awards\u2014although that does elevate the profile of particular films and the Korean to US$9 billion versus nearly US$10 billion from overseas. Brokeback Mountain and Hitch are just two examples of Hollywood movies that have grossed more revenues internationally (\"Hollywood Caters\" 2006).Without this revenue, many films would not even cover their costs(Scott 2004). The movie industry is adapting to globalization, and no blockbuster big-budgetmovie is made unless producers are convinced that it will sell overseas. Increasingly, U.S. stu-dios are releasing films simultaneously around the world instead of sequencing their release, aswith The Da Vinci Code in June 2006, so as to combat piracy. The timing of release in multiple markets has become an important consideration (Marvasti and Canterbery 2005; \"HollywoodCaters\" 2006). However, foreign movies account for less than 1 percent of box office receiptsin the United States, despite the lack of any protection. This figure is down from 10 percent inthe 1960s (Marvasti and Canterbery 2005).Table 6.5 Korean Film Exports by Region, 2002 and 2003 Share of Share of Growth Region 2002 exports (%) 2003 exports (%) rate (%) Asia 10,499,979 70 19,024,000 61 81 Europe 2,365,500 16 5,724,000 18 142 North America 695,500 5 4,486,000 14 545Oceania 123,610 1 30,000 0 /H1100276 South America 47,000 0 82,500 0 76 Others 1,206,500 9 1,632,500 5 35 Total 14,952,239 100 30,979,000 100 107 Source: Korean Film Council 2004.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 179 film industry in general\u2014the films need to appeal to international audi- ences and to cross over to mainstream taste. In this effort, Korean films seeking an audience abroad are not alone. A number of East Asian economies are trying to capture the attention of the worldwide audience. China, Hong Kong (China), and T aiwan (China)have all been remarkably successful in breaking into foreign markets, andnot just regionally\u2014their performance record in the U.S. film market isquite impressive. 10 Links with Other Industries The movie industry typically depends on an extensive array of supporting services. Even in an age when electronics communication is so effortless, aconcentration of varied talents, as in Hollywood and now in Seoul, is vital for success. These talents include scriptwriters, musicians, sound techni- cians, prop constructors, lighting specialists, digital effects specialists, andother professions, including financial and legal ones. The movie industryalso contributes to the economy indirectly, mainly by offering leisure ac-tivities such as movie-themed amusement parks; by boosting tourism through sales of CDs, DVDs, and other merchandise; by promotingcultural life; and by pulling in foreign direct investment. The increasing presence of performing artists has substantial multiplier effects and technological spillovers. Aside from material supplies andequipment, musical performers, for example, require a variety of support- ing services.

Innovative artists oftenpush the envelope, asking a maker to design an instrument differently or a choir to sing unconventionally. . . . Artists then amplify their economic significance to a region by generating work for others who are supplyingtheir materials and services needs and polishing and distributing theirwork.\" In the United Kingdom, for example, the 31,500 full-time em-ployees in the film industry supported an equivalent number of other workers in 2004 (Oxford Economic Forecasting 2005). In 2002, California had 4,148 firms with about 70,000 workers em- ployed in the motion picture and video production industry, mainly in theLos Angeles area. In addition, 19,606 independent contractors suppliedteleproduction and postproduction services; casting bureau services; wardrobe and equipment rentals; talent payment services; and the services of independent writers, directors, and performers (table 6.7). 11A high per- centage are skilled workers commanding premium wages. This is also true for the filmmaking workforce in the United Kingdom, two-thirds of which is in the London area and the southeast.12 11. Although they may be independent, many are members of either a union or a guild for collective bargaining purpose (\"Lights. Industrial Action!\" 2005). 12. In 2004, the film industry in the United Kingdom had a turnover of UK\u00a323 billion, with value added of close to UK\u00a316 billion. When all other sales are accounted for, the direct andindirect contributions of filmmaking to gross domestic product were UK\u00a331 billion. Interest-ingly, employment in filmmaking alone was equal to that in the publishing industry (OxfordEconomic Forecasting 2005).Table 6.7 Number of Establishments and Employees in Motion Picture Production in California, 1997 and 2002 Number of Number of Annual payroll Year Description establishments employees (US$ thousand) 1997 Motion picture and video production 3,321 49,762 3,408,881 2002 Motion picture and video production 4,148 69,820 5,186,938 1997 Motion picture and video industries 16,193 2002 Motion picture and video industries 19,606 Source : United States Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/econ/census02/guide/02EC_CA.HTM).

T ypically, this multiplier is estimated at between 2.0 and 4.6 (Business Research Division 2003).13 By comparison, the employment directly generated by the movie and video industry in Seoul is quite small. The 310 establishments in 2002 employed a little more than 2,000 workers (table 6.8). Collaboration with Foreign Movie Studios Financing from the chaebols contributed to the development of the Korean film industry. Funding from Samsung, Lotte, and CJ Entertainment madea hit movie like Shiri (1999) possible. But this source of funding is on the decline, and the Korean venture capital industry now offers scant support, preferring instead to finance established firms in more mainstreamactivities. In tune with the globalization of the movie industry and in response also to these modest supplies of local funding, producers in Seoul have been forging alliances with foreign partners, although not to the sameextent that their rivals in China have. The pace is affected by foreigners'perception of Seoul and the local movie production business. Partners andinvestors have yet to be impressed with what the city has to offer. Thisattitude is beginning to change, with more Japanese financing becoming available because of the interest in Korean films and the costliness of making movies in Japan. The need to find collaborators is made more urgent by the rising out- lay on each film. The average budget of a film is now US$4.5 million,necessitating many coproducers to finance a single movie. By compari-son, the average cost of a major Hollywood feature film is US$60 million(Waterman 2005). However, collaboration can also modulate content andstyle, thereby enhancing the international flavor and appeal. Daisy , the latest offering of Korea's iFilm, was written by a Korean; the director wasfrom Hong Kong (China); and the story is set in the Netherlands. In2001, Hur Jin-ho's One Fine Spring Day was coproduced by Korea's Sidus Pictures; Applause Pictures of Hong Kong (China); and Japan's ShochikuFilms. It had a budget of US$1.5 million. 13. It is difficult to adequately capture links, especially indirect ones. For instance, an anima- tronic puppet studio has collaborated with the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology to createrobots that can be used in movies (\"It Came from Hollywood\" 2003). Many links such as thisone are generally overlooked. 182 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES In 2003, Pandora Film, an independent film production company from Germany, invested W 300 million (more than US$295,000) in Kim Ki-duk's Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter . . . and Spring, which had an overall budget of W 1.3 billion (US$1.28 million).

Lucrative distribution deals with Hollywood are sometimes more valu- able than production deals, because of the entry gained into the American market. After Miramax acquired Chow's Shaolin Soccer, marketing the film became a major hurdle. The studio did some slight editing but kept thefilm on the shelf for two years before releasing it. When the company didrelease it, though, Miramax realized it had been sitting on a gold mine. Al- though Asian films are now generally associated with martial arts, Koreanfare is more contemporary (though a lot of the films are historical dramas)and reality based and appeals to completely different types of audiences. T ypically, an effort is made to export a film only after it has won approval in the domestic market. So far, no movie has been made with international distribution in mind from its inception. T o attract more foreign funding and compete with the Chinese, Korean producers willhave to adapt film content and style to establish a Korean brand that iswidely appreciated and to win a secure international foothold for theirmovies. The Film Industry Workforce Directors who were born after the 1960s and educated in the 1980s con- tributed significantly to the development of the film industry in Korea.Many were trained at Chung-Ang University in Seoul. It was one of the first institutions to be licensed as a university (in 1953) and has a Graduate School of Advanced Imaging Science, Multimedia, and Film. It offerscourses in scriptwriting, sound and shooting, editing, and acting. Youngpeople drawn to acting inevitably gravitate to Seoul to seek training and acareer. Many graduates from Chung-Ang have become prominent in the moviemaking business. Among them are directors Kang Je-Gyu and HongSan-Soo, actress Kim Hee-Sun, and leading actors such as Yoo In-Chon,president of the Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture, and Park Jung-Hun. Many professors or instructors who are engaged in teaching the per-forming arts are also from Chung-Ang University. Other schools, all in the Seoul area, include Hanyang University, the Academy of Film Arts, and the School of Film, TV , and Multimedia at the Korea NationalUniversity. Prospective directors who have produced short films or are self-taught are increasing in numbers, with the availability of affordable digital videocameras and alternative consumer movie-editing software as effective asFUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 183184 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the professional ones (\"Budding Filmmakers\" 2005).14As in Hollywood, more of the industry's services providers are working as independent con- tractors. This trend is likely to continue as the industry evolves and microprocessor technology improves (and multicore chips are introduced) (\"Hollywood Sees Power Shift\" 2005 ). The technical skills needed for film production are also more abundant as people educated abroad\u2014inAustralia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere\u2014return to Seoul, drawn by rising earnings and the opportunity for greater recognition. However, the number of graduates is still small. T o enhance their effec- tiveness, the film schools need to develop a two-year special school or agraduate school to deepen the knowledge of film production\u2014similar tothat imparted, for example, by the American Film Institute and the London Film Institute. Skilled scriptwriters are in short supply. Every- one wants to be a director, not a scriptwriter, because writers do not getthe recognition given directors. The management of stars for film production is another weak spot. Most actors receive income from multiple sources, of which acting in filmsis only one. Contracting actors and actresses for their services is difficult.For instance, stars not only appear in the movies but also on televisionshows and in endorsements, and they perform as singers. This system is instark contrast to that of the United States, in which movie stars tend toconcentrate on appearing on big screens, television stars being on TVshows, and singers on recording and performing. In fact, in the UnitedStates a movie star's stature and reputation can be diminished by an ap-pearance in a TV feature (Waterman 2005). Of course, there are a num-ber of crossovers, but in general, the number remains small compared with the norm in Korea. This pattern reflects the small size of the talentpool in Korea as well as cultural proclivities perhaps peculiar to NortheastAsia. Japanese stars behave in much the same fashion. 14. For instance, the manufacturer of the industry's leading software, Avid, claims that it has been used for 90 percent of the prime time television shows and 85 percent of the blockbustermovies. However, many students feel that the Final Cut product series by Apple can edit moviesprofessionally at a significantly lower price of US$1,300 (even lower with academic discounts)(\"Budding Filmmakers\" 2005). Also, in place of text- and image-based blogs, the new trend is tohave a video weblog (\"vlog\"), signifying the availability of necessary hardware and software andindicating that the Internet is moving more toward video content (\"Blogging\" 2005). The inter-est in video search capabilities by a number of firms attests to this trend (\"Google, Meet TiVo\"2005). This trend is not limited to moviemakers. Many independent artists and musicians are us-ing computers and specialized yet affordable software to self-promote and distribute their worksinstead of relying on their traditional middlemen (\"Making Their Own Breaks\" 2005).Korea's Competitors Films produced in China, Hong Kong (China), and T aiwan (China) have done very well at the box office in recent years. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, released in the United States in 2000, grossed more than US$128 million there and US$213 million worldwide, an impres- sive achievement for a non-English film. It was nominated for BestPicture and won the Best Foreign Language Film award, as the entryfrom T aiwan (China), at the 23rd Academy Awards in the United Statesin 2001. This achievement was followed by the wide release of Hero in 2004, which grossed US$54 million in the United States, and House of Flying Daggers, which had grossed US$11 million by the end of 2004. They are among the largest-grossing foreign-language films released in the United States. They impressed audiences with stunning cinematog-raphy and impressive and colorful visuals. The somewhat unconven- tional story-telling and presentation became immediately popular, much like Japanese anime, because it seemed so new and fresh to aWestern audience. Korean producers also face competition from India's Bollywood in Mumbai. In terms of the number of feature films produced, India is rankedfirst, producing twice as many movies as the second-ranking United States(\"Power Projectors\" 2005). Indian films tend to be highly formulaic.A young, good-looking couple become romantically entangled and, aftermany changes of costume (every five minutes) and a half-dozen or morelengthy songs and dances, find fulfillment or explore the contours of tear-soaked tragedy (Rosen 2003). The popularity of these films is greatestwith an ethnic audience, and in fact, overseas Indians now account for65 percent of Bollywood film revenues (Rosen 2003). Without them, mostfilms would not cover costs. China may be Korea's biggest competitor in movies, as it is in other areas. Chinese filmmakers are not neophytes; the Chinese film industry emerged in the early 1900s and flourished in the 1930s, mainly inShanghai. Hong Kong (China) and T aiwan (China) developed their ownfilm industries and later overshadowed their mainland counterparts.Following the reopening of the Beijing Film Academy in 1978, a new cropof directors came to the fore and launched an exciting new genre that sub-tly challenged existing movies. Films such as Y ellow Earth, Red Sorghum , The Big Parade , Dove Tree , and The Blue Kite pointed to a remarkable upwelling of talent (P . Clark 2005). More recently, Chinese movies have shifted toward drama and action, and the political edge is less evident\u2014and perhaps less relevant for today'sFUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 185186 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES audiences. Directors such as Ang Lee15and John Woo are internationally renowned and have been entrusted with several big-budget Hollywood films, most well received by audiences and critics alike. But beyond the big name directors and recognizable actors, there is in general a renewed interest in martial arts movies, which have been rediscovered by a newgeneration of moviegoers. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bruce Lee was a popu-lar action hero; however, despite his popularity, his films were counter-cultural and played mostly underground. Now that genre is both exotic and familiar, and the style has been co-opted, adopted, and imitated inHollywood action films and even considered mainstream. Even the smallaction-comedy films of Stephen Chow, who produced, directed, and starred in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle , did good business. T ogether, those two films grossed more than US$17 million in the United States and about US$90 million worldwide\u2014besides receiving favorable reviews. 16 Chow's comedic routines, reminiscent of the style of Hong Kong-to- Hollywood crossover star Jackie Chan, are a clear contrast to Crouching Tiger 's high art approach. Whether this trend is merely a fad is something to consider, but Holly- wood seems to think that it will endure, evidenced by the partnerships Hollywood studios are forging in China. Hoh Xil: Mountain Patrol, a movie backed by Hollywood studios, shared the Golden Horse Award for bestpicture of 2005. Hollywood is drawn to China for a number of reasons. First, China already has a fairly mature film industry. Second, China offers a huge mar- ket that Hollywood wants to break into, recognizing that the countryoffers the broad domestic base, especially for big-budget movies that is keyto Hollywood's success (Waterman 2005). Third, the changing political and cultural climate is making it easier to transact business. Fourth, China and East Asia are becoming fertile sources for movie themes that can berepackaged for American audiences, such as that of Shall We Dance . 17 15. His works in T aiwan (China) include Pushing Hands, The Wedding Banquet, and Eat Drink Man Woman. The most famous of all, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, was financed entirely by Columbia Pictures, shot in China, and coscripted by an American, with stars from China, Hong Kong (China), and Malaysia, and minimal input from T aiwan (China) (Rosen 2003). 16. An Observer reviewer described Kung Fu Hustle as \"Jackie Chan Meets Julie Andrews\" (\"Jackie Chan\" 2005). A Financial Times review called Chow's performance \"a gem in the film's crown\"; he was likewise praised for his camerawork and the film's dialogue and witty one-liners (\"Crimes against Hollywood\" 2005). At the 42nd Golden Horse Awards ceremony in T aiwan(China) in 2005, Kung Fu Hustle won five awards, including the award for the best film. 17. Shall We Dance was released in Japan in 1996 and won the Japanese Academy Award for the best picture. It was also released in the United States, although limited to art-house theaters.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 187 So, though many a Chinese actor and filmmaker would like to make movies in Hollywood, Hollywood wants to produce more movies in Chinaand sell to the local audience. 18Moreover, to maintain its grip on the world market, Hollywood's preference is to produce more expensive movies(with special effects), which raises the entry barriers for newcomers (Waterman 2005). The Future May Be Digital The high-definition digital camera is working hard to sever moviemak- ing's bondage to 35 millimeter celluloid film, with directors such as BryanSinger, George Lucas, and Robert Rodriguez taking the lead. The transi- tion will have momentous consequences for filmmaking as well as for distribution and screening. Digital high-definition (HD) equipment freesthe director from constructing a movie through a series of painstakinglychoreographed shots in custom-built and carefully lit sets. Instead, filmingcan take place before a green screen and background that is added or changed as the director sees fit. The face of a movie star can be digitallyscanned and projected onto the faces of stunt performers, lessening theneed for actors to be involved in actions for which insurance is expensive.Such a technique helped control costs for the movie Gladiator (Epstein 2005). Digital equipment also results in enormous savings of time by minimizing the number of takes and frees the activity of production from the tyranny of lighting in sets. With the digital camera, lighting can beadjusted at will. The digital medium has also progressed to the point whereit is providing the palette of colors, the texture, the shading, and the feelof film. At the pace at which technology is moving, the remaining gapsthat purists can point to will soon be closed. 19 Digitized movies and videos have many more delivery options, given the diffusion of broadband connections and plethora of new devices.20 Distribution through digital media allows subscribers and operators to 18. The recent Memoirs of a Geisha, starring three famous Chinese actresses, shows that Hollywood's grasp of Asian culture and sensitivities is still quite uncertain. 19. Fruitful technological collaboration between moviemakers and scientists was also responsi- ble for importing artificial intelligence and robotics into filmmaking through the movieT erminator (\"It Came from Hollywood\" 2003). 20. Digitization also raises the risk of piracy. The music industry has been fighting over piracyin the United States and so has the movie industry. Not only does piracy affect theater receipts,but it also threatens to erode the lucrative video and DVD markets in which Hollywood firmsmake substantial profit. Piracy is also the major concern of filmmakers in Korea, and many havebeen slow to adopt digital shooting because of this concern.188 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES exercise control more efficiently. It also permits a range of tradeoffs between picture quality and system capacity, which is convenient formultichannel operators feeding both low-resolution and HDTV (high- definition television) channels (Waterman 2005). The widespread distri- bution of videos over the Internet seems inevitable. For instance, BBCwill make 50 percent of its regular shows available online for free (\"YourOwn World\" 2005). And Sony Pictures Digital has introduced movies onmemory sticks for viewing on cell phones in the United Kingdom (\"Download This\" 2005). T o take full advantage of digital technology, video content needs to be digitized not only at the final stage (as in transfer from film to digital) butfrom the beginning. 21For instance, CJ Entertainment is financing eight HD-format films over the next couple years. This technology is not con- fined to the big screen. Cable TV station OCN is planning to produce a US$2.5 million omnibus to be shot in HD. This shift is as much a response to changing technology as it is finan- cially motivated. Use of this format is expected to slash 30 percent of production and postproduction costs and sharply reduce distributioncosts, allowing low-budget niche films such as Indigo to enter the market. This movie, which cost US$500,000 to make, grossed US$1.19 million on its first day (\"Miniature Could Be\" 2005; Ravid 2005). The power of the computer can also simplify the logistics of the film- ing process itself. Before shooting the film War of the Worlds (2005), Steven Spielberg used animated renderings of the movie to better plan and or- ganize the actual shooting. By doing so, he was able to shoot the movie in 72 days, about half the average time typically required to shoot a block-buster feature film (\"Hollywood Sees Power Shift\" 2005; Ravid 2005).Robert Rodriguez's Sin City and The Adventures of Sharkboy were also shot for a tiny fraction of the cost that conventional technology would have en-tailed. Digitization of a movie can also change the production processes inthe movie industry through more integration of color-generated imageryand other elements of movies (such as backgrounds) on software. Increas-ingly, postproduction can be and is outsourced (Cook and Wang 2004). 22 The technology for color generation in Korea has improved greatly in the 21. At this moment, only a few programs are shot in HD digital format, even in the United States. Many of the movies shown on HDTV channels are the result of transferring film-basedmaterials to digital format. 22. For instance, the postproduction work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy was done in New Zealand, Hollywood, and Germany and that on Gladiator in London and Hollywood (Cook and Wang 2004).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 189 past few years. However, much of the equipment necessary for postpro- duction and color-generation work is still imported. The adoption of digital technology will depend on the types of films created. Dramas seem not to benefit much from the transition from ana- log to digital, aside from the transportation cost, because their visualeffects tend to be minimal and the sequence of the story tends to be linear.In contrast, for films in which special effects are heavily used or the non-linear storylines require much heavier editing, the benefits can be far higher. For that and other reasons, George Lucas has become a vocalproponent of the digital format. T o facilitate the change from analog to digital format, exhibition venues need to be able to support digital inputs rather than analog ones. Thisrequirement affects two main venues: movie theaters and homes. The transition to digital projectors from old-style celluloid film projectors is a rather slow and expensive process. In the United States, the transition hasnot occurred as quickly as expected, with only 19 theaters converting in2002. Many expect that the transition will not be completed in the UnitedStates until 2010 (Cook and Wang 2004). 23In Korea, it may take even more time because many of the newer multiplex movie theaters began to appear after 1999 and their equipment is still new\u2014although Korea's use of digital projectors is expanding at the fastest pace in Asia (\"Power Pro- jectors\" 2005). The slow rate of conversion has meant that a movie by Sidus that was shot in a digital camera still needed to be transferred to analog filmso it could be shown at the movie theaters, arousing frustration similar tothat felt by George Lucas over the screening of his Star Wars movies. The situation could change rapidly if filmmakers adopt a different busi- ness model instead of sequencing release windows for different distribu- tion methods (releasing at movi e theaters first and then on DVD). Depending on the nature of the movie, firms could simultaneouslydistribute movies through different distribution channels, including transmission over the Internet, rather than relying on big screens to ini- tiate the \"buzz.\" 24Using multiple distribution channels could also be a 23. The move to digital projectors is estimated to save the film industry US$2 billion on distribu- tion. However, movie studios expect theater owners to bear the cost of conversion (US$150,000to US$200,000), while the theater owners expect studios to do so (Cook and Wang 2004). 24. MK Pictures experimented with releasing Desire (2003) at theaters and online at the same time because that film was shot in digital cameras and only a few theaters had digital projectors. However, the film was not a commercial success\u2014although it was never expected to be. Bubble, directed by Steven Soderbergh, was released in the United States in theaters, on subscriptiontelevision, and on DVD. It is the first of six movies planned for simultaneous release by thedirector (http://www.stevensoderbergh.net/).190 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES way of combating piracy (Cook and Wang 2004; Ravid 2005).25Once the film industry adopts different release practices, theater owners will be forced to adopt the digital projector and other amenities to stay in busi- ness. Faced with declining box office receipts (partly the result of rising ticket prices in the United States), studios are now releasing DVDs lessthan six months after theatrical releases. They are also responding to pres-sure from Wal-Mart and other retailers, whose DVD business amountedto almost US$18 billion in 2005 (\"What's Driving\" 2005). In 1998, the av- erage time between theater and DVD release was 200 days. In 2005, theaverage time was estimated at 137 days. The DVD for Miss Congeniality 2 was released in 90 days. Many believe that the time will be shorter still infuture, further pressuring theater owners (\"Building a Better Movie\" 2005;\"What's Driving\" 2005). T o realize the delivery of high-quality video to individual homes, the necessary infrastructure must be in place. The minimum transmissionspeed for streaming HDTV over the Internet is estimated at 20 to 50megabits per second (Mbps) even after MPEG-2 compression. High-quality movies (such as Star Wars episodes I-III by George Lucas, recorded at 1080p) require 40 to 100 Mbps with MPEG-2compression. Korea is ideally suited to initiate this kind of transition, because more than 70 percent of Korean households were connected in 2004 (\"HopeLies\" 2005; H. Lee, Oh, and Shim 2005). 26Anticipating this trend, the Korean government is creating a Digital Media City, where a cluster of digital media technology firms could emerge, including firms specializing in filmmaking and video production, wired and satellite broadcasting, and film release and distribution. Whether Korean moviemakers can produce a steady stream of movies with international, as distinct from regional, appeal is another question.Currently, the main output of the Korean movie industry is drama, depicting a reality with which audiences can identify. The audience for 25. Piracy costs Hollywood between US$5 billion and US$6 billion annually (\"Building a Bet- ter Movie\" 2005). Content producers and consumer electronics (and computer) producers havebeen at odds for a long time. Content producers wish to limit duplication of their products.Consumer electronics firms tend to promote such duplication, intentionally or unintentionally.The classic example was the \"Betamax\" case ( Sony v. Universal Studios ) of 1984, and in recent years, multiple court cases have involved peer-to-peer software developers (Cook and Wang2004). 26. Not only is use of broadband widespread in Korea, but mobile Internet use is high also. There are about 35 million mobile phone subscribers in Korea; 90 percent also access theInternet through their mobile phones (H. Lee, Oh, and Shim 2005).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 191 these movies is culturally fairly specific (Koreans and Japanese). For this reason, the export destinations of Korean films have been concentrated inNortheast Asia, where the cultural ties are stronger. 27T o achieve the global success of American films, Korean films will need to have much broaderappeal. It remains to be seen whether low-budget films can compete with Hollywood's products, scale economies, portfolios of global stars, and leveraging of the English language (Marvasti and Canterbery 2005). Thechallenge now is to find the right content and scale; the other ingredientsare more or less in place. 28The international appeal might be less of an issue with online computer games, which are a second major line of business for Seoul's creative industries. VIDEOGAME INDUSTRY The worldwide market for videogames was US$24.5 billion in 2004, ex-ceeding the box office receipts for movies by a comfortable margin in partbecause games cost so much more than movie tickets. 29This market is ex- pected to grow to US$55 billion by 2008 (\"Game Wars\" 2005). The mar-ket in the United States alone was US$7.3 billion in 2004, approaching that year's box office receipts of US$9.3 billion (\"Hollywood Games\" 2005). The profit margin for movie studios is about 10 percent, as com-pared with 15 percent for the average videogame publisher and 25 percentfor those in the lead (\"Game Wars\" 2005). The expanding videogame market has caught the attention of other firms in the media industry, which are keen to leverage their intangible assets and reach a wider audience\u2014especially the movie industry, which inthe United States is eyeing the game industry as a fulcrum to increase itssales by offering movie-based games. Moreover, the actors involved in 27. One of the reasons Japanese anime attracts a wide audience is because the characters tend to have certain specific attributes. In the words of Stan Winston, the acclaimed makeup and robotartist in Hollywood, \"big eyes, a head that is bigger than a body, a cute mouth, and a pug nose[are] considered lovable everywhere\" (\"It Came from Hollywood\" 2003). 28. The organization of the movie industry might also have to shift, as it has in the United States over the past two decades. Independent studios struggling to survive need powerful backers,which generally have their own agendas (Thomson 2004). 29. Johns (2006) estimates that the online videogame industry earned US$23.2 billion in 2003 and projects a market of US$33.4 billion in 2008. The console-based videogame industryearned US$10.5 billion from the sales of hardware and software in 2005 as against US$9.9 bil-lion in 2004, generating apprehension that the market was becoming saturated (\"Video GameIndustry\" 2006). The Xbox 360 and Nintendo's dual-screen handheld console resulted in apickup in sales of videogames in 2006 (\"Signs of Recovery\" 2006).192 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the source movies are lending their voices to add realism to these games,30 and screenwriters for the movies are offering their services (\"Hollywood Learns to Play\" 2005). Other media industries are also using videogames to reach consumers. Faced with declining television viewership, some advertising companies now produce videogames to showcase their products for those who spendmore time in front of a computer (\"Now, A Game\" 2005). 31 The explosive growth of the videogame industry globally has its echo in Korea.32The number of Korean videogame firms has increased from 694 (of which 416 are developers) in 1999 to 2,633 (of which 1,774 are devel- opers) in 2002. Industry jobs also rose, from 13,500 in 2000 to 33,970 in 2002 (H. Lee, Oh, and Shim 2005). Korean firms are recent entrants, with no earlier association with the videogame industry.33In the past, videogames based on specific consoles (such as Atari, Nintendo, Playstation, and Xbox) were the mainstream outlets for game developers. These machines gave rise to a division of labor between producers of hardware and producers of software, with consoles tailored to specific regional markets with their own standardssuch as PAL (phase alternating lines) or NTSC (National T elevision Stan-dard Committee) and backed by a sophisticated international network ofproducers ( Johns 2006). Korea missed this stage altogether because the import of such machines from Japan was banned. Given that the consolemarket was dominated by Japanese firms (Nintendo, Sega, and Sony) until2001, when Microsoft entered the market, none of the Korean firms wereable to develop any games for this platform. Japanese popular culture(movies, music, games, video, animation, and broadcasting), which had been banned from Korea, began to be legally imported only after 1998 following the Joint Declaration between Korea and Japan. This openingto Japanese culture has taken effect in stages. In February 2002, for thethird stage of the opening up, the import of video console games waspermitted. This was also when Sony's Playstation 2 could be importedlegally. For the fourth stage, effective January 1, 2004, the remaining bans 30. Including Sean Connery, Al Pacino, and Clint Eastwood (\"Hollywood Learns\" 2005). 31. Other entities also use videogames effectively. For instance, the U.S. military uses video- games to improve the results of its recruiting effort. The United Nations World FoodProgramme has a game to raise awareness of hunger around the world (\"Now, A Game\" 2005). 32. Steve Russell, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology, created the first inter- active videogame, called Spacewar!, in 1961 (Johns 2006). 33. For a brief history and interesting review of the videogame industry, see Aoyama and Izushi (2003).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 193 (against playing videogames at home) were also lifted. Before the opening up, the Korean videogame market was barely developed. According to theGame White Paper (Korea Game Development and Promotion Institute 2001), arcade games accounted for 61.4 percent, online games for 22.9 percent, and personal computer (PC) games for 13.9 percent of themarket, while console videogames accounted for just 1.5 percent. In 1992, Fox Ranger, developed by Soft Action, became the first com- mercialized Korean game title for the IBM PC. Although the demand for PC games remains strong with the advent of newer and more powerfulconsoles, 34the growing popularity of more interactive games over the Internet has raised the earnings of Korean developers. The precursors of such games date back to the text-based online multiplayer virtual worlds that emerged with the earliest computer networks in the 1970s. The pop- ularity of virtual worlds as in EverQuest has grown to enthrall 73 milliongamers around the world in 2003, the largest number in China(Castronova 2005). A number of Korean firms have successfully enteredthe market for MMORPGs. 35After just a handful of years, there are now more than 400 online games available and 1,500 online game developers in Korea\u2014and some 20 million players (\"Present, Fast, and Future\" 2004). According to the Korean Game Development and Promotion Institute, the industry turnover could exceed US$1 billion in 2005, and exportscould rise substantially over the US$250 million level reached in 2004(\"South Korea T op\" 2004). The Brief History of MMORPGs Starting with Dungeons and Dragons, tabletop fantasy-based games evolved into multiuser dungeons, which allowed users to enter \"text-basedvirtual environments hosted on a computer\" (T. T aylor 2006, 21-22). The first key differences between the early single-player role-playing game and the MMORPG are the fact that there is no end to the MMORPG; the ex-traordinary richness of the MMORPG environment; and the deliberatefocus on the social interaction of players and, through it, the creation of aforum of game-specific social capital (T. T aylor 2006). Although there are small, preset objectives that a player can achieve, there is no winner and no 34. The release of next-generation machines such as the Xbox 360 (in 2005) and the Play- station 3 (in 2006) stimulated the release of a new round of more sophisticated games. 35. Once the number of players expanded from 8-16 to more than 3,000, the term massively was added to MORPG (Castronova 2005).194 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES ultimate goal such as defeating the monster to rescue the princess. There are levels of progress toward accumulating wealth and power but these lev-els do not evoke much competition with other players (T. T aylor 2006). Therefore, the individual storyline of the single-player game is missing from the MMORPG. Instead, this kind of game is more about guilds,tribes, clans, or nations, emphasizing cooperation with other players.While single-player games entail no more than 40 to 50 hours of game play,MMORPG players can spend 1,000 hours a year playing (Smith 2005). 36 The only way to end the game is through boredom, although interactions with other players maintain the randomness of the events in the game (notscripted by the programmers) and player interest. 37T o reduce the risk of the game becoming stale if it is played intensively for a long period, manyexpansion packs are offered to open additional avenues for exploration and enhance the play. Expansion packs (new cities or dungeons to explore, new dragons to kill) also encourage the spillover of products into other mediaand attract new players (Woodcock 2005). Interaction with other players isa key feature, because it allows the game play to vary every day, dependingon whom one is interacting with online. The advent of the game Ultima Online (1997) popularized this genre (T. T aylor 2006). The flat monthly fee of US$10 provided further induce- ment (currently US$13-US$15 for EverQuest). In 1999, Sony OnlineEntertainment released EverQuest in the United States, followed laterthat year by Asheron's Call. T. L. T aylor (2006, 28) states, \"What you do in EverQuest is immerse yourself in space. People create identities (Avatars) for themselves, have a variety of social networks, take on rolesand obligations, build histories and communities [in which] people liveand, through that living, play.\" The commercial success of these threeMMORPGs launched this genre (Castronova 2005). MMORPGs appeared three years earlier in Korea, starting with a game called Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds, designed by Jake Song. This 36. In fact, the addictiveness of gaming (EverQuest is known in gaming circles as EverCrack ) is giving rise to serious psychological problems in Korea, where an estimated 12 percent of the population between the ages of 9 and 39 are suffering from some degree of addiction (\"WhenEscape Seems\" 2006). 37. Some games are criticized because of excessively linear game stories. Introducing random events into games is one way of lessening linearity. One innovative product is a game called Boktai,in which the hero's ability will be influenced by the actual sunlight picked up by the solar sensorattached to a portable game console (\"Sunny the Vampire-Slayer\" 2003). Videogames are not theonly ones introducing the element of randomness. Chess960, invented by Bobby Fischer, is an-other such game. Unlike traditional chess, in which each piece has preset positions, in Chess960the pieces can take 960 different positions. By introducing the element of chance, this game avoidsthe standard opening moves that are so exhaustively studied (\"Unorthodox Chess\" 2005).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 195 game debuted in 1996 and was played by a million subscribers (Wikipedia 2005). His next game, Lineage, published by NCSoft, was released in1998. It proved to be a bigger hit, drawing 4 million players (Woodcock 2005) 38and encouraged NCSoft to expand into the global market (Wikipedia 2005). A sequel, \"Lineage II,\" was released in 2003. By 2002, the initial success of these Korean MMORPGs resulted in a flurry of new entries by other game publishers, even though the overall player population was rising slowly. That sharpened competition amonggame developers to secure players; only a few games can survive in this en-vironment (Woodcock 2005). Nevertheless, popular games enjoy lastingloyalty. For example, EverQuest still enjoys a huge following, is supported by 1,500 servers worldwide with an underground command center\u2014calledDeath star \u2014in San Diego, and continues to be developed by a team of 50 people while Ultima Online, one of the earliest games, still draws150,000 subscribers (Castronova 2005; Johns 2006; Kushner 2005, 34-36). In the current MMORPG market, 85 percent of the games are fantasy based, 9.5 percent rely on sci-fi themes, 1.3 percent are combat simulationgames, and 4 percent fall into social and other categories (Woodcock2005). 39This market is highly skewed compared with that of other enter- tainment products, such as movies, where there are more sci-fi stories than fantasy stories. This scenario is likely to change in future, as more games with sci-fi themes are launched in 2006 (Woodcock 2005). The MMORPG also has a more devoted following in Asia, although FinalFantasy XI did well in the United States (Woodcock 2005). 40 Technical Challenges Posed by MMORPGs Simply put, the difference between the single-player role-playing game and the MMORPG is that there are many more people playing the game 38. Not all 4 million players pay subscription fees. Many players in Korea play this game at Internet caf\u00e9s (PC baangs in Korea), and the owners of the caf\u00e9s pay the subscription fees, open- ing a wedge between the number of players and the number of subscribers (Woodcock 2005). 39. This breakdown is based on U.S. data, so when one includes the market share of Lineage and other Korean games, the share of fantasy-oriented games is much higher. 40. Ultima Online achieved the highest subscription in 2003 with 250,000 subscribers, but by March 2005, the number had declined to 160,000 worldwide, of which 70,000 were in Japan(Woodcock 2005). In March 2005, the subscriber base of Lineage was about 2 million worldwidebut only 7,623 in the United States (Woodcock 2005). Lineage II was released in Korea inNovember 2003 and in the United States in April 2004. In early 2005, it had 2.1 million sub-scribers worldwide with 65,644 in the United States (Woodcock 2005). The newcomer, Worldof Warcraft, is hugely successful. Within three months of its launch in China, it attracted morethan 2 million customers. The subscriber base for MMORPGs in China is said to be 25 million,with estimated revenues of US$390 million. The expected growth rate is 40 percent over thenext three years (\"Role-Playing\" 2005).196 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES at the same time in a much larger virtual world\u2014one more generously supplied with quests, puzzles, danger, missions, and possibilities for socialinteraction through economic transactions and gift-giving, made possible by a larger dose of artificial intelligence (AI). Thus, much of the innova- tion is in the client-server technology, especially the server technology,because of the need to handle massive amounts of information simultane-ously while keeping the connection to many players (Kushner 2005). Each MMORPG requires many servers. They can be grouped in three categories: zone servers, 41chat servers, and database servers (Smith 2005). Because the key attraction of the MMORPG is the opportunity to inter- act with other players, chat servers play a crucial role in assisting commu- nications among players. Database servers keep all the information and attributes of every single item available in the game, numbering in thethousands, while zone servers are the main servers that participants use toplay and manipulate the objects and other characters in the game. Notonly do zone servers keep track of the movements and actions of the players; they also control the other creatures controlled by AI, dependingon the players' actions (Castronova 2005; Smith 2005). The graphics filesare stored on the clients' computers. The server, by sending small packetsof information, tells the files what to do. T ypically, each zone server represents a small predefined location within a larger world. The persistence of the world is another key featureof MMORPGs; hence, the server needs to run continuously (Smith2005). 42Because of much longer playing time, the world that participants play in needs to be much larger than it is in the single-player games. The virtual world of EverQuest, one of the most popular MMORPGs, covers an area of 350 square miles\u201415 times larger than Manhattan. Seamlessly integrating servers to provide smooth game play is a daunting task andsupporting technicians have to deal with bugs around the clock(Smith 2005; Kushner 2005). 41. The world of MMORPG can be either zoned or seamless . In the zoned games, when a player enters a zone, only those data are transmitted and loaded on a player's computer. Thus, when one is moving from one zone to the other, there is a lag and discontinuity in the game. In theseamless world, players can continue traveling from one area to another without such delay.Those different types of world structure affect the memory requirements of client computers,the bandwidth requirements, and server configurations. In a zoned world, typically a server isassigned for each zone, balancing the load, whereas in the seamless world one server handles allthe players. Zoned worlds tend to be able to accommodate a much larger number of players atthe same time because of this configuration (Wikipedia 2005). 42. This persistence is a key difference from other online games, in which the environment one plays in is not persistent.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 197 These games create an environment for the advancement of personal avatars. They also promote thousands of items that are sold at merchant shops and through auctions among players, so several elements of eco- nomic models are integrated and are affected by players' actions.43T. L. T aylor (2006, 62) observes that \"one of the most fundamental and indeed most powerful design choices made for the game was the creation of many objects and the ability to trade.\" Game developers need to maintain basic macroeconomic stability as much as real-world policy makers do,especially by curbing too rapid an increase in money supply (Smith2005). 44 In the late 1990s, high-end games cost only US$3 million to develop. Currently, development of the average videogame for the latest high- performance consoles such as the Xbox 360 costs anywhere between US$5 million and US$12 million, although there are exceptions (\"Gam- ing Goes to 2004; \"Hollywood Learns to Play\" \"Delaysand For instance, Microsoft spent US$40 million todevelop and market its flagship game, Halo 2 (\"Game Wars\" 2005). Bycomparison, an MMORPG with more realistic graphics is much larger and more complex than the single-player games and can cost upward ofUS$40 million to develop (Smith 2005). Some games, notably FinalFantasy XI and World of Warcraft, are part of the well-establishedfranchise of the single-player games. These firms are leveraging the pop-ularity of their original games and extending into the MMORPG arena. MMORPGs based on Star Trek , The Matrix , and Lord of the Rings are in development (Smith 2005). Videogames Come to Seoul The videogame industry is similar to the film industry in that it is highly volatile and only a few firms will be successful. For instance, it is estimated 43. The real-world EverQuest economy is worth $150 million annually. Where money is in- volved, crime follows. In Korea half the computer-related crimes committed in 2003 wererelated to thefts from synthetic worlds (Castronova 2005; Kushner 2005). 44. Hyperinflation is a common problem in these types of games, although it depends on the na- ture of depreciation of items in the game. The items and other tradable properties collected inthe games can be traded in the real economy using real money, typically through eBay. Theowner of the Internet caf\u00e9 can sell these items collected by others for a profit. Often, the arrange-ment is that owners of the Internet caf\u00e9 receive some small percentage of the earnings in thegame. Reportedly, one can make US$100 a day working at the online \"sweatshops\" in China(\"Virtual War Game\" 2005; Wikipedia 2005). There are even foreign exchange services, whichtrade funds from one game to others, including real currencies (\"Model Economy\" 2005). SeeCastronova (2001, 2002, 2003) for an interesting analysis of the virtual economy in EverQuest.198 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES that 14 percent of the games generate as much as 70 percent of the rev- enues (Aoyama and Izushi 2003). The export markets for these games tendto be China, Japan, and T aiwan (China), owing to cultural similarities, low-entry barriers, and the prevalence of online gaming. 45In the long run, penetration into U.S. and European markets is the goal of Korean producers. The game industry is going global in order to recoup development costs and also to add variety to the offerings. A high-quality game can cost US$10 million to US$20 million to develop, and this cost is expected torise further with the introduction of the new generation of game consoles.Although consumer preferences seem to be converging, each market has its particular preferences and customization is needed. Johns (2006, 173)notes that ultimately videogames are cultural products \"that are read inspecific ways depending upon the locality in which they are produced.\"The popular online game EverQuest II, by Sony Online Entertainment,was customized to fit the taste of the Asian market in partnership with T aiwanese developer Soga (\"American Gamers\" 2005). Licensing games developed elsewhere can add variety to the genres and types of games sold. For instance, the videogame market in the United States is dominated by sports, military, 46and racing games. Licensing other games, such as puzzle games developed in Japan, can bring different kind of games that may not sell well but will increase the variety of games in the market, keeping gamers interested (\"American Gamers\" 2005). Consolidation. Firms in the videogame industry need to have a wide range of games to diversify their risks, similar to movie studios, because only 5 percent of the games will sell more than 1 million copies (\"Game Wars\" 2005). This situation has led to a concentration of publishers, with the top five firms accounting for 56 percent of the U.S. market (\"GameWars\" 2005). 47 45. Some games are developed specifically for the export market. For instance, Mabinogi by Nexon was developed to cater to the Japanese market. 46. The U.S. military is developing virtual reality-based combat simulators for training purposes and is using videogames to hone the skills of its soldiers (Alpert 2006; \"Virtual Reality\" 2006). 47. For instance, Bandai (the largest toymaker in Japan) took over Namco (a leading videogame developer and the creator of Pac-Man) (\"Bandai to Buy Namco\" 2005). In many cases, mediafirms also own game developers. Blizzard, the developer of World of Warcraft, is owned byVivendi Universal (\"Virtual War Game\" 2005). Another game publisher, Ubisoft of France,is seeking to merge with a leading media firm (such as Disney or Time Warner) rather thanbe taken over by Electronic Arts, the leading videogame publisher in the United States(\"Hollywood Games\" 2005).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 199 A similar pattern of consolidation is surfacing in Korea, with local and some foreign publishers acquiring developers. Rising costs of individual games are supplying an additional push. In fact, the top five firms now ac- count for 80 percent of the market. For instance, Nexon acquired Wizet Corp., the developer of Maple Story; Shanda of China has acquired Actoz,a Korean game-developing firm. 48Currently, only Chinese firms are in- terested in acquiring Korean firms in search of content. However, in the future, as U.S.-based firms expand into East Asia, more investment by U.S. firms is likely in Korea. Already close to 40 percent of the shares of NCSoft, the largest online gaming company, are owned by foreigners.NCSoft, in turn, is active in the U.S. market. It acquired ArenaNet in2002 and distributes games for U.S. developers. 49NCSoft is planning to establish a branch in Beijing, which would mainly focus on graphic designs and draw on the large number of graduates from universities in the area. The Beijing branch would be in addition to its office in Shanghai, estab- lished when it acquired former partner Shina. Webzen has wholly owned subsidiaries in Shanghai, T aiwan (China), and the United States. The role of the subsidiary in the United States is tolocalize the products developed in Korea, gather marketing information in the United States, identify promising products in the United States thatcan be distributed through its client-server technology, and provide cus-tomer support. The role of the subsidiary in Shanghai is more develop-ment oriented, although the client-server programmers are all Korean.The choice of Shanghai stems from the abundance of developers, mass media, and government agencies there. The Geography of the Gaming Industry. Firms in the game industry are clustered in the Kangnam area in Seoul, much like the moviemaking firms. Nexon is there, along with its partners (developer firms). The location is advantageous for recruiting client-server technicians and programmers from such prominent universities as Seoul National University. In addi-tion, the availability of producer services, such as marketing, is an advan-tage, as is the access to government bodies and industry associations. 50 48. Chinese firms such as Shanda, Netease, and The9 have built up the distribution network to sell prepaid access cards for these games. Most games are licensed from abroad; there are nohomegrown Chinese games (\"Role-Playing\" 2005). 49. ArenaNet is a game development company founded by the team that developed the game network Battle.net, as well as hit games such as Starcraft, Diablo, and Warcraft. 50. Local labor markets are key to the development of clusters of creative industries (Scott 2006).200 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES In terms of infrastructure, Seoul offers the best there is in Korea for high-speed, bandwidth-hungry applications. The reason has to do with the concentration of Internet exchanges (IXs) in Seoul. An IX is a node within the Internet, connecting other IXs (domestic or foreign) or Inter- net service providers (ISPs). Thus, traffic between two ISPs will mostlikely pass through an IX (although they can bypass it by connectingdirectly with each other). 51The data will have less distance to travel and less chance of being affected by congestion if they are closer to an IX. Most of the servers are provided by the publishers, although private servers exist. However, the need for the servers to be up continuously,the large storage requirements, and the high bandwidth requirementsare the main reasons private servers for MMORPGs are few (Wikipedia2005). The only exception to this general tendency seems to be in China.There, private servers have sprouted because the 100 Mbps fiber-optic connection can be had for as little as US$30 a month and the operatingcost of servers seems to be lower in China (Wikipedia 2005). Outsourcing. Most game developers tend to specialize in a few upstream areas and outsource other functions, generally to nearby firms, which promotes clustering. These functions include full-motion video, three- dimensional (3D) renderings for showcases, and sound effects. Other firms (such as NCSoft) produce everything in house. T ypically the showcasepiece requires artistic rendering of the actual game play, combined withmusic made specifically for it. An example is the showcase piece for SUN(the upcoming game by Webzen), created by the company that made the soundtrack for Lord of the Rings . For specific services, developers will search widely and contract the best supplier, wherever the firm may belocated. Research and Development, Innovation. Among the creative indus- tries, producers of videogames devote considerable resources to research and development (R&D) (Aoyama and Izushi 2003). As noted earlier, the strength of the Korean videogame firms lies in the client-server 51. The best way to understand the role of an IX is to think of it as a major airport hub (http://www.linktionary.com/i/internet_arch.html). For instance, imagine a trip fromWashington, D.C., to Seoul. One would travel first to Reagan National airport (from your hometo an ISP), then to Chicago O'Hare airport (from an ISP to an IX), then to Inchon airport(another IX), then to downtown Seoul (from IX to ISP). As in air travel, one can take many dif-ferent routes (instead of Chicago, one can use San Francisco or Los Angeles). As with any flight,the more stops you make along the way, the more time it takes in general (a flight from Wash-ington, D.C., to Chicago to San Francisco or Los Angeles, and then to Seoul would take longer).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 201 technology, such as Nexon's hybrid peer-to-peer system. Although this system includes a central server, only selected data are sent to the centralserver and other data are sent directly to the other PCs. Thus, Nexon eliminates the time lags often seen in action and arcade types of online games. The development of the client-server technology is the result ofexperience accumulated through learning by doing, especially from man-aging simultaneous connections to half a million players. The wide diffusion of broadband connection and a large player base are advantages that Korean firms enjoy relative to other countries. Because of them, the network-oriented technologies tend to be developed in theirlabs in Seoul. Korean firms also expend considerable effort in developingtheir own engines or adapting the engines of others. Webzen, for example,purchased the Unreal engine and customized it to avoid royalty payments. Korean firms also have R&D centers scattered around the world. Nexon has an office in T okyo to scout for ideas and content suitable forthe Japanese market. The reasons T okyo was chosen are its high concen-tration of gamers, easy access to information, and availability of support-ing firms, although the development of the game Mabinogi took place inSeoul at DevCat Studio (an R&D center for Nexon). NCSoft has an officein Austin, T exas, where many game developers are concentrated and aredeveloping its next game, T abula Rasa. 52 Demand for Skills Making computer games requires a multitude of skills (table 6.9). The skills of programmers are key, but the industry also depends on artists,musicians, and designers who can conceptualize and manage the entire development project. In many respects, videogame production is similar to movie production, which partly accounts for the proximity of the movieand gaming industries in Seoul. Clearly, a mix of skills is needed to produce commercially viable MMORPGs. Because it is equipment intensive, a MMORPG needs many client-server technicians to ensure a smooth online experience. This typeof skill is relatively abundant and most videogame firms in Korea are sat-isfied with the quality of \"pure\" programmers coming out of local 52. Austin, T exas, was also where the legendary game developer Richard Garriott (creator of Ultima game series) was located. T o break into the U.S. market, NCSoft hired Garriott in 2001and T op\" 2004).202 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 6.9 Occupational Categories and Required Skills in the Videogame Industry Occupational Skills and training category Major tasks required Game designers Artists Sound designers Programmers Game testersDesigners write the blueprint of the game and decide on the mission, theme, and rules of play. Various designers work on concepts, on different levels, and on texts and dialogues. Artists create graphics. In a two- dimensional game, they draw imageson paper and then scan them intothe computer; in a three-dimensionalgame, they create most images on computer. Character artists design and build creatures; animators make them move. Background artists create videogame settings, and texture artists add detailto the surfaces of 3D art. Sound designers compose music and sound in a game, researchappropriate music options forparticular games, and choose creativesound effects with the correct balanceof realism and exaggeration so as tooptimize the entertainment value. Programmers plan and write videogame software and translateideas into mathematical equations. Engine programmers write software that makes videogames run. Artificial intelligence programmers write code to make computer-controlledcharacters act realistically. Graphics programmers, sound programmers, and tool programmerswrite software for artists and designers. Game testers play games to find errors in software, graphic glitches,computer crashes, and other bugs. They write reports describing problems they find.Required skills include writing and communication abilities; man- agement skills; technical skills, including computer programming and software design. Most designers earn a college degree in English, art, orcomputer science. Required skills include visual imagination, ability to apply basic math concepts, and abilityto use modeling and animatingsoftware. Most videogame artists have formal training in the fine arts or art- related subjects; bachelor's degrees are an advantage. Required skills include musical creativity, training in audioengineering, and knowledge ofthe basics of computer hardwareand software. Many sound designers have a bachelor's degree in music, andsome have education in filmscoring. Required skills include strong math skills and knowledge ofcomputer pr ogramming (C and C++). Most programmers have a bachelor's degree in computer science. Required skills include an ability to communicate clearly, familiaritywith technology, and expertgame-playing skills. A formal education is not required, but testers are encouraged toearn computer techniciancertificates. Source: Crosby 2000.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 203 univer sities. \"Engine\" programmers, who also are in big demand (to define the physics, collision detection, motion, and so forth), can also be found in local universities. The worry for firms such as Nexon is the lack of content creators. Because the industry is relatively new, the pool of creators with expertise is still small, with only about 10 such people in Korea now. Currently,Webzen sponsors several private game academies, but it feels that univer-sities should shoulder this role. This gap in university offerings is the major issue confronting the game industry in Korea. Universities andvocational education institutes do not provide customized training coursesfor creators. Furthermore, continuous technological change on the PC side\u2014 especially in the processing power of both the central processing unit and the graphics cards and in the demand for rich content (three dimensional rather than two dimensional)\u2014necessitates continuous upgrading of skillsby workers or their replacement by new workers equipped with the latestexpertise. 53 Often neglected in the story is the role played by musicians. Music in videogames now is used in the same as way as in movies: to heighten emo- tional responses and to signal changes in scenes. In the past, scores could be bought fairly inexpensively (for, say, US$15,000). However, with the increase in sophistication of the music included in videogames, well-madegames now contain four to five hours of original music by the likes ofthe Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, with the cost limited only by thebudget (\"Play Myst\" 2005). Alongside the involvement of Hollywood actors and actresses and directors in the videogames, composers whoproduced soundtracks for the movies are being hired to provide the in-game music. 54In Japan, where videogames have been tremendously popular, sales of game soundtracks have been quite robust. The game industry is largely male dominated55in terms of both con- sumers and developers, but now the leading firms are taking a serious look at the other half of the population, which has been mostly untouched 53. For instance, Lineage II is in 3D. 54. One such example is the music for Metal Gear Solid 2, composed by Harry Gregson- Williams, who also did the soundtracks for Shrek, Spy Game, and Armageddon (Hermida 2002). 55. According to one study, 80 percent of EverQuest players were male; they played an averageof 25 hours per week. Most were not students. A separate survey showed that about a fifth ofthe hard-core players were so immersed in the synthetic world that they treated it as reality(Castronova 2005). 204 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES (\"Female Sensibility\" 2005; T. T aylor 2006).56The first sign of interest among female players was in The Sims by Electronic Arts. The second came from MMORPGs. Both types of games are social: interactions with other players are the main feature (\"Female Sensibility\" 2005). Promoting the Games Industry For a number of reasons, MMORPGs have acquired a large following in Korea and abroad. First, as mentioned earlier, the highly interactive na-ture of the games is attractive to consumers, especially in East Asia, where the group mentality still is strong. Games such as EverQuest, for example, by inducing communication among players, \"facilitate various forms ofsocial interaction and interdependence\" (T. T aylor 2006, 38), supportingthe formation of groups, guilds, and collectives. Guilds, for example, are\"officially sanctioned organizations of players with a hierarchical leader- ship structure . . . [and] the high end guilds are very adept at blendinginstrumental action with social work.\" (T. T aylor 2006, 43). Second, as with the movie industry, the Korean government has been lavish with institutional support and some venture capital support to helpthe industry develop in Seoul. The Korea Game Development Institute, under the Ministry of Culture and T ourism, offers seminars, connects for- eign partners with domestic ones, conducts market research, and givesgame developers an opportunity to participate in foreign exhibitions. Morebroadly, the Korea IT Industry Promotion Agency, under the Ministry ofInformation and Communication, is responsible for policies and infra-structure provisions that may improve the game industry as a whole. It alsomatches local firms with foreign firms and conducts market trend research.Both associations, in addition, provide a variety of materials and financialsupport, promote exports, and grant awards. The Korean Association ofthe Game Industry, meanwhile, acts as the public relations arm for thegame companies. Some venture capital has come from the government-owned Hansol venture capital arm, as well as from private providers. Government support of IT, which made broadband connections available to most urban households, has enabled more Korean consumers to play MMORPGs longer. The broadband connection is always on, andusage is unlimited. By expanding the user base, the proliferation of Inter-net caf\u00e9s (PC baangs ) has contributed significantly to the popularity of this type of game in Korea. 56. Men purchase 70 percent of all video console games; 10 percent of all software engineers are women, but only 4 percent of game programmers are women (\"Programmers\" 2005).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 205 Third, the new business model, which permits free downloads of the client program with a monthly subscription, eliminated the threat of piracy that plagues computer and console games. Firms have been able to recoup development costs gradually through subscriptions. Fourth, many game-producing firms are classified as venture capital- supported companies and, as such, were able to secure highly qualified personnel at low wages through the Special Military Service system.57 Fifth, the marketing barriers for MMORPGs are, from the firm's point of view, lower than for typical computer-based videogames (although they do present different challenges in the form of client-server management). The underlying engines (for 3D graphics or client-server technology) and middleware (such as adventure-building systems and plug-ins for superiorAI effects) can be licensed from other companies (Castronova 2005). 58 There is no preset storyline besides the very simple broad premise on which the game is based. By comparison, many large Japanese game de-velopers painstakingly create a complete storyline for each computer game from beginning to end (\"Invaders\" 2003). With MMORPGs, the story evolves as the game progresses, through interaction with other players.And because many of the significant characters are controlled by people,there is less need to invest in the development of good AI to mimic humanbehavior. 59 Firms are leveraging the experience gained from online games to branch out into other lucrative markets, such as consoles and mobile games. For instance, Webzen is planning to release two new games for 57. As part of their military service, Korean men in their 20s can serve in the Special Military Service, working in companies designated as Special Military Service companies. This systemwas designed to supply employees to enterprises related to national defense and to supportresearch in the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and T echnology in the 1980s. Later, the sys-tem expanded and the conglomerates and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) could also useit. It provides benefits such as career recognition and academic continuity to students. For thefirms, this system is a stable source of employees at relatively low wages. T o hire experts in tech-nology, companies have to pay high wages, which many SMEs cannot afford. However, the Spe-cial Military Service system attracts more participants with greater technical capabilities who donot expect higher compensation. 58. For instance, Lineage II is based on the Unreal engine. There are other 3D engines, such as Quake and Source (used in Half-Life 2). 59. This is also true of many first-person shooter games, which are exclusively multiplayer ori- ented. For these kinds of games, the developer needs to supply a good collection of maps andsound effects and a networking layer without any storylines or creatures controlled by AI. Inaddition, these types of games can be customized by users (new maps, new textures, new \"look\"of the people, and so forth) using the tools supplied by the developers, significantly extendingthe life of a game without using additional resources.206 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES consoles in the next few years. The global market for cell phone games has climbed from US$587 million in 2003 to an estimated US$3.0 billion in2005 and shortly could exceed the US$3.5 billion market for ring tones. 60 The market has begun attracting the big console game producers, such asElectronic Arts and Activision (\"T aking Video Games\" 2005). With closeto a third of the world's population now carrying cell phones and millions of people having grown up playing console games, it is almost inevitable that the videogame industry will mount a strong push into this lucrativeterrain (\"Mobile Phone Makers\" 2005). However, whether Korean firmscan successfully break into this market remains to be seen. Unlike thecomputer and online games in which they now excel, games optimized for mobile phones present a higher level of difficulty. They need to be writtenmore efficiently, and a new gaming style needs to be adopted to fit into asmall screen. Thus far, only old games such as T etris and Pac-Man hadmuch success. Only 4 percent of cell phone users currently download andbuy games (\"Tiny Games\" 2006). Conceivably, console videogame makers may have an edge in this area with their experience (\"Gaming Goes to Hollywood\" 2004) and with their capacity to leverage their establishedfranchise in old games (bringing out the old games for a new platform) 61 and hit movies (\"Halo Effect\" 2004).62 THE EMERGING MULTIMEDIA ECONOMY T echnological development and the changing tastes and preferences of the younger generation are leading to a convergence of the film andvideogame industries. Seoul, which is Korea's cultural capital and the home for both these nascent industries, stands to benefit from such a convergence and a strong global demand for movies and games. Both the film industry and the videogame industry are developing rapidly in Seoul. Their prospects depend on how appealing either or both 60. Mobile games sales are expected to grow 60 percent in 2006. By 2010, the market size is pro- jected to reach US$18 billion (\"Tiny Games\" 2006). 61. There has been a move toward archiving and preserving old video games in a museum. How- ever, this effort has met with a rather cool response from the computer game industry. Part ofthe reason is that the industry is still relatively young and does not yet appreciate the importanceof history (\"Arcade Addicts\" 2003). 62. For instance, the Spiderman game is already in development for mobile phones by India- games in Mumbai. The company also developed a mobile game based on the hit TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\"Games Become a Global Play\" 2005). Disney has acquired Living Mobile, a German-based supplier of games for mobile phones (\"Disney\" 2005). It is already the largestprovider of mobile phone content in Japan, with about 3.3 million subscribers (\"Disney\" 2005).FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 207 of them become globally and how much synergy they can generate. The United States, the world leader in the movie industry, provides a model ofhow the two industries might jointly develop. American movies have global appeal. An important segment of the videogame industry now rides on the popularity of the movie industry by introducing games based onmovies such as Spiderman, Star Wars , and X-Men . Unlike in the past, when movie rights were sold to game publishers as an afterthought, game devel-opers now become involved while the movie is being made (\"Gaming Goes to Hollywood\" 2004). 63The process works in reverse as well. Movies are being made that are based on the themes and characters from success- ful games such as T omb Raider and Pok\u00e9mon. Similarly, the popularity of both anime and console videogames are buoying Japanese exports of movies (most of them anime) and videogames. The videogame industry in Korea differs from that in Japan. There, the industry's strength stems from easy access to hardware makers (Nintendoand Sony), good story-telling capabilities based on manga (as described in chapter 5), and the use of graphics and sound effects by the anime indus- try. Although Korean game firms also acquire ideas from films, comicbooks, and novels, the links with other industries are much tighter andmore integrated in Japan. In Korea, the movie industry is more dramabased, with a focus on real-world situations, whereas MMORPGs are more fantasy based. 64Nexon, for example, does not charge a subscription fee for its game KartRider, but it earns handsome revenues from selling accessories and high-priced avatars. With 12 million Koreans playing KartRider and spending at the online store, the earnings start to mount (\"Dude\" 2005). A vibrant videogame industry will need to have both types of developers: those who are the source of ideas and those who depend on 63. Although there is much similarity and collaborative effort between the movie and the videogame industries, a number of differences remain. One is that videogames can be tested andreworked many times before their release, unlike movies. Second, game sequels tend to do muchbetter than movie sequels because games can incorporate new technologies that became avail-able after the release of the previous game, in addition to taking advantage of the availabilityof more powerful computers every year\u2014for example, EverQuest II (\"Gaming Goes toHollywood\" 2004). 64. However, to the player, this fantasy is the reality. Even if the setting of the game is artificial and sometimes fantasy based, to players who are immersed in the game world and in interactingwith other people and identifying themselves with their avatars\u2014the digital representations ofplayers online\u2014the world seems real enough. This phenomenon is akin to audiences identifyingwith the people portrayed in a drama. Results from a survey indicate that a significant portionof people playing EverQuest consider themselves to be living and moving between two worlds:the world of EverQuest and the real world (Castronova 2001, 2005; T. T aylor 2006).208 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES the accumulation of experience and continuous improvements. Hence, the industry will depend on a continuous flow of innovative people andon the accumulation of experience, which that gives the advantage to existing firms. 65 By having to forgo participation in the production of console games, Korean firms were unable to accumulate expertise in those types of games, where experience counts. However, they were able to quickly capitalize on the popularity of MMORPGs and move ahead of developers in other countries. Whether they can translate this advantage into the next likelyplatform, the mobile phone, depends on their ability to develop these re-quired conceptual games. Many such puzzle and thumb-twitching gameswill be (and are) released on this new platform by the existing rights hold- ers. Entering this segment of the industry will be a considerable challengefor Korean firms. With increasing digitization of the movie production process, the over- lap will increase in future. For example, videogame software and atechnique called machinima make it possible to produce an animated life- like film on a PC using characters from games, customizing the gameenvironment in 3D, and adding voiceovers (\"Deus Ex Machinima\" 2004;\"Young Spielbergs\" 2005). The competitive edge that the Korean gamefirms currently have over others is in the client-server technology. As withany technological advantage, relying solely on one area is dangerousbecause others can catch up. At this point, many of the leading game com-panies are holding on to this technology as their competitive advantage,rather than licensing it out as client-server middleware to other firms.Many believe that the differentiating aspects will be better graphicsand creative game concepts and stories. Therefore, tighter integrationof the strength of the movie industry\u2014the underlying story-tellingcomponent\u2014with the videogame industry is one of the crucial links thatthe gaming industry in Seoul now needs. 66Once this happens, the Korean videogame industry can expand into other types of games, thereby increasing the opportunities overall. 65. This statement assumes that the developers retain the talent originally responsible for creat- ing successful games or that, as an organization, they are able to retain the experience. In somecases, however, a major publishing firm may purchase a hit game to create a sequel. The origi-nal developing team may depart, leaving the publisher only with the right to produce a sequel,without the necessary knowledge accumulated in developing the game. Hence, some sequels donot perform as well as the original games. 66. For instance, MK Pictures is planning to develop mobile phone games that are based on one of its film characters.FUN, MOVIES, AND VIDEOGAMES 209 The development of the online game industry in Korea happened in large part because of widespread adoption of broadband connections (78 percent of households) and the availability of broadband access through 30,000 Internet caf\u00e9s (Shameen 2004). In Korea, the common speed is 10Mbps, with some subscribers at 20Mbps. Even faster 100Mbpsservices are in trial, and the goal is to migrate most households tothis speed by 2010 (\"Present, Fast, and Future\" 2004; Shameen 2004).These speeds are all offered at prices in the range of US$30 to US$50 per month, making the connection speed in Korea one of the fastest at anaffordable price. 67This access has created the market for online games and, in the future, the scope for distributing movies and broadcasting over the Internet (some Japanese firms are already broadcasting past television programs over the Internet for a fee). Online distribution of movies will also help the niche producers because of the long tail phenomenon (thelong downward slope of a probability distribution). The ease and low costof distribution will allow producers to cater to a wide variety of tastes thatare poorly served by the mass market for entertainment that aims for the lowest common denominator (\"Long T ail\" 2004). Already past televisionprogramming can be downloaded in Korea for as little as US$0.40, andKorean movies made in the 1980s and 1990s can be downloaded forUS$0.80 (Shameen 2004). The Korean online videogame industry had a head start. With the experience accumulated through the early stage of online game develop-ment, these firms now have the technological capability to manage largeonline games, including client-server technology. Whether they can keepdeveloping innovative contents to take advantage of their early lead is anopen question. The rising expenditure of increasingly sophisticated usersis inexorably ratcheting up costs for game producers. In part, also, thepressure on producers comes from the competitive forces unleashed bythe music and movie industries, which compete for the same segment ofpotential buyers (\"Games Makers\" 2003). Firms in other countries areleveraging their assets in contents. For Japanese firms, the content lies inconsole games and anime. In the United States, it is PC games and Holly-wood movies. 68As broadband expands in other countries and more firms 67. However, at these government-regulated rates, recouping the cost of investment and earn- ing a healthy profit are a problem for broadband suppliers. 68. There is a concern, however, that too much collaboration with the movie industry may stifle the creativity of the game industry, especially when production costs are soaring. Many gamepublishers may try to stick with the safer games based on hit movies (and sequels) rather thandeveloping new creative games (\"Gaming Goes to Hollywood\" 2004).210 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES enter the entertainment industry, the success of Korean game developers\u2014especially in the U.S. market, where Lineage has made fewinroads\u2014will depend crucially on the quality of the game and the under- lying storyline. The same will be true for the movie industry. Closer interaction could well enhance the prospects of both industries, although a question hangs over the future of the filmmaking business (not just in Korea), as it faces the prospect of intensifying competition in homemarkets from foreign movies, as it confronts the implications of lowered entry barriers, as digital production and distribution technology spread,and as it makes the transition to new forms of distribution. The two in-dustries can share many of the same resources\u2014especially the pool ofhighly specialized and skilled personnel\u2014and work together to improvethe technologies. In addition, continuous investment in the infrastructure in the form of faster broadband connections would widen the market domestically and enlarge the clientele abroad.The term fashion immediately evokes images of two cities\u2014Paris and Milan. After reflection, some might add New York, T okyo, and London. But only the indulgent would consider extending the list. Clearly, among the creative industries, the high-fashion industry has proven to be geographically the most exclusive and still among the least mobile. This attachment to place is unusual because thefashion industry in the broad sense is widely diffused. The worldwideturnover is vast and relatively impervious to business fluctuations, and the entry barriers do not appear to be especially high, which could makeit attractive for industrializing countries such as Thailand that havegained a comparative advantage in the manufacture of garments and jew-elry. That Bangkok could become a leading fashion center of East Asia issurely within the realm of the possible, but for the moment the idea re- mains on the very fringes of the possible. Could it be brought within closer reach, and if so, what will it take for this most delicate of industriesto bloom in Bangkok? Could this industry become an engine of growthfor postindustrial Bangkok? Are the changing local and global circum-stances ripe for a new entry? These are some of the questions addressedin this chapter. INVENTING FASHION Almost inevitably one must start with an existing point of reference. Paris is where the fashion industry was born, and by observing the accidental birthand gradual flowering of the Parisian fashion business into a worldwideCHAPTER 7 SILK AND GEMS212 TonkinNATIONAL CAPITAL CAPITAL URBAN EXTENTIBRD 34884 JULY 2006phenomenon, one can find one of several keys in developing a fashion in- dustry that is more than a tiny urban enclave.1 The story of fashion as currently perceived begins in mid-17th century Europe (see DeJean 2005). A glance at the paintings from this period sug-gests that something new had entered the lives of the rich and the cultured. For the first time, their garments and accoutrements began to take on a meaning and significance of their own. The wealthy had discovered fashion,and henceforth it was to become a marker variously of status, distinction,style, and individual wealth. Items of dress and decoration started becomingalmost as important as the person depicted in the painting and, therefore, were meticulously selected, coordinated, and presented for maximumeffect. Just as people became increasingly conscious of differences in stylesof clothing, in materials, and in how those varied from place to place andover the seasons, artists strove to render these newly charged sensibilitiesand to present the image their subjects were attempting to project. Those many images help us construct an overlapping tableau of changing fashions. Paris can claim to be the birthplace of the fashion industry because of a king and his overweening ambition. In the mid-17th century, Louis XIV , a monarch with a sedulously cultivated taste for style, sought to elevateFrance over its European rivals by the sheer grandeur of his court. Theking shrewdly came to realize that the pomp and style other monarchiesquickly attempted to emulate could become the basis for considerablemercantile strength. With the help of his minister of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis built a small but thriving fashion industry for thearistocratic elite by regulating every aspect of high-end merchandising sothat it would favor France's business community\u2014by minimizing importswhere possible and encouraging exports (DeJean 2005). Under the king's patronage and with the help of incentives from the state, industry mushroomed, and by setting the standards, Louis ensured that French products, especially luxury items, became known for theirunique designs and high quality. The king's endorsement also made theproducts more marketable and desirable. This initial success spurred cre-ativity, new professions arose, and entrepreneurs were inspired to pursuefresh ventures. DeJean (2005, 9) notes of that period, \"France's nationalimage was the product of a collaboration between a king with a vision andsome of the most brilliant artists, artisans, and craftspeople of all time\u2014men and women who were the founding geniuses in domains as disparateSILK AND GEMS 213 1. Aggregating the direct and indirect economic effect of the fashion industry leads to big numbers. For France as a whole, as much as 8 percent of industrial output and more than 350,000 jobs canbe traced to the businesses that produce, display, package, bottle, and market fashion products(\"Rags and Riches\" 2004).214 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES as wine making, fashion accessorizing, jewelry design, cabinetry, codifica- tion of culinary technique, and hairstyling.\" Paris thus gained first-moveradvantages. A concept, a tradition, and an industry were established that survived the French Revolution and quickly found a new patron in Napoleon, whose appetite for ostentatious display was a godsend for thetextile producers in Lyon and the dressmakers in Paris. When, in the mid-19th century, Napoleon III became emperor, fashion found a patron with an even keener penchant for grandeur. His wife, the Empress Eugenie, created the couturier line by commissioning CharlesFrederick Worth, the English dressmaker, to design a wardrobe fit for anempress. He did, and the House of Worth was born (Mansel 2005). ButWorth did more than father the couturier culture. Imitations were alreadyworrisomely prevalent in those days, and this concern provoked Worth to found the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture 2in 1868 to safeguard his designs, as well as to promote and market Parisian tailoring. This chamber was joined more than a century later, in 1973, by the Chambre Syndicale du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode, for ready-to-wear fashion, and the Chambre Syndicale de la Mode Masculine,for menswear. All three chambers make up the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de laCouture, du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode, 3 which fixes the annual fashion calendar and schedules the fashion shows; develops emerging brands; coordinates the activities of the variousindustry participants (designers, buyers, weavers, subcontractors); tackles issues of intellectual property rights; trains people; and defines the ground rules of the fashion industry (\"Fashion's Favourite\" 2004). 4,5 2. Haute couture literally means high sewing in French. It is, traditionally, the term used for custom-fitted, handmade, high-quality clothes that use expensive fabrics and materials, with close attention to detail and finish. Legally, only design houses that belong to the ChambreSyndicale de la Haute Couture and have met the conditions set by the chamber are granted theright to use the appellation haute couture . The term, though, is also informally used to refer to clothes that are similarly stylish and are of high quality. 3. The Italian chamber responsible for the development of the fashion industry, La Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, was established in 1958. With the signing of the Italian-Frenchagreement in Milan, both chambers outlined Italy's leading role in the fashion industry. In 2000,the Italian-French protocol agreement was signed in Paris, detailing the importance of a com-mon policy for the export of luxury goods outside of Europe (see http://www.cameramoda.it/eng/areaistituz/profilo.asp). 4. For example, a fashion house needs to employ at least 20 people in its workshops and must present a minimum of 50 designs at the twice-yearly Paris collections in order to qualify as haute couture (\"Fashion's Favourite\" 2004). 5. Support from the state continues and takes many forms: incentives to couturiers to use fabricsmanufactured in France, attention given by state-controlled television to fashion shows, andpermission to designers to present their collections at iconic buildings such as the Louvre (\"Ragsand Riches\" 2004).World War II forced several fashion houses in Paris to either close down or else relocate. Designers who moved their businesses elsewhere went to New York or London, some permanently. This partial relocation of the industry and the slowing down of the business in Paris stirred creativity in those other cities and induced the trade magazines and news-papers to turn away from an almost exclusive focus on Paris. After the war,Paris recovered some of the ground it had surrendered but was no longerthe sole arbiter of fashion. New York was now a force to be reckoned with. A dress and bespoke- tailoring industry had emerged that not only drew on the skills of immigrant hand labor for the rapid execution of ideas but also developedspecializations in sportswear\u2014a reputation the city retains\u2014and workwear for women. New York's advantage was strengthened by structural fea- tures of the U.S. economy. Because American designs leaned more toward the practical side, a large, ready market of middle- and high-income house-holds was available, made accessible by retail chains that sell luxury prod-ucts to a wide cross-section of the buying public (\"No-Profit Zone\" 2005).Paris also had to contend with the appearance of a high-fashion industry inthe early 1950s centered on Milan, which was based on regional craft anddesign skills that had catered to the demands of regional aristocracies overthe centuries. Government support buttressed private initiatives in Milan,as it had done in Paris, enabling rich and diverse cultural traditions (witheach region having its own specialties in yarns, fabrics, and jewelry) to feeda fashion industry that now commands a growing worldwide clientele. T wo other centers complete the list. London is a leader in fashion design, with some of the most famous training institutes, and is a majorforce in men's clothing. Since the 1980s, T okyo has become a pacesetter for midlevel fashion and casual \"punk style\" fashions (see, for instance,Richie 2003) with a discriminating local market that has set and sustainedhigh standards of quality. Designers such as Hanae Mori and Issey Miyakehave a secure place in the highest reaches of the fashion world. Milan and T okyo, rather than Paris or New York, might provide point- ers to the Thai government and aspiring designers as they attempt to makethe fashion industry one of the pillars of the economy, although Paris, withits remarkable marketing apparatus, could play an intermediary role. InItaly, each region developed a strong artisanal specialty, which laterevolved into small, flexible industries in line with fashion trends. For in-stance, Biella is known for its thread, Prato for its woolen articles, andFlorence for its leather goods (Martin-Bernard 2006). From these smallItalian industries emerged famous brands such as Cerruti, Etro, Prada, AND GEMS 215216 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES T russardi in leather goods; and Missoni in textiles (Martin-Bernard 2006). Unlike the French fashion industry, which focuses on the artistic aestheticsof design, Italian fashion designers never lose sight that creativity must not hinder the final result of their work, which is to sell. In this way, Italy's approach to fashion is better suited for today's world: Italy retains its fash-ion conscious image while maintaining a strong balance between productdesign and innovation. The success of this approach is reflected in Italy'sstanding in the eyes of fashion conscious buyers (see table 7.1). Recognizing that a late starter must try harder and telescope the stages of development, the Thai government and the monarchy are highly supportive\u2014the king's granddaughter is a fashion designer herself and hercollection opened the Bangkok Fashion Week for 2005. They put greatstore by Thailand's rich cultural and craft traditions. The Bangkok Fashion City marketing initiative, with the backing of both government agencies and the private sector, aims to unite all fashion-related industry(such as textile, leatherwear, and jewelry) and is promoting, coordinating,and developing Bangkok's image as the creative capital of Asia (\"BangkokFashion City\" 2006). Part of this initiative also involves increasing exportvolume, facilitating enterprise growth, and educating fashion professionals(\"Bangkok Fashion City\" 2006). Whether government policy backing canbe as potent in today's circumstances, as was the case in France and Italy,remains to be seen. Similarly, the appeal of fashion influenced by South-east Asian culture still has to be tested in the global marketplace. Althoughat one level many countries with developed textile industries can acquire afoothold in the world fashion market by dint of clever designing andmarketing, approaching parity with the industry leaders is a task of anTable 7.1 Percentage of Consumers Who Would Buy a Brand If Money Were No Object Brand Percentage Giorgio Armani 31 Gucci in the News\" 2006.altogether different magnitude. The rules of the game have changed enor- mously since Milan was rising into prominence in the 1950s. The front-runners are seemingly more entrenched, and fashion is more of a global industry, controlled by giant conglomerates such as L VMH, Richemont, and PPR. But other factors, such as economic prosperity, demographics,and the geographic shift of manufacturing and income, favor newcomersin Asia, as does an incipient disenchantment in East Asia with the overlyfamiliar and largely Western established brands. The Thai Fashion Industry Thailand's sericulture and silk traditions go far back into antiquity, although interpreting the archeological evidence is problematic. Never-theless, the records suggest that sericulture was well established by the Sukhothai kingdom (1238-1438), which traded silk\u2014along with other goods such as ivory, leather, acacia and sapan wood, ceramics, andpepper\u2014with neighboring kingdoms in China and in what is nowCambodia. Those commodities\u2014especially silk\u2014were also used as royalgifts or tributes. Ayutthayan 6customs indicated position, rank, and status among court officials through designs on silk. Whereas cotton was used for everyday purposes, silk garments were worn on special occasions, such as ordinations, weddings, and festivals. The court of King Narai forged friendly ties with that of Louis XIV , and through a diplomatic mission, theAyutthayan king sent the French monarch some fine examples of Thai silkhandiwork. This skill in silk weaving, which reaches far back in time, is one of Bangkok's strengths as it attempts to bolster the long-run economic for- tunes of the fashion sector. This fashion sector is composed mainly of twoindustries: (a) garments and (b) gems and jewelry. In both subsectors,Bangkok is a dominant player in Thailand, with 74 percent of jewelry,48 percent of garments, and 41 percent of leather goods coming from Bangkok in 2002. The fashion sector currently generates over US$12 bil- lion (B 500 billion) annually in both domestic and foreign sales. It com-prises nearly 20,000 mostly small enterprises, with a total workforce ofabout 2 million people (\"Designing a Fashion Hub\" 2004). Within this fashion sector, the garments and textile subsector is one of Thailand's most robust, and the majority of production (48 percent) isSILK AND GEMS 217 6. The kingdom of Ayutthaya lasted from 1350 to 1767. At that time, the capital of Thailand was Ayutthaya, 85 kilometers north of Bangkok.218 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES located in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The industry, which employs about 81,000 people, has a 3 percent share of gross domestic product.Clothing and textile exports amounted to US$5.8 billion in 2003 (see tables 7.2 and 7.3), or just over 7 percent of all exports, most of which went to the European Union, Japan, the United States, and Southeast Asia(\"Thai Garment Exports\" 2005). Although exports have risen steadily,they are less than 2 percent of a global textile and clothing trade valued atUS$343 billion in 2003. Thai firms want to enlarge their market share, and they have begun putting real money behind this aspiration. Between 2001 and 2004, Thailand's textile and clothing industry invested around US$12.5 billionin upgrading its dyeing, finishing, weaving, knitting, and spinning facili-ties (\"High Style\" 2005). Machinery was imported from Germany, Italy, Switzerland, T aiwan (China), and Japan. The latest in textile technology is merely one factor in overall competitiveness, however.

Such buyers may require large lots on small production cycles, as short as two to three months, soproducers must learn to integrate the different processes and optimize the flow of resources in the supply chain using the full potential of informa- tion technology and modern logistics. Producers also need to find ways topartner with other parties in the manufacturing process, so that they canshare and improve their technology, consolidate resources, reduce pro-duction time, and broaden their product range into the high-value end (\"High Style\" 2005). 7Very likely, through networked clusters and some consolidation into larger-sized firms, firms could augment their capabili- ties in areas of design, production, and exports.SILK AND GEMS 219 Table 7.3 Total Value of Exports: Clothing, 1990-2003 (2005 US$ billion) Economy 1990 1995 2000 2003 China 9.7 24.0 36.1 52.1 Hong Kong (China) 15.4 21.3 24.2 23.2 Italy 11.8 14.4 13.4 16.2Turkey 3.3 6.1 6.5 9.9Germany 7.9 7.5 7.3 9.7Mexico 0.6 2.7 8.6 7.3France 4.7 5.7 5.4 6.9India 2.5 4.1 6.2 6.6United States 2.6 6.7 8.6 5.5Belgium \u2014 \u2014 3.9 5.4United Kingdom 3.0 4.3 4.1 4.4Bangladesh 0.6 2.0 4.2 4.3Indonesia 1.6 3.4 4.7 4.1Romania 0.4 1.4 2.3 4.1Netherlands 2.2 2.8 2.7 3.7Thailand 2.8 5.0 3.8 3.6Korea, Rep. of 7.9 5.0 5.0 3.6Vietnam \u2014 \u2014 1.8 3.6Spain 0.6 1.5 2.1 3.3 Portugal 3.5 3.6 2.8 3.2 Source: World Trade Organization statistics database.

How- ever, buyers looking to moderate their reliance on China, whose share inthe textile market is expected to triple to 45 percent in a few years, areturning to other suppliers. Thailand exported an estimated additional80 million pieces of apparel through the end of 2005 as a result of the U.S.-imposed import restrictions against the flood of cheap textiles com-ing from China. The European Union, likewise, is limiting the importa-tion of 10 categories of apparel in line with the restrictions that allowChinese exports to grow only by between 8 and 12.5 percent in each cate-gory (\"Thailand Benefits\" 2005). Even Japan, where Chinese textile and garment imports have taken more than 90 percent of the market, is look- ing toward other suppliers through bilateral free trade agreements withthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the individual economieswithin the bloc, Thailand among them (\"Japanese T extile Companies\"2005). All these developments can become stepping-stones to an exportstructure within which fashion garments account for a larger share. Thailand needs to forge these partnerships and search for such oppor- tunities. Even with the investment made by the textile and garment sectorin recent years, low-end exports are likely to suffer as a result of competi-tion from other suppliers. Hence, diversifying into fashion garments andleveraging the domestic strengths in producing different kinds of silk areall the more necessary. A Silken Future? In 1901, King Chulalongkorn invited experts from Japan to upgrade local silk production, and later, in 1903, the Department of Silk Craftsmen wasestablished, which marked the beginning of sericulture and silk-weaving development in the modern era. But those initiatives had run out of steam by the 1930s, and silk-making technology had once again begun to ossify.What sparked a revival in the post-World War II period was the entre-preneurship of Jim Thompson, an ex-U.S. Army intelligence officer. Hesmelled an opportunity, adopted the profession of a merchant, and set about reviving the art of silk weaving 8in Thailand and ratcheting up the standards of quality. 8. This skill, particularly the skills needed to weave variants such as mudmee silk, was on the wane at that time.Thompson's company, the Thai Silk Company, was first established as a small retail store in the late 1940s. At that time, silk production was largely a family activity and a way for farming households to supplement their income. Consequently, little attention was paid to quality because most material was made either for personal use or for the local market.Colors faded quickly with repeated washings because the natural vegetabledyes that were used did not hold very well. Thompson persuadedproducers to switch to colorfast Swiss and German artificial dyes. He also introduced weavers to the techniques of making printed silk fabrics, usingdesigns found in paintings, pottery, and old fabrics, and encouraged themto create their own designs. Thompson introduced tourists to the fabrics he was producing by approaching them in the hotel lobby of The Oriental in Bangkok and ask- ing them to examine the material he had draped over his arm. In 1947, he brought samples of his silk to Edna Woolman Chase, editor of Vogue ,i n New York. The magazine was as influential then as it is now. Chase was im-pressed with the display and in the pages of Vogue declared it a \"magnifi- cent new discovery\" (http://jimthompsonhouse.com/life/vogue.ASP). JimThompson's efforts were reinforced by the interest of the Thai royal fam-ily in winning recognition for Thai silk production. The Thai Silk Company that Jim Thompson launched currently has 27 branch shops in Thailand, 15 of them located in Bangkok, and 14 overseasshops located in London, Brunei Darussalam, Dubai, Malaysia, andSingapore. Their merchandise is also displayed in various shops and show-rooms in more than 30 countries. The company has diversified its productline to enhance revenues by producing neckties, handbags, and other ac-cessories, as well as home and furniture collections, all released under the Jim Thompson label. 9 Queen Sirikit brought mudmee silk to international attention by way of the garments she wore during state visits in the 1960s. These patterned fabrics are among the ones most closely identified with Thai silk and are now widely copied and machine manufactured.10 Differences in climate, breed of silkworm, species of mulberry tree, and production methods lend Thai silk specific characteristics differentiating it from silk produced in China, India, and Italy. Thai silk comes in a wideSILK AND GEMS 221 9. The Jim Thompson corporation also established four restaurants and bars. 10. In 2004, the Department of Intellectual Property Rights of the Thai Ministry of Commerce patented more than 7,000 traditional handwoven textile patterns and presented them to thequeen as a birthday gift.222 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES range of prices, types, and quality. T raditionally handwoven, the fabrics tend to be soft, but nubby and imperfect, unlike typical silk, which makeseach bolt of material unique. Thai silks are known for their rich and bright colors because the coarse and knotty fibers are able to absorb and hold dyes better, giving them a distinctive luster. 11 The varieties of Thai silk provide designers with the raw material, and through further innovation, the variety can be continually enlarged. Inno- vation, however, needs to be routinized in design as well as in perfecting and frequent fine-tuning of the vehicles for marketing these products. Human Capital Development Cultivating relevant skills is a necessary step, which has led the Thai Garment Manufacturer's Association to embark on a program to trainentrepreneurs. The program imparts management and marketing skills through instruction and practical demonstration\u2014by visiting the produc- tion plants and business operations of leading firms in the garmentindustry. This activity is part of the government's plan to create new en-trepreneurs. The plan aims at adding 50,000 entrepreneurs to the currenttotal of nearly 4 million business owners within the next few years (\"T rain- ing Plan\" 2005). 12A budget of B 12 billion has been earmarked for the whole project. The Thailand T extile Institute is complementing this sum with a B 25 billion investment to create new yarns and fabrics and to de- velop technical textiles that will provide the raw material for designers.13 11. Thai silk, according to the Thai Silk Association, which oversees the Thai silk industry and industry standards, is defined as pure silk woven in Thailand, including silk woven with dobby or jacquard designs that may contain materials other than silk, but not more than 15 percent byweight. There are several varieties of Thai silk, such as mudmee silk, had saew silk, praewa silk,lai nam lei silk, and sin teen jok. Mudmee, a type of Thai silk also known as ikat, is probably the most popular. It comes from the northeast part of Thailand and is characterized by traditionalintricate geometric and zoomorphic designs that have been handed down from generation togeneration. The designs are made by tying bits of string around a thread mounted on a frame.The thread is dyed, which leaves the tied places uncolored; the dyed and undyed portions appearas a pattern on the fabric as the thread is used for weaving. 12. Entrepreneurs make up 15 to 20 percent of the population in developed countries. The United States has between 30 million and 40 million business owners, and Japan has between8 million and 9 million (\"T raining Plan\" 2005). 13. One idea being developed by Thai scientists is the bacteria-resistant shirt. Scientists from Chulalongkorn University's Institute of Metallurgy and Material Science have been usingnanotechnology to coat fabrics with silver nano, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi,in effect sterilizing and deodorizing fabrics. In a collaboration between the university, the Science and T echnology Ministry's National Innovation Agency, and United T extile Mills, B 15 million has already been invested in producing the prototype shirt and another B 200 mil-lion is needed to commercialize the product (\"Researchers Develop\" 2005).The objective of these schemes is to transform Bangkok's textile and garments industry from just executing designs of foreign name brands to developing local brands and designs that will bring the city recognition in international fashion circles. The local fabrics need to be developed, and indigenous weaving techniques and materials must be used in creatingnew products and textiles that will stand out from those of the other low-cost and midlevel textile and garments producers. A number of fashion design schools were established around Bangkok in recent years. Most of these schools are strongly influenced by foreign faculty and links with institutes abroad. 14Perhaps it is through these links that Thailand will learn and acclimate itself with the challenges, evolving trends, and idiosyncrasies of global consumers.15 Although increased capacity and better technology can raise produc- tion and quality, Thailand must also move on the organizational front.Either through tie-ups with multinational corporations (MNCs) in the fashion industry or through homegrown firms, Thailand requires or- ganizational vehicles to become a fashion center and to groom a fewinternational brands. Building a reputation for style, good design, finetailoring, exact execution, up-to-date technology, and other intangiblequalities is a necessary condition. But the real test lies in the building of brands and their global marketing. GEMS: A CITY'S BEST FRIENDS? For centuries, gems and precious metals have been central to Thai deco- ration and adornment in artworks, religious figurines and structures, andclothing. Deposits of rubies and sapphires are found in Chantaburi, T rat, and Kanchanaburi. Black spine, pyroxene, amethyst, agate, and carnelian are also mined all over Thailand. Cutting, polishing, and setting of im-ported diamonds commenced in the early 1990s, building on a long tradi-tion of gemcraft in some rural areas that has supplemented the incomes offarming households. The jewelry industry in Bangkok arose from this cot- tage industry (Scott 2000a).SILK AND GEMS 223 14. For instance, the Chanapatana Institute, a top internationally recognized design school founded by monk Luangphor Viriyang Sirintharo, is run by Accademia Italiana, a design insti-tute based in Florence. Foreign faculty members teach techniques rather than actual style ordesign (Barton 2004). 15. Thailand needs to play up to the fashion tastes of global consumers by carefully analyzing fashion trends, by ensuring that product quality meets global demand, and by building a strongfashion database with industry information.224 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES In recent decades, the gem and jewelry business has achieved consider- able success, with a turnover of about US$500 million. It employs about 32,000, exports four-fifths of output, and each year has been one of the major industrial investors. Gemstone and jewelry companies are numer- ous in Thailand, with headquarters mostly located in Bangkok. Bangkokhas two jewelry districts, which are adjacent to each other: an oldertraditional district, which is located around the area of the traditionalChinatown because the business is dominated by ethnic Chinese entre- preneurs, and a newer one, which emerged during the industry's growth inthe 1970s. The older district has small workshops and retail outlets thatcater mostly to local markets. In the newer district, located in the moderncommercial center along the Surawong-Silom Road area, the firms areproducing on a larger scale and selling to international markets (Scott 2000a). The industry is a network of complex relationships grounded in family ties, ethnicity, and religion. Scott's (2000a) survey of the industryshows that many of the firms are partnerships in which at least one of thepartners is a member of the family. External business relations also involvefamilial ties, and \"it is not unusual to find that inter-firm transactions in-volve siblings, cousins and other relatives\" (Scott 2000a, 55). Thai gem manufacturers are known for their skillful cutting and they excel in heat treating to enhance color and quality. 16They also are among the leading producers of synthetic gems. Jewelry manufacturers rely on imported machines and freelance designers, although the bigger ones have in-house designers as well. Small and medium-size firms rely mainly on copying other designs. Thai firms have penetrated the global market, with offshore sub- sidiaries catering to different markets. A total of almost 1,100 export firms,most of them small and medium-size, employ approximately 1 million workers, a significant fraction of whom are in the Bangkok region (Scott2000a). Jewelry production is a capital-intensive industry with mostly imported equipment. In addition, it is now increasingly reliant on imported stones(see table 7.4), so most manufacturers are foreign-owned businesses or have Thai and foreign partners. Raw materials make up about 75 percent of the total cost of diamond and gem-based jewelry and accessories production(see table 7.5). Still, many manufacturers favor Thailand and have movedtheir production activities to the country because of low wage rates; the 16. For example, the color of a ruby can be made more intense by adding chromium and heat- ing the stone.availability of skilled Thai labor (for example, cutters and designers); and the local expertise in using heat treatment to bring out the color of stones. Jewelry and accessories, mostly in a cut or worked form valued at B 93 billion, were exported in 2002 (see table 7.6). About one-fourth of ex- ports went to the United States; about 22 percent to the European Union;and the balance to Israel, Japan, Switzerland, and others (see figure 7.1). However, because certain kinds of stones are either unavailable domes- tically or in short supply, Thailand imports stones from Australia, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Madagascar,Myanmar, Sri Lanka, T anzania, Vietnam, and various countries in Africaand South America. Between 40 and 50 percent of the world's rubies andsapphires are cut in Thailand.SILK AND GEMS 225 Table 7.4 Imports of Gems, Precious Metals, and Jewelry, 1999-2002 (B billion) Categories 1999 2000 2001 2002 Pearls 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.5 Diamonds 23.1 31.5 32.7 39.1 Precious and semiprecious stones 3.5 4.3 4.3 4.3Synthetic stones 1.0 1.0 1.2 1.4Silver 3.0 3.7 4.5 4.7Gold 13.4 24.1 36.7 33.1Platinum 0.5 0.8 0.7 0.6Articles of jewelry 1.4 2.8 4.1 5.6Imitation jewelry 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.4Others 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3 Total 46.6 69.2 85.0 89.9 Source: Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand 2003.

Additionally, the thousands of Thai rural workers engaged in the sorting and grading of gemstones risk aloss of jobs from computerized sorting techniques that are more accurate. 17Table 7.6 Exports of Gems, Precious Metals, and Jewelry, 1999-2002 (B billion) Categories 1999 2000 2001 2002 Diamond 16.2 21.0 22.2 25.3 Precious and semiprecious stones 8.8 9.4 8.9 9.0 Synthetic stones 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6Gold 6.5 0.9 0.9 10.2Articles of jewelry 31.6 33.0 43.8 42.3Imitation jewelry 2.1 2.5 3.0 3.3Others 2.3 Total 67.2 69.4 81.3 93.0 Source: Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand 2003.

Cambridge University's Institute for Manufacturing claims to have devised a way to make the grading of diamonds and other precious stones more consistent. (Assessing the value of gems,especially their clarity, involves a certain amount of subjectivity.) The institute automated theThe response to those pressures has been a slew of government and industry-sponsored schemes to try to keep value adding activities in Thailand by staying abreast of technological developments. The Ministry of Industry has allocated B 89.6 million to support the establishment of a skills and technology development program for gem and jewelry manu-facturers and exporters. The program is aimed at substantially increasingexports. The Bangkok Fashion City office appointed the Center of Acad-emic Service of Srinakarinwirot University to operate the Jewelry Ad- vanced Research and Development project, one of the subprojects of theBangkok Fashion City. Its goal is to make Thailand a global gem and jew-elry center by 2012, in line with the Bangkok Fashion City plan. Achieving this goal will depend considerably on the dynamism of the Gemopolis Industrial Estate, a jewelry cluster that is located just 4 kilome- ters from Bangkok's new airport. 18A group of gem and jewelry entrepreneurs established Gemopolis in the early 1990s with government support. It was envisioned as a one-stop manufacturing and trading area, a supply-chain cluster where the interrelated components of the industry\u2014 such as raw materials, machines and technology, finished products,SILK AND GEMS 227 process by using a set of rules, distilled from the judgments of four diamond experts, to deter- mine the clarity of 503 \"virtual stones\"\u2014computer models of stones containing different flaws.When a stone is presented to the computer system, it grades the stones according to how theexperts would have done it. Models of gemstones, which are produced by scanning the stones us-ing a desktop x-ray tomography machine, are fed into the system. Automating the process canlead to more accurate valuations. T ests of the machine, called the iGem, showed it could increasethe value of a rough stone by as much as 25 percent. The next step is to automate the physical process of cutting the diamond. Such a method is being developed by Calibrated Diamonds, a company based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Thecompany is using lasers to make rough cuts and to carry out \"bruting,\" the beveling process usedto give diamonds their characteristic sharp-edged shapes. The laser-cutting method can makemore precise cuts and can even polish the stones. (T raditionally, diamonds are cut and polishedusing other diamonds.) Combining the automated evaluation system and laser cutting couldboth reduce waste and shorten the turnaround time from months to days. 18. One early example of a jewelry cluster that enjoyed a long and successful inning was in Prov- idence, Rhode Island. The jewelry industry in Providence was started in the late 18th century bySeril Dodge, the first jeweler to open a shop in Providence, and Nehemiah Dodge, his nephew.They dealt in watches, clocks, and gold and silver jewelry, operating alongside Rhode Island'smaritime trade. Their success encouraged other jewelers to join the local market. NehemiahDodge, when he opened his own shop, developed an early process of roll-plated gold, whichconsisted of uniting a thin sheet of gold to a thicker sheet of copper with silver solder and thenhammering and rolling it into the desired thickness. Dodge, therefore, became the first \"manu-facturing jeweler\" when he sold his plated gold to other goldsmiths. He also started two trendsthat the Providence jewelry industry continues to be known for: (a) production of jewelry in lowerprice ranges and (b) specialization and innovation in the technology of jewelry manufacture.logistics and distribution services, as well as marketing\u2014are all located close to one another. More than 50 manufacturers have factories in theestate. They are exempt from corporate income tax, import duties, and val- ue added tax for five to eight years, as long as they apply for a license with the Board of Investment. These manufacturers employed more than10,000 workers and generated exports of US$500 million in 2003, aboutone-fifth of Thailand's total exports. Currently, more than 80 percent ofthe companies in Gemopolis are owned by foreigners. Gemopolis houses a factory outlet and retail facility for small to medium-size enterprises,as well as the Bangkok Diamond and Precious Stones Exchange, which issimilar to a stock market, on which precious stones are bought and sold.The estate is also being promoted as a tourist destination by the T ourismAuthority of Thailand, and the government is planning Gemopolis Habitat, an entire township, with a convention hall plus commercial and residential accommodations. Meanwhile, the Thai Chamber of Commerce has requested that the government let financial institutions accept raw gems as collateral forloans to entrepreneurs. For this idea to come to fruition, an institute toevaluate the value of the stones must be established to ensure that thegems meet international standards. The chamber hopes that this idea willease the difficulties traders in raw gems face in gaining access to finance,thereby making the industry more competitive and doubling the value ofexports to B 200 billion in the next five years. Thailand's exports of jewelryand ornaments totaled B 104 billion in 2003. Government and industryare also responsible for new courses being introduced by universities thatwill teach students the use of the latest high-tech tools and machines. Suchmachines are needed to add more value to the products and to upgrade both the quality and the design of Thai gems and jewelry. The techniquesthat will be taught are advanced jewelry prototyping using computer-based methods; advanced gemstone and diamond stamping, welding, and and plating (Bangkok Fashion City's Jewelry AdvancedResearch and Development project). Recognizing that technology will al-ways be changing, gem traders are working with scientists to understandhow each new process works and then to introduce the process to the in-dustry with full disclosure; the marketplace can then determine its valueand properly certify the treated materials. A number of Thai firms are at the forefront of initiatives to enhance competitiveness. For example, Pranda Jewelry specializes in making af-fordable gold and silver jewelry set with diamonds and semiprecious228 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESstones. The company was established 30 years ago, and its products are sold globally, mostly under the Pranda brand, but also under names suchas Prima, Cristalina, and Century. Pranda has about a dozen manufactur- ing, wholesale, and retail brand distribution subsidiaries around the world. Its factories are located in China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, withsubsidiaries in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States to pro-vide customer service to international customers. Exports account for83 percent of Pranda's production. Pranda is planning to invest an addi- tional B 200 million to increase production capacity both in Thailand andabroad. The investment will increase the group's annual production ca-pacity of 5.87 million pieces of jewelry to 6 million pieces. The companyworries, however, about the competitive pressures that will arise as a resultof free trade agreements with China and India, pressures that will force Pranda to constantly upgrade design and quality or risk losing market share (\"Pranda Jewellery\" 2005). Such improvements require high-technology equipment, such as laser machines for faster and more accu-rate cutting of stones and other machines that will allow the creation ofmore complex designs. In turn, these upgrades entail making heavy capi-tal investments and building specific skills, not only to run the new equip-ment but also to service the machines when they break down\u2014costs thatsmall and medium-size firms cannot easily afford. Thaigem, based in Chantaburi, near Bangkok, claims to be the vendor of 90 percent of the gems sold online worldwide. In Thailand, such a hugeWeb site stands out simply for its clear English and painless navigation.The company was started in 2000 by Don Kogen, who sold a few gems oneBay. Against expectations, more and more people are comfortable buyinggems online because the selections are wider, buyers have ample time to choose, the prices are lower, and the purchased item can be tried at homeand returned if the customer is dissatisfied. In 2004, 2 percent of all dia-mond jewelry sales, amounting to US$63 billion, were made online; finejewelry is one of the fastest-growing items sold online. Europe's biggestonline retailer of diamond jewelry, Cool Diamond, has grown sixfold injust six years. Thaigem is successfully exploiting this trend. It is able tokeep costs down by slicing away some seven to eight layers of intermedi-aries, whose commissions ratchet up the colored gem's price on the jour-ney from the mine to the jewelry store. Thaigem's other advantage ischeap labor. Programmers' salaries run about US$750 per month, crafts-people earn US$300 per month, and secretaries' wages are as low asUS$150 per month. Revenues were US$4.3 million in 2001 and morethan doubled to US$10.3 million in 2002. SILK AND GEMS 229The initial challenge that Thaigem faced was Thailand's reputation for credit card fraud and gem scams;19a pilfer-prone postal service, unreliable phones, and antiquated banks; and a workforce not known for team spirit or command of English. Kogen bypassed the postal service by negotiating a volume discount with FedEx. And for the first few years, Thaigem over- came customers' reluctance to purchase from a developing country bymaking use of U.S.-based third-party payment systems, such as Escrow.com and PayPal. In March 2002, when the company's credibility wasestablished, it began accepting direct payments by credit card. Now, Thaigem sources gems from 60 countries, stocking more than 400 gemtypes. Such high volume enables the company to buy inventory in bulkand resell as single items or in smaller lots. These two success stories on an international scale are still something of an exception. Most Thai jewelry firms are not innovative and are not ag- gressively introducing new designs or cultivating a brand image. They pre- fer instead to service the domestic market or supply foreign buyers. Insteadof aiming for branded products, small and medium-size manufacturers, es-pecially, are reluctant to make the big investments required and continueproducing jewelry according to their clients' orders and specifications. This hesitancy is not a recipe for increasing competitiveness or growth. Jewelry firms need to be much more venturesome to enlarge their share ofthe export market and their contribution to the economy of Bangkok. A FASHIONABLE BANGKOK For a new entrant to the fashion industry such as Thailand, this is \"the best of times and the worst of times\" because of globalization,demographics, industrial concentration, technological change, flux in the fashion business, and an excess of beautiful things vying for the consumer's230 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 19. An incident around 2002 further put the Thai jewelry industry's reputation in doubt. Orange stones that looked like padparadschas, precious orange-pink sapphires from Madagascar, started showing up in the market in large quantities. At first they were thought to be the actualMadagascar stones, and gem traders readily snapped them up. But buyers soon became suspi-cious when the supposedly rare sapphires flooded the market. The stones were discovered to becreated by gem burners and part-time farmers from the province of Chantaburi, who introducedtraces of beryllium into oil-fired ovens, thereby transforming low-grade stones into orange andgold stones similar to padparadschas . Although some imperfect gems are subject to heat treat- ment in order to enhance their color and quality, some U.S. gemnologists alleged that this newcorundum treatment pioneered by Thai burners violated the ethics of the trade\u2014although nolaw was actually broken\u2014because the provenance of the stones was not disclosed. In an industrythat relies not only on precision and expertise but also on trust, the lack of disclosure on the partdollar. In this world, the challenge, in the opinion of the designer Karl Lagerfeld, is keeping the desire to buy alive. Fashion has always tended toward the international, and in recent decades this tendency has become far more pronounced, opening the way for designers in cities such as Bangkok. The multiplication and wideningof electronic and media-related communication channels are part andparcel of globalization, and they have had a hand in this expansion. In ad-dition to providing information, these channels have contributed to cul- tural traffic\u2014in particular, the rapid and widespread diffusion of fashion\u2014and to an unprecedented visual pluralism. As it has done for many otherhandicrafts and folk arts, global demand is imparting new life to the fash-ion industry, which was on the verge of losing skills passed down overhundreds of years (Cowen 2002). As Hollander (1993, 345) observes, The tyranny of fashion has in fact never been stronger than in this period of visual pluralism. The enormous plurality of dress messages in our time hasbeen made possible not only by the expansion and diversity of the clothingbusiness but also by the availability of so much visual information both ac-cumulated and newly generated. . . . The rate of change in fashion has not actually increased, what has increased is the number of fashions, all of themindividually subject to change. The cultural globalization we are experiencing in the early 21st century differs from cultural commerce in earlier eras because, Images and practices [are] moving with far greater extensity and at a far greater velocity. . . . The saturation of television, radio, and telephone own-ership in the West and their marked increase in [industrializing countries]and the emergence of new domestic technologies of communication haveexpanded the volume of signs and signification that people are exposed to. This domestic rise in information is coupled with the increasing appearanceof foreign symbols and artifacts within national economies introduc[ing] aspeed and immediacy to elements of contemporary cultural globalization ina way that is historically distinct. In the past, imperial states, networks of in-tellectuals, and theocracies were the key agents of cultural diffusion. In thecontemporary world their role has been displaced by that of large media in-dustries as well as by greater flows of individuals and groups. MNCs are atthe heart of these interconnected processes. In the contemporary world the[cultural] flows continue to be generated primarily in the West and in itsSILK AND GEMS 231 of the burners and the dealers who were in on the process created a crisis of confidence in the industry. Customers began doubting retailers and traders, nobody wanted to lose reputation bycertifying stones wrongly, and existing supplies of sapphires were affected because people wereunsure of what they were buying. Gem wholesalers were estimated to have lost more thanUS$30 million (\"Gemstone Scandals\" 2003). most powerful cultural institutions. . . . However, flows have begun to be re- versed, primarily through migration but also through other cultural formsshifting from South to North and East to West. Music, food, ideas, beliefsand literature from the South and East have been percolating into the cul-tures of the West, creating new lines of cultural interconnectedness and fracture\" (Held and others 1999, 368-69). This cultural globalization, quite remarkably, has not yet affected the fashion industry's concentration in a very few centers, but that trend could change. Fewer than 10 cities can currently claim to be the points of light in the fashion world, and their number has shown no signs of increasing in the past two decades, although the ideas and designs coming out of thosecenters are now penetrating every urban corner of the world. The geographic concentration of the fashion industry reflects historical forces and first-mover advantages. Those advantages might have eroded were it not for the emergence of a small number of MNCs that now dom-inate the business of fashion and have the resources to sustain brand namesand dynamic design strategies; to harness new technologies in the areas ofmaterials, production, logistics, and marketing; and to commit vast sumsto advertising their products to underpin the intrinsic merits of the fash- ions being purveyed. T o thrive in a global marketplace, the products of the fashion industry must first and foremost acquire a brand. Moreover, theyneed to project an image symbolizing quality and, to a degree, exclusivity,and they must be differentiated from other competing products, evenwhen those products are ready-to-wear fashions. Ensuring the quality andappeal of branded products requires ingenuity and large investments formultimedia global coverage and for the use of high-paid celebrities whotemporarily enjoy favorable as well as global name recognition. Undoubt-edly, designers matter, but the brand comes first. The necessity of a brand image, of obsessive attention to design and quality, of multinational corporate vehicles for producing and selling goodsworldwide, and of relentless high-stakes advertising has made new entry,except on a minor niche basis, extremely difficult. A new entrant can startout as an original equipment manufacturer and a supplier to an MNC with a parcel of brands, and then by dint of investment become an originaldesign manufacturer preparatory to launching its own branded products,initially regionally and then on a global scale. But such an evolution, al-though it is being pursued by companies such as Esquel and Giordano, re-quires a long-term strategy for acquiring design skills and the capacity tomarket and conduct operations globally. Essentially, it is a question ofeither staying under the wing of an MNC, as most Thai exporters havepreferred, or of devising a strategy to become an MNC in the fashion232 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESindustry. In a business in which fashion can rise and fall in a matter of months, where the fortunes of even the leading apparel companies\u2014suchas Vanity Fair, Jones Apparel, Liz Claiborne, or The Gap\u2014are at risk, design and marketing are two necessary ingredients of success. Equally im- portant, however, are the scale of operations and the ability to anticipatefuture fashion trends and to deliver just the right kind of product in a time-ly manner. Achieving such scale, in part through acquiring other firms andby building the market expertise, must be part and parcel of a longer-term strategy of Thai companies if they are to achieve global business heft and tocontribute significantly to the economy of Bangkok (\"Stitching T ogether\"2005; \"T oo Many Surveys\" 2005). Although design, quality, marketing, and scale are the keys most critical to success in the fashion business, in this industry as in most others, inno- vation has become an important determinant of competitiveness. The in- novation can take many forms. Most commonly it shows up in design, butit is becoming as important in the area of materials. Whether for clothingor jewelry or leather goods, technology has a growing hand in how thoseproducts are constructed. In the case of clothing, how it is cut is affectedby technology, and for making jewelry, the way in which metals are treatedor combined is at issue. Interestingly, one-third of all men's shirts and suitssold in the United States now incorporate some innovation in the materi-als that enhances comfort, reduces creasing, increases stain resistance, orintroduces other attributes. Innovation extends all the way along the sup-ply chain, from the production and handling of the raw materials to itspresentation to the final consumer. Such innovation, which must now becontinuous in order to meet market expectations of seasonally refreshedproduct lines and to parry the innovations of competitors, requires devel- oping in-house capability, outsourcing, collaborating with partner firms,and creating links with research institutes and design houses. Most firms,large and small, rely on a mix of those strategies. The point to be noted isthat innovation is now a must, and Thai firms with aspirations to becomeglobal players will need to learn to innovate, which lengthens the oddsagainst a newcomer's attaining global stature in the fashion business. The cultural plurality of the industry adds yet another complication. Designers, whether of jewelry or clothing, draw their inspiration frommany sources. They ransack all cultures for styles, techniques, and symbolsand evolve unusual hybrids. Jewelry, for instance, can in one season leanheavily on classical Greek and Roman designs; in the next, it can rely onIndian. In other words, with globalization, all cultures are fair game for thedesigner; specific, ethnically rooted styles or materials cannot be countedon to serve as the basis for enduring success\u2014although Kenzo, Etro, andSILK AND GEMS 233Dries Van Noten have defied the odds. A product line with a strong Thai cultural flavor will lack uniqueness and might not attract consumers,whether in Thailand or overseas. If it does succeed in one season, it might not in the next. If it acquires a strong following, it will be imitated by others. Only if the product line builds a strong brand image and a largegroup of loyal buyers is it likely to be profitable over the longer term. Putdifferently, not only has the cultural democracy introduced by globaliza-tion limited the leverage that a cultural heritage can offer to a local fashion industry with global ambitions; it has also, as is widely noted, led to an in-cipient homogenization of fashion cultures: designer jeans are being wornvirtually the world over. 20 Not only the global convergence of consumption preferences but also the tenacious survival of regional variations reflecting local cultural pro- clivities is exemplified by cross-country patterns of beer and wine intake. Wine consumption is increasing irrespective of what is happening to the national production of those beverages, even between France, a tradition-ally wine-drinking country, and Germany, where beer has long been thepreferred tipple. Differences persist among Latin American countries,however, that are related to the cultural heritages carried over from European origins of dominant groups (Aizenman and Brooks 2005). Thesame tendencies are found in the fashion industry. Whether fashion clothing and accoutrements are being made for the exclusive high end or the midrange, an intention to market them world-wide almost requires that cultural flavors be toned down to appeal to the largest number of customers. Something that is unusually exotic is likely to have a limited market, and global success would be either a fluke or theresult of an extraordinarily inventive marketing effort. Because productsdesigned for the global marketplace must now be aware of and sensitive tomany fashion cultures, they lie in the midrange, where many such cultures234 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 20. Building a brand name and then managing it carefully to preserve the exclusivity that com- mands high prices is probably the only sure route to consistently high returns. However, not allbrands are moneymakers, even for L VMH and PPR. Attracting a top designer or designers todesign collections that are then displayed in the major centers in Europe and East Asia would bea major plus. This success would need to be backed by the production skills that guarantee thehighest quality. Exclusive brands also find it necessary to maintain their own stores in the mostfashionable districts of the major cities\u2014even if they operate at a loss. In addition, they must linkup with the upscale retail chains, provide additional outlets, and sell and advertise globallythrough a variety of carefully selected media. They must also maintain a full range of accessoriesand perfumes to generate adequate revenues\u2014because apparel alone is rarely sufficient\u2014andfrequently refresh the various lines being offered to keep in step with the faster tempo of thefashion world.now intersect. Standing out in this crowded space calls for a carefully cul- tivated distinctiveness; a sensitivity to the variations in preferences acrossmarkets that call for adjustments in size, in colors, and in subtle cus- tomization; and tens of millions of dollars of marketing. 21Even this care is not proof against pirating and imitation, which is the bane of the fashion industry and forces firms to frequently change designs, aside from plow- ing millions into innovation and legal protection.22All these concerns are major hurdles for newcomers. Several facets of globalization are not advantageous for a new entrant trying to secure a beachhead in the market for fashion products, but others broaden the range of opportunities. First, globalization has immensely in-creased the scale of the market. Global value chains assist sellers in findingmarkets for their goods, in finding suppliers of inputs, and in integratingproducts. In the fashion garment and jewelry businesses, Thailand enjoys the advantages of the latecomer to a globalized world economy in whichthe infrastructure of mass marketing is already in place. The many chan-nels, including e-marketing, that are now available permit producers to sellin bulk or to exploit the potential of the \"long tail\" by selling only a fewhundred differentiated items. As Cowen (2002, 16) puts it, \"Partial ho- mogenization often creates the conditions necessary for diversity to flower at the micro-level.\" International retail chains such as H&M and Zara pro-vide a potential outlet for promising new designers and established namesas they seek to woo the lower budget, fashion- and quality-conscious shop-pers in the same way that the online book superstores such as Amazon andAbebooks provide outlets for the small presses (\"Good Fit\" 2005). Second, contracting for services from anywhere in the world has become much easier. For instance, if producers in Bangkok need designSILK AND GEMS 235 21. For example, Coach has found that local research and customer feedback provide valuable leads that enhance sales. For instance, bags sold in Japan need to be smaller than ones aimed atthe U.S. markets. The latter also need to have more pockets (\"Handbag Invasion\" 2003). Abrand needs to be able to capture a market through various means, both traditional and nontra-ditional. Securing pages in fashion and beauty magazines can be very costly, but such magazinesreach a large audience. Cosmopolitan, the fashion magazine that has the largest circulation in the United States, sells almost 3 million copies; a full-page ad can cost as much as US$175,900.High-end brands not uncommonly have several two-page spreads in a single issue. Fashionbrands are estimated to spend as much as 10 percent of total revenue on advertising alone. Build-ing a fashion brand requires promotion, although trendy brands sometimes initiate interest intheir products by trying to create some buzz about their products, which may or may not work. 22. The FBI estimates that up to US$250 billion a year is lost to counterfeiting in the United States, and clothing and footwear companies in Europe are estimated to lose about \u20ac7.5 billion a year. About 65 percent of the production of counterfeit goods is thought to come from China(\"Counterfeiting\" 2005).services or services for constructing garments, they can be purchased from some of the same people who design for leading houses.23Local capacity to design no longer needs be a binding constraint, as long as a firm has agood business model that clearly delineates the particular characteristics of designs to be adopted. A Thai firm might add a dash of cultural flavor and use certain kinds of materials to differentiate its products, as the JimThompson Thai Silk Company attempts to do. Third, entry into the fashion midrange is relatively easier, and models exist of companies that have successfully carved out a considerable market share by focusing on affordable ready-to-wear fashion clothing where thedesigns are frequently refreshed. 24Chains such as Zara and H&M have clearly signposted the possibilities for others to follow. Each firm has in- troduced innovations in organization and marketing and has built up the capacity to meet extraordinarily demanding design, production, and deliv- ery schedules.25Innovation in these areas would most likely be needed for a Thai firm to enter the world market. Once deemed inconceivable, the online retailing of high-fashion garments and accessories is now a reality. Web sites such as Net-A-Porter.com, NiemanMarcus.com, and BergdorfGoodman.com do athriving e-business because they have won the trust of their moneyed anddiscriminating but time-constrained customers. They have gained thistrust by offering the very latest fashion, by providing excellent packaging236 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 23. \"The truly successful designer has an instinct for visualizing sharply what is perhaps nebu- lously and unconsciously desired. Designers exist and work on all levels, not just at the top of thelimelight. Most cheap blouses and shoes have been specially designed for the mass market, notcopied from high priced versions\" (Hollander 1993, 35). 24. Fashion houses normally put out more than one clothing line in order to diversify their clientele. They do couture and also midlevel clothing and pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter. Some even target theyounger age groups and create clothes for children. Children's wear is a lucrative market for lux-ury brands in the United Kingdom; it is expected to be worth UK\u00a36.1 billion by 2007, a 26 per-cent growth, with infant wear being the fastest-growing market segment. The U.S. children'swear market is also growing, but at a slower pace (\"Rise of Petite Couture\" 2005). T eenagers andyoung adults are an important market segment because they will be the firm's main customers in5 to 10 years if the firm has made them familiar with its products and brands. Men's fashion and couture is slowly starting to become a less marginalized section of the industry, which is typically the domain of tailors and haberdashers. As designers and designhouses realize that men's fashion is part of the larger market and can be just as financially re-warding as women's fashion, they now have to reconsider designs and marketing concepts thatwill appeal beyond the female market and tap into those niche markets that are replete withpotential. 25. The Spanish-based Zara is integrated in both retail and production. The entire production process (from design to manufacture) usually takes four to five weeks and rarely restocks oldstyles as new styles always arrive; H&M, on the other hand, specializes in outsourcing fashionproduction (T ran 2006). and delivery, and by agreeing to take back any item that fails to satisfy (\"Surfing\" 2005). Although the difficulties of creating a thriving businessin fashion items should not be minimized, especially for emerging design- ers, whose materials, sizes, construction, and attention to detail might not be well known to prospective buyers, this new channel is important forprospective Thai fashion houses that are prepared to develop brand image.Net-A-Porter is able to sell anywhere in the world, and sales are beingbuoyed by strong growth in online shopping in Europe and more recently in the Middle East (\"Looking for Luxury\" 2005). Probably the factors that most favor the fashion firms in Thailand's budding creative industries are demographics, urbanization, and economicgrowth. East Asia is the world's fastest-growing region, and over the next20 years, the economic center of gravity for the global economy will shift toward Asia. Close to 70 percent of the population will be of working age, and the average age will be below 40 years. With rising incomes and ur-banization, an increasing number of households will be able to afford theproducts of the fashion industry. The passion for name-brand fashionproducts is particularly noticeable in Japan and now in China, as well as inSoutheast Asia and India. Chinese buyers already absorb 5 percent of theluxury goods sold, and between 5 and 20 percent of the revenues of majorluxury brands are being derived from China, India, and the RussianFederation (\"Rags and Riches\" 2004). 26Clearly, Bangkok is in the right part of the world. Whether it can capitalize on the geographic and eco- nomic advantages will depend on a mix of entrepreneurship, innovative- ness, and financing, as well as on the building of multimedia marketing services in Bangkok.27Currently, in the Southeast Asian region, only Bangkok is in the running, although efforts are under way in bothSILK AND GEMS 237 26. Chinese visitors to Hong Kong (China) were spending an average of HK$5,600 over a three- day visit, and they have strongly buoyed sales of luxury goods (\"Chinese Set to Shop\" 2004). 27. International exposure will also induce a rethinking of certain cultural and social mores and the devising of appropriate marketing practices for the fashion industry. As an example, a fashionshow during Fashion Week 2002 caused a sensation when models\u2014allegedly unintentionally\u2014exposed themselves. The Cultural Surveillance Center gave the organizers a warning, sayingthat \"the incident was not in line with Thai society and norms as a Buddhist country,\" instead ofsubjecting them to criminal charges (\"Thailand Raps Elle\" 2003). Showing skin is all too common in fashion shows and fashion shoots, whether by accident or by design. ConservativeThais have rejected the notion that they must be more open-minded about revealing clothes ifthey want to succeed as a major fashion hub. Subjecting the design industry to censorship couldeasily limit the range of styles that can be shown and constrain the creativity of designers. ManyThais who hew to conservative traditions and cultural mores may not be ready for change, inwhich case Thai designers operating from Bangkok may find it less easy to cater to a globalclientele.Singapore and Hong Kong (China) to build a fashion industry. Farther to the west, many Indian designers are testing Western markets. Arguably,Thai firms and designers have a window of opportunity they can exploit. In doing so, they will need to harness talent from around the region, and in this respect Bangkok's ambience and lifestyle offer many attractions. If those attractions can be enhanced, the kind of creative workers who are responsible for the development of a fashion industry will flock to thecity. Likewise, Bangkok-based firms need to build the metropolitan inno- vation system of universities, research institutes, and design houses to sup-port continuous technological change. The media and publishing businessneed to be strengthened to buttress the fashion sector. T echnical assis-tance from leading designers, such as Armani and Lagerfeld, and their en-dorsement of Thai fashion could boost the industry. And firms will have to make effective use of the global value chains that are behind the spread of the fashion industry and provide the logistical and marketing sinews. The Bangkok Fashion Fair is a means of stimulating the local fashion industry and of bringing local designers into the global limelight. The bigretail chains, which are increasingly on the lookout for alternatives to thestandard labels, have a growing appetite for such talent and buyers. T akingBangkok fashion on the road and displaying Thai designs at other fairs, aswas done in Milan in 2004, provide additional exposure. These high-profile fashion events and smaller shows by individual designers providean opportunity to display fine-stitched apparel different from other offer-ings. They also allow Thai designers to learn about international businessmodels and develop contacts. But such events are pricey, and designersneed to be able to raise the funding to display their offerings abroad. None of the major creative industries offer easy pickings for newcom- ers. Each requires a marshalling of talent, business acumen, finance, tech- nologies, and production skills. And each presupposes the willingness tomarket globally and considerable staying power. The rewards are large,however, and the alternatives for the apparel, jewelry, and accessoriesindustries in Bangkok are fairly bleak. The Bangkok industries confrontintense competitive pressure from China and India, which are able tomatch quality and have substantial price advantages. They also confrontpotential pressure from designers in Singapore and the Republic of Korea,who have their eyes on the same markets.238 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESShanghai\u2014with Guangzhou\u2014is the birthplace of the modern manufacturing industry in China. Starting in the late 19th century,cotton and silk textile factories fed by raw materials from farms in Jiangsu province were established in the Suzhou Creek area. Other light industries followed. Although the industry was badly scarred by the wars that gripped China from 1937 onward and was decimated by the em-igration of many of the leading mill owners in 1948 and 1949 to HongKong (China), it rebounded in the 1950s. Along with light manufacturing, the new government also invested in machinery and metallurgical indus-tries. By the time China's open-door policy was cautiously initiated in1979, Shanghai had acquired the broadest industrial base of any city in thecountry and, in particular, was the leading producer of textiles as well askey household durables such as bicycles and sewing machines. T wenty-five years later, although 50 percent of Shanghai's gross domestic product (GDP) is derived from manufacturing, the entire indus-trial system is being reshaped. Much of the textile industry has moved intoneighboring provinces or the interior parts of the country. Dominatingthe industrial sector now are production of chemical feedstocks and fibersin the Caojing Park, where both BASF and Bayer have located their newplants; automobile production in the Anting district; steelmaking inBaoshan; shipbuilding in a huge facility being constructed on ChangxingIsland; information technology-related and biotechnology industries inthe Zhangjian High-T ech Park in Pudong, and in Qingpu, and Songjiang;engineering and the production of auto parts and instruments in Jiading;and a mix of high-tech production by companies such as Ricoh, Bosch,Lucent, and Siemens in the Waigaoqiao area, with its deep-water port atthe eastern edge of the municipality. The vast industrial system that generates nearly US$45 billion in gross products is still evolving, butShanghai's planners recognize that manufacturing has passed its CHAPTER 8 SCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE240 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES MONGOLIA CHINASHANGHAI, CHINAIBRD 34887 JULY 2006 RUSSIAN FEDERATION DEM. PEOPLE'S REP. OF KOREA REP. OF KOREA JAPAN CAPITAL CITY URBAN EXTENT Shanghaihigh-water mark and that other producers will follow Intel and Durex to lower-cost locations in places such as Chengdu. In fact, the authoritiesproject a steep reduction in the share of manufacturing to 10 to 15 percent of GDP . Those projections assume an enormous increase in the contribu- tion of services to output and employment. WHY CONSTRUCTION? Much of the discussion of the future development of the services sector has focused on finance, insurance, accounting, and consulting services,and Shanghai has attracted many global financial institutions such as Citibank, Standard Chartered, Bank of America, and HSBC (Wei, Leung, and Luo 2006). Financial and legal services are the top-tier business serv-ices that account for an important slice of the GDP of London and NewYork, as well as Hong Kong (China), Singapore, and T okyo. But in an in-tegrated global economy, those are not necessarily the producer services with the highest growth prospects or the services that will be employingmany people in postindustrial cities. On the contrary, organizational andtechnological trends favor a consolidation of financial, accounting, andlegal services in a few large firms headquartered in a small number of met-ropolitan areas from which they serve a worldwide clientele. Moreover, innovation is promoting the commodification of many financial services, and digital technology has slowed the growth in jobs even as it induces theoutsourcing of routinized financial back-office activities, engineeringservices, software production, and even some retail operations. We conjecture that other producer services will be occupying the cen- ter stage in postindustrial Shanghai alongside finance and accounting.Among them, the architectural design, engineering, construction, and realestate industries will arguably play a leading role. The logistics sector,which is linked to construction, will be of equal importance. This group ofactivities has, in Shanghai, the potential to contribute the highest growthrate, the most jobs, and a substantial percentage of metropolitan GDPthrough localized delivery of services and exports to other parts of Chinaas well as abroad. Already the construction and real estate industries com-bined account for more than 12 percent of Shanghai's GDP 1as against 10 percent for financial services, and globally the construction businessSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 241 1. Construction is China's fourth largest industry, with a 7 percent share of the GDP in 2004 (\"Brick by Brick\" 2005).242 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES has a turnover of well over US$3 trillion.2The industry expanded rapidly after 1990, with the average growth rates of 23, 16, and 14 percent for the 1990-95, 1995-2000, and 2000-03 periods, respectively.3There are at least five reasons why its share could expand.4 First, there is the huge volume of investment in urban infrastructure and in intercity transportation facilities that will be required over the com-ing decades as a large chunk of the Chinese population that is currently classified as rural\u201457 percent\u2014enters the urban world. The geography of migrant streams in China and the experience of other industrial economiessuggest that the migrants from the rural areas will prefer living in coastalcities, 5which means that intensive construction activities in the expanding metropolitan areas and along the transportation arteries will continue far into the future. The growth rate of the homebuilding market in China was 18.7 percent in the period from 2000 to 2004, although this rate is expected to decline to 9.2 percent from 2004 to 2009 (Datamonitor2005d). The urban face of China and the spatial distribution of thepopulation as we know it today will change beyond all recognition, andthe construction industry will intermediate this transformation. 6 We foresee a second factor at work that will contribute a further surge of activity entailing large inputs from the design, engineering,7and materials industries.8Chinese cities, as well as cities outside of China, are being rebuilt and expanded with little thought given to residential quality, energy efficiency, the consequences of rampant water use, and the implications of a warming climate subject to extreme swings in the weather that could impinge, for instance, on the available supplies ofwater and on the susceptibility of some coastal areas to typhoons. Thenumerous high-rise buildings and residential complexes that dot the 2. The upward revision of the national accounts in 2005 suggests that the share of real estate might be significantly higher in Shanghai as well. 3. These are simple average annual growth rates calculated from the Shanghai Statistical Y earbook (Shanghai Municipal Statistical Bureau 2004) and the China Construction Y earbook (Ministry of Construction 2003).4. According to the Shanghai Statistical Bureau, Shanghai invested Y 88.6 billion in urban in- frastructure in 2004, a 31.7 percent increase from 2003 (Shanghai Municipal Statistical Bureau2005). 5. According to China's 2000 census, the coastal provinces received close to 60 percent of inter- provincial migration flow (Fan 2004). 6. Most of the leading Chinese cities have undergone one round of changes since the mid-1980s, but a second and more extensive round is now under way. 7. China accounts for 18 percent of the engineering market in Asia (Datamonitor 2005c).8. China consumed 54 percent of the global concrete output in 2004 (Datamonitor 2005f ).metropolitan area are being constructed with scant attention paid to cul- tural and recreational amenities, green spaces, the requirements of aleisure-oriented population that in the future will be appreciably older on average, and an urban environment that is both safe and more user friend- ly. Neither the urban infrastructure inherited from the pre-1980s normuch of the development since is likely to be viewed as satisfactory by ur-ban dwellers a couple of decades in the future, and especially so in China'smost advanced and affluent cities such as Shanghai. 9Hence, we anticipate a major redesign of the city and its partial reconstruction to create a more thoughtfully planned urban space that is culturally more vibrant, apart from being better suited to the conditions and demographics of the future\u2014what one author describes as \"slow cities in a fast world\" (Knox2005). 10Thus the pell-mell construction of the past decade could well lead to echo effects in Shanghai and other cities that will sustain the tempo of construction. The industrial restructuring of the city to increase the share of technology-intensive industries, to relocate the shipbuilding and port facilities along the Huangpu River, and to make Shanghai into a majorregional logistics hub will be a third source of long-term demand forconstruction services frequently of a specialized nature. Electronics and biotech firms require customized facilities that call for a high level of ex-pertise, and the products' short life cycles presage steady demand, as longas the industries remain in the Shanghai area. The continuing exodus ofold engineering and shipbuilding enterprises and of the docking facilitiesfrom the Huangpu riverfront frees up prime land for other uses, thereby opening up opportunities for creative mixed-use urban developments comparable to those planned for London and those implemented in T okyoand in Baltimore, Maryland, for example. Furthermore, the ambitious 50-berth Yangshan port project, the ongoing expansion of Pudong Interna-tional Airport, and the associated transport infrastructure all point to theintensive construction activity extending well into the future.SCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 243 9. T wo recent books that describe the physical and architectural evolution of Shanghai during the past century are Denison and Ren (2006) and Rowe and Kuan (2004). 10. A good example is Xintiandi, a two-hectare complex of restaurants, bars, and shops in an open low-rise style built along narrow alleys. The developer for this US$170 million project wasShui On Holdings Ltd. from Hong Kong (China), with architects from Wood /H11001Zapata, based in Boston, Massachusetts (\"Building the Country\" 2005). That complex is a part of theT aipingqiao redevelopment project, with luxury apartments and commercial centers that areadjacent to Xintiandi (\"Remaking Shanghai\" 2004).244 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES A fourth reason that construction has all the makings of a leading sec- tor is that it is rich in links and can become a driver of technological change. Already almost 20 percent of China's GDP is absorbed by construction and real estate. That percentage is likely to be sustained, with a significant part of the finance and insurance sectors remaining keyed tothe fortunes of the construction industry and its affiliated activities. Back-ward links from construction reach into a host of manufacturing industriesextending from cement and glass to ceramics, air-conditioning equipment, and construction machinery. Forward links are equally numerous, affect-ing the appliance, furniture, ceramics, and textile furnishings industries, toname only a few. The real estate sector is a huge employer, contributingvitally to the development, sale, leasing, and maintenance of properties.The engineering design and materials wings of the construction sector give rise to a host of technological advances in the use of computerized techniques in designing more cost-efficient structures, in makingbuildings more energy and water efficient, and in helping to intro-duce prefabricated modules. Other advances in construction methods arestimulating innovation in materials to enhance aesthetic appeal, reducecosts, and raise the quality of construction as well as the functionality ofstructures. In short, design, engineering, and construction trigger techno-logical advances across a wide spectrum of industries, and the accruinggains in efficiency can make a major contribution to the growth of totalfactor productivity. Viewed from that perspective, the construction sector,in its totality, is technologically one of the most dynamic industries and ispotentially a core competence for the Shanghai metropolitan area. Shanghai's comparative advantage in construction activities is but- tressed by its geographic location in the Yangtze Delta. That location enables China's leading industrial city to bid for the diverse, extensive, andlong-term construction requirements in the Yangtze Valley region, which,in addition, guarantee stable demand, offer plenty of scope for learning bydoing, and provide opportunities to experiment with new technologies.The comparative advantage also derives from the broad base of manufac-turing industries in the metropolitan area and in the near vicinity ofShanghai that \"internalize\" most of the linkage effects. That comparativeadvantage could also be enduringly supported by the supply of skills fromlocal universities, the technological inputs from research facilities, andthe accumulating expertise of local developers and project contractors.A deepening of the core competence in the vital area of producer serviceswould further support a range of industries and services in the metropoli-tan area and would give Shanghai-based firms the skills to design andbuild the kinds of cities that will be better tailored to China's emergingrequirements.There remains a fifth reason for focusing on construction services in Shanghai. That multifaceted sector generates numerous and varied jobs, many of which are relatively well paid, and it is hospitable to firms of all sizes.11In 2003, there were more than 2,000 firms in the construction industry. As we noted in chapter 1, postindustrial cities face widening in- come disparities as manufacturing migrates to other locations, taking away midrange blue- and white-collar jobs. With a large construction industry, however, a metropolitan area is assured a secure base of employment forhighly paid architects and engineers as well as for skilled craftspeopleengaged in the building trades, an army of real estate agents, employees ofmanufacturing firms servicing the building industry, and the unskilled or semiskilled workers who toil on construction sites. In Japan, for example,close to half a million firms are engaged in the construction industry, andone in seven members of the workforce are some way linked to theconstruction sector, which still absorbs 15 percent of total investment.Similarly, in the United States, the construction industry employs 7.2 mil- lion workers, 12three-fifths working in small companies with fewer than 20 employees. The fortunes of the construction industry are a good barometer of the health of the U.S. economy, with housing starts serving as one of the most closely followed indicators. Architecture and engineer- ing services are among the three leading producer services and are one ofthe key industries in world cities such as New York. THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN SHANGHAI The role of the construction industry in Shanghai needs to be viewed against the backdrop of the city's phenomenal transformation since theearly 1990s. Economic growth has averaged between 10 and 14 percentSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 245 11. The world's construction materials market is fragmented, with the top five firms accounting for only 13.3 percent of the global market share. Consolidation is likely in the future, especiallyas many firms are trying to diversify from their current dependence on the U.S. market (Data-monitor 2005f ). Some construction materials firms have invested in China already. The Frenchcompany Saint-Gobain, which ranked 106th in the Fortune 500 for 2005, invested US$27 mil-lion in building a glass-fiber factory in Yixin, the pottery city that is located in Jiangsu provinceand that has plenty of raw materials and a skilled local workforce. (http://www.aaart.com.cn/cn/news/show.asp?news_id=11605). Similar fragmentation is also present in theconstruction and engineering sector. No firm has more than 5 percent of the market share inAsia. Most leading firms in Asia are large Japanese firms, such as Kajima, T aisei, Shimizu, andObayashi (Datamonitor 2005a). and part-time workers.246 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 8.1 Infrastructure in Shanghai at a Glance, 1990 and 2004 Type of infrastructure 1990 2004 Road area (square meters per capita) 2.28 12.3 Rail transit (kilometers) 0 125a Living area (square meters per capita) 6.6 14.2 Green area (square meters per capita) 1.02 10.0 Wastewater treatment rate (%) 0 65.3 Source: Gao 2005. a. Data are for 2003. per year since 1995, driven by investment in infrastructure and industry. This growth has not only rejuvenated the manufacturing sector but alsostimulated a boom in services and, almost as a footnote, created an im- pressive new skyline (\"China: Leading City\" 2005). In 1990, the road area was only 2.28 square meters per capita, public green areas were a mere1.0 square meter per capita, and living area was just 6.6 square meters percapita (Gao 2005). By 2004, those numbers had risen to 12.3, 10.0, and14.2 square meters, respectively (see table 8.1). In 2004, Shanghai added 330 million square meters of housing (\"Architecture Watchdog\" 2005),and it has 34 million square meters of office space. 13The city has 4,000 skyscrapers (twice the number in New York) and plans to add 1,000 more by the end of this decade (\"China Builds Its Dreams\" 2005). A major ex- pansion of the road network and the completion of two ring roads, six bridges over the Huangpu River, and two tunnels and a subway network of310 miles add breathtaking detail to the city's achievement and reflect theextraordinary prowess of the construction sector. As an aside, it is worth noting that the magnetic levitation train from Pudong International Airport to the Puxi area, is the world's fastest train; 14 that the longest underwater pedestrian tunnel runs under the Huangpu River; that the Jinmao T ower in Pudong houses a Hyatt hotel with thehighest elevation of any hotel in the world; and that local companies built all these structures (\"Building the Country\" 2005). 13. The data for office space are from 2003 (Shanghai Municipal Statistical Bureau 2004). Between 1990 and 1997, Shanghai added 8.3 million square meters of office space. Consideringthat it took Hong Kong (China) 20 years\u2014from 1976 to 1996\u2014to create 5.8 million square me-ters of office space, the pace of development in Shanghai is quite high (Zhu 2002). 14. It is also the first commercial maglev train in operation (Cho 2004).Because the construction industry, broadly defined, accounts for well more than one-tenth of Shanghai's GDP15and is a major employer, the performance of that industry will have a large effect on labor productivity and the pace of growth in the city.16In 2004, Shanghai spent Y 67.3 billion on building highways, bridges, government offices, and parks and otheramenities (\"China: Leading City\" 2005). 17In addition, because infrastruc- ture long-lived, it will also influence appearance, livability, and effi-ciency. Not only is the construction industry itself very large, but as noted above, it is linked to numerous other industries, including the production of steel and other materials, the production of electric goods, and thefinancial and insurance services. It is clear from the experience of more advanced countries that the sophistication of the construction industry will have a lasting effect on the environment. China faces a number of environmental challenges. Many ofthem deserve to be tackled early on, especially through buildings that havea life extending over several decades. Putting in the right kind of structuresnow will enable Shanghai to minimize energy costs that are trending up-ward. In the United States, for example, buildings account for 65 percent of electricity consumption, 36 percent of total energy use, and 30 percent of greenhouse gas emission (\"Rise of the Green\" 2004). The ongoing boom in the construction business is a good time and place for the domestic industry to acquire the necessary capabilitiesthrough learning by doing and, at the same time, give companies theopportunities to experiment with new methods and innovative materials. 18 By encouraging those activities, the construction sector can become one of most efficient and innovative industries in Shanghai. A STATISTICAL PROFILE Commercial and residential construction has brought into an existence aburgeoning real estate industry across China and notably in Shanghai,which accounts for about 2,600 firms, or 8 percent of the total number ofSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 247 15. When the real estate sector is included, construction can account for as much as 20 percent of Shanghai's GDP (\"China: Leading City\" 2005). 16. Shanghai has remained the top place in China in terms of labor productivity in construction industry since 2002 (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2005). The latest figure is Y 28,769in 2004. 17. That money is in addition to the more than Y 300 billion invested in infrastructure in the 1990s (Wei, Leung, and Luo 2006). 18. The homebuilding market in China is the largest in Asia, with a 40 percent share of the con- struction market. It is followed by Japan, with 36 percent (Datamonitor 2005b).248 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES firms in China (see table 8.2). Shanghai is second only to Guangdong, which has 3,806 firms, or 12 percent of the total number of firms. Fur-thermore, the sector's dynamism in Shanghai has been enhanced by the increasing proportion of non-state-owned firms, which include 280 firms from outside mainland China, representing 11 percent of the total. Ofthese firms, 70 percent are from Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), andT aiwan (China). By 2002, employment in the real estate industry had risen to 79,392, 7 percent of the national employment in this sector. As can be seen from table 8.3, relatively more people were employed by foreign firms and firmsfrom Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), and T aiwan (China). The bulk of the investment completed in 2002 was in housing units (see table 8.4). Relative to other cities in China, Shanghai has a disproportion- ate share of the real estate investment in single family homes and luxury condominiums, reflecting the higher incomes of the average family. Theaverage cost of housing in Shanghai is also close to twice the nationalaverage, costing Y 2,137 per square meter in Shanghai as opposed to onlyY 1,184 per square meter in China on average. The strong demand forhousing and the higher quality of the units constructed make Shanghai ahighly profitable place for the real estate industry (see table 8.5). Although the majority of Shanghai-based construction firms are mainly active in the metropolitan area only, some firms operate in other cities also.Table 8.2 Composition of Real Estate Firms in China, 2002 Firms from Hong Kong (China), Macao State- (China), and Domestic owned Collectively Taiwan Foreign Location All firms firms firms owned firms (China) firms China Number of firms 32,618 28,657 5,015 7.6 8.8 3.3 Shanghai Number of firms 2,588 2,308 420 184 197 83Percentage of total firms 100.0 89.2 16.2 7.1 7.6 3.2 Percentage of firms in Shanghai 7.9 8.1 8.4 7.4 6.8 7.7 Source: Ministry of Construction 2003.For instance, the Shanghai Construction Group worked on the National Theater in Beijing, along with some foreign contractors (T uchman, Reina,and Kemp 2004). A small number of Chinese contractors are active abroad. In 2000, exports of foreign economic cooperation (FEC) businesses, which cover contract engineering, labor services, and design consultation,amounted to US$9.3 billion, by far the largest service exports of China (seetable 8.6). By the end of 2001, the central government had issued FECbusiness licenses to about 2,000 Chinese contractors to stimulate the ex- port of construction services (Chen and Mohamed 2002). 19 Close to 50 Chinese construction firms are listed among the top 225 international contractors, and 12 design firms have risen to the ranks ofSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 249 Table 8.3 Composition of Real Estate Employees, 2002 Firms from Hong Kong (China), Macao State- (China), and Domestic owned Collectively Taiwan Foreign Location Total firms firms owned firms (China) firms China Number of employees 1,134,009 1,014,254 3.0 Shanghai Number of employees 79,392 65,991 13,590 4,090 8,355 5,046 Percentage total employees 100.0 83.1 17.1 5.2 10.5 6.4 Shanghai's share of total employees in China (%) 7.0 6.5 6.5 4.6 9.8 14.7 Average number of employees per establishment 30.7 28.6 32.4 22.2 42.4 60.8 Source: Ministry of Construction 2003. 19. China is following the lead of construction firms from the Republic of Korea. Since the first foray into the international market by Hyundai in 1965, Korean construction firms have been ac-tive in construction works globally, especially in the Middle East. Those international activitiesgreatly expanded the market for Korean firms. For instance, Hyundai's contract for Jubail portin Saudi Arabia was worth 25 percent of Korea's national budget in 1976. Without those activi-ties, Korean firms would have faced a much smaller market, limiting the scope for their growth.250 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Table 8.4 Investment by Building Types, 2002 Single- family Business Completed houses and Economic Office commercial Location investment Houses luxury condos housing buildings building Other China Amount of investment (US$ billion) 94.1 63.1 6.2 7.1 4.6 11.3 15.1 Percentage of total types 100.0 67.1 6.6 7.6 4.9 12.0 16.0 Shanghai Amount of investment(US$ billion) 9.04 6.86 0.96 \u2014 0.40 0.75 1.03 Percentage of total types 100.0 75.8 10.6 \u2014 4.5 8.3 11.4 Percentage of investment in Shanghai 9.6 10.9 15.4 \u2014 8.8 6.7 6.8 Source: Ministry of Construction 2003.

The ex- ception is Shanghai, where the market is dominated by large firms such as the Shanghai Construction Group,22which comprises 300 affiliates and has a turnover of Y 26 billion. The Shanghai Construction Group, the Shanghai Urban Construction Group, and the Shanghai Baosteel Engineering and Construction Corporation were ranked the 6th, 16th, and 60th largest contractors in China, respectively (\"T op Chinese Con-tractors\" 2006). If the experience from other countries is a guide, thenconsolidation of the industry may be needed to scale up the size of thesefirms sufficiently. Here Shanghai-based firms could take a lead and establish a nationwide presence. Engineering and Architectural Services The engineering and architectural services sector can be broken down into three components: (a) planning and architecture design, (b) construc-tion engineering, and (c) project management and execution.

The ranking of international contractors and designers is based only on international con- tracts expressed in U.S. million dollars in 2003. The global ranking is based on both interna-tional and domestic contracts. 21. The lists of top-ranking firms in 2004 were obtained from the Engineering News-Record, http://www.enr.com.22. The main line of business of those firms is to provide construction and engineering services as well as advisory services, manufacturing of equipment, and material (Datamonitor 2005d).252 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES firms tend to contribute most significantly to the first and third compo- nents, generally by way of joint ventures with local design bureaus andconstruction companies. The division of labor between foreign and do- mestic firms arises from differences in their capabilities. 23Foreign firms have more experience and capabilities in integrated planning and design,24 whereas domestic firms have the engineering talent to do the detailed de- sign and construction engineering and are also much more familiar withthe local regulations and building codes. 25Usually a domestic firm charges a design fee equal to about 0.5 percent of the total project cost, whereas aforeign firm typically charges about 3 percent and even higher for more complicated and highly visible projects. 26The price differentials reflect the levels of services provided by those firms. Foreign firms are usually superior to the domestic firms in the quality of their designs and their attention to functional details. Domestic firms tend to ignore such fea- tures, which cost more time and money. Therefore, in the constructionmarket, domestic firms usually are responsible for the bulk of the middle-to low-tier building projects, and foreign firms generally are involved withupper-tier building projects. Many of the most conspicuous high-rise buildings in Shanghai were designed or developed by foreign firms\u2014aswell as those from Hong Kong (China)\u2014in partnership with Chinesefirms. Those foreign firms tend to draw on their relationships with globalarchitectural and design firms and harness talent from around the world. There are five Shanghai-based design firms that are highly rated by Engineering News-Record : Shanghai Xian Dai Architectural Design (Group) Co., Ltd. (rated 3rd); SINOPEC Shanghai EngineeringCompany Limited (rated 15th); Shanghai Municipal Engineering DesignInstitute (rated 19th); Shanghai Urban Construction Design and ResearchInstitute (rated 45th); and the Shanghai Investigation, Design, andResearch Institute (rated 59th) (\"T op Chinese Design Firms\" 2006). 23. In China, most medium-size and large design firms (those with a staff of 1,000 or more) are state owned. The management and operation style of those firms is rooted in the old planningsystem. T o raise the efficiency of those firms, the government is encouraging partnerships withforeign firms, which could help change management style and organizational structure. 24. Foreign firms tend to have better knowledge of technology not only in the areas that they are immediately involved in but also in the other areas that may be relevant to construction of abuilding. Identification of new technologies and integration of such technologies on a projectbasis are complex and complicated tasks. The technological hurdle seems to be much highernow with the need to overlay older technologies with newer ones (Gann and Slater 2000). 25. The involvement of foreign firms at the initial stage is used as a marketing tool for real estate developers, reflecting the consumer preference for foreign products. 26. See http://house.sina.com.cn/n/s/2002-12-02/16668.html.The Shanghai Xian Dai Architectural Design (Group) Co., Ltd., was established in 1998 through a merger of the East China Architectural Design and Research Institute and Shanghai Institute of Architectural Design and Research. It has more than 20 subsidiaries and employs one- third of Shanghai's licensed architects and structural engineers. It has com-pleted more than 30,000 design or consulting projects, which include par-ticipation in some iconic buildings in Shanghai such as the Shanghai TVT ower, Jin Mao Building, Shanghai Grand Theatre, Shanghai Stadium, and Shanghai Pudong Airport. 27In addition, some emerging private design firms set up by famous Chinese architects are trying to compete with the big design institutes. For example, Ma Qingyuan, an architect educated at the University of Pennsylvania, established the firm Ma Design and Associates in Shanghai in 1999. Another area in which foreign firms excel is in the development of com- munities. In a city like Shanghai, residents now want more than just livingspace. They are demanding various amenities in the buildings and the surrounding areas. Many real estate developers are taking note of thosepreferences and offering such communities ample amenities, which wereneglected in the past. For example, buildings are being situated along bod-ies of water, near a fountain, and between small, human-made forests.Western architectural styles and cultural nuances are attractive to the upper income groups in particular. Luxury community development\u2014 jin guan \u2014is a trend that is gaining ground in Shanghai. The recently released rankings of Shanghai's T op 10 Luxury Residential Buildings and its T op 10 Commercial Buildings reflectthe mounting competition among builders, and there is pressure to con-struct buildings of a higher quality. T ypically, a real estate development company will establish a project company for each development project so as to minimize financial andother risks. For residential development, the project company will bedisbanded once the construction is finished. For commercial properties,the companies generally remain to manage the leasing of buildings. Thebusiness of long-term management of residential and commercial proper-ties is still in its infancy in China, and there is considerable scope forexpansion of and improvement in services provided. It is sure to remain a growth industry for some time. Such is the strength of demand in the Shanghai housing market that Shanghai-based community design firms are the biggest employers ofSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 253 27. This information comes from the company's Web site, http://www.xd-ad.com.cn/.254 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES architectural designers, providing jobs for 60 percent of recent recruits.28 Design firms from Europe, Hong Kong (China), Japan, and the United States are especially active. They are looking for employees who can as-similate their design ideas, are familiar with computer-based designing, have good aesthetic judgment, and have a couple years of local experience in the details of designing. There are few such people in Shanghai today,but the numbers are growing with experience. Large domestic firms, such as the East China Architecture Design and Research Institute, are involved in the development of residential and general commercial buildings. Some of the large state-owned contractorshave their own architectural and design division; others\u2014especiallysmaller businesses\u2014contract with specialized architectural firms. The big state-owned enterprises also are engaged in the manufacture of materials(Chen and Mohamed 2002). Financing Nationwide, firms in the real estate sector procure finance from a variety of sources (see table 8.7). Close to half of the funding takes the form of 28. See http://www.aaart.com.cn/news/show.asp?news_id=11443.Table 8.7 Capital Sources for Real Estate Firms, 2002 Funding within Foreign Self- national Domestic Foreign direct provided Location Total budgeting loan Bonds capital investment funding Othera China Capital (US$ billion) 117.75 0.14 26.82 0.03 1.90 1.50 33.07 55.80 Percentage of total capital source 100.00 0.12 22.77 0.02 1.61 1.27 28.09 47.38 Shanghai Capital (US$ billion) 12.18 0 2.75 0 0.39 0.26 3.24 5.80 Percentage 0 3.22 2.13 26.61 47.60 Share of Shanghai (%) 10.3 0 1.0 0 20.7 17.3 9.8 10.4 Source: Ministry of Construction 2003. a. Other includes investments by other firms.investment by other firms and investors. Another 30 percent of the fi- nancing comes from the cash flow of the firm. About 18 percent is madeof loans from banks, whereas foreign direct investment (FDI) accounts for the balance of about 2 percent. At this stage, firms do not rely on bond issues to raise necessary funding. As table 8.7 shows, Shanghai-based firmsadhere to a pattern of financing that closely resembles the national aver-age, although they rely more on FDI than firms elsewhere in China. Involvement of Foreign Firms In 2000, of the 285 foreign firms (and other firms outside mainland China) that were engaged in the construction and real estate business in Shanghai,70 percent were from Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), and T aiwan (China) (see table 8.8). These firms have a vital role in the transfer of tech- nology and tacit knowledge. Such firms\u2014especially those from HongKong (China)\u2014are involved in the planning and development of the moreupscale real estate projects (Zhu, Sim, and Zhang 2006). 29For example, 76 percent of the office space in Jiang'an and 91 percent in Huaihai wasSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 255 Table 8.8 Foreign Construction and Real Estate Developers in Shanghai, 1996-2000 Percentage Total number of developers of foreign Number of from Hong developers developers Kong (China), and developers from Hong Macao (China), Total outside Kong (China), and Taiwan (China) number of mainland Macao (China), among foreign Year developers China and Taiwan (China) developers 1996 2,030 256 93 36.3 1997 2,398 264 129 48.9 1998 2,601 307 206 67.11999 2,595 301 208 69.1 2000 2,549 285 201 70.5 Source: Zhu, Sim, and Zhang 2006. 29. The comparative advantage of firms from Hong Kong (China) in those areas arises because such firms are not at the forefront technologically. Many developers from Hong Kong (China)do not use prefabricated construction materials even though they can greatly reduce costs andincrease the quality of the resulting building. In addition, such firms do not invest much in re-search and development, whereas Japanese construction firms spend 3 percent of their revenueson research and development each year (Chinag and T ang 2003).256 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES developed by firms from Hong Kong (China) (Zhu, Sim, and Zhang 2006), whereas 74 percent of the office space in Lujiazui in Pudong wasbuilt by local developers, many of them state-owned enterprises. Before China's accession to the World T rade Organization, many foreign design and engineering firms operated within China on a project- by-project basis. Following accession in November 2003 and the subse-quent steps to liberalize the construction industry, expectations amongforeign firms were running high on the prospects of expanding their operations in China because wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are to beallowed for the first time in the construction industry (T uchman 2003).However, the so-called liberalization, which was implemented well aheadof schedule, has imposed high capitalization requirements (up to US$1billion in capital is required for a US$5 billion project by foreign firms); has required foreign firms to hire 300 technical and managerial personnel if they are constructing a class I building; has resulted in the repeal of lawsthat had earlier qualified foreign engineering and construction firms; andhas imposed certification requiring experience in China only and not glob-ally, effectively making the sector more restrictive than ever before (\"Brickby Brick\" 2005; Walton 2004). 30Those requirements plus the opacity of the tendering process and the long delays in finalizing contracts could slow the entry of foreign firms as well as technology diffusion. More likely, given the attraction of the Shanghai market, the conditions will further pressure foreign companies to seek local partners and impart the tech-nology that the locals are seeking. Links with Other Industries The rapid growth of construction activity in China is translating into a surging demand for heavy machinery. The sale of wheel- and track-typehydraulic excavators in China exceeded 55,000 units in 2005. By compar- ison, in 2003, 26,000 units were sold in North America and 66,000 units in Europe (Hampton 2004). That vast demand has brought the majorinternational producers to China, where they have, for the most part,entered into joint ventures with Chinese companies. The Chinese domes-tic market is currently dominated by firms from the Republic of Korea and Japan. The top two firms, Daewoo and Hyundai, held 20.3 and 30. The Regulation on Management of Foreign-Invested Urban Planning Service Enterprises allows joint venture and wholly foreign-owned investment in urban planning, but it limits for-eign investment in \"microlevel urban planning\" without adequately defining what constitutesmicrolevel urban planning as opposed to comprehensive urban planning (Walton 2004).20.0 percent, respectively, of the market share in 2003, while Komatsu and Hitachi held 16.7 and 15.0 percent, respectively. T ogether those firmsaccounted for three-fourths of the market in hydraulic excavators in China (Hampton 2004). 31Caterpillar also has about 10 subsidiaries in China in partnership with local construction equipment companies. In 1995, Caterpillar entered into a partnership agreement with Xuzhou Engineer- ing Equipment Group Inc., China's largest construction equipment sup- plier. Caterpillar also introduced the heavy construction equipment rentalbusiness, which is a new procurement and finance trend in China'sconstruction industry (Datamonitor 2005e). 32 The growth of construction and FDI is drawing more Chinese firms, judging by the increased participation in trade shows (Hampton 2004). An important new manufacturing sector is on the march. The links from con- struction activities extend to a number of other high value added items as well, all produced within the Shanghai municipality. Baoshan Steel, byexpanding its capacity and adding new products lines, is now able to meetmost of the construction industry's requirements for steel structures.Schindler, the world's largest producer of elevators and escalators, has been induced to operate the world's largest escalator manufacturingfactory in Shanghai, and Carrier, a leading supplier of air-conditioningequipment, uses Shanghai as a base for production and research. Some ofthe leading manufacturers of glass, ceramic products, and tile are also dis-tributed around the metropolitan region and in nearby cities, with both T oto and American Standard meeting the needs of Shanghai builders. All of those enterprises are extending Shanghai's industrial base in directionsthat will be increasingly valuable down the road because their products aretechnology and design intensive and the local value added is high. Links with Universities and Other Tertiary Institutes Since the early 1990s, the construction industry has been strengthening its links with universities. Local universities supplied the engineers, archi-tects, designers, and managers, whose energy and effort have changed the face of Shanghai. Although the state-owned construction firms have been downsizing since 1990, they still employ more than 11,000 engineers andSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 257 31. Caterpillar had 12.2 percent of the market (Hampton 2004). 32. See http://china.cat.com, http://News.chinabyte.com/253/2114253.shtml, and http://www .quote123.com/usmkt/FinanceNews_Special.asp?ClassID=5&SubID=56689&T ableName=NewsHeadline.258 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES technicians, and the share of those skilled workers employed by firms is in- creasing over time (see table 8.9). That link is now being supplemented by other links with research in universities and in institutes in Shanghai and elsewhere. The Institute of Research on Construction at Jiaotong University is one instance, but thereare others as well, such as the Civil Engineering and Architectural DesignInstitute of T ongji University, 33where research on materials, design, and construction techniques is beginning. The Civil Engineering and Archi- tecture Design Institute employs 661 professionals, including 98 archi- tects and more than 200 engineers, who can provide services ranging from intelligent building design to bridge engineering, geotechnical investiga-tion, landscaping, and ancient monument restoration and protection. Itearned US$71.4 million in 2004. The promotion of faculty members at T ongji University is tied to out- side experience. Many staff members will leave academia for a few years, work for construction firms to gain practical experience, and then returnto the university, sometimes in professional positions. Such experience isindispensable in creating the networks that strongly influence the effec-tiveness of their research. The flow between academia and firms resemblesTable 8.9 Share of Engineers and Technicians in State-Owned Construction Enterprises, 1990-2003 Types of employees 1990 1995 2000 2003 Total employees 210,300 176,600 77,400 61,900 Engineers and technicians 15,600 20,400 14,000 11,500 Percentage of total employees 7.4 11.6 18.1 18.6 Source: Ministry of Construction 2003. 33. The integrated setting of the Civil Engineering and Architectural Design Institute, with about 10,000 square meters of floor space, permits all technical work to be completed in-house,including detailed drawings using the most advanced computer-aided design systems. The insti-tute was founded in 1958 as the Architectural Design and Research Institute. In March 2001,T ongji University merged the Architectural Design and Research Institute of T ongji Universityand the Shanghai-T ongji Planning and Architectural Design and Research Institute to form thenew Civil Engineering and Architecture and Design Institute of T ongji University. T ongji Uni-versity became the main shareholder by equity transfer. The ranking of the institute in the Gen-eral Appraisal of Shanghai Exploration and Design Units rose from sixth position in 2000, tofifth in 2001, and to third in 2002. The Civil Engineering and Architectural and Design Insti-tute is accredited with several class A design certificates issued by the State Ministry of Con-struction for China. Its design products include office buildings, education buildings, hotel andhealth buildings, sports facilities buildings, residential buildings, planning and urban design, andprotected and converted buildings.the circulation of talent between Stanford University and the firms based in Silicon Valley. Labs from the Civil Engineering School and the College of Architec- ture and Urban Planning at T ongji University actively engage in small commercial and public projects. The labs are typically headed by one ortwo professors, and their networking skills are critical for securing thosecontracts. The university encourages commercial involvement of facultymembers because the lab and the university share the revenue from such contracts. On the demand side, many firms are willing to contract withthose labs because the labs are relatively inexpensive and can provide therequisite expertise. T ongji University owns 20 companies, of which 7 arein the construction industry. The university also has equity shares inother companies\u2014mainly limited liability companies. T ongji Universi- ty's sister institution, Shanghai Jiaotong University, also owns construc- tion firms. One of them is Shanghai Jiaotong Engineering ConstructionLtd., which was established in 1993 with Y 5 million in registered capital.It is funded by both the Shanghai Jiaotong University and the ChinaInternational Construction Company of the State Ministry of Construc-tion of China. This company provides construction consulting servicesrather than construction services. It has grown 20 percent every year inthe past decade. Of the 600 projects that the company has engaged in,more than 30 percent were important public projects and foreign-fundedprojects. 34 Inevitably, research and innovation have not been a priority in the rush to build. However, as the industry has begun to mature and become more conscious of energy efficiency, for example, interest in innovation has started to stir. This budding interest is reflected in the activities at T ongji and Jiaotong Universities. Until recently, universities also were neglectingproject management, but that too is changing. INNOVATION IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY There is a wide scope for innovation in all parts of the construction and real estate sectors, but as long as competitive pressures, market demandfor improved quality, and government regulations were weak, technologi- cal change was slow to occur. Nevertheless, even in this environment, in- novation is occurring in many areas.SCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 259 34. See the Shanghai Jiaotong University Web site, http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/.260 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES New Materials The construction of the Jinmao T ower, the TV tower, the Science Museum, the maglev track, and the various bridges has introducedbuilders to the most complex technologies for laying foundations, pump- ing concrete to great heights, assembling large steel frames, and installing the plumbing and electrical work for huge structures. Still to come\u2014andthe time may be approaching\u2014is the greater use of plastics, a constructionmaterial whose reliability has been proven in Europe and North America.Although that technology has been available for a long time, civil engineers around the world have only recently felt comfortable in usingplastics to construct bridges. The benefits of the technology are manifold.First is the low maintenance requirement. The life expectancy of bridgesbuilt with plastics can be as long as 60 years without major rehabilita-tion, compared with 10 to 20 years for concrete and steel bridges. More- over, unlike concrete and steel, plastics do not suffer from corrosion, frost, mold, and damage from insects. 35A bridge can be constructed from recycled plastics such as the one in New Jersey (\"Bridge T oo Far?\" 2005). Other materials can also be recycled. Constructors find that, in some cases, recycled paper and fabrics provide more effective insulation than tradi- tional insulation (\"Rise of the Green Building\" 2004). Even concrete cannow be made from recycled waste. For instance, 45 percent of the concretethat will be used for the One Bryant Park building in New York will comefrom leftover waste generated from iron processing, thereby preventing the release of about 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide, which would havebeen discharged had the building been constructed with new concrete (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). 36 The use of the Internet has added an extra dimension to innovation in the construction sector. A computer-integrated project management system can streamline project operations and increase the efficiency of managing complex production systems, which can involve hundreds of subcontractors of various types (Gann and Slater 2000). 35. The InfraCore Bridge, by the Coposieten T eam in Rotterdam, Netherlands, offers a simpli- fied way of building bridges\u2014bridges that are made of plastics and are standardized so thatordering is rather simple. The bridges are customized to customer's preference. The customerchooses the size, the color, and options such as handrails, and the bridges can be delivered withina week (\"Bridge T oo Far?\" 2005). 36. T echnology related to concrete is also growing. Sensors can now measure the temperature of curing concrete, accurately gauging the maturity level. That ability has led to a two-day reduc-tion in concrete production (\"What's Next\" 2004).\"Smart,\" \"Green\" Buildings Looking forward, we see that some of the biggest challenges for the engineering and construction industry will be to ensure that the structuresand practices adopted are flexible enough to accommodate advances in information technology (IT) and to observe environmental and energy standards. Most new buildings and structures are being designed to be ITready, with built-in space for telephone lines, broadband connections, anda variety of sensors. The drive for greater energy efficiency in buildings is not new. The Crystal Palace in London, which was built for a great exhibition in 1851, and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, which was built in1877, both used a roof ventilation system and underground air-coolingchambers to regulate the temperature inside (\"Rise of the Green Build-ing\" 2004). Modern buildings use similar principles. For instance, the One Bryant Park building in New York will use an air ventilation system located on the eighth floor to produce fresh air, which will be filtered to removedust and other particles, and will use groundwater to regulate the insidetemperature (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). Although building codes clearly specify energy-efficiency require- ments, only 5 percent of office and residential buildings meet the mini-mum energy-conservation standards in China (\"Wasteful Ways\" 2005). 37 Since 2001, Chinese cities have enacted new building standards that aim for 50 percent less energy use per square foot, but enforcement remainsweak, as does the integration of environmental management techniques in construction (\"Wasteful Ways\" 2005). 38Reducing energy consumption of a building by 50 percent is feasible with better designs and the use of ad- vanced technology, as was demonstrated, for example, by the Swiss Re T ower in London (\"Rise of the Green Building\" 2004). As another exam- ple, the Conde Nast Building in London uses special glass to allow all butultraviolet light to pass through. 39A gas turbine fuel cell powers theSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 261 37. China's Ministry of Construction is in talks with the U.S. Green Building Council to develop a rating system similar to the one used in the United States (Gonchar 2004). 38. Shanghai promulgated its own construction energy saving plans in 2005, but implementa- tion has been slow. The plan for energy saving released in May 2006 set the target to reduce theenergy consumption as a coefficient of GDP by 20 percent and to reduce energy consumptionin the construction industry by 15 percent during the 11th five-year plan (\"Shanghai's Energy-Saving Policies\" 2006). 39. By allowing only visible light to come through, the glass helps to keep the temperature warm during the winter and prevents rooms from becoming too warm during the summer. Many newbuildings are now adopting those kinds of windows (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). New kinds of glasswill also minimize the adhesion of dust and dirt, cutting down on the costs of exterior cleaning.262 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES building at night, and the exhaust from the fuel cell is used to heat the building and the water used.

By incorpo- rating those and other technologies, designers and engineers were able to reduce energy consumption by 30 to 40 percent compared with similarbuildings without those technologies. Buildings can save on energy through clever design and the use of new materials, as well as the use of power generators. The blueprint for the Freedom T ower in New York includes 25 wind turbines to generateelectricity, in addition to solar panels to produce about 1 megawatt ofpower, enough to supply 20 percent of the projected power requirement(\"Energy Answer\" 2004; \"Rise of the Green Building\" 2004). 40The One Bryant Park building in New York will compost wastes generated on site to make methane or biodiesel fuel. Those fuels will feed the power generator (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). A survey of green buildings in the United States reveals that by adopt- ing green technologies, building owners were able to reduce the energy consumption by 30 percent on average. The costs of complying with thosestandards typically adds only 2 percent to construction costs, so that the marginal increase in the cost of building can be recouped from lower run-ning costs within a few years, especially when energy prices are high (\"Riseof the Green Building\" 2004). For the One Bryant Park building, a com-paratively ambitious effort, construction costs will increase by 6.5 percent,but the building is actually expected to save about US$3 million in energy costs and is projected to generate US$7 million through increased pro- ductivity. If those assumptions are realized, the additional costs of incor-porating green technologies would be paid off in seven years (\"54-StoryAir Filter\" 2005). 41 The adoption of green technology and alternative construction materi- als have benefited from the shift in the selection process of construction options and incentive policies.42In the past, the initial building cost was the main consideration. Now, the emphasis is more on the total costof ownership, including maintenance and energy costs (\"Science and 40. One Bryant Park in New York also will feature a wind turbine for electricity (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). 41. By using 200 waterless (and odorless) urinals in the One Bryant Park building, the building owner can save an estimated 40,000 gallons of water a year (\"54-Story Air Filter\" 2005). Thebuilding also features rainwater collection facilities. Water collected that way will be treated andthen used for toilets and watering of plants. 42. On these policies and barriers to the adoption of new technologies, see Zerkin (2006).T echnology: Composites\" 2005). That emphasis has encouraged the fur- ther integration of smart building technologies, even though the initialconstruction costs may be higher. The effective incorporation of plants and trees into the interior space has been shown in Frankfurt, Germany, to enhance comfort, air quality, and health benefits for workers. Shanghai is receiving help from Hamburg, its sister city in Germany. Pujiang Intelligence Valley is an industrial park consisting solely ofresearch and development and office facilities in an ecological surround- ing in Minhang district. The office buildings use various energy-efficienttechnologies, such as wall activation, geothermal heat and cold, insulation,ventilation technologies, and sunshading technologies designed by Dittert& Reumsch\u00fcssel (of Hamburg and Hannover) in cooperation with MUDI(Munich Urban Design International). The project is scheduled to be fin- ished in August 2006. There are also a number of the projects that are still at the stage of conceptual design. 43 The only problem is that much more planning and coordination is needed to construct a green building than a traditional building (\"Rise of the Green Building\" 2004).44The need for such close coordination among designers, engineers, and contractors increases the advantages arisingfrom agglomeration of an industry in a locale. Once such an agglomera- tion is achieved and firms can lock in the gains from design, planning, and project management, competitors will find that the lead position ishard to challenge. Now is the window of opportunity for the constructionindustry in Shanghai to quickly establish its position as a leading cityregionally, if not globally. CURRENT STATUS AND PROGNOSIS What is the future of the construction industry in Shanghai? Clearly, the past decade has provided an auspicious start (table 8.10), and as we haveargued, there is much building and rebuilding in store in the metropolitan areas in the Yangtze Valley basin and across China. Many of the supplies and services providers for the construction projects in Shanghai arelocated in the metropolitan region or in neighboring cities so that withinSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 263 43.

The real estate industry is counted as a part of the tertiary industry.a 100-mile radius, there now exists a cluster that is approaching self- sufficiency in everything from research in materials to air-conditioningequipment. Some types of construction machinery, exterior decoration for buildings, and electrical controls for building utilities are still imported, but little by little, FDI or licensing by domestic producers is bringingthose products to the industrial belt around Shanghai. The soft infrastruc-ture of construction regulations and codes has also been taking shapealong with modest progress in developing the machinery of enforcement. The construction industry is vast but is not yet close to its potential productivity, and it is far from being innovative. Still, the scope for achievement is enormous. The hundreds of cranes in the Yangtze Valleydemarcate the biggest and the most ambitious construction site in theworld, with the most diverse assortment of projects, which have links extending in many directions. At least through the end of the decade, both the manufacturing activities and the services that feed the constructionsector are likely to remain and possibly even expand. Further down theroad, Shanghai's ability to hold on to the key elements of the constructionsector will be a function of selective specialization in the most skill- andknowledge-intensive parts of the construction business. Other parts of thebusiness will most likely move to locations where the production costs arelower. Currently, Shanghai produces some of the more capital- and skill- intensive products consumed by the construction industry\u2014for example,iron and steel products, heating and cooling equipment, and elevators andescalators. There is little reason to expect the manufacture of such prod-ucts to move elsewhere. Shanghai has substantial capacity in the areas ofarchitectural design and engineering, but world-class capability is lacking, and those two activities remain fairly compartmentalized. By and large,both design and engineering practices are conservative, structures areoverengineered, and\u2014except for the occasional exterior flourish (\"the bigroof\") with respect to high-rise buildings\u2014Chinese architects and engi-neers hew to well-established and proven techniques. Because labor ischeap, construction methods tend to be immensely labor intensive, evenwhen mechanical equipment is available, which detracts from the qualityof the finish, especially with the run-of-the-mill construction. Low wagesof engineers also mean that some activities, such as physical modeling ofstructures, are far more common. There is plenty of room here forupgrading architectural techniques and engineering practices and,through greater interaction, bringing those services close to the state ofthe art in the most advanced countries. Such deepening in capability isentirely feasible given the ready supply of local skills, the increasingSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 265266 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES involvement of foreign firms, and the reflux of Chinese trained abroad, all of which are contributing to the diffusion of the latest technologies. More-over, the entry of many small new architectural and engineering firms is sure to stimulate experimentation and adventurousness in design. In five areas, however, Shanghai's construction and architectural design lags, and unless remedied, that delay could constrain the competitiveness of the sector, possibly within China and certainly in a future race to winoverseas business. First, Rowe (2005, 17) observes that \"rising expectations with regard to building quality, material integrity, and technological performance, as well as similarities in building programmes that substantially transcend in bothsize and scope traditional ways of building, have led inexorably to a same-ness in contemporary built environments throughout the world, save per- haps, for superficial decoration and adornment of structures to suit the tastes, or to conform to expressive norms of a local culture.\" He (154) goeson to note that, \"unlike many cities in Europe, where there is a constantdisplay or palette of urban architecture on offer from other eras, a far lesswell-conserved and reused residue remains in most East Asian cities\"(154). Rowe (144) finds that \"Most problematic is the lack of any deeplyfelt cultural connection between the sign of past tradition and the realityof contemporary modern practice.\" This tendency is most apparent inChina, although it pervades the region. Rowe ascribes it to the \"wholesaleappropriation and then combining of styles borrowed from abroad.\" He(34) believes that this practice is responsible for, \"the jarring outlandish,downright ugly, or 'over the top' aspect to parts of the urban landscape\" insome Chinese cities. Shanghai has its share of outlandish buildings as wellas drab and utilitarian ones. Certainly there is much catching up to do in architectural design and in harmonization with urban design to conveysome distinct cultural overtones. One observer has remarked that whole-sale demolition and rebuilding as practiced in Shanghai is not good fordesign, \"especially if what is replacing it is a bad idea\" (\"Brick by Brick\"2005, 53). Second, the more complex projects require close attention to overall project management and systems integration in the interests of efficiency,safety, cost-effectiveness, and timely completion. In the case of China, theemphasis is on meeting deadlines, and in fact, a surprising number ofprojects are completed on or ahead of schedule. However, cost-efficiency,quality of installation and finish, and safety are sacrificed. The weakness oflocal expertise in that regard has created opportunities for foreign firmsthat can define a process from the inception of the project through designand completion and can ensure that all the individual pieces come togetherwhen they should. Foreign firms are transferring crucial project- management technologies, safety standards, and craftsmanship. However,unlike with manufacturing techniques, software and tacit knowledge dif- fuse gradually, and China needs to fill an entire missing generation of project managers and systems integrators. Although there is no dearth ofraw talent, moving along the learning curve might take time because inte-gration skills take a while to soak in and foreign firms are in no hurry toshare the tacit knowledge, which is the key to their competitiveness. Third, construction of a project must frequently be complemented by subsequent management of the complete structure for short or long peri- ods. That management calls for different sets of skills if the emphasis is onensuring quality of services, building customer relationships, acquiring areputation, and adopting a long-term business perspective. In any strong construction and real estate sector, there is a need for a number of major firms that serve as pacesetters and help to establish industrywide normsand standards to which other firms can adhere to a greater or lesser extent.Such firms have yet to emerge in Shanghai. 45 The fourth area is the state of financing for construction activities. Shanghai has mobilized huge sums for its infrastructure and housing development, and significant strides have been made in mortgage finance in less than a decade. But too much of the financing of long-lived projects is still sourced from banks, municipal budgets, or informal sources. Theintertwining of construction and finance is such that the two sectors needto evolve in step. Thus, the growth and sophistication of bond marketsand other term finance markets that support the construction sector will be part and parcel of the maturation of the construction industry. Thatdevelopment should be easily within Shanghai's reach. However, theexperiences of China's neighbors suggest that financial deepening, even ina globalizing world, is paced by institutional and cultural changes, whichare always gradual. Fifth, there is innovation abetted by research and development. Inno- vation covers the gamut of construction-related activities, from design But the salience of energy-, environment-, and IT-related issuesmeans that some of the most significant gains associated with long-livedand increasingly wired structures are going to accrue from innovations inthose areas. Advances in materials development and in the design of struc-tures and their effective assimilation by the industry promise continuingSCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 267 45. Raising quality standards and acquiring the capacity to assess risk are also areas in which the bigger firms could take a lead (Hoenig 2004).268 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES improvements in productivity, resource conservation, structural charac- teristics, quality, and project completion times. The older stock of housingand commercial space in China is notoriously energy inefficient. That fail- ing has been only partially remedied in newer structures. Energy losses remain huge, and over the lifetime of a building, they compound China'senergy burdens. Shanghai has the opportunity to take a lead in this area byinstituting more stringent design standards and codes, by backing themwith credible enforcement, by encouraging the use of new materials, and by giving developers incentives to incorporate technologies that usepassive methods of heating and cooling as well as renewable energysources, as long as these methods pass the test of cost-efficiency. With IT soaking into virtually every corner of urban life, especially in major cities such as Shanghai, the construction industry needs to take full advantage of the new avenues it opens and move quickly to establish stan- dards that permit widespread use across a variety of processes (Chun andothers 2004). Moreover, buildings and other structures must be designedto take full advantage, where appropriate, of new digital and telecommu-nications technologies. Because those technologies are bound to evolveand enlarge their potential to make structures \"smarter,\" current designsneed to be flexible enough to allow new wirings and sensors and equip-ment to be incorporated. As noted in chapter 5, anticipated advances inrobotics will gradually change the nature of urban spaces indoors and out-doors, making them more user friendly, interactive, amenity intensive, andsafer. In the race to develop, many of the structures being constructed inShanghai lack that flexibility and down the road may need to be expen-sively retrofitted or demolished and replaced. Such waste can be avoided,and structures can be designed from the onset to anticipate and accom- modate energy-saving, IT, and robotics features that will enhance theirutility and prolong their useful life. Throughout the industrial world and by slow degrees in China, IT through the Internet has begun making inroads into the trading of prod-ucts at the wholesale and retail levels. Thus, for certain products andservices, the bidding for contracts, invoicing, payment, and fulfillment ofcontracts can be done online. That operation of e-business and the settingup of marketing portals are delivering gains in efficiency that contribute tothe price competitiveness of markets while easing the entry of firms. Theconstruction industry is a natural candidate for e-business, and someprogress has been made in Europe and the United States, but relativelylittle in China thus far, even in areas such as project design and the pur-chase of materials. By taking a lead, firms in Shanghai could steal a marchover others.The scope of innovation in the construction sector is wide because so many different technological advances can be folded in. Thus, the smart building or the smart transportation system46or the safe environment rich in amenities will depend on research spanning many disciplines amongwhich materials, robotics, electronics, and IT would rank as the leading contenders. The link between research and the construction industry has yet to be explored and exploited in Shanghai. That link is rich in possibil-ities, and down the road it could ensure that Shanghai is able to field aclutch of new high-tech construction-related activities commandingglobal markets. Such advances may require a push from the authorities through the setting and progressive raising of standards and support forexperimental technologies. It will also depend on enduring alliancesamong developers, producers, and researchers to extend the frontiers oftechnology while keeping a close eye on the direction of the emergingwants of urban dwellers. In postindustrial cities, the quality and resilience of urban spaces and infrastructures in the context of a harsher physical environment will un-doubtedly determine a city's standing in the pecking order of global urbancenters. Shanghai's engineering and construction industries, allied withother industries in the city and in its dynamic neighborhood, could achieveremarkable outcomes. But there is much ground to be covered before thathighly appealing goal can be reached.SCULPTING THE URBAN SKYLINE 269 46. An efficient and sustainable transportation system will be essential to the livability and energy efficiency of a city. See Goldman and Gorham (2006) and T urton (2006).The electronics industry is the poster child for the new economy that around the turn of the 21st century promised the start ofanother technological epoch. The promise proved to be exagger- ated but not false. The growth of productivity, which had slack- ened during the 1980s, has accelerated in a number of industrial and industrializing countries. This acceleration has been spearheaded by theadoption of information technology (IT) by the retail, wholesale, andfinance industries; however, the manufacture of electronic products has provided a sizable share of the gains achieved. The allure of the new econ-omy has faded; that of electronics remains, and rightly so. The narrow definition of the subsector covers equipment and compo- nents; in 2004, this hardware accounted for US$730 billion in globalproduction, and exports of electronics were valued at US$1.1 trillion. Pro- duction and exports grew by 4.0 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, be- tween 2000 and 2004. East Asia's share in total electronics exports reached62 percent, with China alone responsible for 15 percent (Datamonitor2005g, 2006). 1Electronics hardware is the leading export, by far, of coun- tries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. In China, products in this category accounted for 35 percent of exports (US$208 billion) in 2004, but total production and trade is climbing rapidly, with foreign direct investment (FDI) continually shifting more production capacity toChinese cities (\"Quarterly Chronicle\" 2005). 2Asia's IT sector is projectedCHAPTER 9 GOLD IN SILICON 1. See also WTO T rade Statistics at http://www.wto.org. More than 87 percent of China's 2004 exports of \"new and high-technology products\" are produced by foreign-invested firms(\"China's Challenge\" 2005). 2.

These new electronics are being joined by an expanding range of multimedia applications and prod-ucts such as videogames (discussed in chapter 6). Thus, a broadening ofthe definition to recognize the protean and expanding nature of the in-dustry is clearly warranted. It is not at all surprising, in view of the salience of this industry and its technology intensity, that Beijing is seeking to become the prime mover of innovation and upstream development in China's electronics and ITindustries. The potential for technological advances in electronics and as-sociated IT, biotech, materials, and nanotech industries is vast. Beijing\u2014 along with other leading cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Jinan, Xian, and Shenyang\u2014is investing in a metropolitan inno-vation system that could maximize the high-value rewards from introduc-ing new products and services, while allowing mass production of com-modified products that are based on codified technologies to migrate toother cities. For Beijing, this system may be the only feasible objective. Afocus on labor- or land-intensive manufacturing would make little sense,because such manufacturing is a part of the value chain that will gravitateaway from urban areas, where wage costs and overhead are lower andwater plentiful. 4The exodus of light manufacturing from Beijing and Shanghai is already well advanced and, although it was initiated by the government, inevitable. By intensifying research and development (R&D), Beijing is pursuing a comparative advantage in innovation, which it hopes will induce multinational corporations (MNCs) to locate their re-gional research activities in the city, leading to many start-ups as well as tothe emergence of globally competitive national companies. Many cities in Asia are vying for similar roles. Only a small number will be successful on a scale that matters for a metropolitan economy where the population exceeds 5 million. The rest will have to be satisfied with, atbest, a few niches that generate modest revenues, little employment, andfew spillovers and that do not develop the networked and intersecting 3. These forecasts are based on a study by ICD reported in \"America T rails\" (2006). 4. Per capita water availability in China is 2,219 cubic meters, only one-fourth of the world average. The water stress is much more severe in northern China, where only 762 cubic metersof water are available per person (Yusuf and Nabeshima 2006a).274 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES clusters spanning multiple industries supported by providers of profes- sional services that have contributed to the growth of urban regions likeSilicon Valley and the Boston metro area. What are the odds in Beijing's favor, and how likely are the nascent sub- sectors being groomed by the government to flourish and contribute to a long-term growth spiral that is sustained by innovation? BEIJING'S SILICON CREDENTIALS Being China's capital city confers great advantages in the national context, because of the government's close involvement in directing industrialchange and building an innovation system that will steadily improve tech- nological capability. The Chinese approach closely approximates that of other East Asian economies, in almost all of which industrialization has ra-diated outward from the capital cities. Governments have been at consid-erable pains to showcase their industrial prowess by deepening capabilitiesfirst in the vicinity of the capital cities, by using the guiding hand of in- dustrial policies and the hidden hand of (managed) market forces. 5 Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, T aipei, and T okyo are among several notable examples. China, a relatively late entrant on the East Asian stage and a much larger country than its neighbors, focused industrial reforms initially on the distant southeastern corner of the country\u2014in the Pearl River Delta adja-cent to Hong Kong (China) 6\u2014to test their efficacy. Having determined that the mixed approach to modernizing industry was workable and not disruptive of the political economy, China has applied the new recipe widely, with special attention to Beijing, Shanghai, and a few other major cities. In this approach, Beijing should lead the modernization drive anddemonstrate China's gathering strength in key areas of technology, theglobal yardstick for economic competitiveness. Beijing is also the urbancrucible for displaying not only some of the most striking remnants of the old Chinese culture but also the evidence of a new cultural upwelling\u2014anupwelling that could help bolster China's claim to being a cultural pole as 5. The central government decided on Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, as the national production centers of IT products in 1986 (Wang and T ong 2005). 6. See Yusuf (2005) for a discussion of the factors responsible for the remarkable performance of the Pearl River Delta region since 1979.274 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESGOLD IN SILICON 275 well as an industrial one, in a world where \"soft power\" counts as much if not more than other kinds of power.7 The electronics and IT industry neatly supports Beijing's aspirations of becoming a technological powerhouse. It is an industry that has experi-enced widespread geographic (networked) dispersion following a process of standardization, modularization, vertical specialization, and outsourc- ing, the proliferation of highly specialized component producers, anddiversification into closely linked subfields (Ernst 2002). It is an industrywhose growth has been paced by the efficient elaboration of the interna-tional supply chain and by rapid advances in the capacity of key compo- nents and that has been greatly aided by the rising utility of IT equipment,from an expansion of the base of users, and the resulting networkingexternalities. An important characteristic of the industrial dynamic for Beijing is that dispersion is going hand in hand with the concentration of electronics pro- duction in a few specialized clusters, with such concentration being especially notable for the most innovative capital- and knowledge-intensivecomponents and software. Electronics and its spreading penumbra oflinked IT activities concentrate highly skilled \"symbolic workers\" and en-trepreneurs in the metropolitan area. Their presence can encourage newstart-ups while diffusing new technologies to other manufacturing andcreative industries and stimulating the cultural life of the city. A richerurban culture would give Beijing the glamour and buzz that cities such asNew York, San Francisco, and London have worked hard to cultivate. Ifthere is a mobile and discriminating creative class for whom the world isan oyster, as Florida (2002) persuasively argues, then the electronics in-dustry would be the start of an upward spiral for Beijing. The current baseof manufacturing and research could result in a constellation of creativeactivities, revolving around a core of \"anchor firms,\" universities and science parks. WHEN IT ALL BEGAN AND HOW Like much industrial development in China and East Asia during the past three decades, the recent proliferation of electronics and IT firms inBeijing was barely anticipated in the early 1990s. A few large, state-owned 7. See Nye (2004) on the concept of soft power and its significance in a globalized environment. Some observers contest whether China is on the road to acquiring such power.276 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES electronics enterprises producing radios, television sets, and other equip- ment were located in Beijing at the start of the 1980s. The first shoots ofa modern electronics industry only began appearing autonomously in the early 1980s, with an initial wave of firms focusing on the software for word processing and printing using Chinese characters. T wenty years ago, therewas little awareness of what it takes to create a high-tech cluster and whatthe implications of such an entity are for urban development. The tempo of activity began to acquire economic significance in the 1990s. By 1994, the number of IT firms had risen to 4,300. There were several reasons. First, during this period, China's industrial growth accel-erated sharply, led by investment and exports\u2014many produced by theconsumer electronics industry. As a consequence, the star of the electron-ics industry began burning brighter. Both domestic and foreign demand for Chinese products perked up. Second, signs that China's vast domestic market might be awakening and the increasing attractiveness of China asa platform for exports both enlarged the flow of FDI, especially into themanufacturing sector. The electronics industry, already a force in severalEast Asian economies, was viewed as one of the most promising candi-dates, and it began to attract foreign and local capital. Third, the start ofthe IT boom contributed to the enthusiasm for the electronics industryand encouraged the central government to redouble its support. Fourth,Silicon Valley was on everyone's mind. As one observer remarked, \"OnlySilicon Valley was not trying to become like Silicon Valley.\" Silicon Valleysymbolized the IT revolution, and every industrializing or industrial coun-try felt that a desirable economic future required a homegrown miracle insilicon. It soon became evident that silicon appeared to flourish best in asophisticated and attractive urban locale 8equipped with a few anchor firms with advanced industrial capability and amply furnished with elite univer- sities, which supply the human capital for the technology-intensive indus- tries that could become the source of commercially viable innovations (Agrawal and Cockburn 2003). Beijing, in the mid-1990s, lacked some ofthe physical and industrial attributes of a Silicon Valley, but it was endowedwith China's leading universities and rich in talent. The central govern-ment decided to leverage this talent pool and to grow silicon in Beijing's university belt. 8. However, Hsinchu Park near T aipei is atypical in this respect. It functions very much like an industrial estate. Despite its undoubted success as a high-technology center, the park has not at-tracted social amenities or contributed to the social infrastructure of its immediate surroundingsor to that of T aipei.GOLD IN SILICON 277 China's efforts to build an electronics industry commenced in the 1980s, but the emergence of the subsector in Beijing dates back to the mid-1970s (Sigurdson 2005). It all started with the demand for an elec- tronic publishing system in Chinese. In those days, printing was still done using lead typesetting, which required workers to select each Chinesecharacter manually from a shelf of thousands. Needless to say, this processwas\u2014and where it survives still is\u2014highly laborious. 9 The most advanced technology available at that time was a cathode ray tube (CRT)-based phototypesetting system, developed by the German company Hell. The basic principle was to generate the page layout on the screen of a high-resolution computer monitor, to photograph the onscreen image of the page layout, and then to develop the film for offsetprinting. The font used to generate the onscreen page layout was stored inthe computer memory in dot-matrix format. This process works well foralphabetic languages with a small number of characters, but the technol- ogy was stretched to the limit in China because each font required 7,000Chinese characters. For professional printing, at least four fonts wererequired, quadrupling the storage requirement in the computer memoryto 20 megabytes. Although this requirement seems negligible today, theinternal memory of a minicomputer 30 years ago was only 64 kilobytes. Use of other storage devices such as hard drives was rendered impractical by their slow speed and limited storage capacity (Lazonick 2004; Lu andLazonick 2001). 10 A junior professor at Beijing University, Wang Xuan, came up with the idea to compress the Chinese characters by relying on their contours and to reproduce the entire character rather than storing the dot-matrix image of the character. This innovation reduced the storage requirement by a factor of several hundred. Research to realize these ideas was approved in1976 and funded by Program No. 748, which also created the Institute ofComputer Science and T echnology at Beijing University and germinatedan enterprise called Founder (Lu and Lazonick 2001). Because of the com- plexity of the characters, Wang opted to develop a laser typesetter torecord the page layout directly on film (Lu and Lazonick 2001). 11 9. A similar procedure was used in Japan, and the desire to reduce this tedious drudgery provided the impetus for developing Japanese word processors. 10. The access time of a hard drive is still slow today, relative to that of a memory chip. The seek speed of a hard drive is measured in milliseconds; that of a memory chip is measured innanoseconds. 11. Such a laser-based system was not widely adopted in the West until 1986 (Lu and Lazonick 2001).278 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Once the technology was approved for commercial use, it was intro- duced to the news agencies (which were all state-run) with funding from the state, instantly giving rise to a large market. The key was the raster image processor embedded in a chip. The intellectual property related to this printing system resided with Beijing University; on the basis of it, theUniversity formally spun off the company called Founder in 1993. By1995, Founder had acquired a 75 percent share of the domestic Chineseelectronic publishing systems market. 12Founder's chip, introduced in 1995, displaced the international heavyweights Hell, Dainippon Screen, Scitex, and Crossfield from the Chinese market (Lazonick 2004). The success of Founder can be traced to the deliberate policy of the government to make technology development an integral part of post- graduate education. This policy was responsible for a number of innova-tions by the graduate students of Beijing University's Institute ofComputer Science and T echnology and for the progressive deepening of the innovation system in Beijing, as well as in other metropolitan areas(Lazonick 2004). Three other well-known Chinese computer firms that emerged in the 1980s\u2014Stone, Lenovo, and Great Wall\u2014share a similar university-basedlineage. Stone was founded in 1984 by alumni of T singhua University in Haidian district as a collectively owned enterprise. 13Stone's first product was a low-cost electronic printer capable of outputting Chinese characters, a task that previously only an imported and expensive T oshiba printer could perform. Stone also reverse-engineered and modified the printers manufactured by Brothers so that they could output Chinese characters.The reengineering was done by two scientists at the Computing Center ofthe Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) who were moonlighting for Stone.Because Stone was the sole distributor of the machine, it quickly captured the market. Buoyed by the success of its printers, Stone entered the word-processing market, initially in collaboration with Japanese firms. The 12. At that time, foreign computer companies had not yet mastered the problem of Chinese- language word processing. Because the Japanese script shares a number of Chinese characters,Japanese firms would likely have been able to do so in a few years (Lazonick 2004). But Chinesefirms seized the opportunities to enter the market and establish a highly recognizable interna-tional brand. 13. These founders used to work for government research labs (such as the Chinese Academy of Science) and institutes, as well as in state-owned computer enterprises. They quit their positionsto establish Stone, but it was formally owned by Evergreen township, which provided the seedmoney of Y 20,000 (to be paid back in one year) along with free office space equipped with aphone (Lazonick 2004).GOLD IN SILICON 279 trading company Mitsui was responsible for the design and manufacture of the hardware (although actual manufacturing was outsourced to acontract manufacturer, Alps Electronics of Japan); Stone was responsible for the software development only. 14Subsequently, Stone entered the elec- tronic cash register market just when the value added tax was introduced, which immediately produced a spike in the demand for such machines (Lazonick 2004). The second firm, now known globally as Lenovo, was originally called the New T echnology Development Company of the Research Institute of Computing T echnology of the CAS. It was established in 1984, initiallyto check and maintain the institute's imported IBM computers and to train the staff. Chuanzhi Liu and the 11 founding members were CASemployees and they remained so (Chen and Kenney 2005; Sigurdson2005). 15 The company's first major success was the production and servicing of a computer add-on card (the Hancard) to give an ordinary personal com- puter (PC) Chinese word-processing capability (Sigurdson 2005). The company also sold motherboards and other computer-related items and established relationships with Motorola and T exas Instruments. Its prod-ucts were sold under the Legend brand, which is what the company wascalled until recently. It entered the PC business as a sole distributor ofAcer computers with Legend's own Chinese word-processor add-on cards. This position gave Legend a foothold in PC distribution, and in 1988, itdecided to enter its own brand into the PC market through a joint venturewith a Hong Kong firm that had ample financial resources and interna-tional legal expertise. Sales of the Legend computer, introduced in 1990,expanded quickly, backed by highly effective nationwide distribution and service centers throughout China. Legend sold only 2,000 PCs in 1990; by 1995, sales had risen to 100,000. With the proceeds, Legend focused onR&D to strengthen competitiveness with R&D centers in Beijing, HongKong (China), Shenzhen, and Silicon Valley. Legend's subsequent successcan be traced to the skillful integration of hardware and efficient services.With the creation of the Legend Chinese Word-Processing System Users'Association, the company turned its users into advocates for its products 14. Later, Stone entered a joint venture with Mitsui to develop the next generation of Chinese word processors. Through this joint venture, Stone was able to send its managers and techni-cians to be trained in Japan (Lazonick 2004). 15. The CAS also provided the seed money of Y 200,000, along with the offices and research fa- cilities (Lazonick 2004).280 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES and valuable sources of feedback for further product development (Lazonick 2004).16 Unlike Stone and Lenovo, Great Wall was state owned and state run. From the outset, the other two had broad managerial autonomy, eventhough they were officially characterized as collectively owned enterprises. Not so at Great Wall. Initially, the enterprise tried to enter into a joint venture with IBM, but that attempt failed. However, during the negotia-tions with IBM Japan, Great Wall was able to gain an understanding ofIBM's structure and mode of operation. Even though IBM's productdevelopment was done in-house, production of actual hardware was out- sourced to several Japanese manufacturers; IBM retained control overmarketing and distribution. Great Wall emulated this business model and set up a subsidiary enter- prise in 1984 with a dozen or so engineers and technicians and seed moneyof Y 300,000 from the Computer Industry Association's R&D budget. About half the staff members were sent to Hong Kong to learn about high-resolution Chinese font display technology. The other half went toT okyo to work with IBM Japan on a Chinese word processor. A PC thatcould display Chinese fonts was introduced in 1985. Following the initialmarket success with a word processor and a PC, the Computer IndustryAssociation set up another company, Longxing Electronics. Longxingorganized production for Great Wall computers by outsourcing assemblyto 13 state-owned enterprises, which in turn sourced parts from 10second-tier suppliers. Longxing also set up a nationwide dealership, whichhad more than 100 stores by 1987. Initially this original equipment man-ufacturing arrangement worked well, but the sales of Great Wall PCsslowed significantly in the late 1980s as a result of competition from Stone,Legend, and Founder. 16. The strength of Japanese electronics firms partly depends on the sophisticated user base in T okyo, which evaluates products and provides valuable feedback to manufacturers on theirviability (see chapters 1 and 5; Fujita and Hill 2005). Going one step further, firms can activelyengage with consumers in their quest for improvements and innovation. Recent examples of in-novations proposed by consumers include prototype telematics for BMW and various add-onscreated by users for computer games (\"Rise of the Creative Consumer\" 2005). Although the ac-tive involvement of consumers in product development is not new, the advances in IT and theavailability of user-friendly development tools (often provided by the manufacturers) havespurred these activities. Products based on such consumer innovation tend to be more success-ful than products developed in a traditional way (\"Rise of the Creative Consumer\" 2005). Three-fourths of traditional product development projects fail. By actively seeking creative consumersto generate ideas, to serve as lead users, and to help develop a community of other users, firmsare attempting to focus their research and reduce the cost of development (Franke and Shah2003; \"Rise of the Creative Consumer\" 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 281 In 1994, Great Wall entered into a joint venture agreement with IBM. By this time, IBM was willing to partner with Great Wall, having failed to penetrate the domestic Chinese market. IBM saw the arrangement as a way of producing and selling high-end computers in China (Lazonick 2004). Other firms that emerged during this period included a Chinese start- up, Stone Rich Sight Information T echnology Company, which waslaunched by Wang Zhidong and marketed Chinese-platform software compatible with the Windows environment and Zhongxin MicroElectronic Co., which produced the multimedia \"China Chip.\" (StoneRich merged with Sinanet.com in Silicon Valley in 1998 to formSINA.com, which became one of the most popular Chinese portal sites.)All of these firms succeeded because of the science and technology (S&T) talent and resources concentrated in Beijing. Without their links with the research institutes, the firms would have lacked the human resources, fi-nancial resources, incentives, and general office spaces to begin opera-tions. Equally important was the ability of the scientists and engineerswho started these firms to identify the latent consumer demand in theemerging computer industry: the ability to compose and output docu-ments in Chinese. By the mid-1980s, a few firms were springing up in the Zhongguancun area, a part of the Haidian district, on a stretch of road running fromBeijing University to No. 2 Zhongguancun Primary School. As the num-ber of enterprises grew from 11 in 1983 to 90 in 1985, the name ElectronicStreet gained currency. The small electronics shops and businessesattracted attention because such private entrepreneurial activity was stillrelatively rare in Beijing. Few saw them as anything more than an epiphe- nomenon, possibly transient. Still, some reformers sensed the potential offirms such as Founder and Stone and, in keeping with the spirit of thattime, were prepared to experiment. Hence, the central government cre-ated the Zhongguancun Park in 1988, adjacent to the key universities andresearch centers\u2014the first of many steps, including the nationwide T orchProgram, to bring high-tech industry to Beijing. 17 17. Funds from the T orch Program were used to support start-ups and larger enterprises in- cluding Stone, Lenovo, and Founder. Although the exact effect of the loans is hard to assess, be-ing selected to receive funds from T orch Program acted as a seal of approval, enabling firms tosecure funding from other sources (Segal 2003; Sigurdson 2005). A description of the severalmajor research programs launched by the government, such as the \"863\" and \"973\" programs,can be found in Sigurdson (2005).282 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES ELECTRONIC ZHONGGUANCUN Zhongguancun is close to leading universities such as Beijing University, the People's University, and T singhua University. In all, there are 58universities in the area, which together graduated more than one-third of China's college students annually (Hamaguchi and Kameyama 2005). Zhongguancun parks: Haidian Park, Fengtai Park, Changping Park, Dianzi City, Yizhuang Park, Desheng Park, and Jianxiang Park, each of which has itsown special function and mix of industries (see table 9.1). The total planned area of the zone is close to 3 million square kilometers, and in2005, the industry in ZGC accounted for one-sixth of Beijing's GDP(Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform 2006; Xiaand others 2004). The majority of the parks are located right in and aroundthe four corners of the fourth-ring road. Future development will focus on building two arms stretching out to the northeast (Changping district and Yanqing county) and northwest (Shunyi district, Huairou district, andMiyun county) (Beijing Municipal Commission of Economics 2005). The Yizhuang Park, also known as Beijing Economic-T echnological Development Area, is the manufacturing base of Beijing and home toseveral MNCs, including Nokia, Foxconn, and SMC, and to many leadingdomestic high-tech firms, such as China Aviation, BOE T echnologyGroup Co., and Jin Changke (Beijing Municipal Commission of Devel-opment and Reform 2006). The emphasis is on telecommunications,liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, and integrated circuits (ICs). 18 Nokia and other leading firms in mobile phone business have invested US$1.2 billion since 2001 in the Esoteric Mobile Architecture Plan to build a mobile phone industrial park, which now holds more than 20 cell phone firms (Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform 2006). In addition, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corpora-tion, a Shanghai-based leading semiconductor foundry in China, plans toinvest US$3 billion in two 12-inch IC production lines (Beijing MunicipalCommission of Development and Reform 2006). Other major firms include the BOE T echnology Group, the largest domestic and the ninth-ranked global thin film transistor LCD manufacturer. This firm acquiredthe core technology on thin film transistor LCD through the producer,Hynix, a company from the Republic of Korea, for a fee amounting to 18. Silicon Valley owed its beginnings and early momentum to the fruitful nexus established be- tween large corporations such as Lockheed, Hewlett-Packard, and Varian and Stanford Univer-sity (S. Adams 2005; Lecuyer 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 283 US$80 million in 2003. Spearheaded by BOE's efforts on thin film tran- sistor LCD, the cumulative investment of the 16 firms in Yizhuang Parkreached US$800 million in 2005 (Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform 2006). 19Table 9.1 Industry Distribution in Parks within Zhongguancun Parks Industries Function highlights Haidian Park Telecommunication, biotech, High-tech, research and optical, mechanical and development intensive electronic integration, and functions; close to new materials industries universities and the CAS Fengtai Park Optical, mechanical and High-tech manufacture electronic integration, functionsbiomedicine, and advancedmanufacture industries Changping Park New medicine, biotech, Biotech manufacture environmental protection, functionstelecommunication, newmaterials, and advancedmanufacture industries Dianzi City Telecommunication, computer New technology and software, computer monitor, high-tech products color display tube, and digital manufacture functions;audio and video industries reformed from the old industry base Yizhuang Park Optical, mechanical and External economy; electronic integration, and technology-intensivebiomedicine industries manufacture functions; national economic technology developmentdistrict Desheng Park High-tech distribution services, Upscale, national, well-known high-tech incubator industry, high-tech companies and and high-quality technology initial public offering and industry development companies' research center, services sales center, and business center Jianxiang Park Technology exhibition, human International technology resources, conferences, communication, networking,marketing, information business services, andconsulting services extended component-based development functions Source: Xia and others 2004. 19. The so-called fifth-generation technology that BOE bought is outdated, and the firm's current performance and capacity to upgrade is uncertain.284 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES The individual parks are further subdivided by specialties ranging from the life sciences to agriculture to nanotechnology (see table 9.1). Elec- tronics is prominent across several of the parks, but it rubs shoulders with other industries. In fact, one of the most important characteristics of Zhongguancun that could buttress its long-run success is the diversity ofhigh-tech industries being groomed by the government and the presencein their midst of major anchor firms such as Lenovo, Microsoft, andNokia. One lesson that the authorities have drawn from international experi- ence is the cross-disciplinary nature of many innovations, such as the widening contribution of electronics to numerous subsectors, rangingfrom transportation to health. Hence, it can be a great advantage forproducers of electronic products to be next door to firms engaged in developing new materials that can be incorporated into electronic compo- nents; to producers of software, which can add value to electronic itemsthrough embedded or application software; to biotech firms, which useelectronic chips for a host of purposes and contribute to the advance ofinformation technology as well; and to suppliers of producer services,which are major users of electronic hardware as well as application-specificsoftware. Now that the multifaceted nature of a dynamic electronics industry is more fully perceived than was the case in the 1980s, the planners in Beijingare aiming for an assortment of clusters that derive an innovativefocus from electronics and IT. The point to remember about the elec-tronics industry taking shape in Beijing is that, much like biotechnology inSingapore and moviemaking in Seoul, the industry is largely a creature ofthe central government's industrial policy, as is the Zhongguancun Park. Its fortunes for the time being are wholly tied to a generous regime ofindustrial incentives, the government's innovation policy, and the effortsunder way to \"fix\" the industry in the Beijing metropolitan area by pro-moting cultural as well as recreational amenities. The demonstration effect of the tiny number of pioneering enterprises that started in Zhongguancun 20 years ago attracted a wave of newcomers,whose numbers exceeded 12,000 firms by 2003, employing 48,000workers. The overwhelming majority of firms are relatively small, with anaverage of fewer than 10 employees. The large firms, such as Founder,Great Wall, and Lenovo, now being joined by foreign MNCs such asNokia and IBM, are most directly responsible for the spillovers that havecontributed to the proliferation of firms and to Zhongguancun'sreputation within China and beyond. They are the equivalents of theHewlett-Packards, the Fairchilds, and the Lockheeds of Silicon Valley,GOLD IN SILICON 285 which provided the lion's share of employment for hundreds of start-ups. Large firms employing more than 500 workers account for 1 percent of thetotal number of firms but are responsible for 20 percent of the park's turnover. They are the ones that have achieved superior productivity, attained greater profitability, are more innovative on balance, and\u2014becauseof size as well as demonstrated performance\u2014have found it easier to mo-bilize resources to finance growth. The larger firms in Zhongguancun,much like similar firms in Europe, 20also work most closely on technolo- gies with university researchers and very possibly, as in Silicon Valley, will have a decisive influence on future technological capabilities. Zhongguancun's workforce has impressive academic credentials. Close to 38 percent of workers have a bachelor's degree, and almost 9 percent have a master's degree or a doctorate. Many, if not most, were trained inlocal universities and have either stayed on to work in local firms or, aftera stint at a foreign university, returned to seek their fortunes in Beijing. The chief executive of a start-up firm, which is typically private ( minban or minying kejiqiye ), usually has received postgraduate training overseas and may have had some work experience abroad as well. 21Such chief execu- tives are usually in their thirties.22They have returned to the country, often pulled by the generous terms offered by central and municipal authorities, to try to commercialize a research finding or a new licensed technology that is underpinned by a business model that passes muster with the Zhongguancun administration and is sufficiently attractive tomobilize the first round of financing. Zhongguancun Park offers the new start-up an impressive array of incentives and one-stop administrative and other approvals, which partly\u2014 perhaps largely\u2014explains the growth in output and the number of firms.The benefits include tax exemptions, preferential tax rates on corporateincome of 15 percent, and tax deductions for R&D expenditures; lowertariff rates on imports of machinery and intermediate inputs; grants to as-sist companies during the start-up stretch; low-interest bank financing; and assistance with raising money from securities markets at later stages (Segal 2003; Yusuf, Wang, and Nabeshima 2006). In fact, a significantpercentage of the grants under the \"863\" program have been awarded tofirms in the park (Sigurdson 2005). Park authorities provide space for 20. See Soete (2006) and Foray (2006) on the Netherlands and Switzerland, respectively. 21. From 1978 to 2003, the government estimates that 700,000 Chinese studied abroad (\"We've Got Solid Grounding\" 2005). 22. Examples are Zhonghan Deng, the founder of Zhongxin Micro Electronic Co.; Ziping Dong of Keya, a biotech firm; and Jian Zhou of Kesen T echnology, an information technology firm.286 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES promising start-ups in one of the incubators or commercial buildings, a form of assistance that is often critical for new businesses, and help withhousing as well as access to schooling for families coming back from over- seas. Park authorities, recognizing the weaknesses of many new and small enterprises, offer a measure of administrative support to smooth out themany bureaucratic obstacles that dot China's economic landscape. Theyare a source of information on legal, accounting, financial, consulting, andmarketing services. Although most firms do not have much difficulty find- ing staff from the rich pool of trained workers in the vicinity of the park\u2014another major attraction\u2014the administration can assist firms in findingappropriate human resources and, in some cases, managerial skills. Inthese respects, the park administration is beginning to fulfill some of thefunctions of venture capital and angel investors, who assist with manage- rial and technical advice and provide new firms with contacts that are often essential for gaining traction in the market. Innovative firms look for intellectual property protection and, to a degree, such protection is also becoming available. Since introducing suchlaws in the mid-1980s, China has, on paper at least, one of the betterintellectual property systems in the world. The cost of enforcementthrough the courts is a relatively modest US$50,000 to US$120,000, com-pared with US$500,000 in the United Kingdom. One sign of the increas-ing robustness of the system is that domestic patent applications areincreasing by 25 to 40 percent; Chinese universities are already taking outas many as 6,000 local patents per year (\"Chinese Poised to Outstrip\"2005). However, the level of distrust among firms and the level of discon-tent with intellectual property protection remain high, indicating thatthere is plenty of room for improving patent rights. The distrust impedes networking, one of the central characteristics of a dynamic cluster. In current circumstances, smaller firms in particular have extremely limited options if their intellectual property is stolen. In fact,rampant piracy is the bane of IT development in China and a problem thatis still a long way from being deterred and contained by the legal system,a point we return to below. 23As Judson (2005) observes, a respect for intellectual property has yet to germinate, copyright and trademark pro- tection is almost nonexistent, and plagiarism in the sciences is rampant. 23. China adopted modern intellectual property law in 1898 at the end of the Qing dynasty. The law was modeled after those of other industrial countries at that time. However, enforcementwas weak (Wang and T ong 2005). A T rademark Law was adopted in 1982, a Patent Law in 1984,and a Copyright Law in 1990. Those laws have been amended and updated (Walsh 2003).GOLD IN SILICON 287 Piracy is also a problem for the MNCs, which often complain about the lack of intellectual property protection in China. A number of high-profilecases have highlighted the problem. In one survey conducted in 2000, 26 percent of domestic software firms identified piracy as the major obstacle to the development of the industry (Segal 2003). Indeed, businesssoftware piracy rates are higher only in Vietnam (table 9.2). CONSTRUCTING A METROPOLITAN-SCALE INNOVATIVE SYSTEM By 2000, these incentives, strongly reinforced by the \"973\" program and broader efforts by the state to develop China's innovation system and catchup with advanced countries, were producing results. Most of the budget for S&T was spent in just a few urban centers\u2014one-fourth of the total public spending and 30 percent of China's aggregate R&D spending for2000 being allocated to Beijing. By 2004, outlay on S&T in Beijing hadrisen to Y 51 billion from Y 23 billion in 2000, and R&D expenditure hadincreased from Y 13 billion to Y 30 billion (see table 9.3). The more thanTable 9.2 Business Software Piracy Rates by Economy, 2000 Economy Rate (%) Vietnam 97 China 92 Indonesia 88Russian Federation 87Bolivia 81Thailand Source: Saxenian 2003.288 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 370 research institutes in Beijing spent one-third of all the resources allocated to R&D by such entities, and one-fifth of the R&D funding foruniversities flowed to Beijing. 24Out of this funding, as table 9.4 shows, more than 11 percent was devoted to basic research, close to 28 percent toapplied research, and more than 61 percent to technology development, in line with the emphasis on making knowledge usable ( Judson 2005). As a result, Beijing-based institutions were responsible for between 17 percentand 21 percent of all patents issued during 1995 to 2000 and received one-fifth of the revenues for contractual research. This share was more thantwice that for second-ranked Liaoning and more than three times that of Shanghai. As table 9.5 shows, Beijing also generated more than twice asmany patents as Liaoning during 1995-2000 and more than three times asmany as Shanghai. During the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95), the Beijing Municipal government disbursed US$1.3 billion for technology develop- ment. Most of this went to independent research institutes rather than to large and medium-size state-owned enterprises. The Ninth Five-YearPlan (1996-2000) doubled the technology budget (Segal 2003). Themunicipal government was not the only entity investing in technology de-velopment. Firms in Zhongguancun on average plowed 8 percent of theirincome into R&D in 2000 (Segal 2003), far in excess of the 1 percentinvested by the average IT firm in China (\"China's Challenge\" 2005). 25Table 9.3 Research and Development Spending in Beijing, 1999-2004 Science and Research and Research and technology development Technology development expenditure expenditure contract value Year personnel (Y billion) (Y billion) (Y billion) 1999 240,000 23.0 10.6 9.2 2000 240,000 23.0 13.9 14.0 2001 42.5 Source: Chen and Kenney 2005. 24. The government funded 71 percent of the research by institutes in 2003, compared with 53 per- cent in 1991\u2014a fivefold increase in the volume of resources committed. 25. Some firms, of course, spend more. For instance, ZTE and Huawei spend 10 percent or more on R&D (\"China's Challenge\" 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 289 The Beijing government also established technology funds available to promising start-ups, totaling US$120 million in 2001. By 2002, the universities associated with Zhongguancun had more than 26,000 employees engaged in S&T activities, yielding close to half of all scientific publications from the metropolitan region and 36 percent of thepatents. In 2000, universities were actively engaged with firms in morethan 1,500 collaborative research projects and in almost 800 technologyservices contracts. The leading universities were also achieving some success in launching start-ups through their incubators and scienceparks. T singhua University, China's leading technical institution, wasmanaging, through its holding company, 39 technology-based spinoffs in2003, including T singhua T ongfang, one of China's largest producersof consumer electronics, and an equal number of companies offering a range of services. T singhua Holding's turnover in 2005 was Y 25 billion (US$3 billion). Beijing University, meanwhile, was equally successful ingenerating resources from spinoffs.

It should be noted, though, that some of these enterprises are nothigh-tech operations and were created to find employment for university employees who could not be laid off. Recently, T singhua University set up a four-person office solely to negotiate projects with overseas R&D part-ners such as General Electric, Lucent, Alcatel, and BP . Foreign firms typ-ically provide equipment and research dollars in research collaborations,and professors and students may work for several years on a dedicated project.

This progresscould yield substantial long-term dividends if innovation flowers and becomes perennial. The importance of R&D can be seen from the experience in T aiwan (China). Both the IC industry and the PC industry were created by the government, with the state-owned Industrial T echnology Research Insti-tute laying the technological foundations, especially for the IC industry. Initially the IC foundry industry did not spend much on R&D (5 percentof sales between 1993 and 1997, when other firms were spending close to15 percent). T o compensate for the paucity of local R&D funding, T aiwan(China) sought support from foreign firms, in particular IBM. These firmsplayed a key role in helping local IC producers move from the 6-inch wafer to the 8-inch wafer. However, firms in T aiwan (China) have steadily increased their spending on R&D and personnel, and they were able to in-troduce 12-inch wafer production through their own research efforts(Fuller 2005). The rise of the foundry industry in T aiwan (China) also prompted the development of fabless design companies such as VIA, which focus purelyon the design of the ICs and let foundries do the actual manufacturingprocesses. Some of those design firms are now the world leaders in codecchips for optical drives, Ethernet, and motherboard chipsets (Fuller 2005).The IC industry has steadily invested and upgraded its R&D operations, asis evident in the number of U.S. patents awarded to firms in T aiwan (China).These patents are predominantly granted to IC firms (Fuller 2005). Cross-country research uncovers a robust relationship between R&D spending and patenting, innovation, and productivity gains. 27The early findings from Beijing are consistent with experience elsewhere, but it is too early to say that electronics and IT can thrive once the hothouses pro- vided by the state in Beijing are dismantled, as eventually they must be. In fact, some data for Zhongguancun through 2003 belie the statistics onpatents and the evidence on R&D activities. In three major product cate-gories, only 4 percent of the production is exported, which suggests thatthe innovativeness or competitiveness of the products is limited in the global market. Furthermore, parkwide data show that foreign-investedenterprises constitute less than 3 percent of the total pool of enterprisesbut account for 80 percent of industrial output and half of total assets. 27. For a review of this evidence, see Mohne, Mairesse, and Dagenais (2006) and Wieser (2005).292 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES In effect, although a large number of start-ups are supported by gener- ous incentives, much of the turnover of the Zhongguancun Park comes from a few foreign firms that have been attracted by the incentives and the abundance of skills.28They and a few Chinese firms, such as Founder, Daheng,29and Lenovo, form the backbone of the park. Although these firms are engaged in research and customization of electronics and IT products for the Chinese market, neither the local nor the foreign- invested firms are conducting research at the frontiers of their fields. By and large, most firms are adapting and developing products for thedomestic market. The pure research quotient is low, as is the level of tech-nology. Some of the most successful IT firms are concentrating on multi-media, emphasizing innovation and marketing, which will generate quick returns. The new entrepreneurs are young and ambitious, but they arenot equipped to push the frontiers of technology, and the local market isnot ready either. Although the number of firms in the Zhongguancun Park is large, the evidence of clustering and networking that would multiply links and enhance coordination of research and partnerships among firms is fairly thin. Surveys find that firms come to Zhongguancun to benefit from theincentives and to tap the labor pool, but they have established few links,and there is minimal interfirm networking associated with synergy in clus-ters (Lawlor and others 2002). The problem of mistrust we referred toabove poses an additional hurdle. The anchor firms have not yet begun toprovide technological leadership. Having acquired IBM's PC business,Lenovo is now attempting to strengthen the ThinkPad brand image, addnew design features to its product range, broaden the coverage of marketsegments, and deepen its penetration into markets such as India's. Butlittle of the research and production undergirding this strategy is done inBeijing. As the Haidian district at the core of the park has becomeprosperous, developers have put up expensive buildings, and rental costshave risen. Many firms are having to move farther out, with the result that the geographic contiguity of the electronics and IT businesses, theirproximity to universities, and the colocation of manufacturing with R&D 28. Close to 90 percent of high-tech exports of China come from export processing activities\u2014 mainly assembling imported materials with rather low local value added (Wang and T ong 2005).Overall 62 percent of all Chinese patents registered with the U.S. Patent and T rademark Officeare held by foreign-owned enterprises or by joint ventures (Wong 2006b). 29. Daheng's main products include mechanical computer-aided design and system integration, laser processing devices, television network broadcasting equipment, and semiconductor com-ponents. Its revenue was Y 3 billion in 2004, with an R&D budget of Y 159 million (\"China'sT op 100\" 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 293 activities are being compromised by the realities of extremely rapid urban development and skyrocketing real estate values. The same problem isseen in other cities: rising rental costs and desire to convert urban land to other uses first drive out manufacturing but then can also push out the creative industries, as happened in New York with multimedia firms. Even with the financial support that the park administration offers to selected start-ups, most of these firms fairly quickly face cash flow issues,unless they can generate a revenue stream either from their principal prod- uct or services or from an interim offering. Although the 1985 DecisionConcerning the Reform of the Science and T echnology Management Sys-tem improved the access of high-tech firms to bank financing, in practicemuch of the lending goes to state-owned enterprises. This situation con-tinues to constrain the financing available to small and medium enterpris- es (SMEs) (Segal 2003; Yusuf and Nabeshima 2006b). In the absence of much mergers and acquisitions activity involving small firms or a buoyantinitial public offering market, if small firms are to survive they must de-velop relatively minor innovations that can be commercialized quickly. Stone, Lenovo, and Founder were able to do so initially by being the first firms to offer certain kinds of software. Their incomes were alsosupplemented by distribution agreements with foreign producers of PCsand word processors. However, as the import quotas were lifted on com-puters, distribution agreements did not generate much-needed cash flow,and competitive pressures exacerbated the problem. Founder remains thesecond-ranked PC producer in China, and it has diversified into ICs andcircuit boards, but the company has also entered completely unrelatedfields, such as steel, medical products, chemical engineering, and realestate (\"Diversity and Design\" 2005). Stone also has entered the real estate and cement businesses and has even started producing chocolate snackpies (Segal 2003). The strategies pursued by the leading Chinese elec-tronics firms point to the intensity of competition in electronics, but theyalso suggest that the region's innovation capability remains fairly limited.Though Beijing might be plowing a lot of resources into R&D with acorresponding sharp increase in patent applications and in published arti-cles, the results might take years to materialize. AN ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAPITAL? These are relatively early days for the electronics and IT industry in Beijing, and it is too soon to offer firm views on the efficacy of policy ini-tiatives and whether they will lead to the jelling of a dynamic local294 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES innovation system. For the sake of electronics and IT development, the Chinese government is requiring companies that produce and marketequipment in China (for example, Alcatel, Siemens, Nokia, and NEC ) to transfer technology to local partners. This approach borrows from the past practices of Japan and the Republic of Korea. It involves plowingpublic funds into R&D by research institutes and universities and encour-aging R&D by state enterprises. It is supported by efforts to make intel-lectual property rights more accessible, cheaper to maintain, and legally easier to enforce, something that among the East Asian countries onlyJapan, Singapore, and now Korea convincingly offer. The government isattempting to create domestic standards for mobile technology\u2014the TD-SCDMA (Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access)standard along with standards for video compact discs (VCDs), digital versatile discs (DVDs), and high-definition television (HDTV)\u2014by lever- aging the potential of China's huge market. This effort takes a page fromthe experience of Nokia, for example. The government is also groomingnational champions equivalent to Samsung and the big Japanesecompanies\u2014or to Nokia\u2014which could become global technological andmanufacturing powerhouses (see Linden 2003, 2004). Some encouraging results are already apparent. The trend in spending on R&D nationwide and especially in Beijing is upward, and that expand-ing volume of resources is a necessary condition for achieving innovative-ness. In 2004, China allocated 1.3 percent of GDP to R&D. 30This share is projected to reach 2.0 percent of a much larger national product in 2015.31If 30 percent of this amount continues to be spent in Beijing, the incentives to conduct research and to innovate and the means to commer-cialize new findings will be considerable. 32The funding would comple- ment the growing stock of S&T workers in the metropolitan area\u2014thelargest single labor market for technical skills in China and another neces- sary condition for a competitive electronics industry. Beijing has the 30. When this figure is scaled using purchasing power parities, China was classified by the Or- ganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as the country with the third largestspending on R&D in 2003. At the current pace, R&D spending in the European Union will risefrom 1.93 percent of GDP in 2003 to 2.2 percent in 2010. R&D spending in China is growingrapidly and will be on par with that in the European Union by 2010 (\"Chinese Poised to Out-strip\" 2005). 31. Beijing is the center of R&D activities in China, with 6 percent of GDP devoted to R&D (see chapter 3). 32. In 2000, total R&D spending in China was Y 63 billion, of which Y 21 billion was spent in Beijing and only Y 5 billion in Shanghai (Wang and T ong 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 295 additional advantage of attracting some of the best students from across China (Sigurdson 2005). Already more than 300,000 students graduatewith engineering degrees in China every year (\"China's Challenge\" 2005). In 1975, China produced almost no science and engineering doctorates. In 2003, there were 13,000 doctorates, about 70 percent of them in scienceand engineering (Freeman 2005). From 30,000 in 1980, the number ofscientists and technicians increased to 1.3 million by 2004 (\"Long March\"2005). 33 An increasing number of Chinese and foreign companies (more than 400 by 2004) are setting up research facilities in Beijing and some produc- tion units as well.34This trend is helping Beijing to develop strong capabilities, including IC design and system-on-a-chip design with assis-tance under the \"863\" program. Foundries and IC production units have been established by Beijing and T singhua Universities by SMIC, NEC- Shougang, Yangdong, and others (Sigurdson 2005). 35Nokia, for example, has a large telecommunications production and research facility at Xingwang Industrial Park in the Beijing Municipal Development Zone. One of Nokia's neighbors is GE Hangwei Medical Systems, which started a joint venture in 1991 and in 2003 opened a 60,000-square-meter facilityfor designing, engineering, and producing medical imaging equipment. In2003, Microsoft established the Advanced T echnology Center in theHaidian district, on the same floor as Microsoft Research Asia, which opened in 1998. The purpose of the center is to transfer the technologydeveloped at the Beijing research center to product development fasterthan in the past. Started with only 20 staff members, the center now hasmore than 200, recruited from all over China. Some technology devel-oped in Beijing, such as video editing, has been incorporated in standard 33. Building basic infrastructure, health care, social security systems, and better schooling is likely to occupy many of China's best brains for years (\"China's Hi-T ech Success\" 2005). 34. Foreign R&D centers in China numbered 750 at the end of 2004 and employed 500,000 people (\"Long March\" 2005). According to McKinsey, only 10 percent of Chinese graduates aregood enough to work for MNCs (\"China's Hi-T ech Success\" 2005). Although many MNCs rec-ognize the quality of Chinese graduates, they find that creative thinking is not yet a strength.The graduates are good at solving closed-ended questions but not open-ended ones. MNCs'R&D labs urge staff members to ask questions about the whys and hows of research to stimulatemore creative thinking. The response in China is still weak (\"We've Got Solid Grounding\"2005). 35. A major new Chinese company, LHWT, was established in 2000 by seven Chinese nationals who studied in Japan. LHWT is making headway in the design and development of latent se-mantic indexing technologies. One-fifth of China's 500 software design houses were located inBeijing in 2004 (Sigurdson 2005).296 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Microsoft software distributed worldwide. Eventually the center will han- dle technologies developed elsewhere, making Beijing an important linkin Microsoft's innovation strategy (\"Microsoft: Getting from 'R' to 'D' \" 2005). These experienced outsiders, the lynchpins of global electronics and IT value chains, play an important role in raising the quality and productivity of research by pulling local research in specific fields closer to the frontier,bringing leading foreign researchers to Beijing, placing experienced research managers in charge of local research centers, linking researchersin the metropolitan area more closely with labs around the world, andproviding local producers with points of entry into global markets.Greater openness and heterogeneity would enhance the innovativeness ofelectronics and the scope for fruitful intertwining of technologies from different fields\u2014for instance, electronics and biotechnology. Current measures that improve the physical and cultural ambience of Beijing, reverse the worsening traffic congestion, and broaden the options for recreation reinforce the government's efforts to make Beijing a cre-ative city. 36A city richer in amenities and in the quality of social services\u2014 one that offered a more attractive environment, to boot\u2014could pull in the regional headquarters of MNCs seeking a base in China. It is also possible that China\u2014specifically Beijing\u2014could benefit from the bandwagon effect. Should key research communities come to view Beijing as one of the meccas for their disciplines, the circulation of nationaland international talent through Beijing will accelerate. 37The likelihood of this possibility occurring increases if spending on R&D or government in- centives weakens in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment countries or if economic prospects in Europe and Japan remain tepid, thereby inducing talented people to look for brighter lights.38 In East Asia, but not in other parts of the world, the determined pursuit of industrial policy objectives (those that initially appeared misjudged, such as the development of the steel, shipbuilding, auto, petrochemical, and dynamic random access memory industries in Korea) over many years 36. Some of these measures are the direct outcome of Beijing's selection as the site for the 2008 Olympics. 37. Beijing is seen as an attractive place for R&D operations. For instance, Hon Hai of T aiwan (China) set up an R&D lab in Beijing even before setting up one in T aipei (Fuller 2005). 38. An outflow of S&T workers from Europe to the United States has been going on for some time. Although a redirection of the stream to China in the near future is highly unlikely, over thelonger term it is not inconceivable.GOLD IN SILICON 297 has frequently yielded some striking successes. Who would have thought that China would be the second largest producer of electronic and ITproducts today and the biggest exporter? Who would have thought that Beijing, Chengdu, Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Suzhou would so quickly achieve manufacturing capability in a broadswath of electronics products and come to be viewed as having the poten-tial to join the leading centers of research? Much of this has happenedbecause of the (in some quarters) unanticipated outcome of industrial openings that emerged in the 1990s, reinforced by central and localindustrial policies and now by innovation policies. A vision that encompasses centers of economic excellence that conduct cutting-edge R&D, the growth of IT and biotech-related services and ofprototype or small-scale manufacture of high-value items, and the expan- sion of affiliated business services is certainly consonant with China's re- cent trajectory and Beijing's place in China's metropolitan pantheon. Thisvision is also consonant with the impending departure of the remainingtraditional manufacturing industries (with the encouragement of thegovernment) and the push exerted by rising labor costs and stiff environ-mental regulations. But a number of imponderables relate to the urban environment in gen- eral and the electronics industry in particular. Beijing's innovativeness\u2014for that matter, the innovativeness of any Chinese city\u2014ultimatelydepends on its openness to ideas and to knowledge workers from aroundthe world. It depends, as Judson (2005) noted, on successful implantationof the ethos of science and the willingness to pursue basic science withoutgetting fixated on the desire for quick technological findings. It will be in-fluenced by the business friendliness of the regulatory regime and by whether it creates an environment that promotes a technological spiralthrough the entry and growth of electronics firms and the swift exits ofunsuccessful ones. 39It is likely to be intertwined with the growth of the metropolitan economy, itself a function of population and other changes in the metropolitan area, as well as in the hinterland. The area is faced with intensifying water shortages and problems of desertification, which might be ameliorated only in part by the South-North water transferscheme, which will bring Yangtze River water to the Beijing area. 39. Close to 50 percent of the start-ups in Silicon Valley did not survive (Zhang 2003). The fail- ure of firms is already tolerated in Beijing, especially if they are not governmental firms. Thesuccessful computer firms (Lenovo, Founder, and Stone) are aware of this attitude of the localgovernment (Segal 2003).298 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES Beijing faces competition from other cities that are advantageously located in lower latitudes and on or close to the coastline. Cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai also have relatively abundant sup- plies of skilled workers and are strengthening their university and research infrastructure. They offer cultural amenities that are at least equal, if not su-perior, to Beijing's, and unlike the capital city, they have been more ready topromote openness. Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and their surround-ing cities have resources and are attracting enough foreign investment in their innovation systems to match the resources poured into Beijing's S&Tinfrastructure by the central government. Beijing could still emerge asChina's leading center of innovation in electronics, IT, and affiliated disci-plines. But it could be eclipsed by one of the cities of the south. These factors qualify Beijing's prospects, but in the Chinese context, its chances of becoming a bastion of high-tech development are at leastcomparable with those of other contenders. The presence of the centralgovernment and leading research institutes partially counterbalances thedisadvantages of a weaker hinterland. Arguably, the more troubling ques-tions arise from the dynamics of the electronics industry and its potentialfor generating innovations with as well as from Beijing's emergingtechnological capability. Several aspects of the electronics industry deserve attention because they have a bearing on its future geography. Electronics is in the grip offurious technological change, with product life cycles that are measured inmonths (Agarwal and Gort 2001). 40It is an intensely competitive industry because modularization and the speed of codification have resulted in a high degree of contestability.41The result is that project margins are thin and successful firms depend not only on their innovativeness but equally 40. Within a matter of four years, the semiconductor industry has moved from circuits of 130 nanometers to circuits of 65 nanometers and is now setting its sights on circuits of less than30 nanometers (\"IBM Set to Unveil\" 2006). 41. Many Chinese firms, especially the visible ones, are expanding rapidly into the global market. Lenovo, ZTE, and BOE, all makers of thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays, have expressedthe need to go abroad to survive in this fiercely competitive market (\"Starting a Walk\" 2005). Forthis reason, among others, local technologies such as the Wired Authentication and Privacy In-frastructure (WAPI) standard, TD-SCDMA standard, and the enhanced versatile disc (EVD)have been received with little enthusiasm even by domestic firms, which doubt whether thesestandards will be adopted by international bodies (\"Home-Grown Standard\" 2005; \"TicklishIssue\" 2005). Such skepticism is warranted from past failure to push domestic standards againstemerging global ones. Japan and Korea tried to create their own versions of PCs without usingIntel's central processing unit and Microsoft's operating system but without much success. Theywere never able to gain significant market share domestically, let alone globally (Fuller 2005).GOLD IN SILICON 299 on the scale of their production and their willingness to invest in capital- intensive facilities, on the efficiency of their logistics, and on marketing aswell as services, which can be bundled with products. 42So intense is the pressure on all participants to meet the most exacting standards ofproduction efficiency, quality, and delivery that an industry leader such as Dell has to worry about the fraction of a minute\u2014in the four minutes needed to assemble a PC in 2005\u2014that is required to attach the \"Intelinside\" sticker (\"Critical Mass\" 2005). The latest silicon foundries formaking semiconductors with circuits 65 nanometers in diameter entail aninvestment of US$5 billion. T exas Instruments and IBM have unveiled even costlier technologies, which will reduce circuit diameters by one-third to one-half. Although this example is extreme, modern electronicsfactories are becoming increasingly pricey (\"IBM Set to Unveil\" 2006). In these circumstances, one trend that stands out is consolidation. This trend has greatly concentrated the share of the leading 8 to10 firms in key products and services such as hard disk drives, motherboards, and application-specific software. Consolidation of certain production activi-ties has gone hand in hand with a greater readiness to outsource specificcomponents, software, and services to specialists and to constantly shopfor suppliers that offer the best package of attributes. The offshoot of this process of consolidation and outsourcing in conjunction with the technological characteristics of the industry is thatelectronics and IT production is dispersed and constantly in motion. Innot much more than 25 years, an industry centered mainly in a few partsof the United States has seen its center of gravity shift to Japan, Korea, andT aiwan (China) and more recently to China, India, Israel, and severalEuropean and Southeast Asian countries. Leading producers of hardware,such as Intel and Motorola, have plants scattered around the world, as dothe contract manufacturers such as Solectron, Flextronics, and Hon Hai Precision. Software producers and suppliers of IT services are even moredispersed. IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft have footholds in a half dozencountries. But so far, despite all this globalization of production and the wide distribution of IT products, the research that drives the industry\u2014thefabrication of the most high-value components and the design, integra-tion, and customizing of the core software\u2014has remained very highly 42. Software and services will account for 35 percent of Chinese technology spending in 2009, up from 26 percent in 2004. Such an increase can give local firms opportunities to enter the mar-ket, which is currently dominated by foreign firms (\"Open Source\" 2005).concentrated in a few cities in North America, Western Europe, Japan, and Israel, as well as, more recently, India, Korea, and T aiwan (China).The heartland of the electronics industry is in those very few cities. They are where the bulk of the research is done and where the results of scat- tered research from around the world are integrated into new products,whose production is then farmed out. The cities where the upstream workis done are no longer centers of manufacturing, although most retain someproduction facilities; however, they have specialized in R&D, software, design, and prototyping and in an array of profitable producer servicesthat are coextensive with the IT industry, such as multimedia, entertain-ment, and consulting. IBM earns more from consulting than it does fromthe sale of hardware. The cities that rank as global centers in the electronics and IT industry are also the ones with the world's leading research universities. Cities suchas Boston and San Francisco in the United States; T okyo in Japan;Cambridge, Stockholm, and Geneva in Europe; and T el Aviv in Israel de-rive handsome benefits from the IT industry because they are the brainsof the electronics industry and generate tens of thousands of highly paidjobs, mainly for knowledge workers. Is Beijing ready to compete? And can a top-down strategy underwritten by central government funding propel the city into the ranks of thefavored few? Our sense is that the strategy could work, but it might take adecade or more before it begins to show results. The key to success will beflexibility, in terms of both objectives and the means used to realize the ob-jectives. The electronics and IT industry is changing so fast that the targetis bound to shift. Maintaining forward momentum will require a flexibleresponse from industry and research establishments, with help from policy makers. Whether and how Chinese researchers participate in thedevelopment of new technologies to extend the applications of CMOS(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) silicon microprocessors andfind alternatives to silicon through biotechnology, the neurosciences, andnanotechnology might determine the course taken by the industry inBeijing (\"Silicon Down\" 2005). Urban and industrial policies have produced remarkable results in China against considerable odds, but autonomy granted (sometimes inad-vertently) to individual actors has had a large role as well, starting withagricultural reforms in the late 1970s. Policy can contribute a lot more tostrengthening the electronics industry in Beijing by deepening theresearch capabilities of universities, by enhancing the quality of the urbanenvironment, by promoting promising technologies such as digital media,by instituting telecommunications policies that assist the industry (as in300 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESGOLD IN SILICON 301 Scandinavia), by defining standards that coordinate and focus the efforts of local industry, and so on. Still, policy efforts alone may be insufficient. The corporate sector must also do its bit through ceaseless, incremental organizational innovation that complements advances in technologies. These organizational skillsare concentrated in the large MNCs, which is why the significant presenceand active involvement of such large organizations have become vital forthe electronics and IT industry. The MNCs bring together research and supporting services of a sufficient scale\u2014both their own and that ofassociated entities. They provide tested business models, and they havethe organizational wherewithal to manage complex operations across theworld. China, including Beijing, still lacks these corporate entities. Observing their emergence elsewhere in East and South Asia, it is far from obvioushow their development can be accelerated. Size is not enough. Organiza-tional capability and innovativeness are more important. Without thosecharacteristics, pouring money into R&D and physical infrastructure willhave a limited payoff in the short term. Continued over a decade or more,the returns could begin to climb. Beijing can afford to keep trying, and ithas time on its side\u2014we think.The economic future of cities hinges on the scale, mix, and com- petitiveness of their industries. Increasing prosperity demandsa steady expansion in jobs, with rising value added and the production of goods and services commanding ready national and international markets. Cities are not self-sufficient entities. They depend on a myriad of imports. Even a brief interruption in the flow can precipi-tate a crisis. All these imports must be paid for through exports or fiscaltransfers from higher levels of government, through remittances, and through direct investment. T emporary imbalances of the urban currentaccount can be offset by borrowing. Long-term imbalances are far harderto sustain, unless they can be financed by capital inflows. In most cases,cities that are unable to correct persistent current account imbalances arepushed into economic contraction and declining incomes. Rising employ- ment and incomes are a function of the productivity and innovativeness of existing industries and the emergence of new tradable activities capable ofgenerating better-paid jobs. The message of this book is that most of East Asia's leading cities ben- efited from the industrial revolution that swept through the region in the1960s. Bangkok, Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, and T okyo all sawtheir economic fortunes rise with the growth of internationally competi-tive, export-oriented, light manufacturing industries. The success of theseexporters in domestic and overseas markets led to rising urban incomesthrough the 1990s. As incomes rose, two forces began changing the industrial composition of these cities, starting with T okyo. First, the labor-intensive manufacturingactivities began moving out, initially to the periurban fringes and thenfarther out into the hinterland or to other countries where labor was cheaper. Second, because the income elasticity of demand universallyCHAPTER 10 SUMMING UPfavors services, consumption in these cities shifted toward services, and the nature of employment opportunities began to change. The East Asian crisis, which sent a shockwave through the economies of the region, underscored the challenges posed by globalization, acceler- ated the geographic redistribution of industry, and\u2014in conjunction withthe information technology (IT) revolution\u2014focused attention on pro-ductivity growth and innovation. All six cities, which had attained levels ofper capita income well above their respective national averages, were faced with the need to make an industrial transition. Manufacturing industriesof different stripes remained part of the urban landscape, but risingland and labor costs decreed that the scale of those industries diminishedand that the cities moved, willy-nilly, toward a postindustrial world\u2014aworld where manufacturing activities account for a minor share of urban gross domestic product and employ a small fraction of the workforce. This trend is irreversible, and it accords closely with the experience of majorurban centers in Western Europe and North America. If the per capita incomes in the six cities are to continue climbing\u2014or even maintain their current levels\u2014new, more productive, and more in-novative activities must replace the ones that have relocated or have beendriven out of business. IDENTIFYING POSTINDUSTRIAL CITIES The six cities in our sample are distinctive in certain respects and better placed than most to forge ahead in a globalizing environment. First, theyare large and populous cities with diversified industrial bases. 1As such, they benefit from the agglomeration economies associated with size andindustrial breadth\u2014economies that boost productivity and can underpin competitiveness (Henderson 2004a; Rosenthal and Strange 2004). Second, five are capital cities and administrative axes of the nationaleconomies. The sixth, Shanghai, is China's leading industrial andcommercial center. These positions confer numerous advantages, not theleast of which is the pull that capital cities exert on businesses because of lower transaction costs, greater scope for networking, and superiorinfrastructure. 2304 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIES 1. For instance, T okyo's industrial base embraces 122 of a possible 125 three-digit subsectors (Yusuf and Nabeshima 2006a). 2. This has been and is especially true in East Asia, where governments actively intervene in managing economic activities (Fujita 2003).A third advantage related to urban and administrative dominance in the national context is the degree to which these cities are connected to other centers in their nations and globally. For a postindustrial city increasingly dependent on the export of services, on foreign investment, and on the international circulation of knowledge workers, such connectedness\u2014predicated as it is on the quality of the information and communicationtechnology, transportation facilities, and soft infrastructure\u2014is vital. Fourth, these cities have the greatest concentrations of learning facili- ties and research institutes. As a consequence, they are richly supplied with skills from local institutions and from the steady stream of migrants at-tracted to these cities. The deep and diverse pools of skilled labor first sup-ported the growth of manufacturing industries. Now the base of skills will,to a significant extent, determine the composition and competitiveness of the new breed of industries. Local universities are the principal source of trained workers. However, in the postindustrial stage, they are also becoming sources of new tech- nologies and ideas with commercial spillovers. Thus, university-industrylinks, where they are forged through the initiatives of businesses, univer-sities, and governments, could be decisive for the future success of manyactivities that will drive the postindustrial city. 3The reservoir of skills and the fruitfulness of the links between businesses and researchers are also likely to affect the resilience of the urban economy and its capacity to overcome shocks, as well as its ability to seek new industrial loci of com- petitive advantage. All six cities, even Singapore and T okyo, continue to derive entrepre- neurial energy, dynamism, spending power, and an increase in labor sup-ply from the influx of migrants. Each remains a city where populations are growing. This fifth factor has a bearing on the cities' growth prospects andon the age structure of the workforce. Sixth, industrial progression in these cities is aided by the capacity of local financial systems and the logistics infrastructure, as well as by theefforts of the state to develop advanced telecommunication facilities. T ogether these characteristics contribute to industrial change, to produc- tivity increases, and to the increasing export of services. These six factors frame the postindustrial prospects of East Asian cities. But robust economic growth will depend on the kinds of industries thatflower in these cities and, in particular, on their competitiveness in exportmarkets, domestic as well as foreign.SUMMING UP 305 3. For discussion of university-industry links in East Asia, see Indjikian and Siegel (2005).SELECTING URBAN INDUSTRIAL ENGINES We have examined a number of potentially promising candidates for the postindustrial urban stage in East Asia's leading cities. Our choices wereguided by seven criteria necessary to the efficacy of new engines of mega- urban economies and broadly suited to the dynamic comparative advan- tages of the cities in our sample. 1. The factor requirements of these industries must broadly conform with available factor supplies and the capacity to augment these supplies. 2. The industries must produce tradables\u2014whether services or manufactures\u2014with substantial (potential) global markets that recent trends and developments suggest are likely to grow well into the future. 3. The industries are technology or knowledge intensive and derive a good part of their competitiveness from innovation and creativity. Moreover,their competitiveness is not significantly affected by labor costs, makingthem suitable for postindustrial cities with rising wages. 4. Because they are technology intensive, the industries all draw heavily on the skills of workers. They also rely to a greater or lesser extent on linkswith local universities and research institutes for technical workers andtechnology development. 5. The industries have multiple backward and forward links with other providers of manufacture and components. They are particularly suitedto the environment of a megacity, which is industrially diverse and cansupport activities that require a mix of technologies and input producers. 6. The industries have the potential to generate large turnover and em- ployment. Their economic footprint in the city is such that they canfunction as leading sectors. 7. For each industry, there are proven business models to guide newcom- ers and a fund of experience with enabling institutions and policies that can light the way forward. On the basis of those criteria, we identified one or two industries that can serve as engines of growth for each of these postindustrial cities. Ex- cept for biotechnology in Singapore, the industries are not newcomers.More important, they are all far from having realized their full potentialand, hence, can add momentum to the urban economy for some time. The robot industry in T okyo has a 45-year history and a developed network of subcontractors. But research on humanoid robotics and tech-nologies tailored for smart houses, unmanned aerial vehicles, sub-mersibles, robotic ground vehicles, medical devices, and helper robotsoffers relatively new, exciting, open, and fresh commercial vistas. Both306 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESrobotics and animation tap into T okyo's vast reserves of accumulated ex- pertise in multiple areas and its continuously upgraded skills mix. With aneconomy the size of India's and of Mexico's, T okyo also provides a testing ground for new technologies before they are exported (Fujita and Hill 2005). It hosts the corporations and research centers that are spearheadingdevelopment in these areas. Unlike some of the other industries wediscuss, neither robotics nor animation depends on government policy orfinancial support. 4Their futures rest on the capabilities inherent in a ma- ture corporate sector and the resources of a postindustrial megacity with an open economy heavily dependent on trade. Seoul's film industry also has existed for several decades, although the online game business is of relatively recent origin. Moviemaking was pro- tected and had few prospects until regulations were eased in the 1980s andnew directors came to the fore. The industry has since notched up a stringof successes and could become an exporter of some standing, equivalent in scale to the movie industries of France or the United Kingdom. Similarly,by leveraging its client-server and game engine technologies, Seoul couldmake the massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)a major and lucrative part of its multimedia sector. Whether these indus-tries do so will depend on several factors\u2014in particular, the effectiveness of government policies, which have provided both businesses with critical assistance. In the case of MMORPGs, investment in broadband infra-structure was the key to success. Such factors as the use of digital tech-niques in moviemaking and distribution will be influential, as will, mostvitally, the flow of talent into both industries. Last but not least, Koreanfilmmakers will need to respond innovatively\u2014and by differentiating theirproducts\u2014to the intense competition, not only from Hollywood but alsofrom China and India, whose movie industries are becoming more activeon the global scene. The IT and electronics industry is seemingly a natural growth pole in Beijing, given the stage the city is at and its resource endowment. T wodecades of developmental work in IT and multimedia and work with theassembly of personal computers and computer peripherals, coupled with avast university infrastructure and broad-ranging government support for technology development, provide a strong push. Were IT and electronicsto put down deep roots, they would be a strong force in Beijing's economy.But thus far, both the basic research to provide the underpinnings for aSUMMING UP 307 4. Basic safety regulations concerning the use of robots outside factories need to be clearly spec- ified for this industry to develop.dynamic sector and the innovativeness that would lead to and sustain com- mercial success on a global scale are missing. Those resources could begrown in time with sufficient investment and incentives, just as China has succeeded in building substantial Beijing-based corporations that special- ize in electronics (for example, Founders and Lenovo). Still, resources are only one essential ingredient. For a creative indus- try, an urban environment that encourages openness and traffic in newideas is another. And there are still more. Postindustrial Beijing is explor- ing a number of industrial combinations; although the government's willand ambition are obvious, whether the IT and electronics sector is theright urban champion is not clear. There can be little doubt, though, that construction, real estate, and engineering could be a major and enduring industrial cluster in Shanghai. This traditional cluster of industries nevertheless offers the widest possi- ble opportunities in China and around the world, with much scope fortechnological progress. Construction is unique in several respects. It hasnumerous links with other industries; it is a huge employer of skilledworkers; it is relatively less subject to cyclical fluctuations than some in-dustries are; and it offers a great deal of scope for creativity in design andexecution, as well as for technological change, particularly with respect toenergy and environmental conservation and new materials. Shanghai started out with a sizable construction sector. The sector has grown to huge proportions, has linked back to suppliers of materials, andhas begun exporting its services. As it builds expertise in multiple intersec-toral areas, Shanghai could easily become the center of China's construc-tion and engineering industries and from this jumping-off point penetratemarkets throughout the world. Like construction in Shanghai, jewelry making and garment manufac- ture in Bangkok are industries of long standing. However, in the postin- dustrial context, they have a new role to play\u2014and unless they adopt thisrole, these industries will soon migrate from the metropolitan area. Bothindustries must upgrade in order to grow and contribute more toBangkok's economy. Upgrading translates to an unwavering focus on de-sign, quality, and finish; on technological refinements that improve mate-rials and quality, assist with design, and lower production costs; and on themarketing and building of brand names that command global recognition. Government policies and actions taken by the Bangkok metropolitan authority can be a means to realizing these objectives, but much of theinitiative and the bulk of the investment must come from the corporatesector. In fact, changes in industrial organization and in strategy willvery likely be key to the future scale of these two industries in Bangkok.308 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESThe foundations are there, but the fashion industry is a difficult one to break into, and niche-level penetration yields only modest returns. CanBangkok-based companies succeed in the face of mounting competition from other East Asian players? The answer is far from clear; however, with the demand for fashion products rising steeply in the Asia region, the op-portunities are better than ever. The biotech industry being grown in Singapore represents a fairly rad- ical departure\u2014and a risky one. But success, even on a regional scale, would bring rich rewards to the city-state. Singapore's options are con-strained by its size, by its industrial base, and by the supply of skills. Theemergence of biotech clusters in San Diego, San Francisco, and Austin inthe United States suggests that it is possible to jump-start such develop-ment through a series of carefully sequenced investments. Singapore has gone through a checklist of necessary conditions, allo- cating physical space, attracting star scientists, building hospital and train-ing facilities, drawing in multinational corporations (MNCs), committingventure capital, and providing determined leadership. It has avoided put-ting all its eggs in one basket by embracing several subfields in biotech-nology, although the emphasis is on drugs and products for combatingcancer. Whether these subfields will prove sufficient and, if so, how longit might take for them to become so are big questions. Drug discovery is achancy business. Piloting drugs, vaccines, and implants through trials isbecoming ever more expensive and demanding. And for biotechnology tobecome an engine of growth, it must acquire a substantial scale, achievea high turnover, and employ considerable numbers of skilled workers.Singapore's MNC-dominated and thriving pharmaceutical sector offersgrounds for hope, but much will depend on whether Singapore can assemble and retain world-class talent and achieve a succession of luckybreaks that will give it a lead over China, India, and the Republic of Korea,its closest competitors. ENGINE DRIVERS This industry-eye view of postindustrialism in East Asia's megacities has highlighted the role of three participants. First and foremost are the gov-ernments, both national and municipal. Without their policies on the national innovation system (including intellectual property), on urban land use, and on skill development and without their fiscal and financialsupport, the technology-intensive industries examined here would havedifficulty taking root and achieving a high-growth trajectory.SUMMING UP 309Second are corporations. In each industrial subsector, it is evident that the corporate contribution, in the context of globalization, is of ever- increasing importance. The future of robotics in T okyo, of moviemaking in Seoul, and of biotechnology in Singapore is entwined with the strategy and dynamism of corporate entities. Japan has an abundance of powerfulcorporations with a global reach, and Korea has a few. The other countrieshave still some catching up to do. Third are universities. All the most attractive candidate industries for postindustrial cities are skill intensive to varying degrees and dependent on innovation for international competitiveness. For both skills and inno-vation, the quality of universities will matter more and more. In all fivecountries, the universities\u2014even the elite ones\u2014have given little atten-tion to the quality of education and to basic or applied research. This must change, and in Beijing, Shanghai, and Singapore it is changing at great speed. Other countries need to follow suit. A transition to a postindustrial economic system is in the cards for these six cities, and for Guangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, T aipei, and others. A tran-sition that does not break the economic momentum that these cities haveachieved requires a well-thought-out strategy and the active cooperationof several key players, led by the government, the corporate sector, and theuniversities.310 POSTINDUSTRIAL EAST ASIAN CITIESAdams, Christopher P ., and Van V .

Growth is increasingly coming from the strength of innovative activities in these economies rather than from factor accumulation as in the past. Such innovative activities\u2014especially in producer services and the creativeindustries\u2014are concentrated in high-tech clusters in globally linked cities. Drawing on a wide range of literature and on interviews of rms, this book explores these issues with a focus on six East Asian cities: Bangkok, Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo. It suggests how policies andinstitutions can induce and furnish an urban environment that supportsinnovative activities. A valuable resource for researchers, urban planners,urban geographers, and policy makers interested in East Asia, Postindustrial East Asian Cities presents the latest ndings on creative industries in East Asia and their effect on urban economic growth. ISBN 0-8213-5622-4Focusing on the six most important global cities in East Asia\u2014Bangkok, Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai,Singapore, and Tokyo\u2014the book presents a remarkably insightful investigation of the next stage of the region's economy. In each city, all of which are on the threshold of a postindustrialera, one or two industries are chosen as the contenders for leading the innovative and productive future, and in-depth analyses of their prospects and tasks are presented. The industries chosen for each city are initially rather surprising but, ultimately, become convincing. Thus, reading this book is not only wonderfully informative but also thought provoking as well as entertaining. This book is a must for scholars and policy makers or any person interested in the future of East Asia. MASAHISA FUJITA Professor of Economics, Kyoto University; President, Institute of Developing Economies, Japan External Trade OrganizationThis is a truly excellent piece of work, a land- mark publication that will be widely read and referenced. Well-written, well-structured, and highly informative, it powerfully conveys an important message about the logic and dynamicsof the new urbanism in Asia today. The main story concerns the new large-scale urban forms that are now appearing across East and Southeast Asia and the ways in which new economic sectors are driving much of the region's develop- ment and growth. The implications of this trend for the social and physical character of thesecities and for their position within the global economic system are of major signi cance. ALLEN J.
