Appendices Glossary iii Professional Resources vii Provider Agreements ix v Preface Overview The Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program's Provider Operations Manual (POM) is a reference guide that help s health -care providers stay compliant with VFC Program requirements . By complying , providers can increase immunization levels in their patient populations, ensure vaccines are administered at the recommended ages, and protect vaccine viability following manufacturer s' recommendations for storage and handling . How to Use the POM This reference guide provides clear instructions that help providers incorporate VFC Program requirements and best practices into their existing practice protocols . Providers and key practice staff can reference the POM as they complete necessary patient immunization and vaccine management tasks. Providers are encouraged to store this manual within easy reach and instruct staff to refer to it as needed to ensure tasks are completed in compliance with program requirements that protect patients and vaccines. Terminolog y This manual contains requirements , best practices, and procedures . It is important to understand the intent of each term and how they are used . Program r equirements are federal or state VFC Program policies that enrolled providers have agreed to follow. Procedures are instructions that walk staff through key immunization tasks. If the instructions are followed, providers will be complying with VFC Program requirements and best practices . Best practices are recommendations shared by CDC and the California VFC Program to improve efficiencies; best practices often evolve into requirements. Target Audience Each topic in the POM is associated with common roles that might assume responsibility for completion of key tasks in compliance with program requirements. In many practices and clinics, the office manager or supervisor might be responsible for completing or overseeing some tasks. However, key program roles should be familiar with the contents of this document. Each practice should determine how to best make use of their staffing resources to incorporate VFC Program requirements into existing practice protocols . POM Structure This manual is divided into chapters that assemble related topics, and each topic is structured using repeating elements to increase readability and ease of reference : overview requirements best practices procedures notes Each chapter also includes an organizational graphic (see figure 1 ) that summarizes key concepts to be addressed acr oss the chapter's topics. FIGURE 1. Visual illustration of chapter structure. This manual includes a Quick Start Guide , which helps orient new providers to important daily, weekly, monthly, and other routine and ad hoc tasks. Keeping the POM Current The California VFC Program updates and revises information as needed and communicates those changes to providers. Replace relevant sections in this manual as instructed to ensure it reflects current program policies and procedures . vi Keys to a Successful Implementation Overview Provider involvement. The provider of record should be directly involved in the practice's implementation of VFC Program requirements to ensure high -quality care is provided to patients . Since providers are responsible for replacement of any VFC vaccines spoiled or expired due to negligence, management should also have a clear understanding of the vaccine replacement costs and the clinical implications of mismanaged vaccines. Well -traine d Vaccine Coordinator & Backup roles. The VFC Vaccine Coordinator and Backup roles bear the important responsibility of implementing and overseeing the practice's vaccine management plan , and success requires well -trained staff . However, a national survey conducted by the CDC in 2015 revealed that the Backup Vaccine Coordinator and other key practice staff not routinely performing vaccine management tasks were insufficiently trained , indicating areas where practices can improve . The same survey revealed the following data (see figure 2) about the designation of vaccine management responsibilities by role in California : FIGURE 2. 2015 CDC survey results for CA depicting typical designation of tasks by role. VFC -compliant storage units and digital data loggers . Selection of the appropriate vaccine storage units to meet practice immunization volume is essential to maintaining stable vaccine temperatures. Properly calibrated data loggers ensure that recorded temperatures are accurate. Well -trained clinical staff knowledgeable about current immunization schedules . Staff should be familiar with ACIP -recommended vaccines, vaccine products and dosages, as well as vaccine administration techniques . Thorough eligibility screening and documen tation at every immunization visit. Providers help ensure program integrity by immunizing only VFC -eligible children with VFC -supplied vaccines and avoiding missed immunization opportunities .

By the end of this chapter, providers should have an understanding of the provider and patient benefits and know where to find the requirements that protect provider vaccines and patients and the integrity of the VFC P rogram . Figure 1.1 highlights the key topics covered in chapter one. FIGURE 1.1. Overview of the topics orienting new providers to the VFC Program. THE VFC PROGRAM 4 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition About VFC Overview A severe resurgence of measles in the Unites States between 1989 and 1991 resulted in more than 55,000 reported measles cases with over 11,000 hospitalizations and 123 deaths. Access to vaccines was not readily available at that time. The cases were mostly unvaccinated preschoolers , and the VFC Program launched emergency campaigns to respond to the outbreaks .1 In partial response to that epidemic, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) in 1993, creating the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program .2 The VFC Program became opera tional in 1994 as a federally funded , state -operated program that supplies vaccines at no charge to enrolled public and private providers who serve VFC -eligible children. This entitlement program is required as part of each state's Medicaid Plan. Goals. The national program offers an unprecedented approach to improving immunization rates and seeks to help raise childhood immunization levels, provide vaccines at no cost to children whose parents or guardians might not be able to afford them, increase the l ikelihood of children getting their vaccinations on schedule, and keep children in their medical home by reducing the practice of referring children from the private to the public sector for immunizations. Provider Benefits The VFC Program offers benefits to providers who serve VFC -eligible children from birth through 18 years of age who might not otherwise be vaccinated due to an inability to pay: reduced up -front provider costs through federally supplied vaccines comprehen sive vaccine coverage that allows providers to offer all vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)3 reintegration of immunization and primary care to retain c hildren who might otherwise be referred elsewhere enhanced provider services to support populations receiving Medi -Cal-funded preventive care Patient Benefits Patient benefits ensure VFC -eligible children from birth through 18 years of age are vaccinated: all routine vaccines administered at no cost (providers may charge administration fees) convenient immunizations administered by providers in private or public medical facilities a stable , patient -centered medical home for coordinated and comprehensive health -care services About VFC California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5 How the VFC Program Works The following steps outline how the federal VFC Program works: CDC awards federal funding to state health departments, which implement and oversee VFC Program activities. State health departments enroll providers to increase immunizations in vulnerable populations. CDC contracts with vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at reduced rates. Enrolled VFC providers order federally funded vaccine s through their state VFC Program and receive routine vaccines (including influenza) at no cost. California providers enroll online, and once the application is approved, a regional VFC Field Representative will conduct a site visit to ensure that key pra ctice staff are trained and the practice or clinic is certified to store and manage VFC -supplied vaccines. Program Administration The VFC Program is administered at the federal level by the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). The California VFC Program is administered by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Immunization Branch. The California VFC Program4 was created in 1995 and has enrolled more than 4,000 public and private provider sites since its inception. The state -operated program accounts for nearly 10% of the total doses of vaccines distributed nationwide \u2014equivalent to more than ten million doses of federally purchased vaccines. Th e success of the program is large ly due to the commitment by participating providers to ensuring California's children are protected from vaccine -preventable diseases. Regional offices. California's VFC Program is comprised of the VFC Call Center as well as five regional offices based in Northern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, Los Angeles, and Southern California . ACIP The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)3 was founded in 1964 as a federal advisory committee to reduce the incidence of vaccine -preventable diseases and increase the safe use of vaccines . The committee of medical and public health experts develops and issues written statements advising on the use of routine vaccines for both pediatric and adult populations. ACIP's role in the VFC Program. ACIP's congressional mandate includes the authorit y to make recommendations for the VFC Program (as well as the general population) regarding recommended vaccines, age for vaccination, vaccination schedules (including number and timing of doses in a series), precautions , and contraindications. Key functions. ACIP acts as advisor for CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services to determine which vaccines should be recommended and covered. ACIP develops recommendations on vaccine use and immunization practices; approves vaccines to be incl uded in the VFC Program; and harmonizes immunization schedules with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Practitioners (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists VFC PROGRAM Edition The VFC Program and Medi -Cal The VFC Program is required as part of each state's Medicaid Plan. The majority of children eligible for VFC -supplied vaccines is enrolled in each state's Medicaid plan , which is implemented in California as Medi -Cal. Notes 1. Walter A.

Click to Return Home Chapter One VFC California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7 Vaccines Overview The VFC Program supplies all ACIP -recommended vaccines at no cost to enrolled public and private providers who serve VFC -eligible children from birth through 18 years of age. Providers are required to offer all age -appropriate vaccines \u2014including flu \u2014according to patient populations served. Available Vaccines & Schedules Table 1 lists the ACIP vaccine recommendations1 available through the VFC Program for children from birth through 18 years of age. For schedules, refer to ACIP's \"Birth -18 Years and \"VFC Vaccine Fact Sheets\"4 for one-page flyers about routine schedules, minimum intervals , approved age ranges, and more for each available vaccine. TABLE 1. ACIP -recommended vaccines for children from birth throu gh 18 years of age Vaccine Description DTaP Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis DTaP -HepB -IPV* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis , hepatitis B , and polio DTaP -IPV* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and polio DTaP -IPV/Hib* Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b HepA Hepatitis A HepB Hepatitis B Hib Haemophilus influenzae diphtheria Tdap Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis VAR Varicella (chickenpox) * Combination vaccines. In order to reduce the number of shots children must receive to stay current with ACIP -recommended immunizations, manufacturers combine two or more vaccines (that are available to be administered separately) into one shot. Refer to the \"Immunization Schedule with Combination Vaccines\"5 for more details. THE VFC PROGRAM 8 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Understanding ACIP Vaccine Recommendations In 2010, ACIP adopted a graded approach that classifies vaccine recommendations into two categories ,6 both of which are covered under the Vaccines for Children Program. Routine vaccine recommendations . This recommendation (formerly known as \"universal\") applies to all persons in an age- or risk-factor -based group .7 For example, t he meningococcal conjugate vaccine is routinely recommended for all preteens 11 through 12 years of age.8 All children in this population should be routinely vaccinated. VFC providers agree to order and administer all ACIP -recommended vaccines to VFC - eligible children . Routine vaccine recommendations are identified on ACIP schedules with the following keys: Non -routine vaccine recommendations . This recommendation (formerly known as \"permissive\")7 does not apply to everyone but instead identifies opportunities for the clinic ian to discuss with the patient or parent/guardian whether a particular vaccine is appropriate based on risks, benefits, and the desire to be protected from a specific disease .8 For example, according to ACIP 's recommendation, people 16 through 23 years of age (preferred age of 16 through 18) \"may be given\" the vaccine against meningococcal serogroup B disease. MenB is classified as non-routine because there insufficient evidence to suggest that all children 16 through 18 be vacc inated, but there was enough evidence to suggest that adolescents and young adults be given the choice.8 VFC providers agree to e nsure that VFC -eligible children have access to non -routine, ACIP -recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested by pa tients . Non -routine vaccine recommendations are identified on the ACIP schedules with the following key: Introducing New Vaccines into the VFC Program New vaccines are incorporated into the national VFC Program only after careful review and consideratio n by ACIP, which reviews vaccine efficacy data and considers each vaccine's risks and benefits, the number of doses in a series, the recommended schedule, and contraindications. ACIP then votes whether or not to include each new vaccine. VFC resolutions. ACIP's official decision regarding the incorporation of new vaccines in to the VFC Program is called a VFC resolution. VFC resolutions are available on CDC's \"VFC - ACIP Vacc ine Resolutions\" .9 Vaccine distribution. Once a VFC resolution is passed, CDC begins the process of making the vaccine available through the VFC Program. CDC negotiates prices for bulk vaccine purchase at the national level, vaccine supplies are assessed, and each state is typically allocated an initial supply during the vaccine's introductory period. Ordering guidelines are developed and Vaccine Information Statements (VIS s) are produced. The entire process might take several weeks to a few months. VFC Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Provide r notifications. The California VFC Program communicates all new vaccine information to enrolled providers \u2014 including the dosing schedule, administration, billing, and ordering information \u2014through e -mailed VFC Program letters. Best Practices . Providers ar e strongly encouraged to discuss with staff all new products \u2014including formulations, schedules, vaccine administration, and storage \u2014prior to ordering the product and especially before using it on patients. Vaccine Availability California offers a choice of vaccine brands and presentations (e.g., single -dose vial s or manufacturer -filled , single -dose syringes) \u2014except for influenza vaccine . Availability might vary due to supply issues and timing of the introduction of new vaccines. The most current list of v accines and formulations are listed on the MyVFCvaccines.org online order form. Vaccine status updates are posted on EZIZ.org . Special Note: Influenza Vaccine The VFC Program requires providers to provide pediatric influenza vaccine s to their VFC - eligible patients during influenza season. Providers are responsible for formulating a vaccination plan to ensure children in their practice or clinic are protected. VFC providers do not have a choice of influenza vaccine brands and packaging. Instead, the VFC Program, in coordination with CDC, selects influenza products and formulations to meet the needs of VFC providers for each flu season . The VFC Program will issue special instructions regarding availability, brands, and ordering of influenza vaccines in advance of each flu season. VFC's \"Pediatric/Adult Influenza Vaccine\"10 provides guidance on schedules and a vailable brands and presentations. (Refer to \"Ordering Flu Vaccines.\" ) The California Mercury -Free Vaccines Act The California Mercury -Free Vaccines Act of 2004 , Chapter 837, Statutes of 2004 (AB 2943, Pavley)11 prohibits administ ration of mercury -containing vaccines to pregnant women, or children younger than three years of age. Thimerosal, a chemical used to prevent c ontamination of multi -dose vials of vaccines, contains trace amounts of mercury. All routine childhood vaccines, including VFC -supplied vaccines, are available in formulations that meet the Mercury Free Act. All multi -dose vials of influenza vaccine curren tly exceed the legal limit of mercury content and should not be used in these groups. VFC's p reservative -free influenza vaccine formulations should be used for administration to VFC -eligible children younger than 3 years of age and pregnant teens younger t han 19 years of age. Refer to \"Thimerosal\"12 or \"Thimerosal and Vaccines\"13 for more inform ation. Temporary exemptions. California Health and Safety Code Section 124172 subdivision (c) permits the Secretary of the Health and Human Services Agency to temporarily exempt the use of a vaccine from section 124172 under certain circumstances , such as severe delays or shortages of thimerosal -free influenza vaccines . In such events, CDPH will communicate with providers.

Click to Return Home Chapter One Program Requirements California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Program Requirements Overview In exchange for federally funded vaccines, enrolled providers agree to partner with the VFC Program to ensure that federal and state requirements are met in order to protect the integrity of the program as well as the provider's vaccines and patients . Take the EZIZ train ing \"VFC Program Requirements\" lesson1 for an overview of the program. Program Requirements VFC P rogram requirements , which are explained throughout this manual , are summarized in \"Program Participation Requirements at a Glance\"2 and defined in the VFC \"Provider Agreement\"3 (federal agreement) and California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum.\"4 Table 2 highlights key compliance areas covered by these requirements documents . TABLE 2 . General description of provider requirements Requirement General Description Provider profile Estimate populations served annually (VFC and private ) Eligibility screening & documentation Conduct patient eligibility screening and documentation at every immunization visit ACIP -recommended vaccines Comply with ACIP recommendations and offer age -appropriate vaccinations according to population served Record retention Maintain all VFC -related documentation for three years No-cost vaccines Immunize all VFC -eligible children at no charge to the patient Vaccine administration fee Follow VFC requirements for administration fee caps or reimbursement rates; don 't deny vaccines due to inability to pay VISs Distribute current Vaccine Information Statements before administering vaccines Vaccine management Store , manage, order, transfer, and return vaccines according to the California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum;\"4 complete VFC \"Vaccine Management Plan\" Word template5 Fraud & abuse Follow VFC Program requirements in a manner to avoid fraud & abuse Site visits Agree to scheduled compliance and unannounced storage & handling visits, and make changes per VFC findings Accountability Track and document vaccine usage; r eplace VFC vaccines deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for- dose basis . Recertification Reaffirm annually that VFC Program requirements will be met, key practice information is up to date, and patient estima tes are provided. Failure to recertify might result in temporary suspension of provider account and termination of agreement . THE VFC PROGRAM 12 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Key practice roles . Designation of key practice staff responsible for overseeing VFC - supplied vaccines is an important requirement that ensures successful compliance . Staff fulfilling key practice roles must be knowledgeable and trained in all VFC Program requirements . Important. Providers must report personnel changes to these roles through their MyVFCvac cines account or the VFC \"Key Practice Staff Change Request Form.\"6 Provider of Record : The VFC Provider of Record is the physician -in-chief, medical director, or equivalent role that signs and agrees to the terms of the VFC \"Provider Agreement \" 3 and the California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum \" 4 and who is ultimately accountable for the practice's compliance . The Provider of Record mus t be a licensed MD, DO, NP, PA, pharmacist, or a Certified Nurse Midwife with prescription -writing privileges in California. Provider of Record Designee : The VFC Provider of Record Designee is the on-site person that is designated by the Provider of Record to sign VFC documents on his/her behalf and assume responsibility for VFC -related matters in the absence of the Provider of Record. Vaccine Coordinator: The VFC Vaccine Coordinator is an on -site employee who is fully trained and responsible for implementing and overseeing the provider's vaccine management plan. The Vaccine Coordinator might be responsible for all vaccine management activities, including training o ther (especially new) staff. In other practices, a different person might have one or more vaccine management responsibilities. Backup Vaccine Coordinator: The VFC Backup Vaccine Coordinator is an on -site employee who is fully trained in the practice's vac cine management activities and fulfills the responsibilities of the Vaccine Coordinator if the Vaccine Coordinator is unavailable. TABLE 3 . Essential responsibilities for the Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Responsibility General Description Receiving vaccines Be present when vaccines are delivered , ensure acceptable temperatures were maintained during transport , and check for damage or shipping issues , whi ch must be immediately reported Storing vaccines Prepare vaccine storage units to maintain stable temperatures, organize them for efficiency, configure data loggers with required settings, and store vaccines and diluents immediately upon receipt Inventory management Immediately add vaccines to inventory, r otate stock to ensure oldest vaccines are use d first , remove all expired vaccines from storage units , and separate VFC -suppl ied vaccines from private stock Monitoring temperatures Use calibrated, compliant data loggers to record vaccine storage unit temperatures twice daily on VFC -supplied logs , take immediate action for out -of-range temperatures , and report temperature excursions immediately Ordering vaccines Conduct an inventory of VFC -supplied vaccines before ordering , account for vaccines returned /transferred since the previous order , and submit vaccine orders online Program Requirements California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 13 Attention providers. Because VFC providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , practices and clinics must select for the roles of Vaccine Coordinator and its Backup those staff members who can consistently and accurately perform the responsibilities in TABLE 3 . These roles might be filled by medical assistants, LVN, RN, office manager, or other trained staff. Best Practices Consider assigning the role of Immunization Champion to anyone on site who is passionate about immunizations. This is not an official role, but practices and clinics that assign an Immunization Champion often have better compliance rates. The Immunization Champion might Ensure staff know how to and are completing VFC eligibility screening and documentation consistently , Ensure vaccinators are consistently pulling from private or VFC stock as instructed in written orders, Ensure vaccinators are urging parent/guardian to schedule follow -up doses before leaving , Ensure vaccinators are educating patients and the ir parent/guardian about immunizations , and Research and collaborate with providers to implement essential immunization strategies practice -wide.

Click to Return Home Chapter THE VFC PROGRAM 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Training & Support Overview VFC provider s and key practice staff must undergo annual training on key aspects of VFC Program requirements. To assist providers, t he VFC Program offers convenient online training that fulfills federal education requirements . The VFC Call Center and regional VFC Field Representatives also train and support enrolled providers to ensure their success. Program Requi rement s Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Designate an on -site Provider of Record Designee authorized to sign VFC Program documents and assume responsibility for VFC -related matters in the absence of the Provider of Record (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #2A). Designate fully trained, on -site Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Vaccine Coordinator as detailed in \"Vaccine Coordinator Roles & Responsibilities\" (P.A.A. #2B). Ensure Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator and Backup, and other key practice staff comply with federal VFC educational requirements, such as annual EZIZ trainings; ensure staff demonstrate competency in their assigned VFC responsibilities (P.A.A. #2C) . Ensure that staff are knowledgeable of and familiar with all ACIP -recommended immunizations including schedules, indications, dosages, and new products (P.A.A. #2D). Ensure staff, including supervisors and new employees, are properly trained on temperature monitoring , including proper use of the practice's digital data loggers and the required corrective actions for out -of-range temperatures (P.A.A. #2E). Ensure staff authorized to accept packages are trained to immediately notify the Vaccin e Coordinator when vaccines are delivered (P.A.A. #2F). Conduct regular vaccine transport drills to maintain competency and readiness for emergencies (P.A.A. # 2G). Immediately report to the VFC Program any changes in key practice staff who have immunizat ion-related responsibilities; a change in the Provider or Record or Designee requires a signed \"Key Practice Staff Change Request Form \" (P.A.A. #2H). Best Practices All other staff (outside key practice roles ) who are involved in immunizations , including front - and back -office staff, should be knowledgeable about VFC Program eligibility ; they are encouraged to take the EZIZ training lessons. Clinic staff administering vaccines should demonstrat e proficiency in administration techniques ; provide refresher training as part of annual training or general staff meetings. Importance of Vaccine Coordinator & Backup The VFC Vaccine Coordinator and Backup are responsible for implementing the practice's vaccine management plan , which protects the viability of vaccine s that might be worth from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year . Make sure staff filling these roles understand the impact they can have . Staff must be properly t rained on use of the practice's data loggers and the required corrective actions for out -of-range temperatures . Conduct regular vaccine transport drills to maintain staff competency and readiness for emergencies. Refer to \"Responding to Vaccine -Related Emergencies\" for details on drills. Encourage staff to consult with their supervisor or the VFC Call Center if they have questions about any vaccine -related tasks. Training & Support California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 15 Other Vaccine - Related Training Staff autho rized to accept packages must be trained to immediately notify the Vaccine Coordinator when vaccines are delivered to ensure vaccines are stored promptly.

Program communications are e-mailed to the site's Provider of Record, and any additional staff as requested. EZIZ.org The VFC Program is committed to being a green organization. The California VFC Program relies primarily on e -mail communications, so practices and clinics must maintain a current and valid e -mail account. Archived VFC Program communications1 are posted on the home page at EZIZ.org. Best Practices All staff involved in immunizations are encouraged to sign up to receive EZIZ news and VFC letters via e -mail from the EZIZ.org home page. Providers are strongly encouraged to share and discuss all VFC -related information with staff. Communication Methods The VFC Program communicates with providers via the methods listed in table 8. Table 8. Categories of VFC Program communication methods Method Description VFC Program letters Official VFC communications containing program information like vaccine recommendations and schedules, new requirements, recertification timelines, and timely information on vaccine shortages and delays. Order information E-mails sent when vaccine requests are submitted, approved, or denied and forwarded to the distributor(s) for fulfillment ; confirmations are e -mailed directly to the Vaccine Coordinator. Comp liance reports Communications generated by VFC Field Representatives following site visits are tailored to each practice and describe necessary actions to achieve compliance ; reports are sent to the Provider of Record and additional staff as requested. E-mail blasts Brief messages alerting providers about vaccine supply issues (e.g., temporary vaccine recalls and temporary suspension) and reminders (e.g., upcoming deadlines) ; messages are sent to key practice staff who have signed up to receive notificat ions.

By offering vaccines at no cost to VFC -eligible children and reintegrating vaccinations with primary care, p roviders are uniquely positioned to influence healthy immunization levels in their local communities . Why? Parents are likely to follow vaccine reco mmendations of their child's doctor \u2014even when the adults were initially reluctant.1 Adole scent immunizations are lagging behind childhood immunizations in California, which means missed immunization opportunities. Fewer than 70% of health -care providers t ypically receive influenza vaccine ,1 creating an opportunity for increased expansion of health -care prevention and maintenance. Figure 2.1 highlights the key topics covered in chapter two. FIGURE 2.1. Overview of the key topics of patient vaccinations . PATIENT VACCINATIONS 4 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Conducting Eligibility Screening & Documentation Overview Eligibility screening and documentation is a key procedure that impacts downstream vaccine administration and accurate billing of the appropriate party. It's typically conducted when the immunization visit is scheduled. In order for children to receive vaccines through the VFC Program, provider s must screen for and document VFC Program eligibility in the child's permanent medical record \u2014at each immunization visit . Target Audience Typically front -office staff ; office managers and Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization visit for VFC eligibility and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the VFC eligibility criteria ( VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #2). Federally funded vaccine -eligible children include American Indian or Alaskan Native, Medicaid -eligible , uninsured, or underinsured and served in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinics (RHC) (P.A. #2). No other factor(s) may be considered when screening for eligibility (P .A. #2). Document the eligibility criterion (or status ) that was met in the child's permanent medical record for each immunization visit (P.A. #2). Providers must maintain all records related to the VFC Program (including VFC screening and eligibility documentation) for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review (P .A. #4). Pharmacies, urgent care, and school -located vaccine clinics must agree to vaccinate all \"walk -in\" (not just established) VFC -eligible children and must never refuse to vaccinate VFC -eligible children because t he child's parent or guardian is unable to pay the administration fee (P .A. #12). Rationale The VFC Program is an entitlement program. Children must meet federal VFC eligibility criteria to receive public ly funded vaccines . Providers must document the screenings and retain eligibility documentation to prove compliance and ensure vaccines are going to the intended populations . Failure to comply is grounds for immediate suspension and a site visit, and might lead to termination if compliance issues are not resolved . Conducting Eligibility Screening & Documentation California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5 VFC Eligibility Criteria Children from birth through 18 years of age must meet at least one of the criteria in table 1 at each immunization visit to be eligible to receive VFC -supplied vaccines . Verification of a parent's response or self -identification of eligibility criteri on (or criteria) is not required. TABLE 1. VFC -approved eligibility criteria (or status) Criterion Description Medi caid eligible (or enrolled ) Has Medi -Cal or California's Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) as primary or secondary coverage American Indian (AI) or Alaskan Native (AN) As defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act1 Uninsured No health insurance coverage Underinsured Health insurance doesn't cover vaccines, doesn't cover all ACIP -recommended vaccines, or covers vaccines but with a fixed dollar limit (or cap) ; underinsured patients are only eligible to receive VFC vaccines at FQHC or RHC facilitie s. Important. No other factor(s) may be considered when screening children for eligibility. Examples of Children Not Eligible Children whose health insurance covers the cost of vaccinations are not eligible for VFC vaccines \u2014even when a claim would be denied for payment because the plan's deductible ha s not been met. Children covered by medical savings or health savings accounts are not eligible. PATIENT VACCINATIONS 6 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition If Multiple Eligibility Criteria Apply Providers should select the eligibility criterion (or criteria) that requires the least amount of out-of-pocket expense s for the parent or guardian. Refer to t able 2 for examples of how to record multiple eligibility criteria in screening systems. TABLE 2. Sample entries for children with multiple eligibility criteria Eligibility criteria Screening -system entry AI/AN & on Medi -Cal Select \" Medi -Cal\" (and \"AI/AN\" if system allows two). Why? Medi -Cal will be responsible for administration fee. AI/AN & Uninsured Select \"AI/AN\" (and \"Uninsured\" if the system allows two). Why? \"AI/AN\" is the permanent eligibility criterion. Parent or guardian will be billed for the administration fee, which must be waived if due to inability to pay. AI/AN & Underinsured Select \"AI/AN\" (an d \"Underinsured\" if the system allows two). Why? \"AI/AN\" is the permanent eligibility criterion and allows vaccination at any provider facility \u2014not just FQHC/RHC. Parent or guardian will be billed for the administration fee, which must be waived if due to inability to pay. (Refer to \"Billing for Vaccine Administration\" for more details.) Underinsured & Medi -Cal (as secondary) Select \" Medi -Cal\" (and \"Underinsured\" if system allows two). Why? Medi -Cal will be responsible for administration fee, and the child will be covered in all provider settings \u2014not just FQHC/RHC. (Refer to \"Billing for Vaccine Administration\" for more details.) Insured Exceptions In limited situations, insured children might be eligible to receive VFC vaccines: AI/AN children with private health insurance that covers immunizations: Insured American Indian and Alaskan Native children may be screened as \"AI/AN\" and are always eligib le. Insured with Medi -Cal as secondary insurance: These children may be screened as \"Medicaid eligible\" because they are enrolled in Medi -Cal. (Refer to \"Billing for Vaccine Administration\" for more details.) Pers ons under 19 years of age who are incarcerated in detention centers and lost access to their parent's insurance benefits as a result of incarceration may be screened as \"uninsured.\" Refer to TABLE 4 for a summary of other eligibility screening scenarios. Exceptions for Family Planning Clinics Persons under 19 years of age who have insurance, but because of the confidential circumstances of seeking services in a family planning clinic * do not have access to that insurance, may be screened as \"uninsured .\" * CDC defines a family planning clinic as a clinic or provider whose purpose is to prescribe contraceptives and/or treat sexually transmitted diseases. School -based clinics or any VFC -enrolled provider whose main services are primary or acute care services do not meet CDC's definition of a family planning clinic and may not use this VFC eligibility criterion. Conducting Eligibility Screening & Documentation California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7 Pharmacies, Urgent Care, and School -Located Vaccination Clinics Every patient seeking immunization services in pharmacy settings is considered an established patient. Therefore, pharmacies, urgent care, and school -located vaccine clinics agree to vaccinate all walk -in, VFC -eligible children. In these settings, vaccination of VFC - eligible children may not be denied due to a parent's inability to pay the administration fee. VFC-Compliant Recor d Keeping Systems Providers must document the results of the eligibility screening in the child's permanent medical record using any of these VFC -compliant record keeping systems: Electronic Medical Record (EMR)/Electronic Health Record (EHR) system Electronic i mmunization registry VFC \"Patient Eligibility Screening Record\"2 or other paper chart By federal law, the child's permanent medical record (electronic or paper) must reflect the followi ng VFC eligibility data: screening date VFC eligibility (Y/N) eligibility criterion (or criteria) that was met Important. If the electronic system does not store the federally required VFC eligibility data, providers must supplement the permanent record (e.g., by using VFC \"Patient Eligibility Screening Record\" 2 or equivalent ) to store the required data. PATIENT VACCINATIONS 8 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Incorporate these instructions into practice protocols to conduct eligibility screening and documentation in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices . TABLE 3 . Instructions for conducting eligibility screening & documentation Step Description 1. Conduct insurance verification per office protoc ol. 2.

Click to Return Home Chapter Two Reviewing Immunization Records California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Reviewing Immunization Records Overview Providers must use screening results to ensure that only VFC -eligible children receive VFC vaccines. To comply with VFC Program requirements and avoid missed immunization opportunities, providers must review immuniza tion records at each immunization visit and ensure all VFC -eligible children receive all age-appropriate , ACIP - recommended immunization s. Ensuring that accurate immunization records are assessed is one essential strategy for raising immunization levels among the provider's patients. Immunization registries are excellent tools to assess immunization status and history . Target Audience Typically licensed providers, nurse practitioners, and other s imilar roles ; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization visit for VFC eligibility and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the VFC eligibility criteria ( VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #2). For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider's VFC Provider Profile, c omply with immunization schedules , dosages and contraindications that are established by ACIP and included in the VFC program (P.A. #3). Discretion may be exercised if in the provider's medical judgment, and in accordance with accepted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the child, or if the particular requirements contradict state law, including laws pertai ning to religious and other exemptions (P.A. #3). Never deny administration of a publicly purchased vaccine to an established patient because the child's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee (P .A. #7). Best Practices Consider using the AAP \"Refusal to Vaccinate\" form1 (or equivalent) to document provider's efforts to vaccinate despite patient/parent refusal . Consider using an immunization information system . They are directly related to increasing and maintaining vaccination rates2 and result in cost savings to practices performing administrative tasks .3 Strongly r ecommend to parents all vaccines currently du e. According to CDC, \"Parents of pediatric patients are likely to follow vaccine recommendations of the child's doctor, and even adults who were initially reluctant were likely to receive an influenza vaccination when the health -care provider's opinion of the vaccine was positive.\"2 For multi -dose series, encourage the parent/guardian or patient to make a follow -up appointment for the next dose before leaving. Ensure staff are familiar with ACIP recommendations ; print and display immunization schedules for staff and parents . Consider these CDC best practices : Reinforce the need to return for future doses.2 Recommend that families leave with the next appointment booked.2 Issue reminder calls that vaccines are soon due.2 PATIENT VACCINATIONS 12 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Incorporate these instructions into existing practice protocols to review immunization histories in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices for children who present for vaccin ation . TABLE 5 . Instructions for reviewing immunization recor ds Step Description 1. Review the child's permanent immunization record (electronic or paper) at every immunization visit for VFC -eligible children. No access to an immunization registry or EHR/EMR? Consider using CDPH \"Immunization Record and History\" form .4 2. Determine which vaccines are recommended by comparing the child's immunization record to ACIP's \"Birth -18 Years Recommended Immunization Schedule\" .5 A. Review the ACIP \"Catch -up Immunization Schedul e\"6 if the child is not up to date . 3. Recommend all ACIP -recommended, age-appropriate vaccines (unless provider feels vaccinations are medically inappropriate in accordance with accepted medical practice or as exempted by state law). A. Do not refer patients to other facilities where they might be charged for vaccine administration. B. Request that the parent complete the AAP \"Refusal to Vaccinate\" form1 (or equivalent) if appropriate. 4. Ensure that VFC -eligible children have access to non -routine, ACIP - recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested. A. Answer any questions to help the patient or parent/guardian determine whether a non -routine vacci ne is appropriate based on risks, benefits, and the desire to be protected from a specific disease. 5. Reinforce the need to leave with the next immunization visit scheduled. A. Use written and verbal reinforcements, and tie the visit to some calendar event (e.g., the child's next birthday or some holiday). 6. Document a written medical order (electronic or paper) in the child's permanent medical record for the vaccinator. A. Indicate whether vaccines are to be administered from private or VFC stock.

Click to Return Home Chapter Two PATIENT VACCINATIONS 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Administering Vaccines Overview Providers must ensure eligibility status is clearly identified for staff administering vaccine s. Administering vaccines is more than simply the injection. It's a process that includes selecting the prescribed vaccines from the correct funding source based on the written order, preparing the vaccines , verifying the correct dose and vaccine for age, giving them to or injecting them into the patient, and documenting the doses administered in the child's permanent medical record. Target Audience Typically clinical staff ; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: I will screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization encounter for VFC eligibility (i.e., federally or state vaccine -eligible) and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of a ge or younger who meet one or more of the following categories: Are an American Indian or Alaska Native; Are enrolled in Medicaid; Have no health insurance; Are underinsured (VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #2). Providers must maintain all records related to the VFC Program (including medical records that verify receipt of vaccine) for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review ( P.A. #4). Distribute the current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporti ng System (VAERS) (P .A. #8). Administer all ACIP -recommended vaccines (including flu) in -house; do not refer patients to other facilities where they might be charged for vaccine administration (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #14A) . Ensure non -routine , ACIP -recommended vaccines when indicated or when requested (P.A.A. #14B). Administer all VFC -supplied vaccines at the approved location fo r the VFC PIN; administration of doses outside the approved location (e.g., special event clinics, health fairs, special school clinics, or mass vaccination clinics) is not routinely allowed and requires prior approval from the VFC Program (P.A.A. #1 4C). Acknowledge and follow VFC Program and manufacturer guidance, including revaccination, if non -viable vaccines have been administered to patients (P.A.A. #14D). Document all VFC vaccine doses administered -1053F) , an immunization registry, or equivalent electronic or paper form (P.A.A. #14E). Best Practices Ensure vaccinators are properly trained on preparing and administering vaccines to children in the correct anatomic site according to practice protocol. Use an immunization information system such as EMR/EHR system (or immunization registry ) that supports VFC Program documentation requirements to keep track of doses administered (private and publicly funded). Documentation for Minors Unaccompanied by Parent or Guardian Family planning and STD clinics confidentially administering VFC -supplied vaccines to unaccompanied minors must document vaccine administration in the patient's confidential medical record and on a VFC -supplied administration log. Due to the confidential nature of services provided, vaccine administration information cannot be entered into an immunization registry ; so, alternative documentation must be kept. Administering Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 15 Transcribing Immunizations Immunization records from other providers must be transcribed into the child's permanent medical record (electronic or paper) to reflect a complete immunization history. When transcribing immunization records, document the date the vaccine was given, the full name of the practice, and write \"transcribed\" to clearly identify that the vaccine was given elsewhere. Administering with Medi -Cal as Secondary Insurance Insured children with Medi -Cal as a secondary insurance are VFC -eligible as long as they are enrolled in the state's Medi -Cal program. Vaccinating patients in this scenario might be done two ways , as determined by the pr ovider: Pull from private stock (the patient's primary insurance should be billed for vaccine cost and administration), or Pull from VFC -supplied doses (Medi -Cal should be billed for the vaccine administration fee). There is no out -of-pocket expense for t he parent or guardian with this option. (Refer to \"Billing for Vaccine Administration\" for more details.) IMPORTANT. Providers should select the vaccine inventory that is most cost -efficient for the family and trai n their staff accordingly. Be sure to provide clear instructions to those responsible for vaccine administration. Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) Providers are required to distribute the current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS s) each time a vaccine is administered \u2014including each dose in a series \u2014and document and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) . Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are produced by CDC, in consultation with panels of exper ts and parents, to educate the public about the benefits and risks of vaccines. For a list of current VISs, visit http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/ .1 Key points: VISs must be distributed to all patie nts before vaccine administration \u2014in both private and public settings. Providers must distribute the most current version, in either paper or electronic formats. (Some EMR/EHR systems don't update VISs automatically. ) VISs must be distributed for each dos e administered \u2014including combination vaccines. VISs should be given in the language that the recipient can easily understand, and they are available in multiple languages under \"Vaccine Information Statements\"1 Signed consent is not required for a person to be vaccinated. VISs must not be altered before distribution to th e patient, parent, or guardian. Vaccine Dose Documentation In accordance with federal law, all providers must maintain immunization records that include all of the following elements : VIS edition date Date the VIS is distributed FIGURE 2.2. Edition date found on the back of the VIS in the right bottom corner. Practice address and name/title of the person who administered vaccine(s) Vaccine and d ate administered Vaccine manufacturer and lot number PATIENT VACCINATIONS 16 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Minimum Intervals CDC encourages using the shortest interval to complete immunizations. For example, when a VFC -eligible child is in the four - to five-month interval bet ween doses of DTaP, target the four -month date for receiving the next dose rather than waiting the maximum five months. Encourage the parent or guardian to schedule the next dose but caution them not to get the dose before the minimum interval is reached. IMAGE 2. 3. Screenshot from CDC's \"Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 0 through 18 Years\" .2 Vaccine Preparation CDC recommends preparing vaccines immediately prior to administrati on in order to assure vaccine viability and p revent waste. Vaccines that are not administered immediately are at risk of exposure to temperatures outside of the required range, which can affect viability and, ultimately, might leave children unprotected against vaccine - preventable diseases. Vaccine Accountability All doses removed from the storage unit and administered must be totaled by vaccine type and recorded \u2014either electronically through an EMR/EHR or immunization registry, or on a daily usage log. Accurate accounting of doses administered helps ensure that future orders meet actual need and reduces the likelihood of vaccine orders being denied due to accountability issues. How do practices benefit? Accurately logging doses administered helps practices assess immunization rates in their patien t populations. It also helps identify non -vaccinated children who might need to be quarantined in the event of a public health intervention in response to outbreaks and epidemics. Additionally, in the event of a vaccine recall, practices can easily determine which patients received a specific vaccine and how many must be recalled to ensure protection against vaccine -preventable diseases. Administering Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 17 Vaccines & Administration Routes Refer to table 6 to identify correct anatomic sites before vaccine administratio n. TABLE 6 . Vaccines and correct administration routes POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Incorporate these instructions into existing practice protocols to administer vaccines in compliance with federal and VFC Program requirements and best practices. TABLE 7. Instructions for administering VFC -supplied vaccines Step Description 1. Review the physician's writt en order to determine vaccines to administer. 2. Distribute the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for each vaccine before vaccine administration and educate the family as necessary. Tip. The current VIS must be given with every vaccination \u2014 including each dose in a multi -dose series and combination vaccines . 3. Pull from VFC -supplied or private stock as instructed or based on eligibility . Never borrow from VFC -supplied vaccines for private use. Check with supervisor if instructions are not clear or complete. 4. Double check the selected vaccines for accuracy and expiration . A. Double check each vaccine against physician's written order to prevent vaccination with the wrong vaccine . B. Use vaccines with the earliest expiration dates first. Do NOT use expir ed vaccine s. 5. Sort vaccines by administration route to quickly determine the number of needles to select . (Refer to TABLE 6 for assistance.) 6. Before you start: A. Wash your hands. B. Gather alcohol, syringe, and appropriate needles as needed. C. Intramuscular route : Vaccines require 1 -inch, 23 - or 25 - gauge needle. For heavier or larger patients, consider a 1-1/2\" needle. D. Subcutaneous route : Vaccines require 5/8 -inch, 25 -gauge needle. 7. Prepare vaccines according to practice protocols. Tips: Refer to \"Preparing Liquid Vaccines\"3 for more details. Refer to \"Preparing Reconstituted Vaccines\"4 for more details. Use only the diluent that comes with the vaccine for reconstitution. 8. Administer vaccine(s) in the correct anatomic site per practice protocol . FIGURE 2.4. Proper 90 angle for intramuscular injection. FIGURE 2.5. Proper 45 angle for subcutaneous injection.

Click to Return Home Chapter Two Reporting Vacc ine Adverse Events California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 21 Reporting Vaccine Adverse Events Overview In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which mandates that all health -care providers report adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).1 VAERS is a safety surveillance program through which vaccine safety -related information is analyzed and disseminated to the public. Target Audience Typically front -office staff and medical assistants; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Distribute the current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #8). What is VAERS? The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is a national vaccine safety program co - sponsored by CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to CDC, while clinical trials provide important information on vaccine safety, rare side effects and delayed reactions might not be evident until the vaccine is administered to millions of people. Therefor e, the federal government established the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events following vaccination.2 According to the VAERS website, \"VAERS provides a nationwide mechanism by which adverse events following immunization may be reported, analyzed, and made available to the public. VAERS also provides a vehicle for disseminating vaccine safety -related information to parents and guardians, health care providers, vaccine manuf acturers, state vaccine programs, and other constituencies.\"3 Procedure To report vaccine adverse effects in compliance with federal and VFC Program requirements, go to https://vaers.hhs.gov/ and follow the instructions on the website.

Click to Return Home Chapter Two PATIENT VACCINATIONS 22 California VFC Program's POM, 2019 Edition Billing for Vaccine Administration Overview Providers must use screening results to ensure that only VFC -eligible children receive VFC -supplied vaccine s and that administration fees are billed as appropriate. Established patients cannot be turned away or reported to collections for inability to pay the administration fee. Target Audience Typically medical billing and coding specialists or office managers ; Immunization Champion Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Maintain all records related to the VFC Program (including billing records) for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review ( VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #4). Agree t o immunize VFC -eligible children with publicly supplied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the vaccine (P .A. #5). For Medi -Cal children, agree to accept the reimbursement for immunization administration set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans (P .A. #6). For non -Medi -Cal VFC -eligible children, agree not to charge a vaccine administration fee that e xceeds the administration fee cap of $26.03 per vaccine dose (P .A. #6). Never deny administration of a publicly purchased vaccine to an established patient because the child's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee (P.A. #7). For pharmacies, urgent care, or school located vaccine clinics, I agree to: Vaccinate all \"walk -in\" VFC to vaccinate VFC -eligible children based on a parent's inability to pay the administration fee (P.A. #12). For non -Medi -Cal, VFC -eligible children, waive the administration fee if the parent/guardian is unable to pay . Never bill parents who are unable to pay the waived administration fees (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #14F). For Medi -Cal children, never bill the difference between Medi -Cal's administration fee and the administration fee cap to the parent/guardian (P.A.A. #14G). Rationale VFC -supplied vaccine s are provi ded at no cost to both the VFC p rovider and VFC -eligible children. At no time should billing occur for the cost of VFC vaccine s. Billing for the cost of vaccines is prohibited by federal law, and billing constitute s fraud or abuse and might lead to termination from the VFC Program . Providers must never bill two different payers (i.e., patient, Medi -Cal, insurance) for the same vaccine administration fee. Best Practices Ensure clinic billing staff are familiar with VFC eligibility categories and maximum vaccine administrative fees. Provider s are encouraged to clearly outline the breakdown of fees associated with vaccine administration and office visits to prevent patient confusion. Billing for Vaccine Administration California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 23 Billing Practices Staff must accurately bill based on the eligibility categories as listed in table 8. TABLE 8 . Billing by VFC e ligibility criteria Criterion Description Medicaid eligible (or enrolled) Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee : Bill Medi -Cal\u2014not the patient . The difference between Medi -Cal's administration fee and the regional fee cannot be billed to patient . For pharmacies, administration fees must be waived because Medi -Cal does not reimburse for pharmacies. American Indian (AI) or Alaskan Native (AN) Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee : If billing, bill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS . However, this fee must be waived if the parent or guardian is unable to pay the fe e. Uninsured Cost of Vaccine: Do not bill - provided by VFC Admin Fee: If billing, bill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS . However, this fee must be waived if the parent or guardian is unab le to pay the fee. Never bill parents who are unable to pay the waived administration fees. Underinsured Cost of Vaccine : Do not bill - provided by VFC through FQHCs or RHCs ONLY Admin Fee : Medicaid -eligible ? Bill Medi -Cal; Private insurance ? Bill patient/insurance for cost of covered vaccine; otherwise, b ill the patient up to but not exceeding the current maximum regional charge set for California by CMS ; waive the fee if the parent /guardian is unable to pay the fee. Vaccine Administration Fees The p rovider's vaccine administration fee for non -Medi -Cal, VFC -eligible children must not exceed the state/territory vaccine administration fee cap established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). For current fee caps, refer to http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -2012 -11-06/pdf/2012 -26507.pdf .1 Providers will no longer be able to bill for the administration fee after the date of service. The provider must w aive the administration fee if the patient or parent is unable to pay the fee when the service is received , and the provider cannot bill the patient/parent for any waived administration fees at a later time. Unpaid administration fees may not be sent to collections, and the provider may not refuse to vaccinate an eligible child whose parents have unpaid vaccine administration fees. Providers may still continue to bill for office visits as allowed under VFC policy, and unpaid bills related to office visit fees or other fees (e.g., labs) may be sent to collections . PATIENT VACCINATIONS 24 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Other Fees In addition to vaccine administration fees, providers may charge other visit -related fees such as office visit fees. These fees should be clearly identified in the bill and thoroughly explained to prevent any confusion, misunderstandings, or allegations of abuse of publicly purchased vaccines. Fees for Combination Vaccines A combination vaccine, even if it contains several antigens, is considered one vaccine dose. The regional vaccine administration fee cap rates are established on a per -vaccine basis \u2014not a per -antigen or per -component basis . Billing with Medi - Cal as Secondary Insurance Insured children with Medi -Cal as a secondary insurance are VFC -eligible as long as they are enrolled in the state's Medi -Cal program. Billing might be done in either of two ways , as instructed by the provider or supervisor : 1. If vaccine was administered from private stock . Bill the patient's primary insurance for vaccine cost and administration. If the carrier denies payment, the provider may bill Medi -Cal for the administration fee and contact the VFC Call Center to request approval to repl ace private doses used with VFC -supplied vaccines. A copy of the carrier's denial m ust be submitted with the request. 2. If vaccine was administered from VFC doses . Bill Medi -Cal for the vaccine administration fee. There is no out -of-pocket expense for the parent or guardian with this option. Important. Providers are encouraged to choose fr om the vaccine inventory that is most cost -effective for the family and train their staff accordingly. Questions? For questions about billing for vaccine administration, contact Med -Cal directly.

Summary Both the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC ) 2 Standards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Practices and Standards for Adult Immunization Practices are calling on providers to track immunizations so they can remind parents when vaccinations are due and recall children who are past due. The followin g strategies are recommended in CDC's Pink Book to help providers raise immunization levels in their patient populations:3 Recordkeeping a. Immunization records must be accurate and up to date; active medical records should reflect current patient population . b. Ensure immunization record is up to date and tied to the child's permanent medical record. Immunization Information Systems a. Maximize use of population -based IIS s (including immunization registr ies), which are proven to increase immunization levels : i. Client reminder/recall systems ii. Provider reminder systems iii. Identif ication of missed vaccination opportunities iv. Vaccine management and accountability Best Practices with Parents and Reinforcement of Immunization 's Importance a. Strong provider recommendation for immunizations. b. Recommend age -appropriate vaccines. c. Reinforce the need to return for subsequent doses. d. Use verbal and written reminders tied to calendar events. Reminder and Recall Messages to Patients a. Issue reminder calls notifying parents that vaccines a re soon due. b. Issue recalls notifying parents that vaccines are past due. Reminder and Recall Messages to Providers a. Use internal tracking systems to remind providers of patient immunizations and raise staff awareness of the importance of checking immunization status: i. Computer -generated lists ii. Stamped note in patient charts iii. \"Immunization Due\" clip or Post -It on patient chart iv. Electronic reminders Reduction of Missed Opportunities to Vaccinate a. Reintegrate immunization and primary care to eliminate referrals. b. Consider standing orders that enable non -physician immunization personnel to vaccinate clients without direct physician involvement. c. Educate staff that concern about multiple vaccinations in t he same patient visit is not supported by scientific data; prevent unnecessary additional visits that might be a barrier for families .

Vaccine inventory management is an essential practice that can prevent inadvertent vaccine loss due to temperature excursions. Success is dependent on five key factors : 1) a complete and up -to-date vaccine management plan, 2) properly trained staff, 3) reliable vaccine storage units with sufficient capacity , 4) proper temperature monitoring with calibrated, accurate devices, and 5) careful and consistent adherence to routine tasks that protect vaccine viability . Figure 3.1 highlights key topics covered in chapter three to help practices and clinics comply with VFC Program requirements and best practices t hat protect vaccine viability and minimize loss. FIGURE 3.1. Overview of the topics of vaccine management. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 4 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Vaccine Management Plan Overview Providers agree to complete and maintain a vaccine management plan that covers routine and emergency situations. The plan details proactive responses providers and staff must take to protect vaccines and minimize vaccine loss due to negligence. Vaccine Coordinators (and Backup s) are responsible for implementing the plan , and the Provider of Record is ultimately acco untable for practice or clinic compliance. The vaccine management plan covers the topics detailed in chapters three (Vaccine Management) and four (Vaccine Orders) . Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee , Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Maintain a current and completed vaccine management plan (IMM -1122) for routine and emergency situations that includes practice -specific , vaccine - management guidelines and protocols, names of staff with temperature monitoring responsibilities, and required EZIZ lesson completion dates for all key practice staff (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #1A). Review and update the plan at least annually , when VFC Program requirements change, and when staff with designated vaccine -management res ponsibilities change (P.A.A. #1B). Designate a staff member responsible for updating the practice's management plan (P.A.A. #1C). Ensure staff with assigned vaccine -management responsibilities review, sign, and date the vaccine management plan annually a nd each time it is updated (P.A.A. #1D). Store the vaccine management plan in a location easily accessible by staff, ideally near the vaccine storage units (P.A.A. #1 E). Rational Because federally purchased vaccines are supplied to providers at no cost , providers must manage their vaccine inventory to prevent negligent loss . Providers are required to compensate the VFC Program for loss that could have been prevented \u2014on a dose -for- dose basis. Practice -Specific Protocols The VFC Program provides a template to assist providers with most vaccine -management tasks. However, practice -specific protocols will be required to direct staff to respond to common situations, such as responding to temperature excursions after hours . Document the steps staff are e xpected to follow and ensure new staff are familiar with practice protocols. Updates to Vaccine Management Plan Review and update your plan at least once a year. Ensure that all content in each section (including emergency contact information and alternat e vaccine storage location) is up to date. Key practice s taff must sign and acknowledge the signature log whenever your plan is revised. Providers must assign someone responsible for ensuring their plan is updated and ready to be executed. Keep the plan in a location easily accessible to all staff, ideally near the vaccine storage units. Vaccine Management Plan California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5 Key Practice Staff Because VFC providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , key practice staff must be knowledgeable about the plan's content and be able to respond to emergency situations. Provider of Record. Oversee key practice staff to ensure VFC Program requirements are met. Comply with all federal vaccine management requirements, including key areas outlined in this plan. Complete required EZIZ training lessons for Provider of Record . Designate one provider as the VFC Provider of Record Designee responsible for ensuring all VFC Program requirements are met when the Provider of Record is not available. Designate the VFC Vaccine Coordinator responsible for implementing and overseeing the vaccine management plan . Designate one employee as the VFC Backup Vaccine Coordinator res ponsible for vaccine management when the Vaccine Coordinator is not available. Report to the VFC Call Center any staffing change s for the Vaccine Coordinator, Backup Vaccine Coordinator, Provider of Record, and Provider of Record Designee. Meet and docum ent required annual EZIZ training lessons for the practice's vaccine management staff. Ensure that vaccine management staff are knowledgeable of VFC Program requirements for temperature monitoring and vaccine storage. Ensure that the practice's vaccine i nventory management is consistent with VFC Program requirements. Ensure that the practice's vaccine storage units and temperature monitoring devices meet VFC Program requirements. Update and revise vaccine management plan at least annually and when nece ssary. Review VFC Program requirements and management plan with staff at least annually and when necessary. The Provider of Record or Designee must be present for site visits \u2014especially during the feedback portion of the visit \u2014and sign the acknowledgemen t form. Provider of Record Designee.

Click to Return Home VFC Temperature Logs California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7 VFC Temperature Logs Overview Temperature logs are official VFC Program documents. Providers must use the most current VFC temperature logs to record temperatures for VFC -supplied vaccines . Completed logs must remain on -site and may not be falsified. Logs include a section for supervisors to review an d certify completeness; through this process, supervisors can identify staff training issues. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator & Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Ensure vaccine storage unit temperatures are recorded on VFC temperature logs (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #10A). Retain paper logs and electronic files related to temperature monitoring for three years (P.A.A. # 10I). Acknowledge that temperature logs missing during a VFC site visit but found at a later date will not be accepted (P.A.A. #9J). How to Get VFC Temperature Logs The VFC temperature logs can be printed by accessing PDF versions from EZIZ for refrigerator s (Fahrenheit1 | Celsius2) and freezer s (Fahrenheit3 | Celsius4).

Click to Return Home Chapter Three Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications Overview Vaccine storage units act as an insurance policy to protect patient s from administration of damaged vaccine s and protect practices and clinics from costly vaccine replacement due to negligent loss . Because providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , investing in reliable storage units that meet VFC P rogram requirements will likely cost less than replacing spoiled vaccines. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator & Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Never store vaccines in dormitory -style any time ( VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9B ). Use only refrigerators or freezers that comply with VFC vacc ine storage unit requirements : Very high volume providers must use purpose -built (pharmacy -, biologic -, or laboratory -grade) refrigerators. Other providers may use refrigerators and freezers that are purpose -built (preferred) or commercial -grade (acceptabl e). Household -grade , stand -alone units are discouraged. Purpose -built combination units, including auto -dispensing units without doors, are allowed (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #3A). Acknowledge that manual -defrost freezers are acceptable if the practice has access to an alternate storage unit when defrosting the freezer. The alternate storage unit must comply with VFC vaccine storage unit requirements and be monitored using a VFC -compliant digital data logger . Temporary storage of VFC - supplied vaccines in a cooler is unacceptable (P.A.A. #3B). Never us e any of the following for vaccine storage: household -grade , combination refrigerator -freezers ; compact , household -grade , stand -alone refrigerators (with capacity 11 cubic feet or less) ; dormitory -style or bar -style combination refrigerator/freezers ; manua l-defrost refrigerators ; convertible units ; cryogenic (ultra -low) freezers ; or any vaccine transport unit for routine storage (including coolers and battery -operated units) (P.A.A. #3 C). Purchase new refrigerators (purpose -built) or freezers (any grade) if existing storage units experience frequent temperature excursions jeopardizing vaccines , or malfunctioned resulting in spoiled vaccines (P.A.A. #3D). Best Practice s Use pharmacy -grade units for vaccine storage; they are purpose -built for the storage of biologics and maintain stable temperatures. Providers using pharmaceutical -grade vaccine storage units should consider purchasing a generat or to compensate for electrical -grid insufficiencies as the ir interior temperatures rise more quickly during outa ges. Purchasing New Storage Units Providers must purchase a new vaccine refrigerator or freezer if vaccine storage units do not m eet VFC Program specifications , or the practice has had storage incidents resulting in spoiled vaccine s. Refurbished units. Purchasing refurbished storage units or those o utside the warranty is discouraged. These units might not be able to maintain stable temperatu res if not properly conditioned, which puts vaccines at risk. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 10 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Key Terms Refrigerators and freezers are available in different types (stand -alone and combination) and grades (pharmaceutical, commercial, and household). Stand -alone. These types are self -contained units designed as either refrigerator -only or freezer -only and range in size from compact to very large pharmaceutical -grade units. FIGURE 3.3. Stand -alone refrigerators . FIGURE 3.4. Stand -alone upright and chest freezers . Combination. These types typically have a refrigerator and freezer with separate exterior doors , though Figure 3.6 depicts a combination unit without doors . FIGURE 3.5. Combination purpose -built storage unit. FIGURE 3. 6. Purpose -built, pharmaceutical -grade, auto - dispensing unit without doors. Purpose -built . These storage units are specifically designed to maintain consistent temperatures for storage of fragile vaccines or biologics. They are available as pharmacy -, biologic -, and laboratory -grades . (See Figure 3.6.) Commercial. These grades are intended to store food and beverag es in commercial settings. They are often larger and more powerful than household units but are not designed to store biologics . They experience some temperature fluctuations. Household. These grades are intended for food storage \u2014typically in homes and offices. Vaccine Refrigerator Specifications Providers have agreed to comply with VFC Program vaccine refrigerator specifications. Vaccine refrigerators must meet these requirements: Maintain temperatures between 3 6.0\u00baF and 46.0\u00baF (between 2.0\u00baC and 8.0\u00baC); Have enough space to store all the practice's refrigerated vaccine inventory throughout the year \u2014including during flu and back -to-school seasons; Have enough space to store water bottles to stabilize temperatures; Defrost automatically; Seal tightl y and close properly; Be used primarily for vaccine storage. If necessary, medications or biologic s (not inoculated) may be stored on the shelves below vaccines. Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Vaccine Freezer Specifications Providers have agreed to comply with VFC Program vaccine freezer specifications. Vaccine freezers must meet these requirements: Maintain consistent temperatures between -58.0\u00b0F and +5.0\u00baF (between -50.0\u00b0C and -15.0\u00baC); Be a stand -alone unit; Have enough space to store all the practice's frozen vaccines along with sufficient frozen cold packs t o stabilize temperatures; Defrost automatically (manual is acceptable if the practice has access to an alternate storage unit when defrosting the freezer; the alternate storage unit must be able to maintain recommended temperatures and be monitored using a VFC -compliant data logger; temporary storage of vaccines in a cooler is unacceptable); Seal tightly and close properly; Be used only for vaccine storage. Acceptable Vaccine Storage Units Refrigerators. Not all refrigerators are designed to maintain proper temperatures that protect vaccine viability. When evaluating existing or shopping for new vaccine refrigerators, refer to table 2 to determine required grade and type by practice volume. TABLE 2. Vacci ne refrigerators by practice volume Grade (Type) Rating Description Practice Volume Pharmacy -, biologic -, or laboratory -grade (any) Best Purpose -built to maintain consistent temperatures for storage of fragile vaccines or biologics.

Any practice Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 13 Unacceptable Vaccine Storage Units Refrigerators with cooling plates or coils are not allowed. T able 4 lists storage units that do not meet VFC Program requirements and may not be used to store VF C-supplied vaccines. TABLE 4. Unacceptable storage units Type Comments Compact household refrigerator (stand -alone) Small, under -the-counter, stand -alone refrigerators with a capacity of 11 cubic feet or less are not allowed. Household combination refrigerator/freezer Household combination units have one compressor with poor temperature control. They can pose a risk to refrigerated vaccines because cold air from the freezer is vented into the refrigerator and can freeze vaccines. The freezer portions of many combination units are not capable of maintaining the consistent temperature for frozen vaccines. Dormitory -style and bar-style combined refrigerator/freezers These units have a single exterior door and an evaporator plate/cooling coil, usually located in an icema ker/freezer compartment. These units pose a significant risk of freezing \u2014even when used for temporary storage. Manual -defrost refrigerators These models have a vertical cooling plate at the back of the refrigerator, which poses potential risk of significant temperature variation and freezing vaccines. Convertible units These units have an internal switch that converts an all - refrigerator unit to an all -freezer unit. Cryogenic freezers These units reach temperatures well below -58.0\u00b0F . Transport units Coolers and battery -operated units may not be used for routine vaccine storage. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Final Considerations before Purchasing Storage Units Before purchasing a storage unit, make sure it will fit in a space that meets VFC Program requirements and best practices. Vaccine storage units should be placed in rooms with good air circulation; away from public spaces, direct sunlight , and any heat sources; plugged directly into a nearby, dedicated wall outlet that does not have built -in GFI circuit switches and is not controlled by a light switch; and with at least 4 inches of space around the top, back , and sides. The unit to be purchased must have sufficient storage space to accommodate vaccine stock at the busiest time of year without overcrowding. If yo u are unclear about vaccine storage unit requirements, contact your VFC Field Representative prior to making a purchase. Click to Return Home Chapter Three Configuring Vaccine Storage Units California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 15 Configuring Vaccine Storage Units Overview Vaccine s torage units should be organized for efficiency and with preparations to stabilize interior temperatures. Carefully grouping and label ing vaccines reduce s time spent searching for vaccines, administration errors , and vaccine exposur e to room temperatures. Filling empty interior spaces with water bottles or cold packs also preserves cold mass and helps reduce the frequency of temperature excursions . Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Prepare vaccine refrigerators (IMM -962) and vaccine freezers (IMM -965) following VFC Program requirements (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #4A). Place water bottles (in refrigerators) and ice packs (in freezers only) to stabilize tempera tures. (Exception for purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors.) (P.A.A. # 4B). Place buffered probes in the center of the refrigerator and freezer near vaccines. (Exception for purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors.) (P.A.A. # 4C). Place the data logger's digital display outside the storage unit s to allow temperature monitoring without opening vaccine storage unit door s. (Exception for purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors.) (P.A.A. # 4D). Plug the vaccine refrigerator and freezer directly into nearby, dedicated wall outlet s that do not have built -in GFI circuit switches and are not controlled by light switch es; never plug vaccine storage units into extension cords , or power strips or surge protectors with an on/off swit ch. (P.A.A. # 4E). Post \"Do Not Unplug \" (IMM -744) signs on the electrical outlets and circuit breakers to prevent interruption of power (P.A.A. # 4F). Set up vaccine refrigerators (IMM -963) and vaccine freezers (IMM -966) following VFC Program requirements (P.A.A. # 4G). Clearly identify VFC -suppli ed and privately purchased vaccines. Designate and label separate shelf space or mesh baskets (P.A.A. # 4H). Clearly label shelves or baskets to group vaccines by pediatric, adolescent, and adult types (P.A.A. # 4I). Allocate enough space to position vaccine s or baskets 2 -3 inches away from walls, storage unit floor, and other baskets to allow space for air circulation. (Exception for purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors.) (P.A.A. # 4J). Post VFC temperature logs on vaccine storage unit doors or in an easily accessible location (P.A.A. # 4K). Rationale Careful preparation and setup of vaccine storage units is the first step of a well -organized vaccine management plan designed to minimize preventable vaccine loss. Best Practice s Store vaccines with similar packaging or names on different shelves to lessen risk of administration errors. Never store refrigerated vaccines near cooling vents, which can result in freezing of these vaccines. Purchase plastic mesh baskets for all vaccines identified in the practice's provider profile to organize vaccines for easy access. If the practice is in an area that experiences frequent power outages, consider an emergency power generator and then test it regularly with staff. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 16 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Large hospitals and health -care systems can demonstrate their power source is protected by providing comprehensive policies and standard operating procedures to prevent v accine storage units from being physically disconnected from the power supply. Placement Considerations Locate vaccine storage units away from public spaces, direct sunlight, and any heat sources. Ensure each storage unit has its own dedicated wall outlet to ensure all vaccines aren't at risk if a breaker is tripped. Do not use outlets controlled by wall switches or outlets with built -in circuit breakers because power can easily be interrupted. Position storage units to allow good air circulation aro und the top, sides, and back. Procedure: Preparing Storage Units Storage units must be prepared to maintain stable temperatures before storing vaccines. The concepts are identical for both refrigerators and freezers. Follow these instructions to prepare vaccine storage units in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices. TABLE 5. Instructions for preparation of vaccine storage units Step Description 1. Protect the power supply. A. Plug each storage unit into its dedicated wall outlet. B. Do NOT use multi -outlet power strips or extension cords, or outlets with GFI circuit switches (have reset buttons between plugs) . C. Protect the power supply by securing the plug with a guard or cover and posting \"Do Not Unplug \" signs1 near the outlet. D. Label fuses and circuit breakers so the Vaccine Coordinator is alerted if power goes off. 2. Add plenty of water bottles (refrigerators) or cold packs (freezers only ) in unstable areas to help maintain recommended temperatures during busy days and power outages . Add them : A. On the top shelf, but don't block the air vents. B. On the unit's floor. (For household stand -alone units, remov e drawers and bin s before adding water bottles. ) C. In any door shelves. Configuring Vaccine Storage Units California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 17 Tip: Also add them along the back wall to prevent vaccines from touching the back of the storage unit. (For purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors, water bottles and cold packs are not needed.) 3. Set up a data logger for each storage unit. A. Place the buffered probe in the center of the storage unit near the vaccines. B. Place or mount the digital display so temperatures can be read without opening the storage unit door. C. Thread the probe's cable through the side of the door and attach it to the digital display. (For purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors, internal data loggers must meet VFC Program requirements. Refer to \"Data Logger Specifications\" for details. ) 4. Ensure the data logger is recording storage unit temperatures \u2014not room temperature. Tip: Some devices might display \"REC\" or \"RECORDING\" if recording internal storage unit temperatures. 5. Set storage unit temperatures. For refrigerators. If the thermostat is set to Fahrenheit, set it at 40 F. If it has a dial with a range of settings, adjust the temperature dial as needed. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 18 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition For freezers. If the thermostat is set to Fahrenheit, set it below 0 F. If it has a dial, set it to the coldest. 6. Post VFC -supplied temperature logs on the corresponding refrigerator or freezer door to prevent recording temperatures on the wrong logs. 7. Configure the data logger to meet VFC Program requirements. (Refer to \"Configuring Data Loggers.\" ) 8. Follow the instructions in TABLE 6 to set up vaccine storage units while waiting for temperature s to stabilize. Procedure: Setting Up Vaccine Storage Units Proper setup involves organizing the storage unit interiors for efficiency. It also reduces time spent with doors open searching for vaccines. The concepts are identical for both refrigerators and freezers . For purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors: Follow manufacturer's instructions for setup of vaccine storage units. Follow these step -by-step instructions to set up storage unit interior spaces to comply with VFC Program requirements and best practices. TABLE 6. Instructions for setup of vaccine storage units Step Description 1. Clearly identify VFC -supplied and privately purchased vaccines. Consider designating separate shelf sp ace (or breathable mesh baskets). 2. Designate separate shelf space or baskets to group vaccines (such as by pediatric, adolescent, and adult types ) to prevent administration errors. 3. Position vaccines or baskets 2 -3 inches away from walls, floor, and other baskets to allow space for air circulation. Tip: Do not stack baskets on top of each other as this reduces air circulation around the vaccines. Configuring Vaccine Storage Units California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 19 4. Set up space for diluents in the refrigerator or at room temperature according to manufacturer recommendations. Tips: When diluents are packaged with vaccines, store them together. Store diluents with similar packaging or names on different shelves to le ssen risk of administration errors. Otherwise, clearly label diluents and store where they can be easily identified and retrieved. 5. If storage of medications or biologic s is necessary, store them below the vaccines and on a different shelf to prevent contamination of vaccines due to spills. 6. Label your baskets or shelf space to make vaccines easy to find for administration. Tip: Plan to store vaccines with similar packaging or names on different shelves to lessen ri sk of administration errors. 7. Once storage unit temperatures have stabilized, record CURRENT, MIN, and MAX temperatures on the appropriate VFC temperature log twice a day\u2014until all three temperatures remain in the OK range for three to five days. (Refer to \"Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures.\" ) Important. OK range for refrigerated vaccines is 36.0\u00baF and 46.0\u00baF (between 2.0\u00baC and 8.0\u00baC) . OK range for frozen vaccines is between -58.0\u00baF and +5.0\u00baF (between -50.0\u00baC and -15.0\u00baC) . 8. Store vaccines in the storage units following VFC Program requirements and best practices . (Refer to \"Storing ) VACCINE MANAGEMENT 20 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Routine Maintenance Regular care helps ensure that vaccine refrigerators and freezers work properly. Follow these step -by-step instructions to maintain vaccine storage units. TABLE 7. Instructions for cleaning vaccine storage units Step Description 1. Do not unplug the storage unit. 2. Wipe the inside of compartment s and shelves with disinfectant or antibacterial wipes. Do not remove vaccines from the storage unit to clean it. Move the trays of vaccines as shelves are wiped . Return vaccines to their designated location . 3. Check door seals to ensure no gaps allow cool air to escape . Locate and examine door seals. Ensure seals are not torn or brittle. Ensure there are no gaps when the door is shut . Report any issues to the super visor. 4. Clean outside coils and motor. Use a duster to remove dust from coils . Plan to defrost manual -defrost vaccine freezers if about one inch of ice has built up. TABLE 8. Instructions for defrosting manual -defrost vaccine freezers Step Description Plan Ahead 1. Ensure there is enough space to accommodate vaccines in an alternate on - site freezer (e.g., the breakroom freezer). Remove any food. If the freezer cannot accommodate the practice's vaccines, make plans to transport vaccines to the alternate storage location identified in the practice's vaccine management plan. Do not store vaccines in coolers while defrosting the freezer. 2. Install the backup data logger in the alternate freezer. Check device settings to ensure LO /HI temperature alarm alerts are set between -58.1\u00b0F ( -50.1\u00b0C) and +5.1\u00b0F ( -14.9\u00b0C). Ensure the device is set to begin recording storage unit temperatures. 3. Wait for the device to register the internal freezer temperature. 4. Adjust freezer thermostat if temperatures are outside the required range. Do not transfer VFC vaccines until temperatures have stabilized within the required range. 5. Defrosting of the freezer should start at the beginning of the workday so vaccines can be returned to their orig inal unit before the practice closes. Configuring Vaccine Storage Units California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 21 Defrost Your Freezer 1. Transfer frozen vaccines to the alternate on -site freezer and close the door. 2. Defrost the freezer following the practice's preferred method identified in the practice's vaccine management plan \u2014if different from steps below. Unplug the storage unit. Open the freezer door. Place shallow pans, towels, or paper towels to absorb melting ice. Heat a bowl of water and place it in the freezer to speed up the melting process; re heat the water every 15 minutes or so. Use an ice scraper and carefully remove melting ice to speed up the process; be careful not to puncture freezer walls. Final Steps 1. After the freezer has defrosted, clean interior surfaces with soap and water. Rinse the soap off and wipe down thoroughly. Dry interior thoroughly. Wipe down the door seals. 2. Plug in the freezer. 3. Allow the internal temperature to stabilize between -58.1\u00b0F ( -50.1\u00b0C) and +5.1\u00b0F ( -14.9\u00b0C). 4.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 22 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Data Logger Specification s Overview Continuous temperature monitoring is an essential component of each provider's vaccine management plan, but data logger reliability is the critica l factor that helps to ensure vaccine viability. VFC Program specifications ensure vaccines will be accurately and reliably monitored if provider s used compliant devices. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator & Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Temperature monitoring devices must meet CDPH and handling requirements ( VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9). Equip all refrigerators and freezers (primary, backup, overflow, or any other temporary unit) storing VFC -supplied vaccines with VFC -compliant digital data loggers . (For purpose -built, auto -dispensing units without doors: Built -in, internal data loggers must meet VFC Program requirements \u2014except for buffered probes, which are not required.) (California VFC Program \"Prov ider Agreement Addendum\" #5A). Ensure all data loggers include the following minimum features: a digital display of current, minimum, and maximum temperatures; minimum accuracy of \u00b11.0\u00b0F (0.5\u00b0C); a buffered temperature probe (use only the one that comes with the device) immersed in a vial filled with up to 60mL liquid (e.g., glycol, ethanol, glycerin), loose media (e.g., sand, glass beads), or a solid block of material (e.g., Teflon\u00ae, aluminum); an out -of-range temperature alarm; logging interval of at least 30 minutes; a low -battery indicator; and memory storage of 4,000 readings or more . A battery source is required for backup devices used during vaccine transport (P.A.A. # 5C).Keep on hand at least one backup, battery -operated digital data logger for emergency vaccine transport. (Depending on the size of the practice, additional devices might be needed.) (P.A.A. #5B) Keep on hand at least one backup, battery -operated digital data l ogger for emergency vaccine transport. (Depending on the size of the practice, additional devices might be needed.) (P.A.A. #5 C) Rationale Investing in reliable, VFC -compliant temperature monitoring devices is less expensive than replacing vaccines spoiled due to inaccurate temperature readings. Best Practices Providers should choose Fahrenheit (F) or Celsius (C) scale for all storage units. \"2-point\"temperature calibration testing satisfies VFC Program requirements. (\"Calibration test points\" refer to the number of points used to test the accuracy of data loggers across the temperature spectrum .) Purpos e-Built, Auto -Dispensing Units without Doors These storage units might contain multiple built -in, digital data loggers to accurately monitor temperatures throughout the storage unit. These internal devices must meet VFC Program requirements . Contact a VFC P rogram Field Representative with concerns or questions. Backup Devices Practices are required to keep on hand at least one backup, battery -operated digital data logger for use if the primary device breaks or does not meet calibration requirements, or for use during emergency vaccine transport. Depending on the size of the practice, additional devices might be needed. Data Logger Specifications California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 23 Key Terms Digital Data Logger (DDL).

Update the practice's vaccine management plan with the primary and backup device s' relevant information. 13. Begin using the new device to record storage unit temperatures after 3-5 days of practice and use. Routine Maintenance Normal wear and tear. Periodically inspect primary and backup data loggers. Routinely check cables and probes to verify they are not damaged. Replace batteries on a regular schedule. If a data logger is dropped, hit against the side of a storage unit, or potentially damaged in any other way, verify its accuracy against another calibrated data logger. Calibration testing. Because all temperature monitoring devices experience over time a \"drift\" that affects their accuracy, calibrate primary and backup dev ices (device and probe) annually, or every other year when manufacturers recommend a period longer than two years. Devices must be certified for accuracy at most every two years \u2014even if the certificate of calibration extends to more than two years. Calibra tion testing might be performed on -site or shipped to a laboratory that meets VFC Program requirements , 1 ideally to a laboratory with accreditation from an ILAC MRA signatory body. If there is any question about a device's accuracy, have the device calibrated or purchase a new one. Calibrate primary and backup devices on different schedules to ensure vacc ines are always monitored by working devices. When to replace devices. If calibration testing indicates that a data logger is no longer accurate within +/ -0.5\u00b0 C (+/ -1.0\u00b0 F), the device must be replaced. Keep in mind that purchasing a new device might be less expensive than calibration testing. If a device or probe is damaged, replace the entire device. Procedure Follow these step -by-step instructions for calibration testing of existing temperature monitoring devices. TABLE 1 2. Instructions for device calibration testing Step Description 1. For each vaccine refrigerator and freezer, confirm that existing data loggers meet current VFC Program specifications . Do not rely solely on device photo.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 32 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Receiving Vaccine Deliveries Overview Vaccine shipments must never be rejected. Providers must open and verify vaccine packages immediately and store vaccines in the appropriate storage units. Once delivered, practices and clinics assume responsibility for ensuring that vaccines are stored in temperature -controlled environments. Shipments that are mishandled after delivery are considered negligent losses, and a replacement vaccine order might not be expedited. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup, or staff designated in the provider's vaccine management plan with responsibilities for receiving vaccines Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #13). Account for every dose of VFC -supplied vaccine ordered and received by the provider's practice (California VFC \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #7D). Never reject vaccine shipments (P.A.A. #8A). Receive, inspect, and store vaccines and diluent s within manufacturer recommended ranges immediately upon delivery (P.A.A. # 8B). Inspect vaccines for out -of-range temperatures and shipping times during transport (P.A.A. # 8C). Check package co ntents to ensure funding source, brands, and quantities match packing slip s and approved VFC order s (P.A.A. # 8D). Report immediately all shipment issues using the VFC \"Vaccine Receiving Log and Check list\" (IMM -1112) (P.A.A. # 8E). Keep packing slips for all vaccine shipments received, including publicly funded and private vaccine shipments (P.A.A. # 8F). Ensure the practice is open with the appropriate staff available to receive vaccines at least one day a week (other than Monday) and for at least four consecutive hours (P.A.A. # 8G). Rationale Each vaccine shipment might contain thousands of dollars of vaccines that ensure practices have sufficient inventory to vaccin ate patients. Following proper procedures help s to ensure vaccines are viable and minimize s risk of negligent loss. Mishandling might lead to costly vaccines losses and missed opportunities to vaccinate. Best Practices When placing vaccine orders, make sure the practice 's open hours are up to date. If a delivery is made while the practice is closed and the result is a vaccine loss, the practice might be held financially accountable for the vaccines. When a notification of order approval is received, alert practice staff of the delivery window. Additionally, it is strongly encouraged that practice s cancel any signature release on file. Otherwise, Fed -Ex or UPS might drop off vaccine shipme nts without a signature \u2014regardless of office hours. Receiving Vaccine Deliveries California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 33 Refrigerated Vaccines Refrigerated vaccines are shipped by McKesson Specialty and are shipped with two monitor indicators: a cold indicator (FREEZEmarker\u00ae) and a warm indicator (3M MonitorMark) that alert the recipient if vaccine s were exposed to out -of-range temperatures. Monitor indicators come with instructions on use .1 Cold Indicator Warm Indicator FIGURE 3. 8. Illustration of temperature indicators. Frozen Vaccines Frozen vaccines (varicella -containing products) are shipped directly from Merck . Although there is no temperature indicator, the shipper insert indicates a \"delivery by date ,\" which must be checked to ensure shipment arrived during the specified window. Vaccine diluents might be packaged separately from its vaccine. Check the lid of the shipping container if diluents appear to be missing. Shipper inserts. The shipping time indicate s how many days proper temperatures will be maintained from the shipment date shown on the packing slip. If vaccine shipments exceed that shipping time , vaccines might no longer be viable. Call the vaccine manufacturer for assistance and report the issue to the VFC Call Center . FIGURE 3. 9. Illustration of shipper insert. Partial Shipments Occasionally, packages on a single order might arrive in separate deliver ies due to temporary vaccine supply issues and backorders. Partial shipments are considered \"temporarily incomplete.\" The doses will ship when the vaccine s become available. The VFC Program will notify the practice on the order confirmation in the event of partial shipments. Special -Order Vaccines In limited situations in which ordering for a single -dose vaccine is allowed, McKesson will repackage the vaccine using amber bags , which count as original packaging. These bags offer protection for light -sensitive vaccines. Vaccines should remain in these bags in th e vaccine refrigerator until ready to be administered. Verification of Practice Hours The Vaccine Coordinator should request delivery during office hours and update vaccine orders to reflect any period of time the office will be closed, such as holiday s or scheduled vacation tim e. Ensure the clinic is open with the appropriate staff available to receive VACCINE MANAGEMENT 34 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition vaccines at least one day a week (other than Monday) and for at least four consecutive hours. In the event the practice or clinic will be closed unexpec tedly and a delivery is expected, the practice should contact the VFC Call Center to verify the shipping status. If the order is already in transit , the practice must make alternate arrangements to accept and properly store the vaccines . The VFC Call Cente r cannot stop the shipment. Packing Slips When receiving vaccine deliveries, check the packing slips carefully to determine the number of doses that shipped by funding source (e.g. , VFC) . Doses and vaccines on the packing slip should match the VFC order confirmation. Packing slips also indicate the vaccine expiration dates, which can be used to identify any vaccines that should be used up or transferred within six months. FIGU RE 3. 10. Sample McKesson packing slip with funding source s. What to Do with Questionable Deliveries Delivered vaccines that are questionable (either were exposed to out-of-range temperatures or received outside the shipping time specified on the shipper insert ) must be labeled \"Do Not Use\" and stored in vaccine refrigerators or freezers \u2014separate from the rest of the vaccine stock \u2014until the VFC Call Center provides additional instructions. FIGURE 3.1 1. Illustration of questiona ble delivery separate d from rest of the vaccine stock.

Tips: Follow the instructions on the McKesson temperature indica tors .1 If the MonitorMark index reads 3 -5, record the number on the log . If the FREEZEmarker indicator does not show a check mark or is not activated, note the issue on the receiving log. 5. For frozen vaccines : A. Check the shipper insert and the packing slip's shipment date to determine if the vaccines are still good ; note the receiving log if the shipment arrived beyond the allowed time. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 36 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 6. Check the packing slip for discrepancies. A. Ensure shipment's vaccines and quantities match the packing slip for the correct funding source (e.g., VFC). B. Compare packing slip to the approved doses and diluents on the e-mailed VFC order confirmation \u2014not the original order . C. Check the Brand Received on the checklist. D. If vaccine products and quantities are not accurate, document the \"# Doses Missing \" or \"# Diluent Missing\", or the \"# Extra Doses \" on the receiving log . (Check the container carefully as diluents might be shipped in the top compartment of the shipping container.) 7. For each vaccine, note on the receiving log any vaccines or diluents with expiration dates within six months . 8. Use VFC stickers3 to label the vaccines to identify VFC vaccines from other funding sources. Tip. Labels help to identify to which baskets vaccines should be returned to prevent mixing up funding sources. 9. Store vaccines and diluents immediately. A. Store vaccines with the earliest expiration dates in front of vaccine s with later expiration dates. (Refer to \"Storing Vaccines.\" ) 10.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 41 Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures Overview Twice daily temperature monitoring helps to prevent loss of expensive vaccines and the potential need for revaccination of patients by identify ing out-of-range temperatures quickly and allow ing immediate corrective action . Temperature monitoring is dependent on four key factor s: 1) well -trained staff, 2) reliable and accurate equipment, 3) complete documentation, and 4) appropriate follow -up for any out -of-range temperatures. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator an d Backup, or staff designated in the provider's vaccine management plan with responsibilities for monitoring storage unit temperatures Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #13). Ensure vaccin e storage unit temperatures are recorded on VFC temperature logs (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #10A). Monitor and record current, minimum , and maximum temperatures ( Fahrenheit IMM -1029 | Celsius IMM -1029C) in vaccine refrigerators and freezers twice each day: at the beginning and end of each business day \u2014even though using digital data loggers; for any VFC -approved mass vaccination and outreach clinics, monitor and record temperatures every hour and attach the data logger download (or summary re port if available) to the transport log (P.A.A. # 10B). Ensure staff respond to all data logger alarms by reporting temperature excursions to SHOTS (Storage and Handling Online Triage System) (P.A.A. #10C). Download and review temperature data files for ou t-of-range temperatures at the end of every two -week reporting period \u2014or sooner if an excursion is identified. Look for temperature trends that might indicate storage unit performance issues (P.A.A. # 10D ). Acknowledge that if temperatures are not monitore d and documented, or if temperature logs or downloaded data files are missing or falsified, all affected vaccines will be automatically deemed non -viable and considered a negligent vaccine loss (P.A.A. # 10E ). Ensure VFC temperature logs are legible, and co mpleted accurately and in ink (P.A.A. # 10F). Neatly cross out, correct, initial, and date any inadvertent documentation error immediately (P.A.A. # 10G). Ensure the supervisor certifies and signs that temperatures were recorded twice daily, staff printed names and initials, and corrective actions were taken when the VFC temperature log is complete for each two-week reporting period (P.A.A. #10H) . Retain pap er logs and electronic files related to temperature monitoring for three years (P.A.A. # 10I). Acknowledge that temperature logs missing during a VFC site visit but found at a later date will not be accepted (P.A.A. #10J). Rationale Vaccines are expensive and fragile. Excessive cold and heat can damage vaccines and impact vaccine viability . Consistently and accurately monitoring storage unit temperatures helps to prevent negligent loss of vaccines and provider liability . Getting Familiar with Da ta Loggers All key practice staff monitoring storage unit temperatures must be trained on how to operate the practice's data loggers and interpret their temperature readings. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 42 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Preparing new data loggers for use. Refer to the device's product guide or vid eo to get familiar with its functionality . Call the vendor's support number with all questions regarding setup, functionality, or configuration. Refer to \"Data Logger Setup & Use\"1 for guidance on how to use the device to monitor temperatures according to VFC Program requirements. Patient & Provider Benefits Consistent and accurate monitoring of vaccine storage unit temperatures benefits both patients and providers: Helps ensure vaccines protect pat ients from preventable diseases Helps ensure vaccines are av ailable when patients need them Helps ensure ordering privileges aren't put on hold until storage and hand ling incidents are resolved Minimizes time -consuming revaccination rec alls for patients wh o received ineffective vaccines Importance of Staff Training All staff who monitor vaccine storage temperatures \u2014including supervisors who certify staff documentation \u2014must be properly trained on temperature monitoring, use of the practice's data loggers , and the required actions for out-of-range temperatures \u2014even if temperature monitoring is not their routine activity . Because of the importance of temperature monitoring, practices must update their v accine management plan each year (and whenever changes are made ) to i nclude the names and signatures of staff with temperature monitoring responsibilities , as well as the da tes they complete d the required EZIZ training lesson s. Definitions of Key Terms Temperature excursion s. Manufacturers might refer to out-of-range temperatures (either too warm or too cold) as temperature excursions. Staff communicating with manufacturers should be familiar with this term. CURRENT. Internal storage unit temperature now. MIN. Minimum (c oldest ) storage unit temperature since the data logger was reset. MAX. Maximum (warmest) storage unit temperature since the data logger was reset. FIGURE 3.1 2. Illustration of digital display showing current, MIN, and MAX temperatures . How Temperature Excurs ions Affect Vaccine Viability Repeated exposures to temperatures that are too warm can affect vaccine viability gradually. A single exposure to temperatures that are too cold might destroy vaccines immediately . FIGURE 3.1 3. Illustrations depicting how vaccine s might be damaged by too warm and too cold temperatures. Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 43 Acceptable Storage Unit Temperatures Maintain these recommended temperature ranges , which are designated as the OK range on the VFC refrigerator and freezer temperature logs : Refrigerator: Between 3 6.0\u00b0F and 46.0\u00b0F (between between -50.0\u00b0 C and -15.0\u00b0C). These temperature ranges allow for normal temperature fluctuations caused by opening and closing of storage unit door s and automatic defrost cycles. Taking Corrective Actions for Out- of-Range Temperatures If storage unit temperatures drift out of range, take immediate action to assess the situation and prevent vaccine spoilage. All temperature excursions (out -of-range temperatures) must be reported to the Storage and Handling Online Triage System (SHOTS) at MyVFCvaccines.org . The system guides providers through the documentation process and determines whether it is necessar y to contact vaccine manufacturers. (Refer to \"Taking Action for Temperature Excursions.\" ) Alarm Alerts Do not ignore alarm alerts. If temperature alarms go off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until it has been confirmed as a false alarm. Take these steps: 1. Ensure the alarm alert is set to the correct LO/HI temperature alarm limits. (Refer to Figure 3.1 4.) 2. Check the storage unit door and its power supply and thermostat setting. FIGURE 3.1 4. Illustration of VFC job aid highlighting LO/HI alarm limit settings . If alarm s continue to go off frequently after taking these steps , contact the device manufacturer for guidance . Important. Report all temperature excursions to ensure vaccines are viable. (Refer to \"Taking Action for Temperature Excursions\" for details.) Attention Supervisors Supervisors are responsible for reviewing comp leted temperature logs and certifying that staff are monitoring and documenting temperatures according to VFC Program requirements. Because temperature log review allows supervisors to identify any training gaps , supervisors must be knowledgeable about pro per temperature monitoring. (Refer to the EZIZ \"Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures\"2 lesson for training. ) Supervisors must review completed temperature logs at the end of each two-week reporting period. Look for a pattern that might indicate storage unit performance issues . Contact the VFC Field Representative or the VFC Call Center for guidance to resolve any issues before vaccines are damaged. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 44 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Follow the step -by-step instructions to monitor s torage unit temperatures in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices. TABLE 1 5. Instructions for monitor ing storage unit temperatures Step Description 1. For each new sheet, fill out month, year, refrigerator location ID, and VFC PIN. A. Use the Fahrenheit or Celsius VFC temperature log that matches the data logger settings . B. Document all readings in ink \u2014not pencil. C. If mistakes are made, cross out, correct, initial , and date the changes. 2. Record the time and your initials next to the current day of the month . a.m. temperatures before open ing the refrigerator or freezer p.m. temperatures about an hour before the practice closes to allow time for corrective actions 3. Record a check if a visible or audible alarm went off. Tip. If an alarm did not go off , leave blank. 4. Record CURRENT, MIN, and MAX temperatures neatly, accurately, and in the correct columns. Tip. Refer to the data logger's product guide or video to learn how to use the device . Call the vendor's support number for all questions regarding setup, functionality, or configuration. Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 45 If no alarm: 1. Clear MIN and MAX to ensure staff don't record the same temperatures during the next recording. Tip. Skip this step if the device resets automatically. 2. Ensure the data logger is in place and recording storage unit temperatures . Tip. Some devices might need to be reconnected and restarted. Refer to the device 's product guide for details . If an alarm went off: Take immediate action and report any excursions to SHOTS at MyVFCvaccines.org . (Refer to \"Taking Action for Temperature Excursions\" for details.) VACCINE MANAGEMENT 46 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Supervisor 's Review Supervisors must certify and sign that temperatures were recorded twice daily and corrective actions taken for each two -week log : FIGURE 3.1 5. Illustration of fields to be completed by the supervisor. When log is complete: 1. Ensure staff recorded month and year, storage u nit location ID, and VFC PIN at the top of the log. Tip. Temperature l ogs faxed to the VFC Call Center without the practice's VFC PIN might delay vaccine order processing. 2. Ensure temperatures were recorded twice daily. 3. Download and review temperature d ata files for all days on the log and r ecord the download date. Tip. Supervisors might find missed excursions that could impact vaccine viability by downloading data files for days not reported. 4. If missed excursions are found, report them immediately to SHOTS at MyVFCvaccines.org . 5. Ensure staff know that falsifying logs is grounds for vaccine replacement and provider termination from the VFC Program. 6. Certify the review by recording supervisor name, signature, and date. 7. Ensure names and initials of staff recording temperatures on this log have been recorded in case VFC representatives have questions about the temperature log. Importance of Staff Tr aining Vaccines viability might be compromised by inconsistent or inaccurate temperature monitoring. The supervisor review is an opportunity to ensure staff understand and are following proper protocol that protects provider vaccines. If errors are found, review the step -by-step procedure with staff, or instruct them to retake the EZIZ \"Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures\" lesson2 on temperature monitoring. Temperature Monitoring at Mass Vaccination & Outreac h Clinics Since vaccines are maintained in a temporary location during pre-approved mass vaccination and outreach clinics , temperature data must be monitored and recorded using a data logger \u2014every hour during the clinic day. Print the relevant excursion data from the temperature data file (or summary report if available) and a ttach it to the \"Hourly Vaccine Temperature Log for Mass Vaccination Clinics .\"3 Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 47 Repercussions of Improper Temperature Monitoring Vaccines not stored at recommended temperatures might be deemed non -viable and the provider held financially accountable for the spoiled vaccine s. Improper temperature monitoring includes not recording tem peratures, not taking appropriate actions for out - of-range temperatures, and not ensuring staff are adequately trained. Falsifying VFC temperature logs also constitutes improper temperature monitoring. Improper temperature monitoring might include but is not limited to the following consequences: Patients might receive non -viable v accine s and remain unprotected from vaccine - preventable diseases . Patients could need to be recalled and revaccinated, which can take a significant amount of clinic resources, m anpower, and time. Spoiled VFC vaccines and private vaccines could amount to an enormous monetary loss to both the p ractice and to the VFC Program. The provider might be held financially accountable for the spoiled vaccine s; doses lost must be compensated dose by d ose at the private sector cost.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 48 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Taking Action for Temperature Excursions Overview Staff must immediately prevent use of vaccines exposed to out -of-range temperatures and notify relevant staff . Any temperature excursion must be documented and reported to MyVFCvaccines . The information reported on storage and handling incidents is used to determine whether a vaccine is likely to be viable and can be administered to patients. Timely and accurate reporting of temperature excursions is essential to a successful determination of vaccine viability. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup, or staff designated in the provider's vaccine management plan with responsibilities for monitoring storage unit temperatures Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Ensure staff respond to all data logger alarms by reporting temperature excursions to SHOTS (Storage and Handling Online Triage System) (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #10C). Take immediate action to prevent vaccine spoilage and correct any improper storage condition for all out -of-range storage unit temperatures (P.A.A. #11A). Mark as \"Do Not any vaccines exposed to out -of-range temperatures (P.A.A. #11B). Download and review temperature data files for every temperature excursion (P.A.A. #1 1C). Accurately document all out -of-range temperatures to SHOTS on MyVFCvaccines (P.A .A. #1 1D). Do not administer vaccines until vaccine viability has been determined by vaccine manufacturers (P.A.A. #11E). Transport vaccines in the event of extended power outages or unit malfunctions following the guidelines for proper refrigerated vaccine transport (IMM -983) and frozen vaccine transport (IMM -1130) (P.A.A. #1 1F). Reporting Excursions on MyVFCvaccines Staff must respond to all data logger alarms by reporting temperature excursions to VFC Program's Storage and Handling Online Triage System (SHOTS). SHOTS allows providers to document temperature excursions and details. If vaccine quarantine is needed, the system directs providers to the manufacturers who determine vaccine viability. Never discard vaccines until advised by the practice's VFC Field Representative or the VFC Call Center. In the event of an excursion, providers must provide incident details including length of tempe rature excursion, minimum and maximum temperatures, and possible cause. Manufacturers might request an inventory of the affected vaccines. SHOTS can be accessed at MyVFCvaccines.org . (Refer to the \"Storage and Handling Triage System (SHOTS) \" job aid1 for details.) Taking Action for Temperature Excursions California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 49 Procedure Follow the step -by-step instructions to report temperature excursions in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices. Contact the vendor for questions about data logger use. TABLE 16. Instructions for reporting temperature excursions Step Description If an alarm went off : 1. Clear the MIN/MAX and any alarm symbol. Tip. This step ensures staff don't report the same excursion during the next recording; s kip this step if your device resets automatically. 2. Post the \"Do Not Use Vaccines\" sign to quarantine all vaccines. Tip. This step ensures vaccines are not administered until SHOTS or the vaccine manufacturer determines vaccines are okay to administer . 3. Alert your supervisor that vaccines might have been damaged by out -of-range temperatures and may not be used until the incident has been resolved. 4. Immediately report the temperature excursion to SHOTS at MyVFCvaccines.org and follow all instructions given. A. Download and save the temperature data file to the folder created for the device. (For example, Injection_Room_ FRIDGE \\ 2019 \\JAN.) (Refer to \"Configuring Data Loggers\" for guidance on setting up folders for data storage.) Tip. Specify a filename that includes VFC P IN, storage unit ID, and current date. For example: 012345_ FRIDGE _0116201 9. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 50 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition B. Look in the data file for any excursion details (alarm results that show temperatures outside the device's configured alarm limits). Tip. Refer to the device's product guide or video to learn how to identify temperatures outside the HI/LO alarm limits in the data file . (See image for sample \"A larm Report .\") C. Use the excursion details to r eport the excursion to SHOTS using the instructions provided . Important: If all excursions are not reported to SHOTS, vaccine manufacture rs can't accurately determine vaccine viability, and patients might be left unprotected against vaccine -preventable diseases. 5. After the incident has been reported to SHOTS, r ecord the assigned SHOTS ID in the appropriate column on the temperature log. 6. Return the data logger to its original location and ensure it's now recording storage unit temperatures. Tip. Some devices might need to be reconnected and restarted. Check device product guide for instructions. 7. Do not administer vaccines until vaccine viability has been determined by vaccine manufacturers. A. If vaccines are okay to use : Alert your supervisor and remove the \"Do Not Use Vaccines\" sign. B. If vaccines are not okay to use : Remove the vaccines from the storage unit and submit a return form on MyVFCvaccines.org . (Refer to \"Reporting Spoiled, Expired, or Wasted Vaccines\" for details.) What to Do If Vaccines Are Damaged When temperature excursions are reported to SHOTS, staff must follow the instructions provided, which could direct staff to contact vaccine manufacturers . Manufacturers will determine if vaccines might have been damaged by out -of-range temperatures. If non -viable vaccines were administered to patients. Providers must follow VFC Program and manufacturer guidance . If any affected vaccines deemed non -viable (unable) were administered to patients, please note that the federal Advisory Committee Taking Action for Temperature Excursions California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 51 on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that any vaccines given after exposure to inappropriate temperatures should generally be repeated. Please consult with the manufacturer of vaccines deemed non-viable for additional vaccine stability studies and other information to help determine provider revaccination plans. Troubleshooting Most temperature excursions can be prevented. If the data logger indicates that the temperature is outside the recommended range, check the storage unit door, the power supply, the thermostat setting, and the data logger settings. These additional factors might lead to vaccine storage inci dents: Inadequate staff training . Action : Review the EZIZ \"Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures\" lesson2 to address training gaps . Opening storage unit door s frequently (e.g., during busy day s). Action : consider upgrading to a pharmaceutical -grade unit, which recovers quickly from door openings . Not closing the storage unit door tightly . Action : Make sure door s are closed properly when not in use; check the integrity of door seals as part of routine maintenance. Unplugging vaccine storage unit s. Action: N ever unplug vaccine storage unit s. Unplanned electrical outage . Action : Follow protocols in the practice's vaccine management plan. Planned electrical outage (e.g., to the room or building) . Action: E nsure the Vaccine Coordinator has been notified before turning off the power; follow the protocols in the practice's vaccine management plan. Taking inventory while storage unit door s remain open . Action : Keep door s shut as much as possible . Normal storage unit cycling . Action : Add water bottles (refrigerators) or cold packs (freezer s only ) to help buffer internal temperatures ; if that doesn't work, consider upgrading to a pharmaceutical -grade storage unit . Too much e mpty space in the storage unit . Action : Add s ufficient water bottles (refrigerators) or cold packs (freezers only ) to help buffer internal temperatures . Not monitoring storage unit temperatures at all . Action : Follow VFC Program requirements to monitor and document temperatures . Malfunc tioning, old, and/or poor quality storage units . Action : Only use vaccine storage units that meet VFC Program requirements. (Refer to \" Vaccine Storage Unit Specifications .\") Turning off or ignoring alarm alerts . Action : Do not ignore alarm alerts. If temperature alarms go off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until it has been confirmed as a false alarm. Unacceptable temperatures during transfers and transport . Action : Use VFC - compliant data logger during transport and follow VFC refrigerated3 or frozen vaccines4 transport job aids .

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 52 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Conducting a Physical Vaccine Inventory Overview Physical vaccine i nventories help practices maintain sufficient doses to meet patient needs by estimating future doses needed for routine periods as well as back -to-school and flu seasons. As part of vaccine management, practices should order proper quantities and use vaccines to prevent expiration. An accurate understandin g of doses on hand helps to prevent over -ordering (doses might expire before use) or under -ordering ( could result in missed vaccination opportunities). Accurate on -hand inventory must be reported with each VFC vaccine order. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (VFC \"Provider Addendum\" #13). Conduct a physical vaccine inventory at least monthly , and before ordering vaccines , using the VFC \"Vaccine Physical Inventory Form\" (IMM -1052) or equivalent electronic or paper form (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #12A). Never borrow VFC -supplied vaccines to supplement private stock, or vice versa (P.A.A. #1 2B). For vaccines that will expire within 6 month s and cannot be used, notify the VFC Call Center prior to transferring to another VFC provider to prevent negligent provider loss (P.A.A. #1 2C). Remove spoiled, expired, and wasted vaccines from storage units after identification to prevent inadvertent use (P.A.A. #1 2D). Report all spoiled, expired, or wasted doses of VFC -supplied vaccines prior to submitting a new vaccine order (P.A.A. #1 2E). Monitor vaccine storage units regularly and purchase additional storage units if capacity cannot accommodate the in ventory in a manner consistent with VFC Program requirements (P.A.A. #1 2F). Rational Because VFC providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year , providers are required to report the number of VFC doses on hand (as well as doses administered) every time they place an order. This system of checks and balances helps practices account for their vaccines on a regular schedule and prevents inadvertent ov er-ordering or under - ordering. Best Practices Check vaccine expiration dates weekly and rotate stock to place vaccines that will expire soonest in front of those with later expiration dates. Create a calendar appointment or task reminder to conduct physical vaccine inventories monthly and before every routine VFC vaccine order. Be mindful that leaving storage unit doors open too long might expose vaccine s to out-of-range temperatures that can damage vaccines . VFC p roviders are strongly encouraged to enroll i n an immunization registry because registries efficiently track vaccine lot numbers and expiration dates, and they can id entify patients to recall in the event of revaccination. Conducting a Physical Vaccine Inventory California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 53 Using an Immunization Registry or EHR/EMR? Physical counting of vaccines might still be required if the number of VFC -supplied doses on hand doesn't match the quantities reported on current or previous vaccine orders. Discrepancies could occur if the data recorded in electronic systems is not accur ate or consistent, or if quantities were incorrectly reported on vaccine orders. Definitions of Key Terms Providers must ensure that VFC -supplied vaccine inventory is routinely checked for expiration dates to help ensure patients receive viable vaccines. Expiration date. All vaccines and diluents have expiration dates , which indicate the date by which a product must be used. Expiration dates vary by type of vaccine (or diluent) and lot number. They are printed on vials, manufacturer -filled syringes, and p ackages . Interpreting Expiration Dates When expiration dates are marked with only month/year, vaccines or diluents may be used up to and including the last day of the month indicated . If a day is included with month and year, vaccines may only be used through that day. FIGURE 3.1 6. Illustration depicting how to interpret expiration dates with and without day of the month. Exceptions to Expiration Dates There are three instances when vaccines must be used prior to the expiration date printed on the label. Reconstitution. Freeze -dried vaccine s that are mixed with diluent and reconstituted into a liquid form mus t be administered within the timeframe indicated in the manufacturer's package insert.1 Multi -dose vials. Vaccines in multi -dose vials that do not require reconstitution may be used through the expiration date printed on the label as long as the vaccine is not contaminated \u2014unless indicated otherwise by the manufacturer. For some vaccines, the manufacturer specifies that once the multi -dose vial h as been entered or the rubber stopper punctured, the vaccine must be used within a certain number of days. This is commonly referred to as the \"beyond -use date\" (BUD). Manufacturer -shortened expiration dates. If vaccines have been exposed to out -of- range t emperatures, potency might be reduced before the expiration date printed on the label. A manufacturer could determine that the vaccine may be used \u2014but with a shortened expiration date when temperatures excursions are reported. Tip: Write the new expiration date on the vial and/or box. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 54 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Follow these step -by-step instructions to conduct physical vaccine inventories in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices. TABLE 17. Instructions for conducting physical vaccine inventories Step Description 1. Print the VFC \"Vaccine Physical Inventory Form.\"2 2. Determine which vaccines are VFC vaccines. Tips: Storage units should have been set up to separate and clearly label p rivate and VFC vaccines to ensure the correct vaccines are administered. (Refer to \"Configuring Vaccine Storage Units\" for details.) Do not count private vaccines. 3. Remove all doses for the first VFC -supplied vaccine and close the storage unit door. 4. Group vaccine s by lot numbers. A. Look at lot number s on every box. B. Place expired vaccines and diluents in a bag or container marked \"DO NOT USE .\" 5. Record vaccine information on the inventory form. A. Record a check next to the brand and packaging. B. Record the first lot number and expiration date. C. Note any vaccines that will expire within six months. 6. Count all doses of that lot number \u2014including opened boxes. Tips. If the vial caps are the same color, then count each vial as one dose. (In this example, there are eight doses.) Conducting a Physical Vaccine Inventory California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 55 If the vial caps are of different colors (diluents are packaged with vaccines), then count one pair of each color as one dose. (In this example, there are two dose s.) If the box contains both vials and syringes, then count one pair of each as one dose. (In this example, there are four doses.) If the vial is labeled with multiple doses, then count the number of doses left \u2014not used. (In this example, someone has made hash marks to indicate that three out of 10 doses have been administered, so the count remaining in inventory is seven.) 7. Record the count in the \"# Doses On Hand .\" 8. Repeat steps 5 -7 for each group of lot numbers for the same vaccine . 9. Total the \"# Doses On Hand\" for all the lot numbers of that vaccine and record the number in the \"Total Doses on Hand\" column. 10. Put vaccines back in the storage unit in order of expiration dates. A. Move vaccines with the earliest expiration dates in front of other vaccines that have later expiration dates (to ensure older vaccines are used first). B. Position vaccines 2-3 inches away f rom unit walls and floor to allow for air circulation . C. Remove expired vaccines and diluents from the storage unit and return to McKesson . (Refer to \"Reporting Spoiled, Expired, or Wasted Vaccines .\") 11. Repeat steps 3 -10 for all VFC -supplied vaccines \u2014one vaccine name/brand at a time. Tip for r egistry users . If the number of doses on the current inventory report is different than the number recorded on the VFC \"Vaccine Physical Inventory Form,\"2 research and correct any differences. 12. Make sure that all vaccines have been returned to the vaccine storage unit and that their doors are closed when the inventory is complete. VACCINE MANAGEMENT 56 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 13. Confirm that the capacity of the vaccine storage units is adequate to accommodate current inventory plus any new orders \u2014especially during back - to-school and flu season s. Tip. Talk to your provider if the practice needs to purchase additional vaccine storage units to accommodate the inventory in a manner consistent with VFC Program requirements and patient population. 14. Contact the VFC Call Center to address any expired or soon to expire vaccines. Expired vaccines must be reported at MyVFCvaccines.org . (Refer to \"Reporting Spoiled, Expired, or Wasted Vaccines\" .) Any vaccines that will expire within six months and are unlikely to be used should b e transferred to another active VFC provider.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three VACCINE MANAGEMENT 60 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Transporting Vaccines Overview Each vaccine transport exposes vaccines to potentially inappropriate temperature conditions. CDC discourages routine vaccine transport because manufacturers do not generally recommend it or provide any guidance. Contact your VFC Field Representative or the VFC Call Center for approval prior to vaccine transport. While being transported to alternative locations, temperatures must be monitored and recorded using VFC transport logs. Use these procedures for guidance i n an emergency situation . Call the vaccine manufacturer if you have concerns. Target Audience Typi cally Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Transport vaccines only when necessary and follow the guidelines for proper refrigerated vaccine transport (IMM -983) and frozen vaccine transport (IMM - 1130) (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" \"Frozen Vaccine Tran sport Log\" (IMM vaccines are transported (P.A.A. #13F). Transport VFC -supplied vaccines only to facilities designated in the provider profile and never to personal residences (P.A.A. #13G). Use backup, battery -operated , digital data loggers to monitor temperatures during vaccine transport and at VFC -approved , off-site clinics \u2014ideally using portable, battery -operated temporary -powered coolers for off -site clinics (P.A.A. #13H). Acknowledge that vaccines transpor ted without proper documentation of temperature monitoring will be deemed non -viable (P.A.A. #1 3I). Caution Monitoring temperatures during transp ort is required. Use backup, battery -operated, digital data loggers to monitor temperatures during vaccine transport and at VFC - approved, off -site clinics \u2014ideally using portable, battery -operated or other temporary - powered coolers for off -site clinics. If temperatures aren 't monitored according to VFC Program requirements, vaccines will be deemed non -viable. Refrigerated vaccines. In an emergency situation, t his procedure might keep refrigerated vaccines within the required temperature range for up to eight hours \u2014 depending on transport conditions. Call the vaccine manufacturer with any concerns. Frozen vaccines. Frozen vaccines (MMR, MMRV, and Varicella) should never be transpo rted except in an emergency and, if necessary, must be transported under frozen conditions. Temperature indicators. These products are not approved for monitoring vaccine temperatures during transport because they do not record time. Data loggers must be used during transport of all VFC -supplied vaccines. Transporting Diluents Transport diluents with their corresponding vaccines to ensure there are always equal amounts of vaccine s and diluents for reconstitution .

While doses administered and doses on hand are reported with each routine vaccine order, providers must report separately all s poiled , expired , and wasted vaccines. All spoiled and expired vaccines must be returned to McKesson within six months. Doses reported as returned must match actual doses received by McKesson. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup, or the staff designated in the provider's vaccine manageme nt plan with responsibilities for shipping vaccines Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Return all spoiled/expired public vaccines to CDC's centralized vaccine distributor within six months of spoilage/expiration (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9D). I agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (P.A. #13). Report all VFC -supplied spoiled, expired, or wasted vaccines prior to submitting a new vaccine order (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #12E). Definitions of Vaccine Loss Terms Spoiled or expired vaccines may be returned to the VFC Program for excise tax credit, but providers are responsible for disposing of wasted vaccines. Providers accurately report vaccines that are spoiled, expired, or wasted to ensure they are processed correctly. Spoiled vaccines . Careful storage and handling should minimize spoiled vaccines. Vaccines still in their original container (vial or syringe) are considered spoiled and nonviable if the vaccine manufacturer has determined that vaccines were exposed to out - of-range temperatures. Vaccines could spoil as a resul t of the following conditions: natural disaster or power outage refrigerator or freezer temperatures that are too warm refrigerator temperatures that are too cold failure to store vaccines properly upon receipt vaccines spoiled during transfer mechan ical failure unmonitored temperatures Expired. Careful vaccine management (including stock rotation) should minimize expired vaccines. Vaccines are considered expired and nonviable if their expiration dates are past the manufacturer expiration date on th e vial or the expiration date after reconstitution, depending on the vaccine and according to manufacturer instructions. Wasted. Careful vaccine management and administration should minimize wasted vaccines. Vaccines may be designated wasted as a result of the following conditions: vaccines drawn into the syringe but not administered vaccines in open vials but doses not administered damaged vials (e.g., due to a drop causing damage to vial integrity or sterility) lost or unaccounted for vaccines VACCINE MANAGEMENT 72 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Procedure Follow these step -by-step instructions to report spoiled, expired, or wasted vaccines in compliance with VFC Program requirements and best practices.

Click to Return Home Chapter Three Conducting Off -Site Clinics California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 73 Conducting Off-Site Clinics Overview Providers must obtain special approval from the VFC Program prior to conducting mass vaccination clinics (e.g., seasonal flu outreach clinics) to ensure that efforts meet all VFC Program requirements. Target Audience Typically Coordinator Vaccine and Back up Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Monitor and record current, minimum, and maximum temperatures ( Fahrenheit IMM -1029 | Celsius IMM -1029C) in vaccine refrigerators and freezers twice each day: at the beginning and end of each business day \u2014even though using digital data loggers; for any VFC -approved mass vaccination and outreach clinics, monitor and record temperatures every hour and attach the data logger download (or summary report if available) to the transport log (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Add endum\" #9B). Obtain VFC approval before storing vaccines at mass vaccination and outreach clinics; always store and administer vaccines at the approved location for the VFC PIN (P.A.A. #9H). For mobile units, follow all VFC Program requirements including vaccine storage, transport, and temperature monitoring (P.A.A. #9I). Use backup, battery -operated , digital data loggers to monitor temperatures during vaccine transport and at VFC -approved , off-site clinics \u2014ideally using portable, battery temporary -powered coolers for off -site clinics (P.A.A. #13H). Administer all VFC -supplied vaccines at the approved location for the VFC PIN; administration of doses outside the approved location (e.g., special event clinics, health fairs, special school clinics, or mass vaccination clinics) is not routinely allowed and requires prior approval from the VFC Program (P.A.A. #14C). Definitions Mass vaccination clinics. These are large -scale vaccination clinics conducted outside the medical home. Note: For local health departments only. Prior authorization from the VFC Program is required. Outreach clinics These are small -scale vaccination clinics conducted outside the medical home. Note: Prior authorization from the VFC Program is required. Mobile units. Mobile units act as an extension of the medical home and are often used to provide outreach to under -served, high -risk populations. For mobile units, follow all VFC Program requirements including vaccine storage, transport, and temperature monitorin g. Note: Mobile units are identified during VFC Program enrollment and recertification. Submitting a Request for Approval Document the following information and keep on file for review upon request by representatives of the VFC Program: off-site location proposed clinic dates clinic locations anticipated population to be vaccinated breakdown of VFC and private vaccine need transport plans (e.g., which vaccines and quantities) to and from the clinic locations VACCINE MANAGEMENT 74 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition point of contact for overs eeing and coordinating the clinics and vaccine supply Vaccine Management Because most temporary mass clinics require vaccine transport on the day of the clinic, CDC has determined that enhanced storage and handling practices are required. In addition to adhering to all general VFC Program requirements, the following additional requirements must also be met: Transport vaccines \u2014do not ship them \u2014from the approved VFC PIN to the location of the temporary clinic. Transport only amounts of vaccines that are app ropriate based on the anticipated need. Transport refrigerated1 and frozen2 vaccines following VFC Program requirements. Monitor vaccine temperatures using a VFC -compliant data logger and record temperatures \u2014every hour the clinic is open \u2014using the VFC \" Hourly Vaccine Temperature Log for Mass Vaccination Clinics .\" 3 Vaccines exposed t o out -of-range temperatures must be labeled \"Do Not Use\" until further information can be gathered from the manufacturer(s) on the usability of the vaccines. If vaccines were exposed to out -of-range temperatures, report the excursion to SHOTS as soon as p ossible. After each clinic day, complete the appropriate refrigerated4 or frozen5 transport log and return vaccines to their original storag e units in the location of the approved VFC PIN.

CDC recommends that providers order vaccine brands and presentations to meet patient needs. Under -ordering puts providers at risk of not having enough vaccines to immunize their patients. Conversely, over -ordering lead s to crammed storage units, compromising inventory management and increasing the risk of vaccines being unused before expiration. Figure 4.1 highlights the topics covered in chapter four. FIGURE 4.1. Overview of the key topics of vaccine ordering. VACCINE ORDERS 4 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders Overview VFC p roviders are expected to maintain an adequate vaccine inventory for all patients served . Provider s submit electronic vaccine orders for all age-appropriate , ACIP - recommended vaccines for their patient population as identified and agreed upon in the VFC provider profile \u2014excluding influenza, which is allocated separately. Orders should be carefully timed to ensure sufficient inventory is on hand to allow time for order processing. The California VFC Program offers a choice of vaccine brands and presentations (e.g., single -dose vial s or manufacturer -filled , single -dose syringe s). Selection is at the d iscretion of providers. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirement s Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Order vaccine and maintain appropriate vaccine inventories (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #9A). Replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non - viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (P.A. #13). Order all ACIP -recommended vaccines (including flu) according to the provider population, category, order frequency, vaccine usage, and on -hand inventory (California VFC \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #7A). Order all vaccines for each order period in accordance with the practice's patient estimates and in sufficient quantities to last until the next order period; individual vaccine orders are not permitted (P.A.A. # 7B). Stock one brand and formulation for each vaccine to avoid administration errors (P.A.A. # 7C). Account for every dose of VFC -supplied vaccine ordered and received by the provider's practice ( P.A.A. #7D). Report on each vaccine order the VFC vaccine doses administered since the previous order and the curr ent doses on hand (P.A.A. # 7E). Maintain accurate and separate stock records (e.g., purchase invoices, receiving packing slips) for privately purchased vaccines and make them available to the VFC Program upon request (P.A.A. # 7F). Rationale VFC providers must have sufficient storage space to accommodate vaccine stock at the busiest time of year without overcrowding. To ensure adequate stock for VFC -eligible patients, practices must follow an assigned order frequency that is based on provider inventory volume. Following a regular cycle helps to minimize under -ordering, which results in insufficient inventory to meet patient need; over -stock ing of expensive, fragile vaccines might result in loss due to expir ation before use. Best Practices Set aside enough time to prepare and submit the order in one sitting, if possible. Run daily usage and vaccine inventory reports before submitting the order. Ensure that all returns and transfers of VFC -supplied vaccines have been submitted before ordering vaccines. Set up an automatic reminder to submit vaccine orders according to the provider's assigned order frequency. Take into account vacation or other temporary closures when submitting vaccine orders; please do not call to hold orders after order sub mission. Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5 Important. If vaccines are delivered when the office is closed, vaccines wasted would be considered a negligent loss to be replaced by the provider on a dose - for-dose basis. Maintain adequate inventories to administer all age -appropriate , ACIP- recommended vaccines for both private and VFC -eligible children. When Ordering Combination Vaccines When to o rder all complementary single -antigen vaccines to complete the recommended immunizations for the patient's age. For example, when ordering Pediarix, providers must order Hib vaccine because Pediarix doesn't include that antigen , which complements the series due at that visit . This practice ensures all indicated vaccines are readily available and administered , and avoids missed opportunities. Guidance on Vaccine Brand Selection Staff should be familiar and trained on all vaccine products used within the practice. This recom mendation includes dosages, schedules, and familiarization with the packaging for each formulation. In order to prevent administration errors, VFC limits providers to only selecting and ordering one brand of vaccine, in most situations. Guidelines When Switching Vaccine Brands VFC Program's standard guidelines apply when switching to another vaccine brand: Careful consideration should be given when selecting alternative brands or products in order to m inimize t he impact on provider practices. Implement ation of a different vaccine brand or product should be routinely approved by the practice's medical director or Provider of Record. Staff should be thoroughly informed and educated on changes to vaccines and the impact on vaccine ordering, storage, admini stration, and documentation. Review the ACIP -recommended immunization schedules1 as well as minimum intervals and licensed age ranges (refer to VFC vaccine fact sheets2) prior to implementation to avoid errors in administration. As the practice transitions to a new product, managing on -hand inventory appropriately is a key factor in prev enting unnecessary vaccine wastage . A plan to deplete excess inventory must be in place prior to transitioning to a new product. It is the provider's responsibility to ensure all VFC -supplied vaccines are used prior to their expiration date s or transferred to another VFC provider who can use them. Viable unused doses of these individual vaccines cannot be returned to the VFC Program. Determine appropriate number of corresponding single -antigen vaccine doses to compliment the new combination vaccine chose n. Subsequent vaccine requests for a different vaccine product will not be automatically approved and justification might be required. VACCINE ORDERS 6 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Provider Category & Order Frequency Order frequency depends on the provider category and number of VFC -supplied doses ordered each year. Provider category is assessed annually as part of provider recertification, and order frequency is adjusted accordingly and displayed on the provider's account page at MyVFCvaccines.org . TABLE 1. Assigned provider category and order frequency Provider category # Doses received per year Order frequency Very high volume >10,000 Month ly (or more frequently if approved by the VFC Program) High volume 2,000 - 10,000 Monthly Medium volume 500 - 2,000 Every 2 months Low volume < 500 Every 3 months Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7 Essential Inventory Terminology When ordering VFC vaccines, providers electronically report doses administered and on hand , as well as the vaccine brands and quantities they w ish to order. In order to accurately estimate the order quantities , the following key components must be factored in . Total d oses administered . This value represents the total number of doses used since the previous vaccine order. For example, the practice or clinic might have administered the following VFC -supplied doses since the previous order was placed: Vaccine Brand Total doses administered DTaP Daptacel\u00ae, Infanrix\u00ae 22 FIGURE 4. 2. Illustration depicting total doses administered by vaccine. Total d oses on hand . This value represents t he total number of VFC -supplied doses currently stocked in vaccine storage units at the time the order is to be submitted. For example, after conducting a physical vaccine inventory, the practice might have the following doses on hand: Vaccine Brand Total doses on hand DTaP Daptacel\u00ae, Infanrix\u00ae 8 FIGURE 4. 3. Illustration depicting total doses on hand by vaccine. Safety stock. This value represents enough extra doses to last about four weeks to ensure practices don't run out of vaccines while orders are being processed and vaccines shipped. Estimated need . This value represents t he number of doses needed to cover immunizations over the next order period. This estimate includes a safety stock to ensure practices don't run out of vaccines while orders are being processed and vaccines shipped. Total d oses to order . This value represents t he total number of doses to be requested at MyVFCvaccines.org . This number takes into account the estimated need and total doses on hand to arrive at an accurate order quantity that minimizes under - and over - ordering. VACCINE ORDERS 8 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition VFC Order Formula The VFC order formula estimates the number of routine vaccines needed over the next order period and factors in a safety stock of surplus vaccines in case there are unexpected delays in processing or delivery . The formula makes use of the essential inventory termi nology explained above. Doses to Order = ( Total Doses Administered x Safety Stock ) - Total Doses on Hand The VFC \"Vaccine Ordering Worksheet\"3 walks providers through the VFC order formula using provider daily usage logs and physical vaccine inventory forms. Figure 4. 4 uses the VFC order formula to estimate the doses of DTaP to order for a provider with an order frequency of \"Monthly.\" FIGURE 4. 4. Sam ple estimate of DTaP doses to order for a pr ovider with a monthly order frequency . Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Procedure: Before Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders Before submitting routine orders, complete the preparatory steps as outlined in table 2 to ensure routine vaccine orders are complete and accurate . TABLE 2. Instructions to complete before submitting routine vaccine orders Step Description 1. Determine whether it's time to place the next order at MyVFCvaccines.org . A. Go to EZIZ.org and click the \"Order, Transfer, or Return Vaccines\" link in the top center of the web page. B. Enter the practice's VFC PIN and zip code, and click the \"Sign On\" button. C. Review the assigned \"Provider Category\" and \"Order Frequency\" to ensure they haven't been reassigned. In the example be low, the Order Frequency is \"Monthly\" for a Provider Category of \"High Volume\" . D. Note the date when new orders can be submitted. E. If it's time to place the next order : Proceed with the remaining steps. Best practice. Create an automatic reminder to place the next order. 2. Ensure all returns and transfers of VFC -supplied vaccine have been submitted . (Refer to \"Reporting Spoiled, Expired, or Wasted Vaccines\" or \"Transferring Vaccines between Providers\" for details.) Important. Delays in order processing might result if returns and transfers are not completed before submitting routine vaccine orders. 3. Run daily usage and vaccine inventory reports before submitting the order. Tip. The VFC \"Daily Usage Logs \" (VFC4 | Flu5 | Private6) and \"Physical Vaccine Inventory Form\" 7 help providers account for their inventory. 4. Estimate the total number of doses to order using the VFC \"Vaccine Ordering Worksheet\"3 following the instructions provided with the worksheet. 5. If usage and on -hand inventory indicate that doses must be ordered , submit the routine vaccine order following the instructions in TABLE 3 . A. If ordering vaccines for the back -to-school season, pull last year's order now to estimate how much larger the quantities should be to meet the larger than usual demand. VACCINE ORDERS 10 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Vaccine Accountability Providers must report both total doses administered (since the previous order) and doses on hand (at the time the order is submitted) for every routine vaccine order \u2014 even if no doses will be requested. If doses are not reported, vaccine orders will be denied, and providers will need to account for the missing doses before the order will be processed. Procedure: Submitting Routine Vaccine Orders The table below outlines the procedure that practices should follow to minimize errors or delays in order fulfillment. TABLE 3. Instructions for submitting routine vaccine order s Step Description 1. From EZIZ.org, c lick the \" Order VFC Vaccine \" button under the \" Orders \" section . 2.

For back -to-school season, i ncrease vaccine order quantities as necessary to accommodate increased demand. Tip. Look to usage from the previous year and adjust the quantities to meet the expected demand. A. Add notes or justification in the \"Comments\" field, if necessary (e.g., if quantities are increased for back -to-school season). VACCINE ORDERS 12 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 7. Repeat steps 5 -6 for each vaccine on the order. 8. Add notes or justification in the \"Comments\" field, if necessary. Tip. If an order is being submitted early, add comments that the practice is aware the order is early and why vaccines are needed now. 9. Click Yes or No to indicate whether the practice has returned or transferred VFC -supplied vaccines during this ordering period. Tip: These numbers must be reported accurately to avoid unnecessary order delays. 10. Click the check box (see above) to acknowledge that you have authority to submit this vaccine request on the facility's behalf. 11. Click the \"P review\" or \"Save for Later\" button. Tips: Verify the practice's storage units can store the requested quantities before submitting the order. Verify the practice will be open when delivery is expected to arrive (within two weeks). If an order was started and can't be submit ted immediately, click t he \"Save for Later\" button to save the order for up to 24 hours. 12. Important. Orders cannot be canceled once approved and processed, so c lick the \"Submit Your Order\" button only when the order has been proofed and is ready for submission . 13. Save the order confirmation (e -mailed to the Vaccine Coordinator and Backup ) for future reference. When to Expect Vaccine Shipments Providers can expect to receive their vaccines within 14 days after receiving the order - processed notification. During peak ordering periods ( back -to-school, flu season, and during the launch of a new vaccine), VFC receives a larger volume of vaccine requests than is typical . Although orders are processed as efficiently as possible during these periods, it might take longer for vaccine orders to be processed and delivered. Contact the VFC Call Center if vaccines have not arrived within two weeks. Shipment information . Check MyVFCvaccines.org \"Shipping History\" for tracking information . This information will be updated online once vaccines have shipped. The tracking number indicates the day the shipment will arrive.

Click to Return Home Chapter Four VACCINE ORDERS 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Correcting Denied Orders for Routine Vaccines Overview The most common reason that routine vaccine orders are denied is due to accountability errors; namely, accounting for vaccines administered (since the previous order) and vaccines on hand (at the time the order is placed) . Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Provider Errors Resulting in Denied Orders The most common mistakes during routine order submission are ordered below . TABLE 4. Reasons vaccine orders might be denied Order denial reason Description Accountability error The number of doses reported with the order (administered and/or doses on hand) is inaccurate based on the quantities reported on the previous order . Not using a daily usage log, EMR report, or registry report to track and document actual doses used will lead to accountability errors. Not reporting transfers or returns will impact vaccine inventory and might lead to an accountability error. Ordering too early The order was submitted too early \u2014and without valid justification \u2014based on provider's order frequency and process date of previous order. Storage and handling incident An incomplete storage and handling incident is delaying processing of the vaccine order. Missing or incomplete usage/inventory The order did not include both doses administered a nd doses on hand \u2014for all vaccines identified in the provider's profile. Recertification not current The order cannot be processed because the provider and key practice staff did not complete annual recertification by the deadline. Sufficient inventory on hand Based on the number of doses requested and doses on hand as reported on the previous order, the provider should already have sufficient inventory on hand. Partial order The provider did not submit a full routine order. Under -ordering Quantities ordered are insufficient to meet expected need, or not ordering at all. Correcting Denied Orders for Routine Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 15 Expired vaccines in inventory Lot numbers reported have expired. Order is denied with instructions to remove inventory and submit a return for expired vaccines on hand. Ordered a new brand Denied for confirmation Mandatory corrective actions Follow -up actions stemming from a VFC site visit that need to be completed prior to receiving vaccines. Other Check custom message as instructions In the Event of Order Errors Routine v accine orders will be denied if inaccurate or incomplete information is provided. The Vaccine Coordinator and Backup will receive a detailed e -mail instructing them of steps to be taken in order for the vaccine order to be approved. The order will be dele ted within 1 4 business days if the required information is not corrected or supplied. IMPORTANT . To avoid fraud and abuse and potential termination from the VFC Program , providers must not fudge the numbers to make the math add up . Tips: Double check the daily usage logs (or electronic equivalent), the physical vaccine inventory form s, and the calculations recorded on the VFC \"Vaccine Ordering Worksheet.\"1 If the number of doses on hand is accurate but the numbers don't add up, practices might not be tracking doses administered consistently and accurately. Steps must be taken to improve internal tracking of doses administered. If doses administered are off and doses can't be accounted for , additional documentation could be requested before the vaccine order is approved . Conduct a physical vaccine inventory to double check doses on hand. If doses administered are not accurately tracked, this gap could impac t doses on hand as reflected in immunization registries and EHR/EMR systems. VACCINE ORDERS 16 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Understanding Calculated Inventory Quantities The order system validates that providers are correctly accounting for their vaccine inventory by calculating provider Doses On Hand with each vaccine order : Data from Previous Order Submitted on Vaccine Order Previous Inventory (Doses On Hand) Previous Order (Doses Requested) Doses Used (since last order) Doses On Hand 15 doses on hand + 10 doses ordered - 5 dose s used 20 doses on hand FIGURE 4.5 . Illustration depicting VFC's calculation of Doses On Hand . If the provider's Doses On Hand does not match the calculated inventory, the system will report any error as reflected in red below under the \"Calculated Inventory .\" FIGURE 4.6 . Illustration of error message generated when the provider's Doses On Hand does not match the system's calculated inventory. Correcting Denied Orders for Routine Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 17 Calculated inventory could be over or under for the following reasons: Transfers and returns weren't submitted before placing the vaccine order. A complete physical vaccine inventory was not conducted before placing the order, or totals reported were inaccurate. Private vaccines were accidently reported as VFC doses on hand. Providers are not accurately accounting for doses administered. Procedure The table below outlines the procedure that practices should follow to correct denied routine orders. TABLE 5. Steps to correct denied routine orders Step Description 1. Go to EZIZ.org and click the \"Order, Transfer, or Return Vaccines\" link in the top center of the web page. 2. Enter your VFC PIN and zip code, and click the \"Sign On\" button. 3. Click the \" Edit VFC Order\" button under the \" Orders \" section . Tip. This button only appears if there are denied orders that must be corrected. 4. Review the VFC notes at the top of the \"Edit Your VFC Order\" page to identify the steps that must be taken to correct the order. In this example, the Vaccine Coordinator must verify and correc t inventory for Rotavirus: VACCINE ORDERS 18 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5. Scroll down to the section of the order with red comments (e.g., \"Over by 10 doses \" below) to determine why the order was denied. In the example below, the order reflects that 1 5 doses of RotaTeq were reported in inventory on the previous order, 10 doses were requested on the previous order, and 5 doses were reported as used on this order. VFC's \"Calculated Inventory\" shows that providers should have 1 5+10-5 (or 20) doses on hand in invento ry. However, the reported number of 30 doses is \"over by 10 doses\". 6. Follow the instructions provided in the e -mail to resolve the problem; call the VFC Call Center with any questions. Tips: Double check to ensure all doses administered and on hand were accurately recorded. Double check the numbers recorded on the VFC \"Vaccine Ordering Worksheet\"1 to ensure the calculations were done correctly. If transfers were not sub mitted, complete the transfers now to reconcile the inventory then resubmit the order with comments. If private vaccines were reported as VFC doses on hand, set the vaccine back to \"Choose vaccine,\" empty the fields, and resubmit the order with comments. If doses on hand were mistakenly reported as doses used, resubmit the order with comments. If doses on hand are correct but doses administered are off, then resubmit the order with an explanation for why the doses administered are off . 7. Make any corrections. In the example below, if the extra doses were private vaccines mistakenly reported as VFC, the Vaccine Coordinator would empty the fields and resubmit the order with comments. Correcting Denied Orders for Routine Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 19 8. Once the order has been correctly updated, add comments to explain the corrections and click the \"Update Order\" button.

In 2018, CDC reported overall estimates of flu impact across age groups and risk groups since 2010. Deaths: between 12,000 and 56,000 annually1 Hospitalizations: 140,000 and 710,000 Illnesses: between 9.2 million and 35.6 million annually1 2017 -18 Flu Season This flu season was the first to be classified as high severity for all age groups, and was characterized by record -breaking illness levels, hospitalization rates, and pediatric deaths. Vaccination can offer substantial benefit s and reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes \u2014even when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. FIGURE 4.7. Hospitalization Rates in 2017 -18 Flu Season. How to Respond to Questions of Vaccine Effectiveness The flu vaccine reduces the likelihood of hospitalization and death, \u2014even during years when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. Because the flu virus is constantly mutating, the flu vaccine is constantly evolving as well to anticipate strains of flu that might be circulating during the upcoming flu season . Some seasons the flu vaccine is more effective than others. Tip. If patients have concerns about flu vaccination based on past experience, remind them that the flu vaccine is different each year, and the protection against the burden of disease (missed school or work, flu symptoms, risk of progression to pneumonia) is increased with vaccin ation \u2014even when vaccine effectiveness is reduced. High -Risk Group: Young Children CDC has released results of a study that found flu vac cination significantly reduced the risk of flu -related death for healthy children and those in high -risk groups. Healthy children: 65% reduction of death risk1 High-risk group: 51% reduction o f death risk1 Strongly Recommend Flu Vaccination Consider bundling flu with other routine vaccines. Patients are more apt to be vaccinated against flu if the health -care provider strongly recommends and offers the flu vaccine during the same office visit. By referring a patient outside the medical home, an immunization opportunity is lost, and VFC -eligible children might be charged for any administration fees \u2014if they get vaccinated at all. If Patients Refuse Vaccination Many patients do not understand that flu is a serious illness that can lead to death , particularly in young children . Practices can directly influence vaccination rates in their practices by preparing staff to address common concerns. Tips . If patients refuse vaccinat ion, ask questions to uncover any reasons behind patient concern. Provide answers and recommend vaccination again. If the patient still declines, share an information handout and follow up at their next visit. Preparing Practices to Fight Flu California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 21 Techniques to Improve Vaccination Rates Empo wer all staff to recommend flu vaccination Offer flu vaccination during routine visits Bundle flu with other routine vaccines Use standing orders Assess flu vaccination status at every visit from September through March Send e -mail or phone reminders to patients to make appointments before flu season and follow up as needed Sample Dialogue CDC suggests using their five -point approach (SHARE) to making a strong vaccine recommendation. SHARE the reasons for the flu vaccine. \"This vaccine can protect you a nd your family from getting the flu, which is a serious illness that can lead to hospitalization and even death, particularly in young children . By getting the shot today, you'll be protecting yourself and the people around you.\" HIGHLIGHT positive experie nces. \"The CDC recommends that everyone get a flu vaccine each year. I always get one so I don't pass along the flu along to my patients and family.\" ADDRESS patient questions. \"To answer your question, a flu shot cannot cause the flu. There can be some mi ld side effects, but it can't cause the flu.\" REMIND patients that the flu vaccine protects children and their loved ones. \"Flu activity is going to start to pick up, and CDC says to expect more cases in the coming months. That's why I want to make sure I help protect you and your loved ones.\" EXPLAIN the potential costs of flu . \"It's important to get vaccinated this season because flu vaccination can reduce the likelihood of hospitalization, flu illnesses, doctor visits, and miss ed work and school.\" Notes 1. \"Prepare Your Practice to Fight Flu,\" EZIZ.org, \"http://eziz.org/assets/docs/NCIRDFightFluSlideDeck.pdf .\" Additional resources: \"Make a Strong Flu Vaccine Recommendation ,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/ vaccination/flu -vaccine - recommendation.htm . Click to Return Home Four VACCINE ORDERS 22 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Ordering Flu Vaccines Overview Providers do not order influenza vaccine s the same way they order routine vaccines. Flu vaccines are allocated to enrolled providers by the VFC Program in advance of the flu season. If additional doses are needed beyond the initial allocation, providers may request additional doses during the supplemental flu ordering window. Target Audience Typically Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirement s Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider's VFC Provider Profile, comply with immunization schedules, dosa ges and contraindications that are established by ACIP and included in the VFC program (Provider Agreement #3). Order vaccine and maintain appropriate vaccine inventories ( VFC \"Provider Agreement \" #9A). Order all ACIP -recommended vaccines (including flu) according to the provider population, category, order frequency, vaccine usage, and on -hand inventory (California VFC \"Provider Agreement Adden dum\" #7A). -1053F) , an immunization registry, or equivalent electronic or paper form (P.A.A. #14F). Rationale Unlike routine pediatric vaccines, VFC books a set number of flu doses in advance of the flu season. In order to ensure demand and full utilization of vaccines, each provider is allocated doses. Doses must be confirmed by the announced deadline or vaccines are released into the general supply. Providers must accurately document flu vaccine usage and account for an y return unused, expired vaccines fro m the previous season before confirming th e current season's allocation. Best Practices Prepare in advance to ensure your allocations are accurately confirmed: Review with staff the annual VFC Program influenza letter , which includes detailed information regarding this season's ACIP influenza vaccination recommendations, product dosage and administration, storage and handling guidelines, and other important information . The letter will be released once recommendations are published by CDC. Ensure that key practice staff responsible for confirming flu allocations are aware of the announced timeline so that allocations are confirmed by the two- week review and confirmation deadline. Consider your seasonal flu vaccine needs for your VFC -eligible patients; influ enza vaccine is routinely recommended for all VFC -eligible children 6 months through 18 years of age. And children under eight years of age might need two doses of flu vaccine to complete the series. Ensure that key practice staff fill out the VFC \"Flu Usage Log\"1 (or an immunization registry or EHR/EMR system) to track flu doses administered; vaccines used and on -hand inventory must be accounted for during supplemental flu vaccine ordering. Initial Allocations The VFC Program allocates provider doses at the beginning of the flu season based on the available vaccine supply (including specific products) pre -booked for distribution to California VFC Program providers, Ordering Flu Vaccines California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 23 the number of non -flu pediatri c and adolescent doses administered, and the total number of doses of each flu product received in the preceding season (initially allocated plus any additional doses received as part of supplemental ordering of flu vaccines ). Newly enrolled providers wi th limited or no vaccine distribution history will have limited allocations based on selected pediatric vaccine distribution. Providers may contact the VFC Call Center or their VFC Field Representative if their VFC -eligible patient population has significa ntly increased since their enrollment date. Confirming Your Clinic 's Vaccine Allocation Detailed instructions will be provided to all enrolled providers in the annual VFC Program influenza letter , but in general the following steps must be completed. TABLE 6 . Key steps for confirming provider vaccine doses Step Description 1. Go to EZIZ.org and click the \"Order, Transfer, or Return Vaccines\" link in the top center of the web page. 2. Enter your VFC PIN and zip code, and click the \"Sign On\" button. 3. If your practice has unused, expired doses from the previous flu season, go to EZIZ.org and click the \"Order, Transfer, or Return Vaccines\" link. (Refer to \"Reporting Spoiled, Expired, or Wasted Vaccines\" for details.) 4. Click the \"Flu Order \" button to access VFC's Online Flu Order Confirmation System. 5. Review and make adjustments based on your VFC -eligible populations served following the instructions provided in the flu ordering letter. 6. Submit confirmed vaccine allocations for the practi ce by the announced deadline. 7. Save the VFC confirmation of submission e-mail for your records. 8. Upon review of the flu allocation request, the VFC Program will e -mail a final approved email confirmation. 9. Prepare room in your vaccine storage unit and label space for VFC influenza doses according to VFC Program storage and handling requirements. Tip. Flu doses expire each year. Remove all expired doses from the previous year have been removed and sent to McKesson Specialty. (Refer to vaccine return procedures) . 10. Look for an e-mail and fax from the VFC Program when flu products are received at the d istribution center and delivery of approved orders begins. VACCINE ORDERS 24 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Vaccine Shipments Influenza vaccine supplies for all different manufacturers arrive at VFC's national vaccine distributor at different times and in multiple shipments throughout the season . Providers will receive their allocated vaccine doses in multiple shipments throughout the season. In the event of significant vaccine delays or shortages, the VFC Program might automatically substitute allocated vaccine brands for another product that is readily available for shipment. Vaccine Usage and Reporting As with all other VFC -supplied vaccines, tracking the administration of VFC flu doses is required for each practice. Doses administered must be documented on VFC's \"Flu Usage Log\"1 (or electronic or paper equivalent ) and reported to the VFC Program as part of the submission process for supplemental vaccine ordering. Providers may also use the practice's immunization registry or an electronic health record system that tracks doses administered and generates vaccine usage reports. Tips for a Successful Flu Season Discuss and outline key strategies to achieve high influenza vaccination coverage rates and decrease missed vaccination s opportunities for practice patients: remind patients to come in for their annual influenza vaccination expand hours for influenza vaccination allow influenza vaccine -only visits discuss mechanisms to track patients that wil l be due to return to the practice for a second dose Submitting Supplemental Flu Orders After the initial allocation, providers may request additional doses of the flu vaccine once the VFC Program has opened up supplemental flu ordering. Supplemental orde ring is contingent upon two co nditions: 1 ) available vaccine supply and 2) 100% distribution of provider -confirmed doses at the beginning of the season. Supplemental ordering will remain open throughout influenza season as vaccine supply permits. Who m ay place supplemental orders? Supplemental ordering is available to providers who were not able to submit confirmation for their initial allocation . Ordering will also be enabled for providers who have already received 100% of initially confirmed doses of avai lable flu vaccines. The number of unused doses must be reported as part of supplemental ordering. Vaccine shipments. Supplemental orders are processed by the VFC Call Center several times per week and sent to the VFC Program's national vaccine distributor for fulfillment. Supplemental influenza orders ship in full. Best practices. The following best practices are recommended: Submit supplemental orders frequently ( rather than placing one large order ) to keep inventory manageable and minimize vaccine waste at the end of the season. Keep in mind any planned reminder/recall influenza vaccination outreach efforts for the particular ordering period before placing your order. Ensure that all the doses requested can be properly stored as orders cannot be canceled once sent for fulfillment. Contact the VFC Call Center if you find that the supplemental order limitation is inconsistent with your current VFC -eligible population . Questions?

This chapter outlines the ways accountability is verified so that providers and key practice staff know what to expect. Figure 5.1 highlights key topics covered in chapter five to help practices understand how their compliance with VFC Program requirements is measured . FIGURE 5.1. Overview of the topics orienting new providers to provider accountability checks. PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY 4 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Vaccine Accountability Overview Vaccine accountability is a critical component of the VFC Program. VFC providers must manage their vaccine inventory effectively to prevent negligent vaccine loss. VFC -enrolled provider s are accountable for all VFC -supplied vaccines upon receipt and must be able to provide documentation to support their numbers. Providers must report vaccine accountability numbers with each vaccine order in order to receive new vaccines. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Providers must maintain all records related to the VFC Program for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review. VFC records include, but are not limited to, VFC screening and eligibility documentation, billing records, medical records that verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering records, and vaccine purchase and accountability records (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #4). I agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non -viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis (P.A. #13). Account for every dose of VFC -supplied vaccine ordered and received by the provider's practice (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #7D). Maintain accurate and separate stock records (e.g., purchase invoices, receiving packing slips) for privately purchased vaccines and make them available upon request (P.A.A. #7F). Neve r borrow VFC -supplied vaccines to supplement private stock, or vice versa (P.A.A. #1 2B). Document all VFC vaccine doses -1053F) , an immunization registry, or equivalent electronic or paper form (P.A.A. #14 E). Rationale Although VFC -supplied vaccines are distributed to providers at no cost, vaccines are purchased with public funds , and providers might maintain an average vaccine inventory ranging from tens of thousands to more than $500,000 over the course of a year . By signing the VFC \"Provider Agreement \", providers agree to account for all doses received (including vaccines that later were spoiled, expired, or wasted ) and could be held liable for negligent vaccine losses . No-Borrowing Policy CDC's expectation is that VFC providers maintain adequate inventories to administer all age-appropriate , ACIP -recommended va ccines to both private -eligible children. Providers may not borrow VFC -supplied vaccine s to supplement their private ly purchase d vaccine s, or vice versa . Providers should not use privately purchased vaccines to vaccinate VFC -eligible patients as the VFC Program will not compensate providers for those doses used. Vaccine Accountability California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 5 Accountability in Practice VFC Program requirements, procedures, and forms help providers account for their vaccine inventory and minimize spoiled or expired doses . Ensure all staff who handle VFC -supplied vaccines are properly trained and understand how to account for all doses . FIGURE 5.2. Doses that must be accounted for in provider practices and clinics. PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY 6 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Accountability Forms While electronic systems such as immunization registries and EHR/EMR systems are designed to simplify vaccine administration and management tasks, the following forms \u2014if used routinely \u2014serve as paper substitutes that simplify the routine vaccine ordering p rocess when electronic systems are not an option. Whichever method is used, providers will use documentation of doses administered to determine patient estimates during annual recertification. TABLE 1 . Alternative paper forms that simplify provider vaccin e accountability Procedure Form IMM Receiving VFC \"Vaccine Receiving Log and Checklist\" -1052 Transfers MyVFCvaccines.org confirmation Online Returns MyVFCvaccines.org confirmation Online Reporting of Accountability Data Accountability data is reported to and verified by the VFC Program with each vaccine order, and orders will not be approved until all doses are accounted for. Under -ordering might lead to missed immunization opportunities in the event of vaccine shortage; o ver- ordering might lead to vaccine wast e. Providers m ust report the following data with each vaccine order: doses administered since the previous order doses on hand at the time the order is placed In the Event of Unaccounted Doses The California VFC Program is required by CDC to ensure every enrolled provider is properly accounting for all vaccine doses received. In the event of unaccounted doses, vaccine orders will not be processed until the provider accounts for the missing doses . For example, if a provider forgets to submit the online VFC transfer form for doses transferred to another VFC provider, the provider will need to submit the transfer form so the vaccine order can be processed. Providers are required to replace doses tha t cannot be accounted for \u2014on a dose -by-dose basis.

Federal fraud and abuse laws apply to the entire VFC Program; state laws apply to portions of the program involving state funds. A provider foun d guilty of fraud and/or abuse will be subject to vaccine restitution and possible removal from the VFC Program. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Operate within the VFC Program in a manner intended to avoid fraud and abuse as defined in the Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7455.2 (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #10). Fraud is defined as an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under appl icable federal or state law (P.A. #10). Abuse is defined as provider practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, (and/or including actions that result in an u nnecessary cost to the immunization program, a health insurance company, or a patient); or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient patient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program (P.A. #10). Rationale As vaccines become more expensive and immunization programs more complex, the VFC Program becomes more vulnerable to fraud and abuse. The California VFC Program investigates all suspected and reported cases of fraud and abuse in order to protect the integrity of the program and ensure federally purchased vaccines remain available to VFC -eligible pediatric populations. Examples of Fraud Fraud results in a financial gain for the provider but with an inadvertent cost to the VFC Program. Many actions might constitute fraud: failing to screen patients for VFC eligibility providing VFC -supplied vaccines to non -VFC -eligible children or adults selling or otherwise misdirecting VFC -supplied vaccines billing a third party for VFC -supplied vaccines charging more than the maximum regional charge for administration of VFC - supplied vaccines to VFC -eligible children denying vaccines to VFC -eligible c hildren because of a parent's or guardian's inability to pay the vaccine administration fee failing to fully account for VFC -supplied vaccines Examples of Abuse Abuse results in an inadvertent cost to the VFC Program. Abuse consists of any actions that l ead to a negligent loss that could have been prevented by proper vaccine management. Providers agree to replace all vaccines deemed non -viable due to provider negligence. Many actions might constitute abuse leading to negligent loss: allowing VFC -supplied vaccines to expire or spoil due to inappropriate vaccine management, including temperature monitoring PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY 8 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition failing to store vaccines upon arrival failing to monitor and document temperatures failing to transport vaccines according to program requ irements failing to properly store and handle VFC -supplied vaccines failing to fully account for VFC -supplied vaccines How to Report Suspected Fraud and Abuse Any suspected fraud or abuse should be immediately reported to the VFC Call Center. The VFC Prog ram maintains the anonymity of the person submitting the report. Investigations of Fraud and Abuse The California VFC Program carefully investigates every case of alleged fraud and abuse. If the non -compliance appears intentional and the provider benefited financially, the case might be referred to Medicaid's Integrity Program1 for further investigation. Any vaccine loss is investigated to determin e the cause and whether the provider actions are deemed negligent . If the VFC Program determines that loss is due to negligence , the provider will be required to compensate the VFC Program. Restitution Policy Providers must replace the same number and ty pe of vaccines that were lost \u2014on a dose - for-dose basis. Providers must submit a receipt of vaccine purchase (reflecting a dose - for-dose replacement) to the VFC Program within 90 days of vaccine loss, or within an acceptable timeline as negotiated with the VFC Program. In general, restitution requires the following actions: Providers must sign a VFC Program vaccine restitution agreement . Providers must provide copies of vaccine invoices for privately purchased vaccines to replace doses lost. Providers must submit a detailed listing of vaccines for all VFC patients who received privately purchased vaccines. The VFC Program might suspend provider vaccine ordering privileges. Vaccines for Health -Care Workers Vaccinations are as important for practice staff as they are for patients. While it is important for staff to be up to date on their immunizations, VFC -supplied vaccines may never be used on staff and doing so constitutes fraud. The VFC Program encourages practices to establish their own policies to ensure all employees are protected against vaccine -preventable diseases. Refer to the CDC's \"Recommended Vaccines for Healthcare Workers.\"2 Notes 1. \"Medicaid Integrity Program - General Information\", Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , https://www.cms.gov/Medicare -Medicaid - Coordination/ Fraud -Prevention/MedicaidIntegrityProgram/index.html . 2. \"Recommended Vaccines for Healthcare Workers \", Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/hcw.html . Click to Return Home Chapter Five Site Visits California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 9 Site Visits Overview As a condition for participation in the VFC Program, providers must allow site visits from authorized VFC representatives. Site visits are educational opportunities designed to improve compliance with the VFC Program and thereby improve patient immunization levels. Failure to allow a site visit might result in the temporary suspension from the VFC Program and removal of VFC -supplied vaccines. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Participate in VFC Program compliance visits including unannounced visits, and other educational opportunities associated with VFC Program requirements (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #11). Ensure that clinic staff conduct themselves in an ethical, professional, and respectful manner in all interactions with VFC Program staff (California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #15A). Acknowledge that providers must make all vaccine administration records (private ly and publicly funded) available to representatives from the California Department of Public Health Immunization Branch and VFC Program (P.A.A. #15C). Initial Site Visit All new providers must receive a new provider enrollment site visit prior to receiving approval for enrollment in the California VFC Program . The purpose of the initia l site visit is to ensure that the provider and the key practice staff are educated on and have the appropriate resources to implement program requirements , including vaccine storage units and data loggers that meet VFC Program requirements. A follow -up compliance visit will be scheduled approximately three to six months after initial enrollment. Compliance Visits Provider n on-compliance might occur due to an unintentional lack of understanding of VFC Program requirements, so site visits present educational opportunities to train providers and key practice staff. All enrolled and active providers must receive a VFC complian ce visit at least every other year, or more frequently if indicated. Site visits help determine provider compliance with VFC Program requirements, including adherence to vaccine eligibility screening and documentation, accountability, and management. The Provider of Record or Designee and a ll key practice staff responsible for vaccine management and administration must be present for site visits , which are scheduled to best accommodate the convenience of the practice. Goals of VFC site visits. Site visi ts are critical opportunities to engage provider staff and develop and strengthen ongoing relationships. Additionally, they identify areas where providers are doing well and areas needing additional follow up, identify the educational needs of VFC provide rs in order to help them meet program requirements, and ensure that VFC -eligible children receive properly managed and viable vaccines. PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY 10 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Visit format. Site v isits are conducted by VFC Field Representatives who review provider compliance with CDC requiremen ts through verbal discussions with practice staff, random assessments of patient charts, visual inspections of key documents and storage units, and completion of the online federal site visit questionnaire . Evaluation criteria. Providers will be evaluated for compliance in accordance with CDC requirements, including but not limited to the following items: Verbal discussions with practice staff Changes to key practice staff Key practice staff knowledge of VFC eligibility categories Random assessments of patient charts Billing practices (for cost of vaccines and administration fees) Eligibility & screening documentation Vaccine dose documentation including VISs Visual inspections of documents VISs and VAERS Certificate of calibration testing VFC temperature logs Private vaccine invoices Vaccine management plan Visual inspections of storage units Storage & handling conditions Data logger s, including backups Placement of data loggers Vaccine placement Capacity to store current vaccine plus addition al stock during peak season Inventory inspection, including expired vaccines ACIP -recommended vaccines, stocked per provider profile Separation of VFC and privately purchased vaccines FIGURE 5.3. Overview of evaluation criteria used to measure compliance. Patient chart review. Because VFC is authorized by law as a public health entity , VFC providers may disclose any patient health information (including private and VFC - eligible patient charts) to us without authorization. We are authorized to collect or receive information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability. Site Visits California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 11 Site visit f indings. At the conclusion of each site visit, the VFC Field Representative discusses key findings with the Provider of Record and Vaccine Coordinators, and Designee and Backup Vaccine Coordinator if available. Discussion could include requirements met, instruction s to address problems or issues found during the site visit, and recommendations to improve immunization service delivery. Immediate actions might be identified to remedy the issue depending on its severity . The VFC Field Representative will also issue a formal written report that summarizes areas for improvement and the timeline for correcting noncompliant areas. T he Provider of Record or Designee must sign the \"Acknowledgement of Receipt\" form , which attests to the fact that the site visit was completed and the results were di scussed on -site. Future follow -up actions with designated due dates might be required, and if so, they must be completed in accordance with CDC -established deadlines. If deficiencies are not corrected by the deadline identified in t he report, the practice's ordering privileges could be suspended. Practices with a history of non -compliance with the same issue identified in past site visits, or identification of a serious issue, might be added to the VFC Program's allegation and referr al database. A provider who demonstrates non - compliance with the same issue might also be terminated from the VFC Program. Site visit duration. Site visits last approximately two hours, or more if compliance issues are identified. Most of the time is spe nt with the Vaccine Coordinator with the Provider of Record attending the site visit findings. Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits VFC Field Representatives also conduct periodic unannounced visits, which are separate from VFC compliance visits. The goal of these storage and handling visits is to provide education, support, and resources related to proper vaccine storage and handling to ensure all VFC -eligible children are receiving properly managed vaccines. Providers may request additional site visits. VFC Field Representatives will work with the practice as necessary to provide staff training, technical assistance, and in -services related to compliance with VFC Program requirements . In-Service Visits An in -service visit is conducted on site by VFC Field Representatives to provide training to key practice staff on one or more compliance issues . No formal evaluation or reporting is involved. Training issues might include reviewing immunization schedules and timing for doses, VFC eligibility and/or other policies and procedures, best practices regarding how to administer vaccines, proper vaccine storage and handling, how to order and account for vaccines, how to configure data loggers , how to document temperatures properly, and how to complete a storage and handling excursion report.

Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee, Vaccine Coordinator and Backup Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Maintain all records related to the VFC Program for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review. VFC records include, bu t are not limited to, VFC screening and eligibility documentation, billing records, medical records that verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering records, and vaccine purchase and accountability records (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #4). Maintain a current and completed vaccine management plan (IMM -1122) for routine and emergency situations that includes practice -specific, vaccine - management gui delines and protocols, names of staff with temperature monitoring responsibilities, and required EZIZ lesson completion dates for all key practice staff (California VFC Program's \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" #1A). Acknowledge that temperature logs missing during a VFC site visit but found at a later date will not be accepted (P.A.A. #9H). Acknowledge that if temperatures are not monitored and documented, or if temperature logs or downloaded data file s are missing or falsified, all affected vaccines will be automatically deemed non -viable and considered a negligent vaccine loss (P.A.A # 10E). Never destroy, alter, or falsify immunization or VFC Program -related records (P.A.A #15B). Acknowledge that pro viders must make all vaccine administration records (privately and publicly funded) available to representatives from the California Department of Public Health Immunization Branch and VFC Program (P.A.A #15C). Records Related to the Practice Providers are required to maintain the following documents and records for a minimum of three years: VFC temperature logs vaccine accountability records (vaccine daily usage logs and inventory forms) vaccine invoices and packing slips (for VFC and private ly purchased vaccines) certificate of calibration for each data logger (or other continuous temperature monitoring devices) including backup devices certificates of completion from required EZIZ lessons vaccine management plan medical records that verify vaccine administration VFC eligibility screening documentation billing records Best Practices Do not take VFC records off site. If VFC temperature logs are lost, providers might not have any documentation that proves vaccines were stored under recommended temperatures. Without proper documentation, vaccines might be considered spoiled and a negligent provider loss. Click to Return Home Chapter Five PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY 14 California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition Annual Recertification Overview Annual r ecertification is a federal requirement to remain enrolled in the VFC Program and continue receiving federally subsidized vaccines. R ecertification is an online process, typically launched at the end of the calendar year. Recertification allows enrolled providers to renew their participation in the VFC Program by updating their information, complet ing online training , updating patient profiles, agreeing to the Program's federal requirements for participation, and certifying adherence with all items listed in the \"Provider Agreement Addendum.\" The VF C Program will suspend ordering privileges for providers who do not complete the recertification process. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: VFC \"Provider Agreement\"1 (federal agreement) and California VFC Program \"Provider Agreement Addendum.\"2 Requirements at a Glance The VFC Program summarizes any new or changes to existing requirements and procedures in its annual \"Program Participation Requirements at a Glance\"3 document. Changes might impact the California VFC Program 's \"Provider Agreement Addendum\" , 4 \"Vaccine Management Plan,\"5 online EZIZ training lessons, VFC temperature logs, job aids, and other key or supporting documents. Training Requirements All key practice staff (as identified in the MyVFCvaccines.org provider profile) are required to complete the federal educational requirements. New trainings, or a review of previous trainings, might be required to stay informed of VFC practices as requirements change slightly each year. Visit the EZIZ Training page6 for the most up -to-date information. Instructions for Recertification The California VFC Program sends information a few weeks before recertification begins , and p roviders have approximately one month to complete the process. Instructions will be provided (both online and through e -mails) that direct providers to the online VFC e-Recertification Form. The instructions will include the deadline for meeting recertification requirements. How to Prepare for Recertification Recert ification is an annual and online process accessible at MyVFCvaccines.org .

The VFC Program also may terminate a VFC \"Provider Agreement\" and remove the provider from the VFC Program for failure to comply with program requirements. In both cases, the Provider of Record must return to the VFC Program or transfer to an approved VFC provider all unused VFC -supplied vaccines. Enrolled providers are responsible for all VFC -supplied vaccines in their practice until their ag reement has been officially terminated. Target Audience Provider of Record and Designee Program Requirements Providers have agreed to comply with the following VFC Program requirements: Understand that the provider's facility or the California Department of Public Health Vaccines for Children Program may terminate this agreement at any time. If the provider chooses to terminate this agreement, s/he agrees to properly return any unused fed eral vaccine as directed by the California Department of Public Health Vaccines for Children Program (VFC \"Provider Agreement\" #14). Suspensions A provider's ordering privileges might be suspended d ue to non -compliance with VFC Program requirements. Once the issue has been resolved, ordering privileges will be reinstated. Provider -Initiated (Voluntary) Termination Providers may voluntarily terminate their VFC \"Provider Agreement\" at any time. Since CHDP enrolled providers must be enrolled in the VFC Program, withdrawing from the VFC Program might affect participation in other programs, such as CHDP. The practice will need to notify the VFC Call Center at least 30 days prior to terminating the agr eement and/or before closing the practice, complete t he \"VFC Participation Withdrawal Request Form,\"1 schedule a final site visit (a VFC Representative will contact the practice and determine if va ccines need to be retrieved/returned/transferred), and receive an official VFC Program termination letter. VFC Program - Initiated Suspensions & Terminations The VFC Program also might terminate a VFC \"Provider Agreement\" and remove the provider from the VFC Program for failure to comply with program requirements, including but not limited to the following: non -compliance with any VFC Program requirement failure to remedy any compliance issue failure to recertify fraud or abuse involving VFC -supplied vaccines administration of non -viable vaccines inadequate vaccine storage equipment or storage practices inability to account for VFC -supplied vaccines vaccine loss due to negligence transfer of VFC -supplied vaccines to non -VFC providers refusal/non -response to requests for VFC site visits from authorized personnel no VFC orders over the 12-month period prior to annual recertification Suspension & Termination California VFC Program's POM , 2019 Edition 17 Repercussions of Termination A provider who withdraws from the VFC Program and terminates their VFC Provider Agreement remains responsible for vaccine doses that expired or spoiled due to negligence or could not be accounted for during VFC Program participation. In such situations, re quests for termination might result in delays or the provider could be subject to additional program actions. Minimally, a provider who withdraws from the VFC Program and terminates their VFC \"Provider Agreement\" is responsible for every dose of VFC -supplied vaccine in their inventory, is required to store vaccines properly until they can be picked up by a VFC Field Representative or transferred to another VFC provider , and might need to wait up to one year before requesting to re -enroll.

I will annually submit a provider profile representing populations served by my practice/facility. I will submit more frequently if 1) the number of children served changes or 2) the status of the facility changes during the calendar year. 2. I will screen patients and document eligibility status at each immunization encounter for VFC eligibility (i.e., federally or state vaccine -eligible) and administer VFC -purchased vaccine by such category only to children who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the following categories: A. Federally Vaccine -eligible Children (VFC eligible) 1. Are an American Indian or Alaska Native; 2. Are enrolled in Medicaid; 3. Have no health insurance; 4. Are underinsured: A child who has health insurance, but the coverage does not include vaccines; a child whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (VFC -eligible for non- covered vaccines only). Underinsured children are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), or Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or under an approved deputization agreement. B. State Vaccine -eligible Children 1. In addition, to the extent that my state designates additional categories of children as \"state vaccine -eligible\", I will screen for such eligibility as listed in the addendum to this agreement and will administer state -funded doses (including 317 funded doses) to such children. Children aged 0 through 18 years that do not meet one or more of the eligibility federal vaccine categories (VFC eligible), are not eligible to receive VFC -purchased vaccine. 3. For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider profile, I will comply with immunization schedules, dosages, and contraindications that are established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and included in the VFC program unless: a) In the provider's medical judgment, and in accordance with accepted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the child; b) The particular requirements contradict state law, including laws pertaining to religious and other exemptions. 4. I will maintain all records related to the VFC program for a minimum of three years and upon request make these records available for review. VFC records include, but are not limited to, VFC screening and eligibility documentation, billing records, medical records that verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering records, and vaccine purchase and accountability records. 5. I will immunize eligible children with publicly supplied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the vaccine. 6. I will not charge a vaccine administration fee to non-Medicaid federal vaccine eligible children that exceeds the administration fee cap of $26.03 per vaccine dose. For Medicaid children, I will accept the reimbursement for immunization administration set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans. State of California \u2014Health and Human Services Agency VACCINES FOR CHILDREN (VFC) PROGRAM California Department of Public Health IMM -1241 ( 12/16) 7. I will not deny administration of a publicly purchased vaccine to an established patient because the child's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee. 8. I will distribute the current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). 9. I will comply with the requirements for vaccine management including: a) Ordering vaccine and maintaining appropriate vaccine inventories; b) Not storing vaccine in dormitory -style units at any time; c) Storing vaccine under proper storage conditions at all times. Refrigerator and freezer vaccine storage units and temperature monitoring equipment and practices must meet California Department of Public Health Vaccines for Children Program storage and handling requirements; d) Returning all spoiled/expired public vaccines to CDC's centralized vaccine distributor within six months of spoilage/expiration 10. I agree to operate within the VFC program in a manner intended to avoid fraud and abuse. Consistent with \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" as defined in the Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7 455.2, and for the purposes of the VFC Program: Fraud: is an intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable federal or state law. Abuse: provider practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, (and/or including actions that result in an unnecessary cost to the immunization program, a health insurance company, or a patient); or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program. 11. I will participate in VFC program compliance site visits including unannounced visits, and other educational opportunities associated with VFC program requirements. 12. For pharmacies, urgent care, or school located vaccine clinics, I agree to: a) Vaccinate all \"walk -in\" VFC -eligible Will not refuse to vaccinate VFC -eligible children based on a parent's inability to pay the administration fee. Note: \"Walk -in\" refers to any VFC eligible child who presents requesting a vaccine; not just established patients. \"Walk -in\" does not mean that a provider must serve VFC patients without an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for all patients to make an appointment to receive immunizations then the policy would apply to VFC patients as well. 13. I agree to replace vaccine purchased with federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non-viable due to provider negligence on a dose -for-dose basis. 14. I understand this facility or the California Department of Public Health Vaccines for Children Program may terminate this agreement at any time. If I choose to terminate this agreement, I will properly return any unused federal vaccine as directed by the California Department of Public Health Vaccines for Children Program.
