No thickeners, preservatives, powders or sweeteners are added to this real, natural yoghurt. Meredith Dairy started in 1991 when the combination of a chance meeting with a cheesemaker and the suspension of the wool price reserve steered Julie and Sandy Cameron towards setting up a small dairy making cheeses and natural yoghurts on their farm in Victoria. Goats were added in 1996 and soon after goat's milk cheeses and yoghurts were being made in addition to sheep's milk products. Today, Meredith Dairy is still a family run business located in rural Victoria in the town of the same name. Meredith Dairy is committed to making excellent dairy products, leading standards in animal husbandry and demonstrating their love of the land through several environmental programs. Over 20% of the farm is set aside for conservation, only renewable energy is used and annual tree planting programs offsets carbon, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both their products and their dedication to sustainability, have been celebrated with many awards over the years. Natural Sheep's Milk Yoghurt was the first product made by Meredith Dairy 30 years ago and little has changed in how it is made, today. Their sheep are milked daily and the fresh, unhomogenised milk is cultured and pot-set at the farm's dairy, making this a true farmhouse product. The blue-label, Greek-style yoghurt contains beneficial Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Thermophilus bacteria that create a moderate acidity and thick texture just below the generous layer of cream that sits on top of each pot. No thickeners, preservatives, powders or sweeteners are added to this real, natural yoghurt. From humble breakfasts served alongside granola and fruit or in smoothies, to the base of dips like tzatziki and desserts such as panacotta, this versatile and nutrient-rich staple is delicious alongside grilled lamb and spicy curries or strained in cheesecloth to make labneh.
