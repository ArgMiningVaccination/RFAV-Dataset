This research project aims to test the immune responses and safety of the JE vaccine (Imojev\u00ae) in children (aged from 5 years ) and adults when delivered by intradermal (ID) injection using a traditional needle and syringe . We would like to compare the immune responses and safety of ID injections with the standard subcutan eous (SC) injection. This Pa rent/Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form tells you about the research project. It explains the tests and treatments involved. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want your child to take part in the researc h.

Ask questions about anything that you do not understand or want to know more about. Before deciding whether or not your child takes part, you might want to talk about it with a relative, friend or your local doct or. Participation in this research is voluntary. If you do not wish for your child to take part, you do not have to. You r child will receive the best possible care whether or not they take part. If you decide you want your child to take part in the research project, you will be asked to sign the consent section. By signing it you are telling us that you: Understand what you have read Consent to your child taking part in the research project Consent for your child to have t he tests and treatments that are described Consent to the use of your child's personal and health information as described You will be given a copy of this Par ent/Guardian Information Sheet and Consent Form to keep . 2 What is the purpose of this res earch? JE is a rare but serious illness caused by the J E. It is spread to humans by infected mosquitoes . It is spread when a mosquito bites an animal (such as pigs or waterbirds) that has the J EV and then this mosquito bites a human. Australia is on the cusp of a potential outbreak of JE viral infections as we move into spring and summer and having back -to-back La Ni\u00f1a seasons. Before this year, J EV had rarely been found in Australia with previous cases noted only in Northern Australia, Cape York and the Torres Strait. It is not known how JEV came into mainland Australia, but the movement of infected mosquitoes or migratory water birds may have played a part in the virus' spread, combin ed with significant rain events. JEV has now been detected in pigs and humans in Western and Southern NSW, as well as in Queensland, Victoria, the Northern Territory and South Australia. Most JEV infections are asymptomatic; however, those with severe infection (less than one per cent) may develop encephalitis which may lead to death or permanent disability. There is no treatment for JE viral infections. One recent study suggests that as much as 3% of the Australian population may be at risk of JEV exposure. Of the 6 JEV deaths recorded in 2022, one was an infant . There are effective and safe JE vaccines which are licensed for children over 2 months old and given by subcutaneous (SC) injection. JE vaccination is currently recommended for people who at higher risk of JE infection because they: work, live or regularly visit a piggery , including farm workers and their families (including children aged 2 months and older) living at the piggery, pig transport workers, veterinarians (including veterinary students and nurses) and others involved in the care of pigs. work directly with mosquitoes OR are diagnostic or research laboratory workers who may be exposed to the virus . The vaccine is also recommended for people aged 2 months or older who live or routinely work in specific Local Government Areas AND : spend significant time outdoors (four hours per day), for unavoidable work, recreation, education, or other essential activities, OR JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 3 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 are living in temporary or flood -damaged accommodation that place them at increased risk of exposure to mosquitoes, OR are engaged in outdoor recovery efforts (clean up) of stagnant waters following floods. People who do not meet the above criteria are considered at lower risk of JE infection and not currently recommended to be given JE vaccine. There is shortage of JE vaccines in Australia. Intradermal (ID) vaccine administration , whilst more painful than a subcutaneous vaccine, only uses 1/5 of the subcutaneous dose and is therefore \"dose sparing\" enabling more people to be vaccinated from each vaccine vial. ID administration of other vaccines using smaller doses have been shown to be as effective as SC administration for other virus es, e.g. yellow fever and rabies. ID administration is widely used for BCG (protects against tuberculosis) and rabies vaccines, and is now recommended for monkey pox vaccination. ID JE vaccination has found to be safe and result in strong antibody respons es in adults ; however , it has not yet been tested in children and adolescents , and older (>50 years) population s. The aim of this project is to study the immune responses and safety of JE viral vaccine (Imojev\u00ae) given ID using traditional needle and syringe in children and adults and to compare safety and immun e responses with Imojev\u00ae given subcutaneously. The results will be very useful to inform vaccination programs if there is a significant JE virus outbreak and especially if we have insufficient supplies of JE vaccines in Australia to vaccinate our most at risk populations, including children. This research has been initiated by Associate Professor Nicholas Wood at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS) in conjuncti on with Professor Colleen Lau and Dr Luis Furuya -Kanamori at the University of Queensland . 3 What does your child's participation in this research involve? Your child will be participating in a clinical vaccine trial and will be given the JE vaccine (Imojev\u00ae) if they pass the screening tests as outlined below. This research project has been designed to make sure the researchers interpret the results in a fair and appropriate way . Healthy children (aged > 5 years ) and adults who are interested in receiving the JE vaccine can take part in this trial. The participant must NOT : have previously had JE disease have previously had the JE vaccine have r eceived dengue or yellow fever vaccines, or are planning to have any of these vaccines in the next 2 months had a history of dengue fever have (or have a family member who has) had a severe reaction to a live attenuated viral vaccine, or are related to someone with known IFNAR1 deficiency have contraindications to JE vaccines be taking immunosu ppressive medication or have medical conditions that impaired the normal functioning of the immune system If you agree for your child to participate in this study, we will first check in more detail whet her the study is suitable . The study doctor will review your child's risk for JE infection. If they are considered by the study doctor to be at higher risk of JE infection because of where you live, your work or recr eational activities they will not be able to participate in this study. They should get t he JE vaccination at your local vaccine clinic. JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 4 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 If they are considered by the study doctor to be at a lower risk of JE infection because of where you live, your work or recreational activities they will be able to participate in the study and will be rand omised to be given either ID or SC vaccination. Being randomised means you will not be able to choose which vaccine they are given but it is decided by chance, like flipping a coin. The NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, based in Sydney, will perform the random isation for this study. If the study is suitable for you r child and you agree for them to participate and receive the allocated vaccine , you will be asked to sign the Par ent/Guardian Consent Form before any study -related procedures can commence. Your child will be in the study for 12 mont hs, during which we will see your child on five occasions. Your child's study doctor may inform your local doctor of your child's participation in this study. Please advise your study doctor if you do not wish this to occur. Visit 1 : On the first visit we will ask you about your child's health and medical conditions, history of JE vaccination or disease. We will collect a blood sample (3-5mls for children ). Females of childbearing potential will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test prior to the vaccine being given to make sure they are not pregnant . As JE vaccination is not routinely recommended during pregnancy and its safety has not been established we do not want to give the JE vaccine to any female who may be pregnant. Females should avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after Imojev\u00ae vaccination. Your child will be randomised to receive the allocated JE vaccine either by SC injection or by ID injection . An authorised immuniser will then perform the vaccination . The vaccine will be given in your child's upper arm (in the deltoid region) for the SC vaccination (Figure 1 a) and either in the forearm or upper arm for the ID vaccination (Figure 1b). Your child can choose which arm they would prefer the vac cine to be given. Figure 1 : Administration of a) subcutaneous (SC) vaccine and b) intradermal (ID) vaccine You and your child will be asked to remain at the clinic for half an hour for observation after vaccination. Following vaccination , we will give you a diary card to complete describing your child's symptoms for the next 7 days after vaccination. We will explain how to use this paper or electronic diary card. We will ask you to measure your child's temperature under the armpit each eve ning and to look at the arm where the vaccine was given for any redness or swelling and meas ure it with a ruler we provide. This visit will take 1 -2 hours. JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 5 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 Visit 2 : At the second visit which takes place 7 -10 days after vaccination , we will ask about potential adverse events, review your child's diary card and look at the injection site. This visit will take around 30 minutes . A subset of p articipants ( only those aged over 10 years ) will be asked at Visit 2 if they agree to provid e a blood sample ( 3-5mls) in addition to having their diary card and injection site reviewed. For these participants the visit will take around 30 minutes. Visit 3 : At the third visit, which takes place at 28 -35 days after vaccination, we will review your child's medical history, ask about any potential adverse events and collect a blood sample ( 3- 5mls for children ). This visit will take around 30 minutes. Visit 4 : At the fourth visit, which takes place at 180-210 days after vaccination, we will review your child's medical history, ask about any potential adverse eve nts and collect a blood sample (3-5mls for children ). We will discuss your child's serology results from Visit 3 with you. This visit will take around 30 mi nutes. Visit 5 : At the fifth visit, which takes place at 12-13 months after vaccination, we will review your child's medical history, ask about any potential adverse events and coll ect a blood sample (3 - 5mls for children ). This visit will take around 30 m inutes. The following table describes the study visits. All visits will be conducted by study staff at relevant medical facility. Visit intervals and procedures Visit Number ( Timing ) Study procedure Baseline visit 1 (Day 0) Explanation and discussion of the study Sign consent form Medical history review Blood sample collection ( 3-5mls for children ) Urine pregnancy test for females (who have started their periods ) Randomised to ID or SC vaccination Imojev\u00ae vaccine administration Observed for \u00bd hour post vaccine Visit 2 (7-10 days post visit 1) Check post -vaccination adverse events diary Medical history review In a subset of participants ( only those aged over 10 years) a blood sample will be taken (around 3-5mls). This is optional at this visit. Visit 3 (28-35 days post visi t 1) Check post -vaccination adverse events Medical history review Take blood sample (around 3-5mls for children ) Visit 4 (180-210 days post visit 1 ) Check post -vaccination adverse events Medical history review Take blood sample (around 3 -5mls for children ) Discuss the Visit 3 serology results Visit 5 (12-13 months post visit 1 ) Check post -vaccination adverse events Medical history review Take blood sample (around 3-5mls for children ) JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 6 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 We may also need to contact you at a later time in order to ask additional questions related to the study. Diary card We will give you either a paper or electronic diary card asking you to record any redness or swelling at the injection site and other symptoms you r child may have after vaccination. You will be given a thermometer to record your child's temperature each evening measured under the armpit . Blood tests The blood samples are taken by an experienced blood collector , nurse immunisation specialist or paediatrician. We will need to take about 3-5mls for children of blood from a vein in your arm. This can be painful and bruising can occur. We can use a local anaesthetic cream to make the blood collection less painful for children. We take the blood to measure the level of antibody to JEV. You will be given your child's individual results and their meaning. Study costs The vaccination, tests and medical care required as part of the research project will be provided to you free of charge . There are no additional costs associated with participation in this research project, nor will the participant be paid for taking part in the study . Families will be compensated for their time and travel in the form of a voucher (for exa mple Coles or Woolworths or other voucher ) per participant. This will be provided as a $75 voucher at Visit 3 (after the completion of Visits 1, 2 and 3), a $25 voucher at Visit 4 and a $25 voucher at Visit 5. 4 What do es your child have to do? It is important that the diary card is completed as accurately and timely as possible and that all study visits are completed. You do not have to change any part of your child's lifestyle. There are no restrictions on your child's diet or exercise. You r child is allowed to take their routine medications. Your child is not allowed to have r eceived dengue or yellow fever vaccines, or hav e any of these vaccines in the 2 months after the JE vaccination. This is because we want to measure for any side effects after the JE vaccine and if another vaccine is given close in time to the JE vaccine it can be hard to know which vaccine may have caused the side effects. 5 Other relevant information about the rese arch project A total of 900 children (> 5 years of age) and adults in Australia are planned to take part in this JE vaccine trial. This trial is being conducted by a collaborative research group and involves paediatricians, vaccine trial specialists and experts in public health . It is being supported by NSW Health , Queensland Health and Victoria Health . 6 Does my chil d have to take part in this research project ? Participation in any research project is voluntary. If you do not wish your child to take part, you do not have to. If you decide that you want your child to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw them from the project at any stage. If you do decide that you want your child to take p art, you will be given this Parent/Guardian Information and Consent Form to sign and you will be given a copy to keep. JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 7 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 If you decide that you want your child to take part or not , or to withdraw your child from the study at any time point , this will not affect your child's routine treatment, relationship with those treating your child or the relationship wit h the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (Sydney Children's Hospital Network) or Murrumbidgee Local Health District . 7 What are the possible benefits of taking part? We can not guarantee or promise that you r child will receive any benefits from this research; however, likely benefits include protection from JEV disease . We know that the JE vaccine is around >95% effective when given subcutaneously in preventing children and adults from JE disease. We will discuss your child's serology results with you and advise whether their immune system has adequately responded. This will primarily be based on the blood test your child has at Visit 3 and discussed at Visit 4. The doctor will discuss recommendatio ns based on this result. 8 What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part? You will know whether you r child has been given the Imojev vaccine by the subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID) route. Serology testing is not normally performed to check vaccine responses to the subcutaneous Imojev vaccine and it is assumed that you r child is protected. In this study we will test your child's seroconversion at Visit 3 (Day 28 -35) and you will be to ld these serology results at Visit 4 (180 -210 days after vaccination). If you r child has been given the Imojev vaccine by the SC route , they are considered to be protected even if the blood result at Visit 3 does not show seroconversion. This is current cl inical care. If you r child has been give n the ID Imojev vaccine and the blood result at Visit 3 shows you r child has seroconverted then you r child is considered to be protected. If you r child has been give n the ID Imojev vaccine and the blood result at V isit 3 shows you r child has not seroconverted the study doctor will discuss this result with you. If your child's risk of being infected by JE virus increases due to changes in work, travel or recreation then you r child can receive the Imojev vaccine via t he recommended SC route at least 6 months after they received the Imojev vaccine via the ID route in this study . Medical treatments often cause side effects. Your child may have none, some or all of the effects listed below, and they may be mild, moderate or severe. If your child has any of these side effects, or you are worried about them, talk with the study doctor. The study doctor will also be looking out for side ef fects. Tell the study doctor immediately about any new or unusual sym ptoms that your child gets and they can discuss the best way of managing any side effects with you. The JE vaccine is safe, effective and has been used extensively over many years in Australian Defence Force personnel, residents of the Torres Strait Islands and many travellers to southeast Asia. When the vaccine is given by the intradermal route, it is more painful than when administered subcutaneously. As with most vaccinations, there are some common side effects. Common side effects of JE vaccines given subcutaneously are: pain tenderness redness JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 8 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 swelling where the vaccine was given. Fever may occur, more often in children. Headache or muscle aches can also occur, mainly in adults . In studies of children aged 12 to 24 months, around 40% of children reported injection site reactions, including: pain (32%) redness (23%) swelling (9%) Other side effects were also reported including: fever (21%) appetite loss (26%) irritability (28% abnormal crying (23%) These side effects usually go away within a few days. For intradermal administration, multi -dose vials will be handled in accordance with strict infection control and ATAGI guidelines in which circumstances the risk of acquiring a serious bacterial infection or blood -borne virus is thought to be extremely low . Severe reactions to JE vaccine are very rare. As with any medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction or side effect . Reproductive risks It is not known whether this vaccine ( Imojev ) can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Therefore, if your daughter is of childbearing age, she must have a negative pregnancy test before entering this study and confirm that she does not intend to become pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination . If she is sexually active, a form of birth control approved by the study doctor or member of the study staff is recommended to be used for 4 weeks following the study vaccination. Medically acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal contraceptive (such as oral, injection, trans -dermal patch, implant, cervical ring); Barrier methods (condom or diaphragm); intrauterine device (IUD) and abstinence. If you think your daughter might be pregnant, you must contact the study doctor immediately . If your daughter becomes pregnant during the study , she will continue to be followed up for the outcome of the pregnancy and for safety assessments. 9 What wi ll happen to my child's test samples? This study is an investigator -initiated study. Your child's blood sample will be sent to the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane for JEV antibody testing . This laboratory will be analysing the de -identified blood samples to check your child's antibody levels. They are a specialist referenc e laboratory that has extensive experience in the conduct of JEV serology in Australia. The analysis and interpretation of results will be performed by study investigators Your child's samples will never be sold. You and your child will not benefit financially if this research leads to development of a new treatment or medical test. If you provide consent for your child's samples to be used in future research, this will allow us to utilise the blood samples in studies we conduct on vaccine preventable diseases. Any such future research must be approved by the ethics committee (who wil l be made aware that we wish to use the existing samples) before we will include your child's sample. JEVID -2 Master Parent Guardian Information Sheet/Consent Form, version 2.0 _ 12 Dec 2022 Page 9 MLHD version 1.0, 11 Jan 2023 10 What if new information arises during this research project? Sometimes during the course of a research project, new information becomes available about the treatment that is being studied. If this happens, the study doctor will tell you about it . 11 Can my child have other treatments during this research project? Whilst your child is participating in this research project, they will be able to ta ke all of the medications or treatments they have been normally taking for any condition or for other reasons. It is important to tell the study doctor and the study staff about any treatments or medications your child may be taking, including over -the-counter medications, vitamins or herbal remedies, acupuncture or other alternative treatments. You should also tell the study doctor about any changes to these during your child's participation in the research project . 12 What if I withdraw my child from this research project? If you decide to withdraw your child from the project, please notify a member of the research team before you withdraw them . If you do withdraw them during the research project, the study doctor and relevant study staff will not collect additional personal information, although personal information already collected will be retained to ensure that the results of the research project can be measured properly and to comply with law. You should be aw are that data collected by the sponsor up to the time of withdrawal will form part of the research project results. If you do not want them to do this, you must tell them before your child joins the research project. 13 Could this research project be stopped unexpectedly? This research project may be stopped unexpectedly for a variety of reasons. These may include reasons such as: Unacceptable side effects Decisions made by local regulatory/health authorities Part 2 How is the research project being conducted? 14 What will happen to information about m y child ? Your child's individual serology results will be given to you with an explanation of the meaning o f the results. By signing the consent form , you consent to the study doctor and relevant research staff collecting and using personal information about your child for the research project. Your child's information will only be used for the purpose of this research project and it will only be disclosed with your permission, except as required by law.
