Resources at the Ready Hawaii Medicinal Options has alre ady entered into leases with a ffiliated entities and purchase agreements for the (2) manufactur ing facility and the (2) requi red dispensaries. It has also pre- designed its manufacturing fac ility based on an e xisting buildi ng. The four dispensaries have also had design plans prepared from th em. In addition, as part of it s due diligence process, Hawaii Medicinal Options has researched the equipment it will need for both the manufacturing facility as well as the dispensaries a nd has located vendors and supplie rs for the equipment for immediate delivery upon award of license.. Hawaii Medicinal Opt ions is confident that it will have its facilities up and runni ng, with the requisite supplies of medical marijuana, before the deadlines prescribed. The finan cial outlay necessary to start a new manufacturing facility as well as four independent, standalone di spensaries is a challenge tha t will necessitate very significant financial resources. Hawaii Medi cinal Options has negotiated te rms with (3) investors that will cover all costs for construc tion and operation for (36) months. Collaboration with Uni versity of Hawaii Hawaii Medicinal Options inte nds to be an industry leader in co llaborating with research universities to study and improve the efficacy of medical marij uana. Hawaii Medicinal Options intends to be a valued partner of t he Hawaii State Department o f Health in the implementation of its medical cannabis program. We look forward to working with t he Department to appreciation in advance for your consider ation of this application. Hawaii Medicinal Options has the will, the passion, the financi al wherewithal and the necessary fundamentals to quickly commence operations and be in a positio n to manufacture and dispense medical marijuana under the aggre ssive time frames. Based on th e proven track record of its CEO and executive team in starti ng large scale projects, develo ping them successfully, and then running them profitably for decades, much of the guess work has been eliminated on whether Hawaii Medicinal Options would ha ve the resources, knowledge an d expertise to successfully operate one of the two sanctioned businesses to be awarded. It will be a patient centric, security focused, professional organizati on that will be a credit to Haw aii/Maui. #2 Hawaii Medicinal Options is exceptionally well positioned to serve the public interest by rapidly launching manufacturing operations to meet the needs of all Maui patients by July 2016. Our worl d-class manufacturing facilities - (2) newly constructed , fully modernized, 30,000 square -foot facilities - will be operational within 75 days of receipt of award. Dispensary s ites will be newly constructed, fully modernized, 4,000 square -foot buildings in the cities of Kahului and Kihei and will be operational within 75 days of receipt of award. Each dispensary site has been selected to facilitate a safe and easy patient flow, from entry through point of sale and exiting. Site size will also accommodate the distinct areas of a dispensary, e.g. check -in and security stations; patient waiting room; patient education and counseling area; point of sale area; product vault and product storage; security and cash vaults; private office, employee break rooms and public bathrooms; and a secure receiving area for delivery of incoming products. Hours of operation will be Monday through Saturday from 8am to 8pm. To accommodate the needs of physically disabled individuals, dispensaries will have ample handicapped accessible parking, ADA- compliant entrances , and public bathrooms. Each dispensary will be housed in a secured and access -controlled facility with 24/7 year -round video surveillance and alarm systems. Dispensary management will coordinate with local officials and law enforcement to provide safe and secure dispensing. Each dispensary will be divided into limited access (e.g. patients, caregivers, and staff) and restricted access (e.g. Pharmacist, Business Manager, Inventory Manager, and Security Site Supervisor) areas. Armed security guards will supervise the entrance and perimeter of the premises during operational hours. Dispensary designs will also allow staff to visually supervise the various unrestricted and restricted store areas in conjunction with robust electronic surveillance. Critically, the layout of the facility will accommodate manufacturing and cultivation process flows with minimal build -out needed after the first phase of construction to accommodate increasing patient needs . Installed, turnkey infrastructure includes: FDA -approved QA/QC labs; HVAC performing 22 air exchanges/hour; climate controls with back- up; industrial power, back -up generators and water; and RO4 water purification system. Our proven manufacturing processes and pharma -standard facility will enable Hawaii Medicinal Options to deliver a steady supply of medicine to meet growing patient demand: After a first run in July 2016, we will be able to serve the needs of 2000 patients (with an initial 2x safety factor) and double our output every 2- 3 months as necessary. The geographic distr ibution of our dispensaries in Kahului and Kihei will serve the public interest by offering excellent public access and at least one store within a two -hour drive from any point on Maui . Hawaii Medicinal Options is also well equipped for excellence in QA -QC compliance, with our standard operating procedu res documented and controlled with schematic workflows generated by BiotrackTHC , a robust process management tool used by a large number of other large growing/dispensing organizations, as well as, the recent recipient of Hawaii's contracting document control software provider. We use our SOP tool with the BiotrackTHC electronic batch record and compliance software for precise verification, documentation and enforcement of over 130 quality assurance and quality control checkpoints throughout our manufacturing process. Quality Assurance Check Points require laboratory -testing procedures for potency, quality and safety purposes, including microbial, pesticide and heavy metal screening. Critical Control Chec k Points require inventory, weighing, labeling and other procedures for regulatory compliance, data collection and tracking traceability purposes. If chosen for the program, Hawaii Medicinal Options will initially outsource QA/QC lab testing needs, but wil l operate an in -house QA/QC lab for day -to-day operational quality control within six (6) months of operation. Our SOPs also enforce stringent inventory controls , which will be adapted to the s tate-mandated supply chain controls being developed by QA/QC la b. Finally, QA/QC lab has the financial resources necessary to meet the DoH operational and regulatory requirements for registered organizations. Our shareholder base has financed our state of the art, 45,000sf manufacturing facility in Holbrook, Arizona ; and we hope to have the privilege of funding world- class operations to provide exceptional service to patients on the island of Maui. In addition to Hawaii Medicinal Option's Management Team, the company is in discussions with local and potential team members who will come on board once the license is granted. Our staffing timeline will vary by location. All management and personnel will be hired, vetted and trained to the strictest standards and guidelines - no exceptions. Site operations will favor the local community; Hawaii Medicinal Options will strive wherever possible to staff the manufacturing facility & dispensary with local hires.

Hawaii M edicinal Options Disaster Recovery Plans will support core operations in t he event of a system failure or disaster, and ensure mechanisms are in place to support patient continuity of care during such an event. Our Disaster Recovery Plan will: Define Key Assets, Threats and Scenarios, including all business systems like computer system failure, records loss; manufacturing facility and distribution facility physical scenarios, human resources, and including both natural and man- made threats . Systems - Seed -to-sale system , accounting, e - mail, and web portal are just some of the key systems the dispensary will need to have operational during a disaster. Data - Backups to be performed and stored offsite. Define recovery window Define recovery solutions Prepare recove ry plan Establish plan of communications - Phone, I nternet, and Fax capabilities are critical to supporting patients and staff as well as procuring inventory. Define recovery site used to implement plan s imilar to other medical em ergency preparedness a ctivities . Hawaii Medicinal Options intends to conduct annual exercises utilizing complex scenarios to test the response and resili ence of the entire supply chain. Our newly built facilities will make weather related disasters less li kely than in an older , existing facility. There will be a Dispensary Policy and Procedure (P&P) Manual supporting our Operating Plan . It details all company and management -level operations, as well as operations documentation for ancillary departments such as Human Resources, Accoun ting, Sales and Marketing. Operations Training Materials - In addition to the Operations Manuals and supplemental operations tools, we have developed a comprehensive training curriculum that instructs department managers on how to train staff members , and ensures comprehension and performance levels by using a Final Performance Test for each department. Hawaii Medicinal Options has ample expansion capabilities. The company can expand within the facility to triple cultivation c apacity by adding an addition al 30,000 square feet of cultivation area. These areas will be prepared to immediately expand into them as needed during the initial renovation. The processing and manufacturing areas are designed to handle the manufacturing needs for the full cultiva tion capacity and will not need to be expanded. Additionally, Hawaii Medicinal Options has the ability with Department approval to expand into another existing 90,000 square feet of greenhouse space on leased property and has access to another 6.5 acres of existing greenhouse on a contiguous property. Adequate power and water supply permits the operation to begin cultivation operations without costly and timely utilities upgrades. C ultivation areas will be designed by our subsidiary contracting company, Tricor Mechanical , to accommodate operation -specific air exchange and airflow, interior layout, lighting, and utilities. The cultivation operations consist of propagation, cultivation, harvest, processing, bulk storage, packaging, and transfer to the manuf acturing unit. Hawaii Medicinal Options designed the facility with the advice of consultants qualified in the marijuana industry to develop efficient and workable spaces. In order to meet initial and future qualifying patient demand in a quick and efficien t manner with minimal impact on the environment and the surrounding community, the company will build out all cultivation spaces during the initial construction phase. The construction plan allow s not only for quick expansion of production, but also allows for well - planned production schedules, the separation of similar strains, and allows for strict environmental controls in each area to allow for variable temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide based on individual strain requirements. The ability to control these conditions with precision is one of the most important measures that can be taken to reduce contamination from pests, molds, and mildew . The Hawaii Medicinal Option s manufacturing facility will be developed with compliance and efficiency as the guiding design fea tures. FDA standards will be applied throughout the facility. The following items highlight specific design characteristics: The manufacturing facility will be organized to maintain the separation of different materials and provide adequate space for cleaning and storage. The flow of production materials, packaging components, in- process materials, bulk and packaged products through the building will be designed to prevent product mix -ups or contamination. The design of the facilities includes airlock entry and exit hallways, clean rooms, and strict flow controls for personnel and materials. The facility is also designed so that preventative maintenance activities can be performed without interruption to work process or impact to our cl ean production areas. Equipment for adequate control of air temperature, pressure, humidity, dust, or microorganisms will be provided when appropriate for the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of medical marijuana products. Air filtration systems will be used for air intake to production areas. If air is recirculated to production areas, measures will be taken to control the recirculation of dust. In areas where air contamination occurs during production, there will be adequate exhaust or other air handling systems to control any airborne contaminants. Hawaii Medicinal Option's manufacturing facility will feature separate and defined areas with specific environmental controls designed to prevent cross -contamination and mix -ups of components, marij uana, or finishe d products during any operation. The production and manufacturing operations are divided into distinct operating units that specialize in certain activities in order to maintain an effective division of duties. These units include: Cultivation Processing Extraction Manufacturing Packaging and Labeling Lab Testing Quarantine and Holding Transportation Staging Different operations will be performed within specifically defined areas of adequate size for that activity. Sep arate and defined areas provide controls to help prevent product contamination and mix -ups during the course of the operations. Separate areas are required for the following tasks: Receipt, identification, storage and quarantine of production materials, manufacturing supplies, packaging components and labeling held for the appropriate sampling, testing, or examination Storage of released production materials, manufacturing supplies, packaging components and labeling Manufacturing and processing operat ions Storage of in- process materials Packaging and labeling operations Quarantine storage of packaged products before release Storage of finished products after release Quality assurance and laboratory operations Holding rejected production mat erials, manufacturing supplies, packaging components, labeling, in process materials and product before disposition Product packaging, holding, and shipping .

The concentration of total tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and total cannabidiol (CBD) will define the brand. The planned formulary THCH Hawaii Medicinal Options will hire within the local communities, support local charities, promote local outreach programs, offer employees paid days off for volunteering - provide the community with free educational workshops on healthy living topics, medical marijuana's background, benefits - safe product use and invigorate the local economy in every way possible. #3 Financial To ensure a six (6) month timeline, Hawaii Medicinal Options, has raised sufficient funds to complete all phases of this project to meet the entire build out, production and thirty- six (36) months of operating capital. Furthermore, we are designing our manufacturing facilities to accommodate additional phased expansions, according to our Operating Plan, by phasing in additional cul tivation capacity within thirty (30) days as demand increases. We would begin implemen ting our Operating Plan i mmediately upon registration issuance. This immediate access to existing funds enables us to uphold our commitment to have two (2) approved medical marijuana dispensaries and manufacturing facilities by July 2016. Sources and Uses of Funds Based on the Ha waii Medicinal Option s Team's extensive experience, it has been determined all anticipated costs associated with initial star tup costs and operations of (2) manufacturing and (2) dispensaries , including mortgage payme nts, new construction costs for the dispensaries /manufacturing, staffing, equipment and the full implementation of the Operating #4 SECURITY - PERSONNEL Hawaii Medicinal Options will contract local, uniformed armed and unarmed security personnel in order to provide maximum safety for our employees and customers. This team will report s and/ or c n #5 Education- Maintaining enough, safe accessible location, cu stomer satisfaction Education It is Hawaii Medicinal Options ' intention to integrate a high l evel of patient/staff interface into its dispensary operations. An ac tively licensed pharmacist by t he State of Hawaii will always hold the position of Hawaii Medicina l Options Patient Care Mana ger, and will be the direct supervisor of all Patient Services department employees. Only m embers of the Patient Services Department will be authorized t o counsel, educate and discuss a pproved medical marijuana products with patients, and only under the direct supervision o f and in consultation with the Patient Care Manager. The Patient Care Manager will ensure all department employees are properly trained and frequently e valuated in their knowledge of approved medical marijuana products and associated risks i n which they are discussing with patients. In compliance with state law, upon request of a patient, the pa tient's designated caregi ver, if applicable, and/or the patient's practitioner , this facility must provide a patient-sp ecific log of medical marijuana products that includes brand, administration form, dosage, date s dispensed, and any return of product. The BioTrackTHC functiona lity allows Hawaii Medicinal Options to custom-create tools to assure conformity with a pplicable state laws. To this end, we will create a Patient Purchase Log report that is acce ssible to authorized employees under the oversight of the Patient Care Manager. Building on this relation our dispensary staff wi ll educate patients on the features, benefits and nuances of interac ting through a dispensary. The c ertified patient and designated caregiver(s) will receive one-to-one guidance by the Pharmacist and/or the Dispensing Assistants under the Pharmacist's direct and continuous supervision from r eception through fulfillment. Patients and caregivers will have the opportunity to have quest ions answered during this orientation. The patient/caregiv er will learn about the medical marijuana prescription given by the patient's physician, and the product and brand, which fulfi ll that prescription. Specific information relevant to the prescr ibed medical marijuana will b e carefully explained. Patients/caregivers will lear n about, but not limited to: speci fic dosage directions and instructions for administration; warning of a dverse effects and/or any poten tial dangers; a warning about driving, operating equipment, ch ildcare and making important de cisions while under the influence of medical marijuana; methods to secure and store the product at the patient's home; a list of excipients; any allerge n warning; possible contra-indic ations; how to recognize what may be problematic usage or substan ce abuse of medical marijuana, the availability of different varieties of marijuana and the purported effects of the differe nt strains, information about the purported effectiven ess of various methods, forms and routes of administering medical marijuana, the prohibition on the smoking of marijuana in publi c locations, places open to the public and places exposed to public view and services or treatment; legal issues, e.g. where the product can and cannot be used according to federal and state r egulations; illega lity of giving the product to anyone else; how to pr operly dispose of unwanted, ex cess, or contaminated medical marijuana product; and other Departmentally mandated warnings o r explanatory statements. In addition to orientation and counsel ing, which provides pertinen t and specific information, as described above, each patient and c aregiver is given DOH approv ed resources for additional information. Hawaii Medicinal Op tions will make available a var iety of printed materials prepared by professional, medical and/or pharmaceutical experts and approved by the DOH. Visual displays at dispensary sites will also advise patients a bout key facts and information contained in the product inserts. The Pharmacist will always be available to patients/caregivers, responding to their questions on a pproved medical marijuana dur ing any visit to the dispensary. After the dispensary experien ce, patient-dispensary interaction continues through patient education seminars and/or elect ronic communications, (e.g. emai l, newsletters and social media). The dispensary will send out e mail communications to help patie nts/caregivers keep track of timeframes, e.g. that they are ne aring the end of their month's supply or that their registration ID might be soon expiring. At no time will the staff of Hawaii Med icinal Options provide prescriptions. Furthermore, Hawaii Medicinal Options will make available one-o n-one counseling to educate our patients on the benefits of a lternative, homeopathic health care that will accentuate any current treatments. Education and counseling for the following regimens will round out services in a commitment to improve \"ove rall\" quality of life benefits. These will include seminars, retreats, educational materi al on the benefits of nutrition, yo ga, herbs, massage, meditation, acupuncture, joint manipulati on, soft tissue manipulation, hydr otherapy, therapeu tic counseling, reiki/ magnetic therapy and total system cleansing. QUANTITY To meet the needs of all Maui patie nts, Hawaii Medicinal Option s manufacturing and dispensing operations will have the initia l capacity to manufacture up to 3000 pounds monthly or 1500 pounds every 15 days. Each dispensary is mandated to provide me dical marijuana to 500 patients at a rate of 4oz/15 days or 8oz/ 30day. Hawaii Medicinal Options has a safety factor of 2x to accommodate this need with the experience and capacity to ramp up production expeditiously to 4x to 1500lbs/15 days & 5000lbs/30days. LOCATION Hawaii Medicinal Options has car efully considered and selected our dispensary locations. First and foremost, our business pla n and mission focuses on serving the health needs of patients across Maui. To meet the needs of all Maui patients, Hawaii Med icinal Options manufacturing and dispensing sites were selecte d to be located in Kahului and Kehei. Hawaii Medicinal Options has chosen dispensing facility lo cations that are beneficial to the island and local communities. They are not on the same roadwa y and not within five hundred (5 00) feet of a building occupied exclusively as a school or plac e of worship. Sites will be loca ted in areas that allow a large number of patients to avail of di spensary services, while addre ssing the difficulties of non-urban populations in reaching a dispen sary. Ample, secured parking wi ll be available for both locations. Dispensary sites will be accessible by public transp ortation and have sufficient and convenient roadway infrastructur e. Hawaii Medicinal Options man ufacturing and dispensaries will be located indoors, in enclo sed secure facili ties that are suitable for dispensing of products to patients and caregivers. Securit y, architectural and engineerin g designs will adequately and suitably reflect the needs and c oncerns of the community within which the dispensary is located and address the security and access needs of our customers. We will comply with the ADA building codes to accommodate t he compromised health and physic al limitations of our clients. Hawaii Medicinal Options will ensure that detailed descriptions of plans, procedures and systems will be implemented and maintain ed for tracking, recordkeeping, record retention and surveillance systems relating to the sale and dispensing at eac h dispensary. They will be pre- approved by the DOH, kept on file and made available for review at any time. Each dispensary is designed to promote a safe envi ronment to facilitate the health needs of our customers. All infrastructure and exterior desi gn will be visually aesthetic, warm and inviting. The building components, including site desi gn, infrastructural build, elect rical, plumbing and HVAC, will comply with all state and lo cal zoning, building, fire and ADA regulations and codes. Customer Satisfaction Hawaii Medicinal Options values our customers and their experie nce with our organization. We strive to accentuate their experience by mitigating complaints and adverse events. It will be Hawaii Medicinal Options goal to provide multiple selections of medical marijuana to accommodate the patient's needs per every visit. We are committ ed to employing enough staff so every patient can be tended t o in a very courteous, informat ional and expeditious manner. We will have Service Specialists ava ilable to invest expedited ser vice to those patients whose health is compromised and physically l imiting. Every patient will have an opportunity to ask questions and will prudently be informed about all medications purchased. We will always stride to offer superior medical marijuana and s trains that always meet the hig hest expectations. Hawaii Medical Options will pledge to s taff our dispensaries with help ful, courteous sales team members in a friendly atmosphere at lo cations that will be accommodatin g to service the residents of Maui. Furthermore, Hawaii Medici nal Options will be vigilant by investigating all patient complaints and adverse events, i ncluding allergies, suspected t o be caused by any medical marijuana brand product offere d by Hawaii Medicinal Options. A ll incidents of complaints or adverse events which have or may have an adverse impact on pati ent safety or satisfaction will be documented and reported to the H awaii Medicinal Options Mana gement within the same working day of the event occurren ce. The Office Manager and Pha rmacist plays a critical role in the accurate identification and c orrect interpretation of compl aints, allergies, and adverse events to medical marijuana products i s critical to prevent serious pa tient harm. Hawaii Medicinal Options has implemented standard ized definitions and processes to document such events. Upon initial patient claim of a com plaint or adverse events, the pha rmacist will conduct a thorough interview with the patient to obt ain all necessary information and complete the Allergy and Adverse Event Reporting Form. The pharmacist will conduct a pat ient interview to obtain all necessary patient data and detail ed explanation regarding the e vent that took place, including additional medical attention t hat was required due to the event (such as hospitalization, urgent care, etc.) A patient's complet e history of allergies and adver se events to other products will be obtained for accurate record keep ing and identification of the cause of the event. The pharmacist will aid in determining if the event was due to an immune-media ted allergic response. In this case, re-challenging with any med ical marijuana-containing prod uct may pose serious risk to the patient's health and would not be r ecommended. The pharmacist w ill assess if any of the following events took place that may indicate an allergy to the product: Anaphylaxis, shortness of breath, ash, hives The pharmacist will aid in determining if the event is considered to be \"serious\". A serious adverse e vent is one that leads to one of the following serious outcomes: Hospitalization required, life th reatening, leads to permanent disability or is incapacitating, leads to organ toxicity, causes birt h defect, results in overdose. H awaii Medicinal Options will be fully transparent with all compl aints and adverse events that o ccur with the DOH as we believe in taking measures to ensure th e safety and satisfaction of all patients. We are committed to helping expand the knowledge base of medical marijuana products and understanding what adverse events the product ma y be associated with is imperative . This knowledge will help Hawaii Medicinal Options and its p artners to educate patients a s well as understand the best strategies for use of the produc t. We also recognize a patient' s overall well being, quality of life and happiness is a collaborative approach with mandating engage ment with the patient, the caregiver, physician, and Hawaii Medicinal Options. We believe the patient should be involved in each step of their own care , and will devise a plan in combi nation with the patient, pharmacist, and practitioner to assess the be nefits of medical marijuana us e versus the risks and collectively determine the safest way to proc eed with medical marijuana use or discontinue use. #6 Criminal background check Background Checks as Standard Operating Procedure #7 Inventory tracking, security and sales limits S ecurity Department of Health. #8 Lab Testing Before processing can occur, batch test samples will be taken to assure the plant is of the highest quality and will pass all the residual pesticide, microbiological, mycotoxin , as well as active ingredient potency test. Established methodologies exist for preparing a sample of useable marijuana for testing. These methods vary slightly based on the intent of the test (e.g. detecting pesticides, or potency, or microbiological, and mycotoxin). As all inventory transactions are tracked and logged in BiotrackTHC samples sent to the lab, or inventory removed from the system for any reason, are tracked in un -modifiable log entries. Along with any inventory or plant removal from Biotrac kTHC notes must be applied. The batch that the inventory is removed from is recorded, along with date and time and person authorizing the inventory adjustment. All Product testing will be done by Hawaii S tate certified laboratories [L 2015, c 241, pt of \u00a72] . Testing shall only be performed on the final medical marijuana product equivalent to the sealed medical marijuana product dispensed to the patient (e.g., in a sealed vial or intact capsule). Within BiotrackTHC there are a number of functions designed s pecifically for use with laboratory testing. Extensive logs track each action performed at the cultivation center and with BiotrackTHC testing results API, testing results can be automatically sent from the testing lab to the BiotrackTHC , eliminating the possibility of manual data entry errors. O ur system will capture all necessary quality assurance info, approved testing laboratory information, and test results. This includes but is not limited to the following : Potency Synthetic can nabinoids Terpene Residual solvents Pesticide residuals Microbiologicals Alfatoxin and ochratoxin Heavy metals Furthermore, Hawaii Medicinal Options -Operations Director will utilize BiotrackTHC to track laboratory facility detail information options, notate lab credentials, log, directly associate lab results with a specific lot or batch of product for Inventory adjustment logging for testing sample removals , separate products pending t esting from available inventory and direct porting lab results to product labels. All of this information is easily ported on to the inventory or product label for accuracy. Hawaii Medicinal Options shall only produce such forms of medica l marijuana as approved by the DOH according to the following requirements: (1) Each registered organization may initially produce up to seven types [\u00a7329D -10] of medical marijuana product with prior approval of the department. These brands may be produced in multiple forms as approved by the DOH. Thereafter, the department may approve additional brands . However, in no case shall marijuana in unprocessed whole flower form be made available to certified patients. (2) Each medical marijuana product brand, in its final form, shall be defined as having a specific concentration of tot al Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and total Cannabidiol (CBD) and shall have a consistent cannabinoid profile. The concentration of the following cannabinoids, at a minimum, must be reported: (i) Tetrahydrocannabinol component at > 0.1% (3) The final medical marijuana product shall not contain less than ninety -five percent (95%) or more than one hundred- five percent (105%) of the concentration of total THC or total CBD indicated on the label for this brand. Each brand shall have a maximum of 10 mg tot al THC per dose. Ultra -High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) will test these properties . Pesticides Testing We will ask the lab to take our flower and trim sample and perform an ASAP probe screen, followed by a Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) phase, and ending with Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry test to determine that the sample meets the acceptable standard for a pesticide residues in any food items set forth in subpart C of USEPA's regulation for Tolerances and Exemptions for Pesticide Chem ical Residues in Food (40 CFR 180 (2014)). Microbiological Testing We will ask the lab to take our sample, extract the sample in butter, place the extract in organism specific trays and once the trays have set the tray colonies are counted to assure that t he samples meets the recommended microbial and fungal limits for marijuana products in colony forming units per gram (CFU/g) set out in the AHP American Herbal Pharmacopoeia Monograph. Mycrotoxin/Aflatoxin Testing We will ask the lab to run our sample through an aflatoxin column to trap the aflatoxins for analyze in a fluorometer to determine that sample meets the following standard; Residual Solvent We will ask the lab to take our marijuana concentrate sample extract and homogenize the sample, place it in a Headspace- gas chromatography system to assure the sample solvent is less than 10 ppm. Additional Testing - as required by the DOH 1. E. coli 2. Klebsiella 3. Pseudomonas (for products to be vaporized) 4. Salmonella 5. Streptococcus 6. Bile tolerant gram negative bacteria 7. Aspergillus 8. Mucor species 9. Penicillium species 10. Thermophilic Actinomycetes species 11. Aflatoxin 12. Ochratoxin 13. Antimony 14. Arsenic 15. Cadmium 16. Chromium 17. Copper 18. Lead 19. Nickel 20. Zinc 21. Mercury 22. Any pesticide/herbicide/fungicide used during production of the medical marihuana product 23. Any growth regulator used during production of the medical marihuana product All sampling and testing of each lot of final medical marihuana product shall be conducted with a statistically significa nt number of samples and with acceptable methodologies such that there is assurance that all lots of each medical marijuana product are adequately assessed for contaminants and the cannabinoid profile is consistent throughout #9 Confidentiality Hawaii Medicinal Options pledges to keep all personal information collected from, but not exclusive to patients, physicians, caregivers, family members and therapists, confidential, secure and private. Hawaii Medicinal Options privacy policy has been d evised and created to ensure that anyone affiliated with Hawaii Medicinal Options understands our commitment to meet their security and privacy standards.

Personal information Security Our patient -verification system will be also be handled by the BiotrackTHCTM software system. Once a patient is logged into BiotrackTHCTM, all pertinent records will be on file, and only current card -carrying patients will be permitted to purchase product. This is ensured through patient check -in feature. The system automatically looks for expired documentation upon patient arrival. Furthermore, the system will allow Hawaii Medicinal Options employees to notify patients with expired or soon- to-be-expired documentation via email or text message. Purchases will be processed through BiotrackTHCTM point of s ale (POS) system, as foll ows: (1) Prior to entrance to the dispensary, and then again at the sale of medical cannabis to a patient, the Security Staff, and then pharmacist will physically inspect the patient's driver's license (or state issued ID), verify the identity o f the patient and confirm the validity of the card. (2) The Pharmacy Technician shall then go to the patient Management Page of the BiotrackTHCTM system and pull up the applicable patient profile by entering the patient's name, driver's license, or registr ation number (3) If the patient's name or driver 's license is not found in the s ystem's patient Profile page, the Pharmacist will create a new patient Profile (4) If the BiotrackTHCTM System flags any patient with invalid information showing on his/her pat ient Profile, the login will terminate . If a patient is flagged, the s ystem notifies the agent as to which information is invalid so it can be corrected (if possible) (5) In the event that the patient is unqualified, invalid, or ba nned and the s ystem block s the sales process, the agent will notify the patient of the reasons for the denial of the sale, and offer suggestions for compliance (if available) (6) In the event the s ystem permits the transaction, the cashier will pull up the patient's information fr om the POS and begin the transaction. The POS will include a list of the customer's previous purchases, as well as symptoms, ailments, or disabilities (7) The POS system will also assure compliance with regulatory controls and limitations placed on patient cannabis acquisition and will verify that the amount of product the patient or designated primary caregiver is requesting does not exceed the time allowances under HS law . (8) The pharmacist will enter the following information directly into the POS datab ase (i) Name and number of the registry identification card of the patient or of the designated primary caregiver of the patient (ii) The amount of the me dical cannabis dispensed (iii) W hether the medical cannabis was dispensed to the patient or to the designated caregiver (iv) T he date and time at which the medical cannabis was dispensed; (v) the number of the medical cannabis dispensary registration (9) The pharmacist will then process the order, retrieve the product and provide it to the patient. All patient records, including demographic information; registry number and expiration date; limitations on purchases; purchases and denials of sale, and other pertinent information will be maintained on the BiotrackTHCTM system. Once a patient's record is cre ated in that system, any subsequent modification must be logged with details of the changes made, username, and timestamp. State -issued identification cards, recommendations, intake forms, and all paperwork relating to the intake process will be attached t o each patient profile for easy viewing at any time. All such information will be kept strictly confidential and will be stored in accredited, HIPPA - compliant servers. BiotrackTHCTM contains comprehensive protections for patient privacy and confidentialit y of patient information. All patients will be advised of their right to confidentiality, including rights under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) additionally Hawaii Medicinal O ptions will have all applicable privacy forms reviewed and executed by each patient. Upon sale of any product to the patient, the Pharmacist or Pharmacist Technician will enter and digitally sign this transaction into BiotrackTHCTM patient log and inventory system. The patient will receive a re ceipt generated by the BiotrackTHCTM system showing the following \"prescription\" information: patient name, address, prescription number, date, time, brand, type (Sativa, Indicia, hybrid), dosage form, quantity (milligrams, milliliters, total weight/active ingredient weight), chemical quantity remaining per 2-week limit, retail price, company's name/logo, address and phone number , the manufacturer (cultivation center registry number), educational content (uses, effects, warnings, and general medical -use strain information). All certified patients and designated caregivers must sign a code of conduct before Hawaii Medicinal Optio ns will allow them to purchase from the dispensary for the first time. The code of conduct includes a guarantee that patient records are stored and maintained in compliance with HIPAA, and that all consultations provided by dispensary staff are confidential. Each signed code of conduct will be scanned and attached to the patient's record. Before working at the dispensary, all agents must sign a confidentiality statement, which is an agreement that the agent will comply with patient confidentiality, the dispen sary, and HIPAA. Any violation of the confidentiality statement will lead to the immediate termination of the dispensary agent responsible for the violation. #10 Signage The appearance of all Hawaii Medicinal Options properties will be professional, orderly, dignified, and consistent with the traditional style of pharmacies and medical offices. External signage will be restricted to a single sign, with only black and white colors, and will not: (1) Illuminate , at any time , (2) Advertise medical marijuana brand names or utilize graphics related to marihuana or paraphernalia on the exterior of the physical structu res, (3) Display pictures of un-approved medical marihuana products and paraphernalia (4) Use any statem ent that is false or misleading, (5) Make any statement that falsely disparages a competitor's products , (6) Make any statement, design, or representation, picture or illustration that is obscene or i ndecent , (7) Make any statement, design, representation, picture or illustration that encourages or represents the use of marihuana for a condition other than a serious condition, (8) Make any statement, design, representation, picture or illustration that encourages or rep resents the recreational use of marijuana.

Packaging All marijuana products, extracts, mixtures & finished goods must be properly packaged and labeled . Packaging will be tamper proof, child -resistant and opaque so that the product cannot be seen from outside the packaging . All packaging must be airtight to protect contents from contamination without imparting any toxic or harmful substance to the medici ne inside. The Production Manager and Cultivation Manager will be responsible for the identification, storage, handling, sampling, examination, and testing of all packaging pursuant to written procedures. The processing stage, like harvest, is vulnerable t o contaminants. Following is a list of protocols that the company will put into place to assure a h igh quality packaging operation: (1 ) The processing and packaging room will be entirely enclosed to facilitate climate control, which is needed to maintain optimal packaging moisture levels (2 ) The room and its entire infrastructure will be easy to clean and sterilize. Stainless steel table s, floor drains and Mar -lite paneled walls will aid in the ease of cleaning and sterilization (3 ) Filtered , positi ve air pressure over work areas, (4) Clean -suits, masks, and gloves are ma ndatory in the processing phase, (5 ) Curing will feed directly into packaging to prevent overhanding of product and reduce exposure to contaminants, (6) Great care will be taken to ensure usable products and by -products are placed in clean and sterile, pharmaceutical containers that are childproof, (7) The product will be weighed and inserted into its respective pac kage, (8) Each package is barcoded and the barcode on the package is scanned to isolate the proper inventory package. Sealed package are weighed on integrated scales and the gross package weight is sent directly into BiotrackTHC enabling easy comparison to stored weights, (9 ) BiotrackTHC tracks and labels two weights for each package of marijuana. Net weight is the weight of the marijuana itself contained within the package. Gross weight is the final weight on tha t marijuana in its sealed package. This allows for easy reconciliation weights to be taken of any package at any time without the need to open the sealed package, ( 10) Once the product is packaged in the sealed childproof , pharmaceutical container and the shrink sleeve with accompanying tamper evident seal applied and adhered by the steam tunnel, it will be stored in the clean, cool, and dark section of the vault designated for finished products, ( 11) The distribution will record the current location and st atus of the packages, such as \"in - transit\" or \"received\". BiotrackTHC will also create a transport manifest, for the package distribution. The manifest will contain details such as time of departure, time of arrival, product and product weight, route to be travelled, origin and destination addresses, and vehicle and employee information. This document can be e -mailed, printed, or produced virtually, on a mobile device such as a tablet, from within BiotrackTHC and sent to the recipient part such as a dispen sary. Each distribution of packages will have a physical copy of the manifest with it at all times, (12 ) During the final verification done by a Pharmacist, the entire certification is verified ensuring all medications are packaged to ensure stability and usability by the time they reach the patient. Each medication order is dispensed and sent out of the pharmacy in a child proof bag in addition to the child proof container within. An emergency or interim supply of medication will be packaged and stored, in the same ptotocol listed above, for disaster or emergency situations . Labeling Policy Hawaii Medicinal Options facility uses a prescription printing and labeling barcode program capable of generating a label compliant with the Department of Health Regulations . BioTrackTHC' s system will automatically print the container -client specific label upon completion of the sale. (j) The registered organization shall identify each lot of approved medical marijuana product with a lot uniq ue identifier. BiotrackTHC automatically assigns a globally unique and non- repeatable 16 -digit barcode number to every plant. Furthermore, the system auto-generates a globally unique and non- repeatable 16 -digit barcode number at every s tage where dried marijuana must be separately identifiable from the original plant due to processing and packaging. These serial numbers, once generated are assigned, cannot be changed. In the event of a recall, BiotrackTHC contains a \"Plant/Inventory Hist ory Report\" that can track everything about the plants & Products from the time it was introduced to your facility, tracking every gram contained in the batch, including but not limited to all purchases containing matter from the plant or product, the cont act information for the purchaser, all vendor information and transport logs. (k) Each approved medical marijuana product shall be affixed with a product label. Each product label shall be applied at the manufacturing facility, be easily readable, firmly affixed and include: (1) the name, address and registration number of the registered organization, (2) the medical marijuana product form and brand designation, (3) the single dose THC and CBD content for the produ ct set forth in milligrams (mg), (4) the me dical marijuana product lot unique identifier (lot number or bar code), (5) the q uantity included in the package, (6) the da te packaged (7) the \"use by\" da te of expiration of the product, (8 ) the proper storage conditions, (9) language stating: (i) \"Medical marijuana products must be kept in the original container in which they were dispensed and removed from the original container only when ready for use by the certified patient\"; (ii) \"Keep secured at all times\"; (iii) \"May not be resold or transfe rred to another person\"; (iv) \"This product might impair the ability to drive\"; (v) \"KEEP THIS PRODUCT AWAY FROM CHILDREN (unless medical marijuana product is being given to the child under a practitioner's care\"); and (vi) \"This product is for medicinal use only. Women should not consume during pregnancy or while breastfeeding except on the advice of the certifying practitioner, and in the case of breastfeeding mothers, including the infant's pediatrician.\" vii . \"For medical use only\" (vii) In the case of a manufactured marijuana product, a listing of the equivalent physical weight of the marijuana used to manufacture the amount of the product that is within the packaging, pursuant to section 329D -9(c) (viii) Auxiliary labels may also be used to denote spec ial handling, storage, appearance, or administration of the medication to the patien t and (ix) Any other ingredi ents besides . Custody of Products BiotrackTHC has a biometric chain of custody module that logs every action in real time and the user who performed that action. BiotrackTHC h as the ability to integrate with scales to deter employee theft and human error. Every piece of data is captured with a time a nd date stamp by user, ensuring a clearly documented chain of custody at all times. Because every action is time stamped it can be cross -referenced with security cameras. All of these functions prevent diversion, abuse, and illegal or unauthorized conduct relating to medical marijuana. Any Marijuana removed from our facility will first be weighed, properly documented in our Seed- to- Sale control system, and all agents removing Marijuana from the facility recorded by our #11 Disposal be either securely stored or rendered unrecoverable at the moment it is generated or determ ined unusable as the result of laboratory testing. Temporary Secure Storage for Marijuana Waste The manufacturing facility will have a separate secure area for temporary storage of any medical marijuana or medical marijuana product that needs to be destroyed. The secure waste storage area will remain locked at all times and will be accessible to employees only with managerial approval. No marijuana waste will remain in the secure waste storage area for more than 24 hours before it is rendered non- recoverable. Rendering Marijuana Waste Unrecoverable The manufacturing facility will use the grinding method to render marijuana waste unrecoverable. This is the method most used by regulated medical marijuana facilities in other states. The grinding method effectively destroys the psychoactive as well as non -psychoactive molecules of marijuana and marijuana products, ensuring that marijuana waste is undesirable and does not create a nuisance for public safety officers. The grinding method uses an electric leaf mulcher machine to grind marijuana waste into mulch. The waste is then incorporated with other types of non-consumable solid waste so that the resulting mixture is at least fifty percent non - marijuana waste. The Hawaii Medicinal Options manufacturing facility will incorporate the following types of non-consumable solid waste: i. Paper waste (cardboard, office paper, newspaper, etc.) ii. Organic food waste iii. Non -psychoactive plant waste, including root balls and mature stems iv. Yard waste The machine used w ill be capable of grinding marijuana waste into fine mulch, with a motor capable of running for extended time periods when necessary. All regular employees and managerial staff will be instructed in the safe operation of this machine, including the use of safety goggles and gloves and performing regular safety checks with each use. Procedures Safety: All personnel will be required to wear PPE when performing this procedure. Personnel: Procedure will be performed by cultivation assistants. 1. Safety glasses and gloves will be donned at this point. 2. Identify marijuana waste that has been tagged for disposal by accessing the list of marijuana waste in the inventory control system. 3. Obtain managerial approval and/or oversight to access the temporary secure storage area for marijuana waste. 4. Transfer marijuana waste from temporary secure storage to the waste storage area where the electric mulcher and non -consumable waste products are located. 5. Remove marijuana waste from packaging, as necessary. Follow Hawaii Medicinal options procedures to tare the scale and weigh the marijuana waste products, and record the weight in the inventory control system. 6. Weigh out non-consumable waste in an amount equal to the weight recorded, plus an additional 5 percent. 7. After all weights have been entered into the wet weight log all branches and leaves and 7 - gallon pots filled with Coco Coir will be gathered and put into rolling bins. 8. Perform mulcher safety checks . 9. Follow manufacturer's directions to feed marijuana waste into the mulcher, taking care not to overload the machine. 10. Mix the mulched marijuana waste with the previously weighed non- consumable waste. 11. At this point, \"Bokashi\", a organic amending agent will be added to the waste pile and mixed in with shovel/gardening hoe. 12. After the mixing is complete, the \"Bokashi\" will be left to sit for seven (7) days being stored in sealed containers, in a secure location. 13. Dispose of the resulting non- recoverable marijuana waste in the designated container. This container shall be kept locked at all times, opened only to deposit and remove non- recoverable marijuana waste, and stored indoors at all times. 14. Note in electronic inventory control system that the marijuana waste products that have been rendered non- recoverable, the date and time that they were rendered non -recoverable, the employee who performed the procedure and the manager who approved or oversaw the procedure. Hawaii Medicinal Options will maintain and make available a separate record of each such disposal indicating: a. The date and time of disposal. b. The manner of disposal. c. The brand name and quantity of marijuana disposed of d. The signatures of the persons disposing of the marijuana and any other persons present during the dispos al. 15. Marijuana waste will be rendered non-recoverable a minimum of once daily, unless no marijuana waste has been generated or identified. Non-marijuana waste 1. Solid waste that is nonhazardous will be stored in bins or dumpsters for regul ar weekly. These would include: i. Growing medium from marijuana cultivation - soil, seedling plugs, etc. ii. Recyclable waste - plastics, metal, paper etc. iii. Food and bathroom waste from employee break room and restroom 2. Other non- recyclable, non -hazardous solid, using the services of the local waste management company. Solid waste will non -organic waste to be picked up a minimum of once weekly. An employee or manager will request the name and signature of the waste management employee responsible for trash pick-up. 3. Hazardous Waste Hazardous waste will be disposed of in compliance with all federal, state and local codes and statutes. When hazardous waste is generated in the manufacturing process, a manager will schedule a hazardous waste pick -up or drop- off with the local waste management company or landfill. The following items will be treated as hazardous waste: i. Chemical waste from the extraction process ii. Fluorescent light bulbs and other mercury-containing bulbs iii. Electronic waste 4. Electronic W aste may be donated or disposed of at an e- recycle event, as available. 5. Liquid Waste resulting from manufacturing processes will be disposed of in compliance with the requirements for discharge into surface water , groundwater and sewers. 6. Dispensary W aste- Hawaii Medicinal Options dispensaries will also use the most environmentally sound practices available so that minimal waste is generated. Any marijuana product that is identified as waste using the protocols listed in the Hawaii Medicinal Options operating manual, including marijuana products returned to the dispensary by a patient, will be returned to the Hawaii Medicinal Options manufacturing facility and disposed of in accordance with the protocols described herein. If an approved medical marijuana product is returned to a Hawaii Medicinal Options dispensing facility, the dispensing facility will return the product to the manufacturing facility and it will be destroyed in accordance with the approved operati ng plan that is described above. 7. Marijuana Extract Oil Waste - In order to prevent any excess, undesired, recalled, obsolete, adulterated, misbranded or deteriorated marijuana extract product from making its way to non-patients or illicit markets, Hawaii Medicinal Options will use an on -site via a Micro Auto Gasification unit to render non- recoverable any large quantity of marijuana extract oil or a large quantity of approved medical marijuana products that must be destroyed. Because this type of waste is incredibly potent, Hawaii Medicinal Options will take the additional precaution of treating it as medical waste. The Micro Auto Gasification unit does not emit an odor of marijuana as a result of the gasification process. Any disposal of marijuana or products from a batch must also be documented, including the reason for the disposal, the number and weight of unusable plants, the date of the disposal, confirmation that the marijuana was rendered unusable before the disposal, the method of disposal, and the name and agent number of the agent responsible for the disposal. If at any time the amount of marijuana on hand is increased or reduced in a way that is not documented in the BiotrackTHCTM inventory control system, our personnel must alert and advise their supervisor, and team steps will determine the source of the discrepancy. After identifying the source, corrective measures will be taken to ensure that there will be no further variance from expected amounts. Any loss of product will be r eported to regulatory authorities, and if criminal activity is suspected, it will be reported to MPD. Hawaii Medicinal Options is committed in keeping with regulations for product safety, types, advertising and packaging. a mounts of THC and CBD. Hawaii Medicinal Options will achieve brand consistency in four ways - 1. Medical marijuana will be produced from genetically -identified single clone sources. This overcomes a common problem in medical marijuana production, that of genetic variability within a cultivar (strain). 2. Hawaii Medicinal Options has designed production facilities for consistent, uniform growing conditions. By providing consistent environmental conditions (light, temperature, air, nutrition, moisture, etc.) production will be consistent crop to crop. Hawaii Medicinal Options will maintain a strain (cultivar) library with d iffering cannabinoid profiles and will maintain safety stock of produced medical marijuana in a dry form. Medical marijuana can be stored in a dried form for over a year with no detectable change in analysis if stored in the dark with reduced oxygen exposure. By blending extracts from different cultivars (strains) a consistent product profile can be achieved. 4. Hawaii Medicinal Options will use a state -of-the- art supercritical fluid chromatograph to isolate individual cannabinoids to be added to blends as Successful crop production in a controlled environment requires attention to sanitation in order to prevent establishment of pests and diseases. The following are measures taken to maintain excellent sanitatio n at both sites: Air inlets will be screened to prevent introduction of insects or mites Entries will have double doors to provide an airlock Floors will be concrete to allow for routine cleaning and disinfecting All foot traffic and equipment ente ring the greenhouse will pass through footbaths containing a quaternary ammonium disinfectant registered for greenhouse use by the US EPA Use of tobacco products will be prohibited on- site to minimize risk of spread of tobamoviruses, especially Sunn- hemp mosaic virus (SHMV) All personnel will change into fresh uniforms daily prior to entering the greenhouse All greenhouse personnel will use disposable gloves when handling plants and will change to fresh gloves when working with a different batch of pl ants Any new cultivars ('strains') to be introduced to production will be quarantined, monitored for insects and tested for known diseases before introduction into production. Horizontal air flow fans (HAF) will be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner between crops to minimize risk of circulating dust. Benches will be brushed free of plant debris after every crop and sanitized with an EPA -approved greenhouse sanitation product before the next crop. Tools are to be sanitized daily with an EPA -approved greenhouse sanitation product. Any equipment showing signs of wear (cracks, splinters, etc.) will be immediately repaired or discarded. Labeling and Packaging The dispensing facilit y will affix to the approved medical marijuana product package a patient specific dispensing label approved by the department, that is easily readable, and firmly affixed and includes: (1) the name and registry identification number of the certified patien t and designated caregiver, if any. (2) the certifying practitioner's name. (3) the dispensing facility name, address and phone number . (4) the dosing and administration instructions. (5) the quantity and date dispense d. (6) any recommendation or limitation by the practi tioner as to the use of medical marijuana . The dispensing facility will place the approved medical marijuana product in a plain outer package when dispensing to the patient or designated caregiver. The dispensing facility will ensure that each patient receives approved medical marijuana product from no more than two distinct lots for any 30 -day supply dispensed. The dispensing facility will include with each product package dispensed to a patient, a department approved package safety insert . Information provided will include. (1) the medi cal marijuana product and brand. (2) a list of any excipients used. (3) a warning if there is any potential for allergens in the medical marijuana product. (4) contraindications .
