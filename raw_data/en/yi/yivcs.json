While patients whose primary goal is not immune support still get this benefit, regular acupuncture with the goal of maintaining a healthy immune system is a great way to support your wellbeing and vitality. There are a number of reasons why you may be interested in boosting your immune system. At Gotham Holistic, we custom tailor each acupuncture treatment to the individual patient to focus on your health goals. We often think of the immune system as something that kicks into action when we catch a cold or other infection. While it's true that the primary goal of the immune system is to protect you from foreign invaders (whether that be a virus, harmful bacteria, or parasite), the immune system is always at work. The health of your immune system not only determines your ability to fight off invaders, but also how well you feel from day to day. Autoimmune disorders are diseases in which your immune system perceives healthy and normal tissues as foreign invaders. Depending on the particular autoimmune disease this can result in a range of symptoms including pain, dysfunction, inflammation, and fatigue. Additionally, people with autoimmune disorders may be at higher risk for contracting infections and less able to fight them off. Acupuncture has been shown to regulate and improve immune function.1,2,3 Whether or not you have an autoimmune disease, acupuncture and Chinese medicine can help to regulate your immune system and improve its ability to fight off infections. If you do have an autoimmune disease, treatment also helps to address associated imbalances and symptoms. You may be interested in boosting your immune system for a number of reasons including: Maintaining optimal health and vitality Regulate or reduce inflammation and pain Easing symptoms and correcting underlying imbalances associated with an autoimmune disorder Strengthen your immune system's ability to fight off common colds, coughs and flus, and potentially COVID-19 At Gotham Holistic, we offer non-invasive, drug free acupuncture treatments in NYC to improve your health and boost your immune system.
