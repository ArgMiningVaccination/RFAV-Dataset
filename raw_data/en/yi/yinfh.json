In1969 Willmont received his bachelor's degree in Creative Writing and Philoso-phy from Bowling Green State Universityin Ohio. During this period, he took aphilosophy course in ComparativeReligion and was exposed to ancientChinese Daoism and its primary text, theDaodejing. He intuitively understoodthat this text explained something aboutlife and the world so comprehensive thatnothing else he had read to date couldcompare. In particular, it seemed toconvey a spiritual perspective that couldbe practiced in everyday life where the mundane world could be integratedwith higher spiritual principles. Theseteachings became the seed potentialthat motivated Willmont's future lifedirection. Willmont currently maintains a practice in acupuncture, Chinese herbs,whole foods dietary practice, andessential oils in Marshfield, Massachu- setts. He is a Certified Instructor for the American Association for Bodywork Therapy of Asia (AOBTA).

What a special moment this is! For that one moment everything is so delicately balanced, as though our Earth is a great Dancing Spindle, to borrow an image from one of my favorite fantasy writers, Robin Hobb. Her Spindle is rmly rooted in the ground and suspended from the heavens, by Magic. e flow of qi is rather like magic, too. It flows around us and through us and supports us as we move. How like magic that is, especially on a day like the Summer Solstice, when the energies are as extreme as they can be without pulling apart . . . and then the shift occurs, and our Earthly Spindle begins to lean in a slightly dierent direction, never losing the momentum of its spin; and the cycle continues, toward the Winter Solstice and toward another delicate, though opposite, balance when the energy shifts again. We have an unusual balance of articles in our Fire issue. We open with an article by Dennis Willmont on the H\u00f9n, the Spirit of the Liver. Willmont speaks of the Liver as the \"end of Yin within Yin and beginning of Yang, \" rather the opposite of the Summer Solstice but denitely a part of the balancing act of shifting energies. Willmont's article is a pre-publication chapter of his book entitled, d_he Five Phases of Acupuncture in the Classical Texts. In this article he takes us through a fascinating discussion of the derivation and the meanings of the word H\u00f9n. e second article is a discussion by Eric Brand of the necessity for authentication of Chinese herbs. Brand neatly summarizes for us what kinds of errors can occur in the identication of herbs; and he provides examples of herbs that are commonly misidentied, along with the consequences of misidentication. Our third article is a case study of Clostridium dicile infection by Joan Rothchild Hardin. C. dicile creates Heat Toxins in the bowel, so it seems a tting article for the Fire issue. What is unusual about this article is that Hardin is a psychotherapist, and she successfully treated herself for this sometimes fatal condition, without antibiotics. Hardin reviews for us the epidemiology and symptoms of C. di. infection and tells us how she put together a health care team to combat it. Her health care team did notinclude an OM practitioner, and she did not use Chinese herbs; but the process she used is one that an OM practitioner can adapt to our methods, and we all should know when to suspect C. di. infection in our patients. We end with a book review by former OMJ Editor Frank Yurasek of the Pocket Atlas of Tongue Diagnosis, 2nd edition, by Claus C. Schnorrenberger and Beate Schnorrenberger. Yurasek clearly nds it an interesting and useful book. We hope you enjoy your Summer. Mary J. Rogel, PhD, LAcTT24|oriental medicine journal By Joan Rothchild Hardin, PhD Abstract in recent years Clostridium dicile bacterial infections of the colon have become a public health crisis. CDis (Clostridium dicile infections) are now more frequent, more severe, more dicult totreat, and more often fatal. infections typically occur after use ofbroad-spectrum antibiotics, which eradicate good gut flora alongwith the targeted bad bacteria. ironically, the treatments of choicefor Clostridium dicile are more antibiotics. Because antibiotics do not kill the spores this bacteria forms in the gut, the recurrencerate after treatment with antibiotics is around one in four; andwhen the infection recurs, it is often more severe. d_he author describessuccessfully using supplements and diet to eradicate her ownClostridium dicile infection. fire/summer 2011 |25 (continued on dicile (klos-TRID-e-uhm dif-uh-SEEL), often called C. dicile or C. di, is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that can cause symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon. Illness from C. dicile typically occurs after use of broad-spectrum antibiotic medications, which eradicate good digestive bacteria along with their targeted bad bacteria. is eradication of the good digestive bacteria allowsC. dicile bacteria to overrun the gut with a vengeance. In recent years, Clostridium dicile infections have become more frequent, more severe, and more dicult to treat. Each year, tens of thousands of people in the United States get sick from C. dicile, including some otherwise healthypeople who are neither hospitalized nor taking antibiotics. (Mayo Clinic Sta, 2011) C. dicile bacteria can be found throughout the environment. ey live in thesoil, air, water, and human and animal feces.Some healthy people carry the spores intheir large intestines asymptomatically.C. di infections are most common in hospitals and other health care facilities,where a much higher percentage of peoplehave compromised immune systems andeasily host the bacteria. C. dicile bacteria are passed in feces and spread to food, surfaces, and objectswhen people who are infected fail to washtheir hands thoroughly. e popular alcohol-based\"hand sanitizers, \" so frequently used even in hospitals inlieu of adequate hand washing, are ineective againstspore-forming bacteria and do not kill C. di. e bacteria produce hardy spores that can persist on surfacesfor weeks or months. People who have touched a surfacecontaminated with C. dicile may then unknowingly ingest the bacteria spores.About Clostridium difficile Figure 1:Clostridium dicile organism (National Institutes of Health)26|oriental medicine journal People with healthy gut immunity do not usually get sick from C. dicile. Our intestines contain millions ofbacteria, many of which help protectthe body from infection. When broadspectrum antibiotics destroy most ofthe helpful gut flora, the sparse healthybacteria remaining in the gut are thenno match for the hardy C. dicile,which can quickly grow out of control. e chief risk factor for the disease is prior exposure to antibiotics. emost common antibiotics implicatedin C. dicile colitis are cephalosporins (especially second and third genera-tion), ampicillin/amoxicillin, Less commonly antibiotics are the macrolides(i.e., clarithromycin,azithromycin) and other trimethoprim-sul-famethoxazole, metronidazole,chloramphenicol, and any single antibiotic cancause C. dicile colitis. A prolonged antibiotic course or the use of morethan one antibiotic increases the riskof disease. Even antibiotics traditionallyused to treat C. dicile colitis have been shown to cause disease. (Abera,F.N. 2011) Once established in the gut, C. dicile produces toxins that attack the lining of the large intestine. Toxin Ais an enterotoxin that causes fluid secre-tion, mucosal damage, and internalinflammation. Toxin B is a more potentcytotoxin but is not enterotoxic. ToxinB causes mucosal damage consisting ofplaque-like lesions that to theformation of a pseudomembrane andpseudo-membranous colitis; severecases may be all strains ofC. dicile produce both toxins. (RapidMicrobiology.com) With our widespread overuse of antibiotics, an even more aggressivestrain of C. dicile has emerged that produces far more toxins and has ahigher mortality rate. e new strain ismore resistant to pharmaceuticals and has shown up in people who have notbeen hospitalized or taken antibiotics,including apparently healthy people in the community and peripartum women. is strain of C. dicile has caused several outbreaks of severe and fatal illness since 2000. e new epidemicstrain was identied in 2004. (Mayo Clinic Sta, 2011) It produces greaterquantities of toxins A and B, making itmuch more virulent. It is also moreresistant to the antibiotic group knownas fluoroquinolones. (Centers forDisease Control & Prevention website, 2010) Figure 2: Large Intestine colonized by Clostridium dicile bacteria Clostridium dicile infection rates doubled between 1996 and 2003. With the incidence and severity of C. di infection rising throughout the United States in the last 10-20 years, determining the actual prevalence of the disease has become a priority for public health ocialsand researchers. People are most often infected in hospitals, nursing homes, or other long-term care institutions, but C. di infections in the community are also increasing. Mostrecent estimates include: 3,000,000 Americans become infected during a stay in a health carefacility each year. 20,000 Americans become infected in community settings each year.fire/summer 2011 |27 (continued on the next page)Some people who have C. dicile living in their guts never become sick, though they can still spread the infection. C. di illness usually develops during or shortly after a course of antibiotics, but symptoms may not appear for weeks or months afterward. e most common symptoms of mild to moderate C. dicile infection are: Watery diarrhea three or more times a day for two or more days. Mild abdominal cramping and tenderness. In severe cases, C. di causes the colon to become inflamed (colitis) or to form patches of raw tissue that can bleed or produce pus (pseudomembranous colitis).Signs and symptoms of severe infection include: Watery diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day Abdominal cramping and pain, which may be severe Fever Blood or pus in the stool Nausea Dehydration Loss of appetite Weight loss (Mayo Clinic Sta, 2011)Symptoms of Clostridium difficile Infection Figure 3: Clostridium dicile bacteria growing inside a colon. Prevalence28|oriental medicine journal According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 30,000 people die every year fromC. di infections: 9,000 from a hospital acquired onset; 3,000 from hospitalacquired, post-discharge onset; and 16,500 from nursing home-acquireddisease. e rate of C. dicile acquisition is estimated to be 13% in patients withhospital stays of up to 2 weeks, and50% in those with hospital stays longerthan 4 weeks. Of those infected inhospitals, 25,000 - 75,000 (1% to2.5% of all cases) will die and 250,000to 300,000 (10% of all cases) will suerfrom severe or complicated disease,including pseudomembranous colitis(infection of the colon with an over- growth of C. di bacteria), sepsis, shock, and toxic megacolon. (Jarvis,Schlosser, Jarvis, & Chinn, 2009;Khanna & Pardi, 2010) In the US, recurrent C. dicile infections are estimated to cost nearly$10 billion in excess hospital expenseseach year. (vedantam & Tillotson, 2011)Pharmaceutical Treatment of Clostridium difficile e usual medical treatment for C. dicile includes stopping antibiotics given for other purposes and, ironically, treatment with more antibiotics: metronidazole (Flagyl) for mild symptoms or vancomycin (vancocin) for more severe infections. (Mayo Clinic, 2010) While a proper regime of these antibiotics usually eliminates the infection, the bacteria can re-emerge from residual spores in the gut - usually with a vengeance - weeks or months later. (vadantam & Tillotson, 2011) About 25% of C. dicile infections treated with metronidazole or vancomycin recur. (Mayo Clinic Sta, 2011) A newer antibiotic, daxomicin, a macrocyclic RNA polymerase inhibitor, has a narrow spectrum of activity which is almost C. dicile specic. is drug appears to have a higher clinical cure rate than vancomycin, and fewer patients relapse fol- lowing initial treatment. From the results of a recent Phase III trial, daxomicin has been deemed \"extremely promising\" for treating C. dicile infection and preventing relapses. (Poxton, 2010) In clinical trials, the recurrence of infection in patients treated with daxomicin vs vancomycin was about 15% vs 25%. (Poxton, 2010) Other antimicrobial treatments under development include ramoplanin, an antibiotic that blocks bacterial cell wall synthesis, and CB-183,315, which disrupts the bacterial cell membrane function. For persistent cases of C. dicile infection, an unusual approach called fecal bacteriotherapy, or fecal transplant, has provedsuccessful. A saline-diluted solution of fecal matter from a healthy donor is createdand introduced into a CDI (C. dicile infection) patient's GI tract using a catheter or enema. Once inside the patient's gut, it reestablishes a normal healthy gut flora. Researchers are also working on various types of vaccines to arm the immune system to ght CDI at various stages of the infection. (vedantam & Tillotson, 2011) My Personal Story: How I Vanquished Clostridium difficile Holistically Repeated Use of Antibiotics In 1984 I was found to have mitral valve prolapse (MvP). At that time, and for many years afterwards, the American Dental Association (ADA), on the advice of theAmerican Heart Association (AHA), required people with MvP to take mega doses fire/summer 2011 |29 (continued on the next page)of antibiotics prophylactically before and shortly after any dental visit to reduce the possibility of developing infective endocarditis (IE) from increased oral bacteria released into the blood stream during dental cleanings and procedures. Eventually the AHA and ADA reversed their recommendation, deciding that (A) the risks of adverse reactions to antibiotics outweigh the benets of prophylaxis for mostpeople, (B) it was unclear that pre-medication actually prevented IE, (C) bacteria from the mouth can enter the bloodstream during daily activities like tooth brushingand flossing, and (D) bacteria causing infections can become resistant to antibiotics if those drugs are used too often. (American Dental Association, 2011) But for me, this policy reversal came too late. ose mega doses of antibiotics, along with doses other doctors had prescribed for this and that over the years, had already done damage to the flora in my gut; and I myself had not yet wised up to the dangers of antibiotics and gone searching for non-pharmaceutical treatments for what ailed me. My Battle with Clostridium dicile Too frequent use of antibiotics over many years, low gut immunity, and low adrenal functioning came together to create a perfect welcoming situation for C. dicile to overpopulate in my gut. Here is my story of how I vanquished a prolonged and quite nasty infection of C. dicile, less virulent than the newer strain and not fatal, but still an experience that caused me much distress: I began having increasingly intense and frequent diarrhea in the spring of 2010 while on vacation. e diarrhea worsened after I got home and I often felt weak, so I consulted my principal health care professional, Denice Hilty, DC, of Transforma-tional Healthcare in New York City. She provided me with a GI Panel test kit, and we sent stool and saliva samples to a trustworthy lab for astool enzyme immunoassay culture specic toC. dicile's A & B toxins along with tests for gut parasites, other bacterial infections, andSIgA (gut immunity as measured by saliva).Results revealed a C. dicile infection (A and B toxins) along with moderate amounts of otherbacterial infections and a parasite I most likelypicked up on a cruise the year before. My gutimmunity was also quite low, making me moresusceptible to infection. Since it was years of antibiotics that had diminished the healthy flora in my gut, allowingC. dicile to take hold, it made little sense to either Dr Hilty or me to use more antibiotics to try to get rid of the infection. Also, I hadlearned that C. di infections treated with antibiotics have a high chance of recurring: about one in four. (Mayo Clinic Sta, 2011) Figure 4: Spores formed by Clostridium dicile that protect it from being killed o.Instead, She Prebiotics: Digestive (Enzyme Research Products) Dose: 3 3X/day before meals Large doses of probiotics to repopulate the good bacteria in my gut: Repleniss, a synbiotic providing 7 nitrogen packed doses each containing 50 billion microorgan-isms, (Interplexus) Dose: 1/day for 14 days HyperImplante, a 7 strain mega-synbiotic with 2 nitrogen packed doses, each providing 400 billionmicroorganisms, (Interplexus) Dose: 1 packet/day for 2 days30|oriental medicine journal BroccoMax (Jarrow Formulas) - a supplement made from broccoliseeds, which kills C. dicile Dose: 2 capsules 2X/day Quantum Allicidin Complex (Premier Research Labs), a supple-ment made from a wild garlicextract, which breaks open thebiolms, mucopolysaccharide sacsC. dicile forms to protect against being killed o Dose: 2 capsules 3X/day Increased to 3 capsules 3X/day after three months During the time C. di ruled my gut, I noticed that even small amountsof gluten, dairy, any processed food,rened sugar, and high fructose cornsyrup always set o bad bouts ofdiarrhea, so I went on a bland, modiednon-inflammatory diet, avoiding thosefoods. Odwalla and Naked juices dilutedwith water, plain live-culture yogurt,poached salmon or white meat chicken,and fresh soups worked well. While my gut had denitely not reached complete balance after aboutthree months, it had normalizedsome - and I began to have hope. I then consulted with David Miller, MD, on-site nutritionist at LifethymeNatural Market in New York City. Hepointed out that Harrison's internal Medicine recommends the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii as a treatment for C. dicile and suggested adding: Saccharomyces boulardii + MOS (Jarrow Formulas) Dose: 2 capsules 3X/day Note: If you have yeast allergies, ask your doctor if you can take Saccha-romyces boulardii. Because Saccha-romyces boulardii is a live yeast, you must not drink alcohol for it to be eective. Alcohol will kill theyeast. It is important to drink a lot of non-alcoholic liquids when youtake this product. (PWA Health Group, 1996) Sauerkraut, organic if you can get it! A few tablespoons or more 3-4 times a day (D.I.F. Miller, MD, personal communication, 2011) Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic yeast that survives stomachacid and colonizes the intestinal tract. Ithelps protect the benecial microbiotaand enhances immune function of theintestinal tract. (Jarrow.com, 2011) MOS (MannanOligoSaccharide) is an oligosaccharide from the cell walls ofS. cerevisiae that can discourage bacte- ria from adhering to the epithelial cellsand reduce their proliferation.(Jarrow.com, 2011) Why Fermented Foods Are Good for Our Guts Fresh, homemade, lacto-fermented sauerkraut, or the kind that comes in ajar in the refrigerated section at WholeFoods and elsewhere, is very good for treating diarrhea. My favorite isBubbies. It is not organic, but I like thetaste of it quite a lot and found I couldeat it many times a day, a few forkfulsright out of the jar or as an accompani- ment to poached salmon or white meat chicken at meals. Live, lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and usually the safest way ofpreserving food. Before we had refriger-ation, canning, and chemical preserva-tives, humans in every culturepreserved kimchi, dry sausages, pickles, cheeses, yogurt, ker, bread, beers, and wines, among others. We stopped eating those digestion- enhancing foods so much when westarted relying on foods kept \"fresh\" byrefrigeration and other articial means.What we gave up in turning away from fermented foods was ingesting enoughfire/summer 2011 |31 (continued on the next page)of the friendly bacteria our bodies need to maintain good health, the prebioticsand probiotics created by naturalfermentation. e fermentation process develops vast amounts of lactic acid bacteria,the friendly bacteria our guts need tomaintain good health. e numbers of dierent lactic acid bacteria in livesauerkraut can reach concentrations of 10 (to the 8 th) to 10 (to the 9th) per gram. (Probiotics-lovethatbug.com; ZdenkaSamish, Etinger-Tulczynska, & Bick,1963)Successful Outcome Six months after starting on these supplements, limiting my diet, and eating sauerkraut, my gut felt well. Two months later, repeat testing conrmedthat C. dicile no longer ruled. Final Repairing of the Damages from the C. Difficile InfectionSince the infection cleared seven months ago, to make sure it does not return I have continued (and will continue) to take: e prebiotic Digestive (Enzyme Research Products) Dose: Saccharomyces boulardii + MOS (Jarrow Formulas) Dose: 2 capsules each morning Quantum Allicidin Complex (Premier Research Labs brand)Dose: 2 capsules 3X/day ere are additional benets to taking the botanical supplement Allicidin on an ongoing basis. It provides broad spectrum immune support, especially for the mouth, ovaries, uterus, prostate, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts as well as heart and artery support. I also sought the advice of a nutritionist, Carol Hornig, MS, CNS, to assist in my healing from C. dicile. She is the former Chief Nutritionist at Strang Cancer Prevention Center and now works in a private practice called Deep Nourishment: Emotional, Nutritional, and Spiritual Healing, located in West Hurley, NY. We have appointments by phone. Carol has discovered, by urine testing, that the integrity of my intestinal tract was compromised by the C. dicile infection, creating a moderate amount of bowel toxicity. I have excess leukocytes in my urine, and I am carbohydrate intolerant.Carol is consulting with Dr Hilty, and the three of us are working together in anongoing process of guring out how to address these issues. I am now on analkalinizing/carbohydrate intolerance diet and also taking these additionalsupplements: Total Probiotics (Nutri-West) Dose: 2 each morning Formula 14, for the carbohydrate intolerance (Enzyme Solutions)Dose: 2 3X/day, just prior to meals32|oriental medicine journal Importance of Retesting for Clostridium difficileSince C. dicile overruns are known to recur, the importance of doing a repeat stool sample retest after you think your C. dicile infection is gone cannot be overstressed. Your health care provider should provide you with another GI Panel test kit to be sent to a trustworthy lab for a repeat stool and saliva enzyme immunoassay culture specic to C. dicile's A & B toxins to insure the infection has been eradicated. Food for Thought: What We Lost When We Gained Refrigeration, Canning, and PreservativesIf you have access to the November 22, 2010, new Yorker, be sure to read \"Nature'sSpoils: e underground food movement ferments revolution. \" is fascinating article makes it quite clear how we have come to have overruns of C. dicile in epidemic proportions - without ever actually mentioning C. dicile. e article is about Sandor Katz, a self-avowed \"fermentation fetishist, \" who argues that Americans are killing themselves with cleanliness. Katz gives lectures and demonstrations around the country to spread his gospel of sauerkraut, real dill pickles, and all foods transformed and ennobled by bacterial lacto-fermentation. (Bilger, 2010) While I am not about to harvest wild acorns or dumpster dive, as Katz advocates, my struggle with Clostridium dicile awakened me to the importance of including lacto-fermented foods in my diet. So I now drink kombucha tea (some brandseven contain Saccharomyces boulardii), make a point of eating real dill pickles,live-culture yogurts, miso soup, and forkfuls of sauerkraut at least a few times aweek - and take to heart arguments for eating fermented foods. (Cheeseslave.com,2009) ConclusionsI refer to C. dicile as the \"cockroach of gut bacteria. \" Like cockroaches, they have evolved to resist destruction. In the case of C. dicile, the bacteria form spores thatburrow into the lining of the colon where they wait until an eective antibiotic isout of the system. When the coast is clear, the spores burst open, and the bacteriare-enter the large intestine and take over again. Since it was essentially long term overuse of antibiotics that caused C. dicile to nd a welcoming environment in my gut, I had no desire to take more antibiotics toattempt to vanquish it. e combination of supplements, described above, that my alternative health care providers recommended worked well. e most recent GI Panel retest, done in fire/summer 2011 |33 (continued on the next page)May 2011, 13 months after I rst be- came ill, was negative for Clostridiumdicile. Traces of Candida and moderate amounts of other bacteriawere found. Even though my SIgA isnow high, most likely indicating ahyperimmune and/or an autoimmuneresponse to something, Dr Hilty thinksmy gut immunity is ghting o someinfection but probably is disorganizedoverall and not optimal due to thelong-term stress it has been under. So there is still work to do to get me back in balance. As Dr. Hilty says, \"We are constantly exposed to 'bugs. ' A strong, healthy, balanced body and immune system is the best prevention for any infectionor disease. \" (D. Hilty, DC, personal communication, 2011) She is working with me to balance my gut immunityand heal my adrenal and otherhormonal imbalances with the long term goal of supporting a robustimmune system so I can ght o any further exposures to Clostridiumdicile and prevent other diseases from making a home in my body. What I Hope You Will Take Away From This Article Contact with Clostridium dicile is almost impossible to avoid. It has been turned into a very serious bug by our over- and mis-use of antibiotics and our modern processed/preserved diets. Its spread can be limited by using good sanitary habits like old-fashioned hand washing with soap.Alcohol-based hand sanitizers and most common disinfectants do not kill Clostridium dicile. Judging by my experience, an infection can apparently be cured without resorting to antibiotics. Maintaining an alkalinizing diet, eating naturally lacto-fermented foods, and creating a strong immune system will make your body an inhospitable place for Clostridium dicile. The Peggy Lillis Memorial Foundation e Peggy Lillis Memorial Foundation was founded by Peggy Lillis's two adult sons who, in honor of their mother's needlessdeath from Clostridium dicile, vowed to raise awareness of thegrowing C. dicile epidemic and advocate for solutions and prevention within healthcare and public health systems. It is anexcellent source of information on Clostridium dicile and can be found at http://www.peggyfoundation.org/. Peggy Lillis's colon became overrun with a virulent C. dicile infection after she took a routine course of broad-spectrum antibioticsfor a dental infection. She was sick for only six days before she died. Figure 5: Washing hands with soap and water kills Clostridium dicile. Alcohol based handsanitizers and most disinfectants do not.34|oriental medicine journal Treatment SummaryTesting If a patient of yours is experiencing serious diarrhea, it is important to test for Clostridium dicile, which can become debilitating, is highly contagious, and possibly fatal. Provide the patient with a GI Panel test kit from a trustworthy lab, and send the stool and saliva samples for a stool enzyme immunoassay culture specic to C. dicile's A & B toxins. It would be a good idea also to test for other bacterial infections, intestinal parasites, and fungal infections in the gut, as well as for gut immunity in the same panel.

C. dicile is highly contagious and also famous for recurring after treatment with antibiotics; so, even though you are not treating with these drugs, you and your patient will want to be sure the C. dicile Toxins A & B stool test is now negative. Please Note: I am neither a physician nor a physical health care provider. Any description of howI treated my own Clostridium dicile infection is just that, a description. e approach I took, on the advice of two trusted holistic health care professionals, was successful, and my gut is now free of C. dicile. I oer this information to you in the hope you will consider helping other people suering with this debilitating, potentially fatal, intestinal infection to regain theirhealth without exposing them to massive doses of antibiotics. e widespread use of antibiotics is generally agreed to be a major reason C. dicile infections have reached epidemic proportions, and there is evidence that C. dicile is developing strains resistant to these antibiotics. Furthermore, while a regimen of the recommended antibiotics will usually eliminate a C. dicile infection, the infection frequently returns with a vengeance weeks or months later because antibiotics cannot penetrate the spores to kill the C. dicile bacteria protected inside. When it comes to my own body and the health of my loved ones, my creed is 'First, do no harm. ' My view, formed from personal experiences and many experiences of family members and pets with the iatrogenic properties ofpharmaceuticals, is that alternative treatments and remedies should be tried rstsince they are generally gentle. en, if they do not work, pharmaceuticals might be considered.
