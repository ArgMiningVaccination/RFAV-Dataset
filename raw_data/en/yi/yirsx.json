(Aromatherapy Vlog Series) Aromatherapy refers to the use of essential oils that have been extracted from plants, shrubs, and trees. These oils can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including the treatment of medical conditions and for alleviating psychological ailments, such as anxiety. Aromatherapy can also be used purely for the enjoyment of the aroma, or to help improve your mood or reduce your stress. The essential oils of aromatherapy have the power to affect both your physical and mental state. Aromatherapy is sometimes thought of as a New Age fad, but the practice of aromatherapy has a long and rich history. The often-negative use of the New Age label causes an unfortunate prejudice against a practice that has many potential benefits, causing some people to shy away from aromatherapy altogether. The effective use of aromatherapy requires considerable knowledge and expertise. Essential oils can be applied in a wide variety of situations and have been proven effective in treating both serious and minor ailments. Even when aromatherapy cannot provide a cure, it can often improve an individual's mood. We often practice aromatherapy on an everyday basis without realizing it. When we choose aromas, bath oils, and air fresheners, we usually choose a scent based on what we like, or on how that fragrance makes us feel. The refreshing scent of a pine forest, the pleasurable aromas of herbs, the sweet citrusy fragrance of a lemon, or the many other daily experiences we have with the scents of plant-derived substances indicate that we are actually practicing and experiencing aromatherapy in many ways, without us even knowing it. The practice of aromatherapy for treating ailments actually predates chemical-based medicine. Essential oils have been used for hundreds of years in herbal medicine, disease prevention, and in religious and public ceremonies. The proven benefits of plant-based therapies are being overlooked in favor of artificial substitutes. It's easy to forget that many commonly used pharmaceuticals were originally derived from plants. With our superior advances in medical technology, many people have come to doubt that something from nature applied externally could possibly have an internal effect. But the answer to many of today's diseases has been with us from the beginning, stored in the plant life all around us. Aromatherapy unlocks the power of essential oils and allows us the ability to receive its many positive benefits, provided to us by nature.
