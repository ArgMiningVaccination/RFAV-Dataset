Yesterday evening he was playing with my daughter who is 9 years old and he accidentally bit her. Will anti-rabies vaccination be required? The site appears to have welted but there's no blood. 2 Answers [Christopher James Varvis](/Expert/8125726-Christopher-James-Varvis)Internist Edmonton, Alberta NO ! [Dr. Kaveh Sharif](/Expert/8137204-Kaveh-Sharif)Internist Los Angeles, California I doubt rabies, so I do not think she needs vaccination, but there is risk of infection at the site of the wound. She might need to be started on antibiotic. She needs to see a doctor "}
