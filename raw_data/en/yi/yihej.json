Notes With any detox bath, you may feel relaxed or tired when you get out. Because of this, we recommend children only take detox baths when a parent or guardian is in the house, and close by, in the event they are feeling tired and need help. It is generally not safe to use essential oils around babies, especially newborns under 3 months. Eucalyptus Radiata is deemed much safer for children than Eucalyptus Globulus, especially under the age of 10. Please check with a certified herbalist, aromatherapist or doctor before use. Stay hydrated. Salt baths can be dehydrating, so consider drinking a full glass of water before and after your bath. Note: Our personal experience cannot replace medical advice. Please check with your doctor before making any changes to your routine. And, as with any health change, start slowly. - Prep Time: 2 min - Category: Bath & Beauty, Do It Yourself, Gift Ideas, Natural Body Care, Natural Remedies, Health & Wellness, Lifestyle, "}
