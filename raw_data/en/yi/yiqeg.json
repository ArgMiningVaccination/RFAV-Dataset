COPPIN A HE WEST INDIES will send a team to tour 3 | Australia in 1951-52, provided they can select f a team entirely representative of the cricket strength of the West Indies. Mb ietacn This has been the decision of the West Indies V4, Cricket Board of Control at their meeting in ' Trinidad last week. This has been perhaps the ~ most important decision of the West Indies Cricket Board in their comparatively short history. With this decision I agree and in doing so I find myself in the unusual position of having to support a Board that I have consist- ently criticised, constructively or sentimentally for the past decade. A LOGICAL ARGUMENT { THINK that my argument against the chances of an Australian team visiting the West Indies at present was a logical, even if not a popular one with the less responsible cricket fans and so there is no justifiable reason why I should repeat those arguments now in support of the action of the Board. It is sufficient for me to say that those who have considered the possibility of the visit of an Australian team to the West Indies and its attendant financial im- plications will naturally commend the Board for the step that they have taken in this connection. WEST INDIES BOARD'S ACTIONS UNPOPULAR ITH regard to the other aspects of the meeting of the West Indies Cricket Board of Control, I must say with a sad heart that they have failed to take this golden opportunity to cement the ties that bind the various elements of West Indies cricket together and above all they have also missed their best opportunity to estab- | lish a measure of confidence on the part of the member colonies in the Board itself and build up = ponularity that should naturally follow in the wake of the first successful W.I. tour to England. HACKETT 11.40 p.m. tumours have undermined their popularity in the past and the present is no exception. If they could see the wisdom of taking the public into their confidence, publicising the decisions they have made in the name of West Indies cricket and following the practice adepted by any normal public body in inviting the press to their meetings, then they will have gone a long way towards building up some degree of respect for the Board and a corresponding amount of confidence in West Indies cricket circles, in their decisions. CAN MAKE OR MAR T cannot be too strongly stressed that the West Indies Cricket Board of Control is the only organised body in West Indies cricket that can at present either dissipate most of the driving power and individual genius that have carried the West Indies onward and upward until they now, by common consent, have earned the right to challenge Australia for world cricket supremacy. . Conversely, they can do more than anyone else towards th guiding of the destinies of West Indies cricket upwards. '' SHROUDED IN OBSCURITY 'HE most important decisions of the Board at their meeting in Trinidad, less than a fortnight ago, with the exception of the Australian visit are all shrouded in obscurity. Who can scotch the rumour that West Indies President R. K. Nunes was granted $1,200 in appreciation of the service which he has rendered to West Indies cricket as President of the West Indies Cricket Board of Control and Mr. D, P, Lacy was also voted $2,400 for the service which he rendered as Secretary of the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. This is all very interesting and I am not accusing the Board as being guilty cf what these rumours out of their context undoubtedly suggest. But let us assume for the sake of argument that these {rumours are correct, and one feels justified in doing this; well then ; it is striking that the West Indies players themselves have only received $720 each and there has not even been any resolution placing on record their contribution to West Indies cricket history. WATER POLO SEASON ENDS SOON rPYHE BARBADOS WATER POLO ASSOCIATION expect to finish their K.O, Competition on Thursday November 2nd. This will be the last game of the 1950 Season, However they are practising three times a week, in preparation for the Trinidad tour in late November. | The Barbados team quite realises that they will be facing a for- midable foe when the Trinidadians arrive, as from all reports the standard of Water Polo in Trinidad has improved one hundred per cent, since the Barbadians went to Trinidad in January this year, bringing horne with them the Elite Water Polo Cup, which will again be at stake, in November. NEW RULES TOURNAMENT aoe tournament will be played under the new rules of Water Polo which ceme into effect in January 1950, The Barbados Associa- tion, unlike Trinidad was unable to play by these new rules as copies did not arrive until after their 1950 season had begun. Of the original nine members of the Barbados team, which toured Trinidad in January, it is expected that about six of them will be again appearing against Trinidad in November. It is not yet known +,if Peter Patterson who skippered the Bimshire team to Trinidad in January will turn out for Barbados and the name of the Barbados captain has not yet been announced. His brother Boo Patterson looks like be:n a certainty, he is busy dropping some weight to be in first class condition by November, THESE ARE SURE PICKS EOFFREY FOSTER, Kenneth Ince and Delbert Bannister are also sure of a pick, Geoffrey Foster however may appear in the back line, Ince ana Bannister are in good form and were top scorers in the goal averages this season, Both these boys belong to the Snappers team, which carried off the 1950 league championship and are well in the running for the K.O, Competition. 'lim Yearwood and George MacLean also look like certainties in the Barbados defence line, Paul Foster who kept goal for Barbados in 'Trinidad in January, still seem: to be the choice for the November series, but his brother Maurice and Albert Weatherhead both deserve tries for they have each kept goal for their respective teams extremely well this season, Likely newcomers to the team are Billy Manning, Basil Brooks, Gerard Jordan, Maurice Fitzgerald and a few others, LADIES PRACTISING HARD 'HE Ladies Water Polo games are something of a novelty so far but they should add much colour to the tournament, The Bar- bados girls have no league, but have got together since the Trinidad girls issued their challenge and have been practicing regularly, They do not foresee victory at present against the Trinidadians who have played league Water Polo for one season already, but they expect to put up a good fight and by next year give them a real run for their money, TRINIDAD GIRL\u00a7 ARRIVE NOVEMBER 23 E entertainment committee arranging the tour, have so far worked out a tentative programme. The team arrives on Thurs- day November 23rd, There will be the first Water Polo test by floodlight that night followed by a dance. Friday night there will be the second test also by floodlight. Saturday morning there is to be a picnic and the third test will be played on Saturday afternoon. Sunday, the 1950 league winners, Snappers will play the Trinidad team there will be a small programme of Aquatic Sports, followed by the distribution of cups and prizes. On Sunday night there will be a dinner at the Barbados Aquatic Club. The team returns to Trinidad on Monday. .

Hutchinson Meeting Opens Next Saturday By BOOKIE oer I always enjoy a November meetin more than any other in Barbados although it is not usually our biggest or most important. Now that the March meeting carries the Guineas : with it, one might even say that the November fix- ture is the least important of the three, But there are things about a November meet~ id ing which are lacking from the other two and one of these is quite often the heavy rain. Now I am no lover of rain particularly and I do not like to see it spoil gate receipts or betting returns, but the effect it usually has on the meeting as a whole is to make everything uncertain from the opening event to the last fixture on the calendar. This isethe part I like the best. As a rule, before the March ana august meetings one sees so many trial gallops that by the time the first race day arrives the favourites have singled themseives out almost automatically. But in November it's just the opposite. One goes to the races, whether one is am expert or merely a chance visitor, xnowing little or nothing of what is going to happen when the gates fly. The present preparation period is no exception and there is not one race on the tirst day in which I could pick a winner with any feeling of confidence. Of course it's not as bad as it was last year when there were ponds all over the track which frequently made trainers take to the beach and myself to the open road, driving fran- tically from one spot to the other; but although I have now seen about four mornings' work-outs I still have not made up my mind definitely about anything. Therefore in my last column before the races I have little advice to offer. ESTERDAY'S work was the most restricted of all. There were quite a number of gallops which were trying efforts for some but on the whole they were taking it very easy in the mud. About the best I saw for the entire period was Landmark's five in 1.12. This was more or less the same as Sun Queen's time and seeing that both these fillies are entered in the Worthing Stakes over 54 furlongs on the first day, it means that their chances are about even, Therefore although I was about to single out Landmark as one of my favourites the presence of Sun Queen makes me think again. THER races are just as bad or worse and the fact that we have not yet seen any of the Trinidadians or the one from Grenada exercising only makes matters more complicated. For instance, what shall we discover about Pharlite in the South Caribbean Stakes? In this race he will be as much of a dark horse as he was when he arrived from Jamaica to run in Trinidad iast year, Please note that it was in thick mud that he won his first start at Arima, Although this can be countered with the remark that last June he also ran in taick mud but still could not win in A class Apart from Pharlite how shall we decide between Elizabethan and Iniusion' 'he former has obviously proved nerseif the better in the past but Infusion's light weight, pius the splendid form she has sometimes shown in mud should win her many admirers. Nearly every morning these two mares, who worked by themselves, have returned similar times. Who is to say which will be the likely winner? In the same race we must also come to some decision with regard to Atomic II. Up to now { und myself unabie lo make up my mind whether he has been going well or just tooling when he teels like it, 1 do not believe that Kidstead is any kind of companion for him and this probably accounts for the spasmodic bursis he displayed when galloping yesterday, but I for one will treat nim with a very open mind until the finish of the South Caribbean Stakes. Y this time I thought the position in the Trumpeter Cup would have cleared up a bit. On the contrary I find myself be- tween, not two, but several minds. Just when I was deciding along the lines of Hi Lo for favourite Flame Flower comes right back into the betting with a splendid gallop yesterday, while Vanguard pulled all over Dunese a little later. On top of that I find myself taken so much by the smooth way in which Soprano moves that despite the fact that she is, by design, being given a restricted preparation, I cannot exclude her from my list of favourites for the race. UT the race which looks as if it will break all records for the Forecast and Pari Mutuel returns is the G class Brighton Stakes. Here we have one round dozen and of these I can think of only one who has no chance of winning. Unless, of course, the three visitors, whom we have not yet seen at exercise, do something in the next week to turn our minds from them. But on paper there is no rea- son why Blue Grass, Flying Ann, Manu or Front Hopper should not have good chances at this race. Meanwhile the homesters have Bachelor's Folly, a reconditioned horse, who is going very well at exercise. Vixen, who in spite of her roaring still has enough class to win in G, Duchess, who, in fact is really a visitor from Antigua or some other Leeward Island, but shows definite signs of being a filly with a game heart. I must say that when I first saw her she reminded me very much of those lean hailf- breds we saw in Trinidad some years ago, but on seeing her exer- cise I was immediately attracted by her display of courage, Then there is Wilmar. Up to yesterday I had paid this one scarcely any attention at all. But on seeing same going with the thoroughbred two-year-old Cross Roads, I was certainly impressed that the half- bred was the better. Next we have the ever saucy Mopsy. Tried as she may be, one can never add truthful, and thereby hangs a tale. She has proved true in the mud before. Will she do it again. Lastly I couple Sun Jewel and Maytime as two outsiders with good chances while to the honest Blue Diamond one might say \"perseverance sel- dom fails\", although it certajnly does not look as if it will be success- ful in his case at this meeting. OMETHING else which I thought we might have seen at the No- vember meeting was some three-year-old with chances in the Trinidad Derby lurking in F class. To fill this role my eye fell on Cross Bow, Colleton and Apollo. That, I admit, was on their form earlier in the year and as two-year-olds. But now it seems that the last call has come for the Derby and none of these are yet ready. They have certainly shown nothing in their exercise to make one enthusiastic and when we consider that they would have to improve to almost C class standard between now and Christmas for them to is your dog getting old?

Instead of one or two large meals a day he should have three smaller ones, and he should have less meat. For his evening meal, give him dog biscuits and a drink of milk. Crunching the biscuits helps tokeep his teeth clean and his gums firm, and the milk, besides being very nourishing, soothes his stomach. Take care, also, not to overtire him, and make sure he has a really comfortable and warm place to sleep. At the end of a lifetime of affection and loyalty to you for doggy. he deserves a little extra con- sideration and kindness. With age, he will be more in- clined to slight bilious attacks and other stomach troubles, Regular conditioning with Bob Martin's Condition Tablets (one a day) will be more than ever necessary. The mineral substances which the tab- lets contain in balanced quantities will help to renew the red blood cells\u2014a form of help especially important in hot weather. At the same time the vitamins they con- tain will supply health - giving elements which a dog's domestic _ diet so often lacks.

F. Harrison Cup to be played on Saturday and the ladies' open- ing matches on Sunday, Larger fields than last year ere expecte | in both events in spite of the fact that two of the four rounds of the men's tournament and one of the ladies' three rounds are scheduled for race days. In drawing up the schedule the Committee took the conflict intu consideration, but is was feli that because of the great increase in the number of competitors, both in the Bi and ladies' fields, only a 1) perc\u00e9ntage, possibly three or four players, would miss the everit because of their greater interest in the horses. It was pointed out that a small percent- age of golfers also are more interested in the sailing regattas or cricket and that no considera- tion is given them in scheduling the events at Rockley. Already there are eight pairs entered for the men's foursomes and three for the women's and the lists undoubtedly be in- creased before the entries close on Thursday evening at 6 pm. At least twelve pairs are m the men's event and eight in the women's section. The Ways and Means Committee headed by Mr. Don ~o has early next year has definitely settled on a western style barbecue and barn dance as one of the principal sources of income. This gay evening is scheduled for the night of January 20.

Earlier Ron Hamence had scored a century for South Australia who lost their remaining five first in- nings wickets today for the adci- tion of 105 runs. Hamence batted cautiously u1- til he had completed his hundred in four hours 35 minutes, with eight fours. Hitting cut afterwards he was smartly stumped by God- frey Evans with 114 to his credit. Bowlers Freddie Brown and Doug Wright were the most im- pressive combination in the tour- ists' attack. Brown took three wickets for 55 and Wright four for 103, while Evans shared in five dismissals. amp SOUTH AUSTRALIA FIRST INNINGS A. R. McLean c Close b Bailey . 2 N.

EOE SOOO IOS SO OOOO OOOOH So ao SSOSSSOSS rrr a a a ad LLL LOLOL 4 an _.: PAGE Ix The Amateur Theatre Hy Charles Thomas Some Reflections on its Present Position and Future Possibilities PERHAPS before I deal too harshly with the Amateur actor I should make it quite clear that I ambeing crue] \"only to be kind,\" If I am frequently exas- perated with the amateur of the theatr\u00ae, this does noi mean that 1 disbelieve in him; on the con- trary, | have the profoundest belief\u2014in his capacity to create real art, not only hecause there is no logical reason why he shouldn't but because I have actually seen it done, though only, on comparatively rare occa- sions. I am afraid, I am not pessimistic because the fact that I have seen it done shows that it is possible, and it is only a ques- tion of the amateur approaching his subject from the right angle. 1 find that many professionals of th\u00e9 theatre with little or no knowledge of amateurs will often shrug their shoulders and raise their eyebrows and_ generally exhibit a well studied attitude of contemptuous pity at the very mention of the word amateur as though the bare fact of receiving payment for one's work endowed the recipient with golden quali- ties whieh are in fact only tco ner? missing. hile this attitude is both -houghtless and stupid, it is the amateur who is to blame for it, because he will not as a rule take his hobby seriously. It is surpris- ing how many amateur actors, even talented ones are utterly unconscientious, not to say highly immodest. That may, perhaps, sound a little sweeping, but surely, it is immodest to prac- tise in public, an art which one has not taken the trouble to leayn anything about? I have heard people who have been severely taken to task by some festival adjudicator defend themselves on the ground that it is only a hobby\u2014that they cannot be expected to work like slaves \u2014that they had other work to do \u2014this is just recreation, they do it for fun, because they like it and so on. Now this is all well and good so far as the majority of hobbies is concerned. A man may derive pleasure from paint- ing without knowing how to paint and this wil] not matter so long as he refrains from inflicting his work on his friends. If he enjoys picking out his favourite tunes on the piano entirely by air and without any musical gift or knowledge, it is quite all right, so long as he lives in a detached from which his family is temporarily absent. He may play games as badly as he hikes with- out injuring his neighbours (though as a matter of fact, sports thusiasts are often apt to take eir hobbies more seriously thai their jobs), but he must not approach the theatre irresponsible manner. mce-on the stage it is his busi-. ness ~ edify an audience of people who have paid to see him, and if audiences would only come to the amateur theatre in the right frame of mind they would not so meekly put up with the be occasionally that we find then going solely for the appreciation of theatre art. When this becomes general, the unconscientious wi!) be swept from the stage and the amateur will be honoured in the theatre as he has so frequently been in other fields, Even music, the most exacting of the arts, has had its great amateurs, and sculp- ture and painting can show some jine examples. In the poetic firmament, amateur stars have shone with real brilfance, and true amateurs may well rejoice in the reflection that their kind has been responsible for much of the rarest poetry in our language. it is a strange thing that the only form of art which is depend- ent on an audience should be so often approached in a_half- hearted and lazy fashion. Any other art, craft or game may be practised independently, but act- ing is unique in that it depends for its very existence on its e = CHARLES THOMAS immediate reception by an audi- ence, Having spoken thus strongly, I should make it quite clear that my experience of the amateur theatre, though considerable, has been gained entirely in Great Britain and it may well be that here in Barbados, I shall discover a more enthusiastic approach to the sub- ject than is common in England. It is true that we have in my country many little theatre groups of first rate quality, and it is on these that I base my belief in the amateur. But the proportion of good groups to indifferent or frankly bad ones, is not what it should be. Barbados, being a small island with a large population and so situated that it cannot be served with first rate professional drama, a olden opportunity to has in thisMlcreate for itself a unique little * theatre movement, and their first need in my opini is the little theatre itself. Something which is small and intimate. Not neces- sarily very costly, indeed it might be quite a home made affair, but the great thing is that it should a theatre and not a multi- fare' commonly served to them, PUrpose hall. It is amazing how but unfortunately, they have got inspiring can be the effect of a intothe habit of coming for a little play-house which, no matter muldolicity of reasons which have nothing whatever to do with art. it may. be in order to support a favourite charity or because they are such near neighbours, friends or relations of those on the stage, or simply because being pleasant and Kindly people, they feel that they ought to be there. It is only how small and simple, has beeif designed entirely for the produc- tion of dramatic effect. We often hear it said that the only things which matter are the play anti the action. We are told that the play is the thing.

There were present a fine representative gathering of the Groups of the District and a not- so-fine gathering of the Lay mem- bership of the Association. The business of the meeting got under- way under the chairmanship of Mr. H. A. Tudor, one of the Lay members of the Association and at its conclusion, films of certain District activities held during the past year were shown, During the course of the meeting Assis- tant Scoutmaster C. L, & Smith of the St Leonard's Troop was invested and the Wood Badge was presented to Scouters Lisle Harrison, Kenneth Pile and Cuthbert Worrell. Mr. F. J. Cote was unanimously re-elected President of the Asso- ciation and Messrs H. F. Alkins, \u00a3. B. Williams and H. N. Chand- jer, Vice-Presidents. Miss S. D. Phillips and Frank Blackman were re-elected Honorary Treas urer and Secretary respectively. S. M. Cyril Brathwaite of the Bethel Group was re-appointed District Scoutmaster, It may not be amiss here to quote from the District Commis- sioner's Report\u2014'While there is much remaining to be done both as regards quantity of achievement and quality of service, yet there is no ground for pessimism.\",. . for....\"it is pleasing to record the interest, self-sacrifice and willing co-operation of the band of men and women who, week after week, give of their time to the training of the young mem- bers of the Movement. Their re- ward is the knowledge that they are serving a worthy cause.\" And a most important quota- tion\u2014\"Our finance continue to be meagre, although we are solvent... .!!\" making something out of nothin,, bricks without straw etc, Now i: seems to me that we have travelle | as far as is possible along tha: particular road. It is time 'now that the conscientious amateur should be equipped with the kind of theatre that his art demands and deserves. For the theatre is the instrument on which the drama is played and without which good plays may sleep be- tween book covers and never be brought to light. The policy of the little theatr\u00bb should be to delight and edify its ona audiences with plays of rea! worth. It is a most unfortunate failing of the amateur theatre that it ecncentrates far too much on modern light comedy and farce. Not only is this kind of vlay far the most difficult to per- form requiring from the players a very highly developed tech- nique, but also because it is a profound mistake to imagine that audiences are only happy when the, are laughing, They want to laugh it is true, but, though they may be too shy to admit it, they excited, they like to be kept also want to cry, They like to be frightened and my long exper- guessing, they even like to be ience of the much maligned pub- lic, convinces me that they also like to \"think\" now and again. I believe in them; I believe in the power of the right sort of theatre, not only to delight its audiences, but to broaden their outlook and play an active part in leading them toa fuller and happier life. Having had the good fortune to see the miracle per- formed in England, I am con- vinced that the same tging can happen in Barbaidos, MOTOR OIL SUNDAY ADVOCATE Scouters Get Guide Notes: Demand For Guide Companies Locally Says Commissioner There is a growing demand for Guide Companies and Brownie Packs in Barbados says Mrs. J.

In little villages such as ti.is on the northernmost tip of New- foundland, far to the north of the West Indies, fishermen will ve locked in by icefioes. They are laying in supplies of food and fuel to last them until next April or i. When the ice comes in it surrounds Raleigh on three sides, and after that all transportation is by dogteam or snowshoe. plies cannot be sent in except plane. The villagers' diet for the winter months is usually brea+, potatoes, turnips, cabbage, salt meat and salt codfish. This fare is occasionally relieved by sea- birds or seals killed by the fisherman's shotgun. Small coastal schooners and steamers now are busy freight ing supplies to the northern ports, and transport is expensive. With his meagre finances the northern Newfoundlander has tc figure his needs carefully, almost down to the last pound of flour and the Jast jar of molasses. These supplies have been bought now and the flour, oat- me hard biscuit, molasses and other essentials are sailing north- wards to be \u2014(CP) oo SUNDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1960 \u00a9 GIVE ME TUTAKA EVERY TIME! says the plumber \"... there's no better drill anywhere!

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1950 PRESSURE THE reaction to any reference to colour discrimination and segyegation of races generally takes the form of fulminating Speeches and writings and deep resentment which assist in no way in remedying the evil, By the nature of his -address to His Excellency the Governor, notice of which was given on Tuesday last, Mr. Brancker has shown that he, at least, is aware of the correct manner of dealing with such unpleasant matters. ae No amount of vituperative language will be effective. A calm dispassionate view of the matt\u00e9r is far more likely to bring the culprits to their senses. The most vulnerable part of the armour of the recalcitrant must be sought and pierced. And Mr. Brancker has rightly judged that by to-day's standards a man's pocket is his most vulnerable spot. The fact that Barbados, by withdrawing her custom' from South Africa can do no harm to the economy of the Dominion is not the point in question. Few covntries, except those which manufacture ma- chinery and textiles, can bring sufficient effective pressure-to bear.on South Africa .. to make her change her attitude towards colour and racial problems. Nevertheless if.eyery country, which d\u00e9plores 'discrim- ination, followed the , lead which Mr.. Brancker hopes Barbados 'will give, then South Africa and all other like-thinking countries would soon have~. to. capitulate and abandon their inhuman tactics. _ , Dr. Malan's Government has b\u00e9\u00e9n round- ly abused in some quarters for its attitude towards the coloured citizens of the, Union, 'But this attitude in South Africa has riot 'arisen overnight as a result of the Govern- _ ment in power. It has been in existence and. has been practised in.the Union for _gerierations. Dr. Malan's' Government has succeeded in making it legal. And the reaction in many countries has been inten- sive But until Mr. Brancker gave notice \u00bb of. his address this reaction'has taken. the form of beating the. air with empty threats. oo Well planned attacks on the economic front will giv\u00e9 the West Indies adequate passenger accdfamiodation oh ships it will stop wars by bankrupting the aggressor i those countries which fail te t Baloured peoples and people of ; itr: races like ordinary human beings mend the error of their Ways. , Economic pressure is mighti\u00e9r_than ~ armed force. * If they cannot be taught to respect the rights;of human. beings, of whatever race, creed or coldur then they must be forced by economic ;pressure to conform to the opinions of right thinking peoples. COLOUR COUNTS \"RECENT research into the resistance to \u20ac th\u00e9 effects of heat and light in cattle of \u2014 different colours should be of absorbing interest to cattle raisers in the tropics. Long before scientific investigation was attempted, the average cattle man had learnt from, observation that some cattle didnot seem to stand up, to tropical heat... as well'as others. But without detailed re+ search to guide him he came td the conclu- sion that the darker the cattle. the better .. chance they had of resisting the light and' heat from the sun's rays. Now, carefully checked' experiments) have shown that whil\u00e9 casual observation was able to detect\u00bb. that c\u00e9rtain coloured cattle 'had greater resistance than others yet it was unable to differentiate between the resistant powers of the various colours and breeds, The excellence of the Zebu cross had long been recognised for beef cattle and has been used extensively in the tropics for its tick resistant qualities. Commenting on the Zebu cross Lord Bledesloe in a re- OUR READERS SAY: csat letter to the \"Times\" writes: \"In , Northern Queensland, where .there is an annual] average shade temperature of 84\u00b0 F., with a maximum of 118 in Summer, there has for some years been a steady increase in the Zebu-Hereford cross of beef cattle (the humped Indian Zebu com- ing for the purpose from Texas, U.S.A.), which are putting on more flesh, with earl- ier maturity, than our pure English breeds enabling an extension of 7,500 square miles of cattle country, with an annual increase in beef value, derived therefrom, of \u00a3300,000.\" But more interesting to West Indian dairymen than this extraordinary influence of crossing in beef cattle are the recent experiments carried out by Mr. J. C. Bonsma at the University of Pretoria. Noting the injurious effects of solar radi- ation on the health of animals, Mr. Bonsma | set out to discover whether there was any variation in the temperature of animals exposed to the same conditions and whether the types of coats and colours in- fluenced in any way the variations of tem- perature. He has found that animals with yellow coats are more resistant to high tempera- ture than those of other colours. He has | also discovered that a smooth glossy coat- ed animal reflects more light than a duller long 'coated animal. \u00bb,, Summing up from the results of these experiments and from practical demon- strations it is concluded that, by reason of their colour and the texture oftheir coats, Jersey cattle are one of the hardest dairy . breeds for tropical areas and most resist- ant to high temperatures. This is good news for West Indian dairy- men for it is a well known fact that dairy cattle do not deteriorate in the tropics as rapidly as beef cattle, and the Jersey is a compact little cow, hardy and easy to feed. SONG BIRDS THE first thing that strikes the visitor to Barbados is the limited number of species vf birds, And when he has been in the is- land for a few weeks he notices that ther\u00e9 are no real song birds or at least none that would gain admittance to a concert plat- form. There may be many reasons for the lim- ited bird life in the island. Presumably there is not the same wealth of bird food in Barbados as there is in many Caribbean islands, But there is sufficient to support vast flocks of cheeky Sparrows, raucous Blackbirds and mournful Wood Doves and Turtle Doves, The reason for the absence of genuine song birds should therefore be not far to seek. It is obvious that no one has been suffi- ciently interested to find a species of song bird which can exist' on the type .of food available in the island. Many strange birds have been introduced from time to time and some have settled down in their new surroundings and have bred and multi- ~ plied, Not so long ago the Love Bird was unknown in Barbados. Now there are flocks of these charming little parrot-like birds to be seen in many parts of Barbados. 'But the Love Bird's vocal efforts can hard- ly be 'termed pleasant. And 'again some years ago the Morris Bird was introduced and in no time had shown that the habitat suited him. He again is not a pleasant song bird and un- fortunately upsets the balance of power in the insect world with corresponding harmful effects on the parasites which fed on insect pests of our crops, Bird lovers should get together and, in collaboration with the Agricultural De- partment, should decide on a variety of song birds not likely to be injurious to crops und capable of existing in this island. Hav- ing selected the right species of bird a sanctuary could be created where they could, live until acclimatised. At a later date protective laws could be introduced. The presence of song birds Would make Barbados a more attractive and pleasant island in which to live. SUNDAY ADVOCATE THEY DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN | I'WONDER WHAT'S EATING Him ?

Shopkeeper states in his or her Jetter that I must be a semi-mer- chant taking home weekly eight or ten hundred dollars in goods that my freight should be so low in cost. For your information I have quoted the figures that the mer- chant should charge for freight, Not what another private owner should charge because I know quite well that it cannot pay a lorry owner or a pick up owner to take to the country goods at 1% because when my load is not big enough for the. merchant lorry, I have to pay 48 cents for a bag of sugar and 36 cents for a bag of rice and so on.

JONES, President Scouts and Old Boys', St. Luke's Association, October 28, 1950. A' least four times in the past week I've been buttonholed on Broadway and asked: \"Have you heard what happened to Charlie Feltus?\" Perhaps I ought to bring you up to date... For as long as I can remember, Charlie Feltus has been a pro- moter of things and people, and he has always made a pretty nice dollar at it. However, like a. lot of other Times Squareheads, he has never held on to these dollars for long because of a weakness for horses and blondes. N recent months, to hear the wisenheimers tell it, it's been rough going for Charlie in both ents seeing as how (a) most of his earnings have been going into the jewel box of a platinum-mopped tootsie named the Hazel Duke, and (b) his luck at the race track has been\u2014as Damon Runyon used to put it\u2014 a whole lot less than somewhat. Came a bleak and bleary-eyed evening not long ago when Charlie called on Hazel, \"I'm in a spot, baby\", he gloom- ed, \"I owe my bookie, Butch Fleeson, seven grand and he just tipped me off that if I don't pay up by the end of the week I'm in for some bad trouble. Butch, as you know, is a pal of mine and wouldn't make no fuss if it was The Question Is, Who Wins? Hy HILLY ROSE up to him, but he says the guy who runs the syndicate is press- ing him.\" : \"What can I do about it?\" asked Hazel. \"Well,\" said Charlie, eyeing the glinty knick-knacks on her ar and neck, \"I could raise sev grand on = your would be just a loan, you under- stand. . . .\" te \"Nuts to that loan stuff,\" sil Hazel. \"And while we're having this heart-to-heart, I might as well tell you I've been thinking of calling it quits. Don't slam door, \"sucker.\" Naturally, Charlie was hurt by this kiss-off, especially after his many blue-white. kindnesses to the little lady, but he was an old campaigner and so he left with- out breaking her arm or doing anything else ungentlemanly HHE next day Hazel got a telephone call from Butch Fleeson, the bookie \"Hello, Beautiful,\" he said. \"I hea> tell you've given Charlie the brush and \"You want to pick it up where he left off\" laughed Hazel. \"Okay jewellery. Tt by me, and you can begin by taking me to dinner,\" \"You catch om quick,\" said the bookie. He named one of the exclusive eateries on the . East Side and went on: \"Meet you at seven, and if you get there first: order yourself a drink, I'll be over soon as I finish with the bets on to-night's fight\". An hour and four Martinis later Butch telephoned Hazel at the restaurant. \"I got jammed up.\" he said, \"but I'll be over in a few minutes. Have them ice up a couple of quarts of champagne and order the biggest double steak in the house. I'm starved.\" By 9, Hazel had polished off most of the porterhouse and all the champagne, but there was still no sign of Butch. Finally plenty peeved, she told herself that no horse hustler was going to make her wait around. with ketchup on her mouth.. But as she rose to go the waiter handed her a tab for $51.20. \"Tell the manager I'm Mr. Fleeson's guest,\" she said. Five minutes later the mana- ger appeared. \"I'm sorry,\" -he said, \"but I just phoned Mr. Flee- son and he says he had pn appointment here to-night,\" \"Okay,\" said Hazel wearily \"Tll leave this bracelet a: security and come in to-morrov to pay you,\" HE manager took the bracele me as = to a stoutis) The mar = a detective's badge and' hande Hazel Eliza Stone.\" And whe.

WH7HEN Hazel got to her apart- ment she found a sheet of paper under the door. It was a duplicate of the jewellery list the \"detective\"\" had shown her.

You'll hear of Jamaica's history and folk-lore, banana loading and the work of a sugar factory, and the voices of Jamaica's leading politi- cal figures, not to forget Jamaira's 'Pocomania.'

This will begin on the 8th November and for Wednesday next, there'll be a broadcast in the series 'I'd Like You to Meet' in which Ernest Eytle will introduce the stationmaster of Paddington, one of the great London termini, Mr. William Geden. In 'Carib- bean Voices,' the Sunday evening version of 'Calling the West Indies' the programme for Sunday, 29th October will present a one-act play. This is the first accepted contribution of this nature, though many have tried to break into this field and have submitted such works to the BBC for use in 'Caribbean Voices.' Sunday's play is entitled 'Ping-Pong' and is by Errol Hill of Trinidad, who is now in London. Both the Wednesday and Sunday West Indies pro- grammes, like all other versions of 'Calling the West Indies' are on the air for half-an-hour begin ning at 7.15 p.m. Festival of Britain Preparations for the Festival ot Britain in 1951 are going on apace \u2014six months remain' before it opens on May 3, 1951.
