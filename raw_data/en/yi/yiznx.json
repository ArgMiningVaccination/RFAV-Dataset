We are your trustees. It is a service that isnot run for profit, but purely in the interestsof every section of the community. \u2014Introductory address, ABC Radio, 1932 Few matters have such significance for the future of the ABC as the extent of its funding,and the selection of its Managing Director. For these reasons, the 2005-06 year was particularly decisive for the Corporation dueto the rare concurrence of two key events:the success of the funding submission forthe coming triennium 2006-09, and theappointment of a new Managing Director,Mark Scott, whose term extends to 2011. Both factors will have a profound influence on the Corporation's progress over the nextdecade, and its destiny in the digital age. Securing appropriate funding for the ABC for the next triennium has been a principalpriority for the Board over the past yearand the basis for a concerted program ofadvocacy to the Parliament regarding theCorporation's future. Creating the Setting: Triennial Funding 2006-09 The ABC's value within Australian life and culture is unique, and can never be fullyexpressed upon the balance sheet. Yet as apublic enterprise, the ABC must be able toclearly demonstrate its efficiency, effectivenessand value for public money, by any measure. Over the past decade, in response to some of the greatest challenges of the digital age, theBoard has set priorities for the Corporationto ensure the ABC's presence on the Internet,digital television and digital radio. It istestimony to the Corporation's capacity and discipline that it introduced major digitalservices such as ABC Online and ABC2without additional funding from theParliament for these purposes. In late 2003, the Board made a formal request to Government for an independentreview of ABC funding. It was the Board'sbelief that the prospects for the Corporation'sfunding bid might be substantially improvedby augmenting the cultural argument for the ABC with a new economic argument, and importantly, an argument madeindependently of the ABC. Accepting the Board's request, the Government committed to conduct this review in its 2004Election Policy, 21st Century Broadcasting , and appointed KPMG to conduct the review,commencing work in late 2005. As the Directors' statement in last year's Annual Report explicitly noted, unlessadequate funding was secured for thecoming triennium the ABC would be forcedto confront \"a range of fundamental questionsabout the extent and quality of ABCprogramming and services\". That possibility has now been avoided. In May 2006, the 2006-07 Federal budget providedthe best budget outcome for the ABC inmore than twenty years. The ABC's Triennial Funding for 2006-09 was renewed, and an additional $88.2 millionprovided for the next three years. Thisconsisted of an extra $30 million to investwith the independent production sector in thecreation of quality Australian television dramaand documentaries, an extra $13.2 million to sustain and enhance regional and localBoard Directors' Statement20 programming, and an extra $45 million in capital to ensure the ABC has both equipmentand infrastructure appropriate to its needs. Some of the most compelling arguments for increased funding arose fromrecommendations of the KPMG report onABC funding, the Funding Adequacy and Efficiency Review . Perhaps more importantly, the independent perspective provided by KPMG elevateddebate about adequate resourcing of theABC beyond the reflexive arguments bywhich it had long been dominated. Consolidating Reform Throughout the Corporation The KPMG review proved to be a stimulus to critical thinking within the Corporation, withenduring benefits for managerial culture.Key decision makers were presented with a further opportunity to test the relevance of current business practices and workingmethods, to clearly define and articulatemanagerial activity in relation to Charter goals. The Corporation is engaged in a continuing process of reform to ensure the maximumbenefit from ABC funding is delivered to theAustralian people, through quality content. Just as the Board directs the Corporation to keep pace with changing public expectationsand needs, its own relationship withmanagement continually evolves to reflectchanges in contemporary expectations ofcorporate governance and standards of public accountability. As the trustee of the public interest, the Board continued to promote a betterunderstanding of the Board's separate and distinct role across the year. A newvitality has been brought to the contest of ideas between Board and management, and greater clarity given to the Board'sexpectations of management. More rigorousreview of proposals put to the Board andperformance against objectives of theABC's Corporate Plan has further improvedmanagerial accountability, and in turn, theCorporation's accountability to the Parliament. As it prepares for the new Triennium, the Corporation has made consistent progresson goals set out by the 2004-07 CorporatePlan, building and consolidating on reformsand innovations of recent years. Detailed reporting of achievements against the Corporate Plan is provided on pages 13 and 112. Managing Director Russell Balding resigned from the positionof Managing Director of the Corporation inMarch 2006, having served the ABC for adecade, first as Director of Finance andBusiness Services, and for the past fouryears as Managing Director. The Board records its appreciation of Mr Balding's special contribution to the ABC.The past four years constitute an era of realachievement for the Corporation. Russell Balding successfully directed Executive management to meet the manysignificant challenges set by the Boardduring his term, including reform to theCorporation's complaints handling processes,and the establishment of the digital-onlytelevision channel ABC2 on a sustainablebasis. His command of the Board's brief with regard to the KPMG Funding Adequacy and Efficiency Review contributed significantly to the outcome of the Review.Board Directors' Statement continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0621 By imposing greater discipline and demanding more rigour of business cases brought beforethe Board, he created beneficial precedentsfor management and governance throughoutthe Corporation. Eight weeks after Mr Balding's departure, after a national and international search that produced an outstanding field ofcandidates, Mark Scott was appointedManaging Director of the ABC. Mr Scott is an exceptional media professional with a distinguished academic recordand comes to the ABC from John FairfaxPublications, where he was EditorialDirector. He takes up duty on 5 July 2006. Board Directors Leith Boully retired from the Board in October2005. The Board records its thanks to MrsBoully, particularly for her knowledge of theinterests of rural and regional Australia andvalued contribution to corporate planning for the ABC. The second term of Staff-Elected Director Ramona Koval expired on 14 June 2006 andthe Board would like to thank Ms Koval forher contribution. With the passing by theParliament of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Act 2006 , the position of Staff-Elected Director wasabolished from 15 June 2006. John Gallagher was appointed Deputy Chairman on the 6 October 2005. Having welcomed new Directors Steven Skala in October 2005 and Peter Hurley and KeithWindschuttle in June 2006, the Board nowhas a full complement of Directors.Board Committees The Board Editorial Policies Committeecontinued its review of the ABC Editorial Policies . To better evaluate application of the policies, the Committee considered a numberof test cases and engaged with policy officersfrom the content divisions. The review ofEditorial Policies will be completed before the end of 2006. At the beginning of 2006, the Board commenced a review of its variousCommittees with the aim of providing agreater focus on the Board's governance andaccountability roles. The Board will also createa new instrument through which its ownperformance can be reviewed on an annualbasis. John Brown, now retired partner fromKPMG, joined the Board's Audit and RiskCommittee as a consultant in May 2006 toprovide financial and accounting expertise. ABC Asia Pacific Television In its first five years the ABC Asia PacificTelevision service has been a tremendoussuccess, increasing its audience by 50% eachyear and now being seen in 41 countries,including India for the first time this year. So successful in fact that it attracted the interest of a strong commercial rival whenthe Government decided this year to put theservice out to tender. The ABC won the competitive tender and was awarded a further five-year contract by theGovernment, a tribute to the professionalismand dedication of the team and the credibilityof the service they have developed. Under theterms of the new contract ABC Asia Pacifichas been re-named the Australia Network.22 Foundations for the Future The ABC's ideas and its ambitions will always outstrip its resources, and more funding is not the solution to every problem theCorporation faces. Just as audiences demand distinctive, creative content from the ABC, the Boardseeks creativity from management essentialto meeting so many challenges faced by theCorporation. It has continually directed theCorporation to respond imaginatively to itscircumstances and to live within its means.Finding the correct balance of investmentsthroughout the Corporation has not beenwithout its difficulties. Given priorities set bythe Board, the ABC intensified its efforts forthe present, yet always engaged innovativelywith the future as well\u2014in a fiscallyresponsible manner. This strand runs continuously through the ABC over the last decade. The greatprogress of the Corporation during thisperiod is a tribute both to its enduringcreativity and its institutional resilience. This year, the gradual drift of audiences from traditional media to new digitaldestinations and new forms of contentcontinued. It is the prevailing pattern of media use throughout the world. Yetwhatever change is upon us, for theforeseeable future radio and televisionservices will continue to have anirreplaceable significance in the lives of so many Australians.Media Diversity This year the ABC has again dedicated itselfto serving audiences throughout the nation.In doing so, it continued its importantcontribution to media diversity. As the Prime Minister noted when opening the ABC's new East Perth Centre inSeptember 2005, that unique contribution is of particular importance to all thoseAustralians living beyond the large Easternurban centres: I wish ABC Perth and the ABC in Western Australia great good fortune. I thank it very warmly for its distinctive contributionto Western Australian life, its distinctivecontribution to interpreting to Australiansin Western Australia\u2014the nuances, thedifferences, the variety of attitudes in this state, as part of its role as a greatnational broadcaster. Beyond the capital cities, regional Australia remains central to the ABC's identityand mission. While other media organisations have continued the drift away from regionalcentres towards greater syndication ofprogramming from the cities, the ABC is doing the opposite, seeking to use itsnetwork of 51 regional radio stations as hubs for digital content creation. The National Interest Initiatives have allowed the ABC to generate more programmingfrom regional Australia, reflecting lifeoutside the cities, for use on radio, ABCOnline and ABC2.Board Directors' Statement continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0623 In these and other ways, the ABC continued to distinguish itself from the commercialsector with programming which wouldotherwise have remained unheard andunseen\u2014and which was clearly valued. The Corporation sought to balance tradition and innovation, to serve audiences rightacross the country, across generations who use media in so many different ways,and wherever, whenever, and by whatevermeans the public has chosen. It has clearlymaintained its relevance and usefulness tothe public\u2014the strategy set by the Board forthis environment has seen the ABC innovateto match emerging audience needs andinterests with quality ABC services. Podcasting is but the latest example of a service that has grown as more and moreAustralians firstly discovered it, thendiscovered how useful it was\u2014giving a newlease of life to so many programs for whichaudiences had been limited due to theconstraints of scheduling. Contemporary audiences are dispersed more widely than at any time in history. And withthe shift from older to newer media forms,the characteristics and measurementsassociated with traditional media\u2014such as mass audiences\u2014have also become less relevant. Masses of audiences are rapidly replacing the mass audience. This developmentdemands not just new behaviour and newcontent from the ABC, but also new means of measuring the effectiveness of thedisparate services it provides to the public.Audiences for ABC Online, the ABC's digital- only television channel ABC2, mobile phonetechnologies and ABC podcasts have grownrapidly this year. ABC Online now draws 2.2 million unique Australian users permonth\u2014almost one in five AustralianInternet users. The ABC will long be part of a remembered Australia. The Board's consistent strategyhas been to ensure it will also be a vitalpresence in a new Australia\u2014vibrant,creative, endlessly innovative. The funding settlement provided this year has created a new climate of hope for theABC. The Corporation moves into this newera and new Triennium with confidence in its ability to remain relevant and useful tothe changing needs of the people of Australia. At the end of this significant year in the history of the ABC, the Board can assert withconfidence that it has fulfilled its statutoryduties, as laid out in Section 8 of the ABC Act. Donald McDonald AC Chairman John Gallagher QC Director Ron Brunton Director Janet Albrechtsen Director Steven Skala Director Peter Hurley Director Keith Windschuttle Director Murray Green Acting Managing Director24 The ABC Advisory Council is established under the provisions of the ABC Act to provide adviceto the Board on matters relating to theCorporation's broadcasting programs. The ABC Board appoints the twelve members of the Council for a period of up to four years.The public are invited to apply to join theCouncil through promotions on ABC Radio,Television and Online and advertisements in the press. This year, Ms Joanne Roachfrom Western Australia, Mr GeoffreyCadogan-Cowper from Tasmania and MrJoshua Knackstredt from New South Walesjoined the Council. In December 2005, the Convenor Deborah Klika retired after six years on the Council. Shewas replaced by Dr Jane Munro, who beganher term as Convenor from January 2006. The Advisory Council and the ABC Board continued to build on Council's role in advisingthe ABC Board on community views. The ABC Board Advisory Committee chaired by Dr Ron Brunton met with the Council aftereach Advisory Council meeting and the Boardheld their annual meeting with the AdvisoryCouncil in November 2005. The Council has continued to make recommendations to the Board on variousaspects of ABC programming and met with ABC Divisional Directors to discuss key areas of interest, including radio, new media and audience research.The Council met three times during the year and provided feedback to the ABC Board on a wide range of programs and services. Ofparticular note during the year was the amountof interest in online information services,news and current affairs, arts programmingand program services for younger audiences. The Council prepared discussion papers on Arts Review, a paper reviewing therecommendations of the 2002 Arts Report ; Role of Radio ; Build to Last\u2014The ABC in Our Community ; ABC Newscaff Review , a review of a previous paper, also entitled ABC Newscaff Review ; and Sport on the ABC . These papers have been circulated widely in the ABC and will be considered in theCorporation's strategic planning. The Council's work plan for the remainder of 2006 includes discussion papers on regionalissues, which will look at the ABC in regionaland rural Australia, and young people, whichwill examine how they do and could engagewith the ABC. The Council is also considering adiscussion paper on diversity and inclusiveness. The Council worked towards community consultations in July 2006 which will focus onyouth issues and in particular services providedby triple j and its relevance to today's youth. The Advisory Council's recommendations and commendations for the year, togetherwith responses from ABC management,appear in Appendix (Tasmania), Robyn Lambley (NT), Professor Michael Burgess (SA), Dr Pamela Chick (Queensland).

The outcome of the KPMG Funding Adequacy and Efficiency Review , followed by the Government's decision to appropriateadditional funding in 2006-09, has eased the concerns expressed in last year'sAnnual Report. An early priority will be to establish a production fund, with total funds of $30 millionover three years, through which to co-investwith the independent production sector inproducing high-quality screen drama anddocumentaries. The venture is intended notonly to provide the ABC with a much-neededboost to its level of Australian content but alsoto help rejuvenate the independent sector. The ABC's new Managing Director, Mark Scott, will lead the Corporation in a strategic reviewof operations over the next five-to-ten years.This work will also inform development of anew three-year Corporate Plan. The current2004-07 Corporate Plan is scheduled toexpire no later than 30 June 2007. Oneunderlying imperative is to ensure not onlythat individual platforms perform stronglybut also that content is used to optimumeffect across the total offering of established and new digital media. The ABC will continueto develop opportunities for cross-mediaproduction activities and to harness digitaltechnology for the efficient capture, storageand manipulation of content for radio andscreen-based delivery. The outcome of the strategic review will consequently influence decisions about theABC's technology and infrastructure needsover the coming decade. Already theCorporation has undertaken the first phaseof an Integrated Capital Strategy project,which aims to provide a rigorous planningframework for the ABC's technology andproperty assets to meet the challenges ofthe digital era. One early commitment is toprovide the Minister with an initial report, bySeptember 2006, on the scope for rationalisingits property holdings. Arising from the KPMGFunding Adequacy and Efficiency Review , the ABC will provide a full report in 2007. The KPMG Review confirmed that the ABC operates efficiently and effectively, but alsomade 35 suggestions that had the potentialto further improve performance. A projectteam convened by the Chief Operating Officerwill evaluate each of the recommendationswith the intention of achieving efficiencieswhere possible. Another important project early in 2006-07 will be to re-launch the ABC's internationalsatellite television service, hitherto known asABC Asia Pacific, which will become knownas the Australia Network. This is a conditionof the new five-year contract awarded throughthe Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradefor the ABC to continue operating the service.2007The Year Ahead26 Behind the News explains events and issues in our increasingly complex world in terms thatchildren aged between 10 and 13 can understand.

These choices have beenfacilitated by the rise of technologies such asdigital media players (iPods and MP3 players),digital personal video recorders, and videoand audio downloads using computersconnected to the Internet via broadband. The continuing challenge for broadcasters and other content providers is to anticipateand adapt to the possibilities thesetechnologies are creating. In the past year,the ABC has expanded the range of contentit makes available via these technologies,while continuing to explore newer platformssuch as television content delivered tomobile phones and datacasting. Despite the impact of these media, the traditional media forms of television and radioremain pivotal to the ABC's performance.Traditional media consistently reach thevast majority of the population and providemost of the content for new media platforms. The reach of traditional ABC media detailedbelow illustrates this strength and alsohighlights some emergent trends. Significantly for the ABC, ABC Online continues to grow at rates two or three timesgreater than growth in the overall uptake ofthe Internet. 1The breadth and depth of content \u2014and the ever-expanding range of originalcontent\u2014means that audiences not only use ABC Online to complement their ABCbroadcast experiences, but also engage withcompelling new content that originates online. The ABC's combined reach across television, radio and online declined slightly from 75%in 2003-04 and 2004-05 to 73% in 2005-06. 2 This is primarily attributable to slightdecreases in ABC Television audiences,which are discussed below.Radio There were a number of key developments inthe radio industry during 2005-06, includingthe introduction of new commercial stationsto the metropolitan radio markets of Sydney,Melbourne and Adelaide. Media consumptionpatterns continued to evolve with podcasting,time-shifted listening and \"live\" streaming viathe Internet entering the everyday radio lexicon. In this environment of heightened competition, ABC Radio performed strongly. Overall five-cityaverage weekly reach decreased marginallyby 2% on 2004-05 to 3 704 000 (33% of thefive-city metropolitan population aged 10 orover). 3The 2004-05 reach of 3 766 000 was ABC Audiences 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.52005-062004-052003-042002-032001-02 ABC NewsRadioABC Classic FMtriple jRadio NationalABC Local Radio Millions 1 Nielsen // NetRatings: Home and Work panel data July 2005-June 2006. 2 Newspoll, ABC Awareness and Usage survey and ratings data analysis, June 2006. 3 All five-city radio data is drawn from Nielsen Media Research.01020 30 40 502005-062004-052003-042002-032001-02 DarwinHobartCanberraNewcastlePerthAdelaideBrisbaneMelbourneSydney %Average Weekly Radio Reach\u2014Five City Source: Nielsen Media Research Aggregate ABC Radio Audience Share (%) Source: Nielsen Media ResearchANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0629 the highest annual average on record.

In these fivemarkets, ABC Local Radio achieved shares of5.3%, 7.3%, 8.9%, 12.6% and 25.9% respectively. The ABC also commissioned surveys in two regional areas (no commercial stationschose to participate in these surveys). ABCLocal Radio achieved a share of 10.1% inAlice Springs and 30.9% in Renmark. Focused Radio Audience Research During 2005-06, ABC Audience Researchundertook nine major research projects on behalf of ABC Radio. Five projects werecommissioned for ABC Local Radio, two for Radio National, one each for NewsRadioand triple j . Qualitative research was undertaken on behalf of ABC Local Radio during June-October2005. The research was conducted in Sydney,Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart andprovided an overall \"health check\" of 702ABC Sydney, 774 ABC Melbourne, 612 ABCBrisbane, 720 ABC Perth and 936 ABC Hobart. The stations used the research to maximise listener satisfaction in each of these markets. During August and September 2005, qualitative research undertaken for RadioNational, in Sydney and Melbourne, providedan overall review of the station and exploredlevels of satisfaction among listeners, with a particular focus on Breakfast . The research was followed in September- October 2005 by qualitative research inSydney that focused on maximising thepotential of Radio National in Australianuniversities and assisting in the developmentof strategies to market the station's contentto the tertiary education sector. Also during September-October 2005, qualitative research undertaken for ABCNewsRadio in Sydney and Melbourne exploredattitudes among regular, infrequent andnon-listeners to the station, with a specificfocus on Breakfast and Drive . Acknowledging that today's youth face a vast array of media and entertainment choices,triple j commissioned qualitative research to explore the lives, attitudes and behavioursof its target market and to examine the roleof media in the lives of modern youth.

Market research organisation GfK estimated that the quarterly average salesvolume of digital media players in 2005 was479 000, although the average nearly doubledin the final three months of the year, when864 000 units were sold. 9 In June 2006, the ABC registered just under1.5 million successful and complete downloadsof podcast files, representing content fromall ABC Radio networks, News and CurrentAffairs and audio from ABC Television. 10 Live Radio Streaming In 2005-06, the ABC invested in a sophisticatedweb measurement tool which enabled theCorporation to measure activity levels recordedfor live radio streaming. Since reporting fromthis system commencing in early March 2006,listening to live radio streaming has provenpopular, with over 400 000 live streamsrecorded in the months of May and June. 11 Digital Radio Trials During 2005-06, digital radio trials continuedin Sydney and Melbourne.

Television Two powerful forces shaped the landscape in which ABC Television competed for audiencesin 2005-06. The first was the fierce competitionamong the commercial free-to-air networksin a tight and highly contested market.The second force was the continuing rise in viewing of subscription television. Since2002, subscription television has increasedits average audience by approximately30%. 13This increase has been at the expense of free-to-air networks. Of all free-to-airnetworks, the ABC has been affected most,due to the lure of genre-specific contentavailable on subscription television\u2014most notably coverage of sports andchildren's content. In the face of these forces, 30 programs on ABC Television attracted five-cityaudiences of more than one million viewers.Ten of these were Australian productions,including Da Kath and Kim Code , Enough Rope with Andrew Denton , The New Inventors and My Favourite Film . 14 In 2005-06, ABC Television maintained a significant share of free-to-air televisionviewing. In the five cities markets ofSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, ABC Television's prime-timehousehold share was 16.7%, compared with17.9% in 2004-05.

Television audiences in the more remote areas of Australia are measured by diary,rather than electronically. In 2005-06, theABC participated in diary surveys of televisionaudiences in Darwin, Riverland/Mt Gambier,Remote Central and Eastern Australia, PortPirie/Broken Hill and Regional WesternAustralia. In these areas, the number offree-to-air television stations available toaudiences varies and the ABC share of viewingreflects these differences. ABC Television'sprime-time household share was 30.8% inRemote Central and Eastern Australia, 20.8%in Darwin and 15.6% in Riverland/Mt Gambier. 16 Total free-to-air metropolitan reach hasdeclined as a percentage of the five-citypopulation since 2002 as a result of increasedcompetition from subscription television,as well as alternative media platforms anddevices that deliver video content to Australianaudiences. 17ABC Television's averagemetropolitan weekly reach also declined to 8.54 million in 2005-06, compared with8.88 million in 2004-05. This represents 61.5%of the metropolitan population, comparedwith 64.7% in 2004-05. In the regional markets,ABC Television's reach was 4.12 million,compared with 4.29 million in 2004-05,representing 65.3% of the regional population,compared with 68.6% in 2004-05. 18 ABC Television keeps informed aboutaudience behaviour and attitudes throughquantitative and qualitative research projectsand data sources. Research findings informprogramming, scheduling and marketingstrategies.

During the year, thetrial featured six information services from arange of content providers. The ABC provideda news, sport and weather service that provedto be among the most appealing content to current users involved in the audienceresearch for the trial. The research alsofound that for those considering taking updigital free-to-air television, the ABC news,sport and weather service was a key driver. 29 News and Current Affairs ABC News and Current Affairs continued to attract and retain substantial audiences across the three platforms in 2005-06. On ABC Local Radio, the 7.45am News achieved a five-city average weekly reach of just over one million listeners (steady withthe previous year). The unduplicated averageweekly reach of Early AM (Local Radio) and AM(Radio National and Local Radio) was 1.29 million listeners (up by 3% on theprevious year). 30 On ABC Television, the weeknight 7pm News had a five-city average audience of 993 000and The 7.30 Report 856 000 (down by 10% and 7% respectively on the previous year). Itis noted that the 7pm timeslot faced very strongcompetition from commercial networks inthe second, third and fourth months of 2006.Consistent performers among the flagshipcurrent affairs programs were: Four Corners , with an average audience of 761 000 (up 3%on the previous year); Foreign Correspondent , with an average audience of 589 000 (up by2% on the previous year); and Australian Story , with one in two episodes recording audiences of more than one million. 31In 2005-06, the average monthly reach of the ABC News Online website from within Australia was 471 000, an increase of 41% on the previous year. 32The combined ABC News and Current Affairs online sites recorded 5.2 million average weeklyaccesses in the six months to December2005, 33and 6 million weekly page views in the six months to June 2006.34The latter figure is a 33% increase over the same six-month period of 2005. ABC Appreciation Survey 2006 In June 2006, the ABC commissioned Newspollto conduct the seventh ABC AppreciationSurvey. These surveys provide an overview of community attitudes about the ABC andallow the Corporation to assess the value the Australian public places on its services and the delivery of its Charter obligations.Newspoll conducted similar surveys in 1998, 1999 and 2002 through 2005. The 2006 research was conducted by telephonebetween 16 and 29 June 2006 and drew upon a national sample of 1 900 people aged 14 years and over. Overall Value of the ABC Overall the 2006 results show beliefs andopinions about the ABC across the communityat large are generally consistent with thoseexpressed in the 2005 survey. Nine-in-ten(90%) Australians continue to believe theABC provides a valuable service to thecommunity and half (50%) believe it providesa \"very valuable\" service. Results for this dimension, compared with those recorded in the 2005 survey, showthree areas of improvement, all of which are reflected in increases in the proportionbelieving the ABC provides a very valuable service to the Australian community.Specifically, there is an increase in theproportion of females who believe that ABC Audiences continued 29 Millward Brown Research, Datacasting Research, December 2005. 30 Nielsen Media five-city radio data.31 OzTAM five-city free-to-air television data.32 Nielsen//NetRatings, Home and Work May 2006.33 ABC Server Statistics, July-December 2005.34 Webtrends, cite-centric measurement of 020406080100 Very Valuable Total ValuableStatistically significant2006 2005 199888 4449 50 4189 898691 90 90% 60 17 17% Good Poor 2003 2002 1999 1998 2003 2004 2004 2005 2006 2002 1999 19981008060402002040608010063 63 22 22 2 ABC Commercial Radio 2005 20061458 59 2160 13 30 3032861 20 2658 55 56 13 13 12 2919 Very Good Very Poor Total Good Total PoorStatistically significant change12 10Overall Value of the ABC % Good Poor Very Good Very Poor Total Good Total Poor2003 2002 1999 1998 2003 2004 2004 2005 2006 2002 1999 199875 100806040200204060801002075 1878 20 2341 440 543 541 5 2 123 112980 80 22 22 1028 19 19 5324 54 5418 5018 51 ABC Commercial TV Statistically significant change19 740 66 21 53 2005 200638 39 7 21 5620 2379 77Television\u2014Quality of Programming Radio\u2014Quality of Programming ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 All of the graphs above are based on a total sample aged 14 years and over. \"Don't Know\" responses are not displayed. Source: Newspoll 2006 ABC Appreciation Survey.38 the ABC is very valuable (up from 44% to 50%), a similar rise among people living in capital cities (up from 45% to 50%) and a rise among heavy users of the ABC(up from 57% to 63%). 35 Looking over the past two years, there hasbeen an increase in the proportion of maleswho believe that the ABC provides a valuableservice (up from 88% to 92%). Television Consistent with results from 2005, a largemajority of Australians (80%) continue tobelieve the quality of programming on ABCTelevision is good, and close to three-quarters(72%) believe that ABC Television does a\"good job\" in terms of the number of showsit provides they personally like to watch. As found in previous years, communityperceptions about ABC Television are farmore positive than perceptions aboutcommercial television. Compared with results from the 2005 survey, there have been few changes among thedifferent segments of the community. Amongyounger people, aged under 25, opinions tendto oscillate year to year, and in 2006 this isevident among those aged 14-17, wherethere has been a decline in the proportionwho think that the quality of programmingon ABC Television is very good (down from 18% to 9%), which follows an increase from8% to 18% in the previous year. There hasbeen an accompanying rise in the proportionwho think ABC Television does a poor job interms of the number of shows they personallylike to watch (up from 17% to 29%) followinga decrease in this measure the year before.Notwithstanding similar oscillation among18-to-24-year-olds, there is more of a trend apparent in this age group, with a graduallyincreasing number who feel ABC Televisiondoes a poor job at providing content theypersonally like to watch. Compared with 2004 there has been an increase in the number of women (up from23% to 28%) and people in country andregional areas (up from 20% to 25%) whobelieve the quality of ABC Television is very good. Compared with 2003, there was alsoan improvement for ABC Television in doinga very good job in terms of the number of shows people like to watch among thoseaged 35-49 (up from 19% to 25%) and amongheavy ABC TV viewers (up from 32% to 38%). 36 The 2006 survey included a new measure ofpeople's opinions of Australian-made showson ABC Television and commercial television. 37 Consistent with other measures relating totelevision, opinions were more favourable forABC Television than commercial television,although the relativity between the two wasfar closer on this measure. The proportion ofthe community who rated ABC Television asgood on this dimension was 74% comparedwith 60% for commercial television. While10% rated the ABC as poor, one third (32%)rated commercial television as poor. Radio Consistent with previous tranches of thesurvey, the majority of Australians (63%)believe the ABC provides good quality radioprogramming. Similarly, six-in-ten (59%)Australians believe ABC Radio does a \"goodjob\" in terms of the amount of programmingit provides to which they personally liketo listen. There is a greater similarity in beliefs about ABC Radio and commercial radio thanbetween ABC Television and commercialtelevision.

It is noted that commercial radio tends to attract a higherlevel of criticism than ABC Radio. Year-on-year there are few changes in attitudes towards ABC Radio. Of note areimprovements in attitude among those aged18-24. Countering a trend apparent since2002 among this age group, there has beenan increase in the number believing that thequality of programming on ABC Radio isgood (up from 55% to 67%), and comparedwith 2004, in the number who think it is very good (up from 10% in 2004 to 23% in 2006). Other improvements in attitude were also recorded among those defined as heavy ABCRadio listeners, where the number believingthat ABC Radio does a good job in terms ofthe amount of programming it provides thatthey like to listen to rose (up from 92% to 97%,including the number who feel it does a verygood job, (up from 39% to 49%). 38 Among those aged over 50, there was adecline in the number believing the quality of programming on ABC Radio is good (downfrom a peak of 68% in 2005 to 61% in 2006,with the level this year being more consistentwith earlier tranches of the survey). It is alsonoted that the decline was not accompaniedby a rise in negative opinion, but a higher levelof uncommitted response ( don't know / neither rose from 28% to 34%). Online Almost one-in-four Australians (23%) claim to ever access the ABC website. Nine-out-of-ten (89%) of these ABC Online users believe that the quality of the site'scontent is good and the same proportionsay the site does a \"good job\" in terms of the amount of content it provides on thingsthey use it for.Consistent with results from the 2005 survey, eight-in-ten (79%) ABC Online users believethe website adds to the value and relevancethat the ABC has for them. The results alsoindicate that the website contributes to theconsumption of other ABC content, thatpeople are using the additional contentavailable, and the website extends the life of ABC content in a variety of ways. For example, in 2006, 45% of the site's users claim to have seen something on the sitethat prompted them to either watch ABCTelevision or listen to ABC Radio. Many ABCOnline users also claim to have consumedABC Television, video or Radio content directlythrough the website.

This remains apparentboth among people in capital cities and peoplein country/regional areas. The vast majorityof Australians (79%) believe the ABC does agood job covering country/regional issues,compared with 43% for commercial media.

Local communities across thecontinent use the ABC to connect with one another, the nation and the world. The ABC has Local Radio stations in 51 regional centres, as well as in ninemetropolitan cities. They have a local focus,reflecting the lives and interests of theirrespective audiences. In times of crisis, such as a bushfire or flood in the area, these stations provide vital information that has the potential to save lives. In regional areas, the small local broadcasting teams not only instigate special events fortheir listeners but also play significant rolesin the daily life of their communities. A team of 70 specialist rural reporters is deployed across the country with one reporterat each regional radio station and one or twoin each capital city. In some outposts, suchas Kununurra in Western Australia, the ruralreporter is the only staff member. All therural reporters travel constantly around theirregions and, in remote areas, often stay onproperties and present outside broadcastsfrom them. Their close contact with peoplemeans that these ABC staff members have a personal knowledge and understanding of the issues that affect those who live andwork in the region.

In 2005-06, ABC staff in all ABC branches continued to take part in a diverse range ofcommunity activities from the CommonwealthGames Queen's Baton Relay and NAIDOCWeek celebrating Indigenous Australia to the NSW Premier's Spelling Bee and theWESTECH Field Days in Barcaldine. Community welfare The ABC's contribution to community welfareis ongoing and takes many forms. Twoexamples in 2005-06 were special Local Radio broadcasts dedicated to road safetyawareness, especially at holiday time, andthe triple j Hack program's coverage of drug usage, which won the program a NationalDrug and Alcohol Award for Excellence inMedia Reporting. Local and national charities receive staff and on-air support. In 2005-06, theseincluded 891 ABC Adelaide's Charity QuizNight in aid of the children's charity Kids Future Kids ; the NSW Knit In for Wrap with Love; Tasmania and Victoria's Giving Tree Christmas collections; ABC Queensland'ssupport for the Salvation Army ChristmasAppeal; the Victorian Blanket Appeal and, in Western Australia, ABC South Coast's freeChristmas Concert at the Albany Town Hall. Two educational and information opportunities made available by the ABC included theWomen in Engineering Scholarships, whichwere offered in all states and territories, andABC Science Outreach, which presentedpublic events featuring ABC Science peoplein locations all over Australia.48 Emergency coverage In 2005-06, the ABC, particularly through Local Radio, provided extensive emergencycoverage to audiences affected by floods in the NSW Far North Coast and CentralWest regions and Katherine and Top Endcommunities in the Northern Territory;bushfires on the New South Wales CentralCoast and in Victoria's Stawell region andcyclones in Western Australia, Queenslandand the Northern Territory. The ABC in all states and territories, except New South Wales, have Memoranda ofUnderstanding with their emergency serviceproviders. Local Radio is the prime platform of delivery and, in many areas, the onlyplatform for delivering emergency serviceinformation in a comprehensive and timelymanner. New South Wales has a complex setof emergency providers that cannot becovered in a single MOU. A Memorandum of Understanding with the Rural Fire Serviceis in place and others are being negotiated. In April 2006, following the ABC's extensive coverage of a spate of emergency situations,the ABC created the new position of Manager,Emergency Services and CommunityDevelopment. This role manages and reviewsnetwork emergency broadcasting procedures,services and training and liaises with externalemergency service organisations. A notableexample of the vital community role of theABC in times of emergency is the coverageand subsequent support given when category5 Cyclone Larry smashed into the far northQueensland coast and Southern Tablelandsin March 2006. From the Saturday morning,ABC Tropical North (Mackay), 630 ABC NorthQueensland (Townsville) and ABC Far North(Cairns) began alerting their listeners to theadvance of the cyclone. These stations andABC Western Queensland (Longreach)broadcast through the night with updates of the cyclone's progress.After the main Cairns FM translator went off air in the early hours of Monday, a specialHF satellite service via Radio Australia'sShepparton facility was provided for thoseunable to receive the AM service from Cairns.Broadcasts were also heard via the GordonvaleAM transmitter south of Cairns and livestreaming online from the Cairns studios.When the cyclone passed, ABC Local Radiostaff began a series of outside broadcastsfrom affected communities. The ABC set up a temporary outpost in Innisfail, whichcontinued to service the area for somemonths. Operating out of the same buildingthat housed the recovery task force, andusing a generator that enabled broadcasts to continue even when power supplies wereunpredictable, the outpost gave a direct linkto sources of information that were vital tothe rebuilding and recovery of the area. In May, the ABC mounted a free concert as a tribute to and morale booster for the peopleof Innisfail and surrounding communities.Managed by ABC Corporate Marketing andhosted and presented by ABC Queenslandand Local Radio, the all-day concert featuredentertainment for all ages. The previous dayABC Radio's AMprogram team as well as ABC Far North Queensland's Morning program broadcast from the main street of Innisfail. The ABC community spirit was also in evidence in June 2006 when ABC Riverina in Wagga Wagga organised a working bee to provide help to local landowners affectedby the January and February bushfires.Over 100 listeners volunteered and the ABCRiverina team coordinated their assignmentto 27 properties, as well as presenting fouroutside broadcasts from different locations. ABC in the Community continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0649 At 30 June 2006, the ABC employed 4 345 full-time equivalent staff members\u2014or justover 5 000 people\u2014who worked together tosupport, develop, produce, present and deliverprograms to its audiences in Australia andoverseas. The Corporation's staff work at over100 different locations (63 offices and 41 shops)around Australia and in 14 overseas bureaux. The ABC aims for its workforce to broadly reflect the diversity of the Australiancommunity. It has a gender balance of 51%men and 49% women, 1.2% of its employeesare Indigenous Australians and a further 11%are from non-English-speaking backgrounds.People with a disability represent 10%of the workforce. Developing ABC Staff The ABC is committed to improving andsustaining high levels of professionalism and practice across the Corporation. In 2005-06, the ABC continued to provide a wide range of skills-developmentopportunities for staff. This year, 60 557hours of structured training were provided.In many cases, this formal training resultedin qualifications for staff. The ABC issued 28 full qualifications, 95 Statements ofAttainment, which is a total of 494 units ofcompetency in accordance with nationally-accredited training standards. Management development is a priority for the ABC and a number of programs havebeen put in place to build a cohort of ableprofessionals with the skills and attributesconsidered critical to the ABC's future. Thisyear, the ABC expanded its programs tocater for managers at three distinct stagesof their management careers: entry-level,experienced and executive. The pilot ABCNew Managers' Program was launched in November 2005. So far, more than 50managers have participated in this program. The ABC Experienced Managers' Programwas launched in late June and will be pilotedin August 2006. A further 20 senior executivesparticipated in the successful LeadershipDevelopment Program, bringing the totalnumber of participants to 50 since theprogram began in 2003. To ensure that the ABC has well-trained technical experts for the future, developmentof the Entry Level Technologist (ELT)recruitment and training program began in2004. The program aims to introduce entry-level staff to the Technical Services areaswith the skills and knowledge required tomaintain and support broadcast equipmentand systems, as well as broader knowledgeof the ABC business, policies and procedures.In 2005-06, six recruits from the NorthernTerritory and Victoria successfully completedall the available programs of the first year of the three-year course. Creating a Positive Workplace Environment In October 2005, as part of its ongoing commitment to provide a work environmentthat is free from bullying and harassment, theABC engaged human resources consultancyfirm IHR Australia to conduct an independentreview of the Corporation's Anti-BullyingPolicy and related procedures. IHR's reportfound that bullying is not perceived to bewidespread or part of the wider cultureat the ABC, and that there has been earlysuccess in addressing bullying issues sincethe implementation of the Anti-BullyingPolicy. Notwithstanding these findings, thereport contained 25 recommendations toimprove execution of the ABC's policy andrelated mechanisms and procedures. TheABC accepted all of the recommendations. A comprehensive case management system, CaseTrack , was implemented to ensure efficient and consistent management ofmisconduct and performance issues.ABC People50 ABC People continued ABC Staff Numbers (Full-Time Equivalent) 05001 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 3 000Retail StaffTechnologistSenior ExecutiveProgram MakerAdmin/ProfessionalABC Staff by Job Group 2005-06 0 1 000 2 000 3 000 4 000 5 0002005-062004-052003-042002-032001-022000-011999-001998-991997-981996-97 4 887 4 177 4 134 4 293 4 116 4 260 4 321 4 244 4 298 4 345 Radio 20.4%Television 8.7% News and Current Affairs 17.7% Production Resources 20.7%Enterprises 5.4% Business Services 8.1% Human Resources 2.3%Technology and Distribution 8.7%Corporate Strategy and Communications 2.6% International Broad casting 2.4% New Media and Digital Services 3.0%ABC Staff by Division 2005-06ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0651 CaseTrack addresses some of the recommendations in the IHR bullying report and will ensure improved casemanagement across the Corporation. The ABC completed roll-out of its mandatory \"Creating a Better Place to Work\" program toraise staff awareness of conflict resolution,bullying, discrimination and harassmentpolicies and contribute to a more positiveworkplace culture. At June 2006, just over97% of the ABC's workforce had undertakenthe training. Further workshops have beenscheduled for staff who have yet to receivethe training and for new employees. Participation in the program contributed to the high percentage of employees whoregistered their knowledge of the relevantpolicies in the IHR review of the ABC'sAnti-Bullying Policy. The Corporation recognises that supporting work/life balance and flexibility is animportant element of achieving a positiveworkplace environment. This is reflected in Corporation-wide plans, policies andinitiatives. Awareness of work/life balanceissues is included in training, performancemanagement assessment and broaderconditions of service and the ABC hasprovided its staff with increased access toinformation and resources on the subject.This approach resulted in the ABC being a finalist in the Gold Award-Public SectorCategory of the ACCI/BCA National Work and Family Awards 2005. The ABC was alsoranked in the top 25 Australian organisationsthat participated in the Work/Life Initiatives: The Way Ahead 2006 Benchmarking Study . Indigenous Employment Initiatives ABC policy is that its workforce should include a minimum of 2% Indigenous staffrepresentation. In 2005-06, Indigenous staffrepresented 1.2% of total (1.3% in 2005).While a number of new Indigenous employeescommenced during the year, this was offset by the departure of employees on completionof fixed-term contracts and others who leftto take-up specialist Indigenous positionsin other organisations. The ABC continued to pursue a number of initiatives to raiseawareness and build the level of Indigenousstaff representation. These include theIndigenous Staff Conference, Indigenous StaffScholarship Awards and the ABC's Indigenousadvisory group, the Bonner Committee. The Corporation's biennial Indigenous Staff Conference was held in September 2005 inCairns, Queensland, and was attended by 46 ABC delegates. Conference proceedingsfocused on employment issues, programmingand cultural protocols. The event coincidedwith an Indigenous Careers Day at DjarrugunCollege, which attracted over 400 students. The third Indigenous Staff Scholarship Awards were presented during NAIDOCWeek 2005 to two employees from NewSouth Wales. These scholarships providecareer development opportunities andencourage retention of Indigenous employees. In April 2006, the Bonner Committee co- ordinated an inaugural forum at the ABCUltimo Centre in Sydney, which showcasedthe Corporation's Indigenous programs andstaff as a means of raising awareness ofthem across the organisation. In recognition of the ABC's continuous implementation of Indigenous employmentinitiatives, the Corporation received a nationalDiversity @Work Award for \"Employment and Inclusion of Indigenous Australians\" inOctober 2005 in the category of organisationswith over 1 000 employees. Occupational Health and Safety Safety is an important issue for the ABC,which is committed to the National OHSStrategy (2002-12) and to achieving a 40%reduction in injuries, zero fatalities and52 better return-to-work outcomes following injury. The ABC, its managers, supervisorsand employees are responsible andaccountable for safety and are expected to adhere to a variety of legal instruments,guidance documents, best practices and theABC OHS Agreement 1998. The Agreement is between the ABC, its employees andtheir representatives. In 2005-06, the ABC continued to pursue improvements to its OHS managementsystems. Initiatives included operational riskmanagement training, whole-of-life plantand equipment safety management guidance,electrical safety improvements, a majormanual-handling review in the ProductionResources Division and the safety and securitymanagement of the ABC's involvement atMelbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Further details of the ABC's OHS activities are contained in Appendix 12 (see page 193). Employment Agreements A number of ABC Employment Agreementsexpired during 2005-06. The terms of theseagreements remain in effect while theCorporation negotiates new enterprisebargaining agreements with the relevantunions. The negotiations have been complex,in part because of the need to thoroughlyreview and assess the impact of therecently-introduced WorkChoices legislation. Performance Management Performance Management continues to bean important focus for the ABC. In 2005-06,efforts were concentrated on supportingstaff and managers to effectively engage andparticipate in performance managementthrough provision of one-on-one coaching for line managers, as well as training morethan 380 staff and managers.Knowledge Sharing Cross-divisional stimulus events promotea Corporation-wide focus on the future byencouraging a critical mass of people in theABC to engage in dialogue about changes inthe industry, likely impacts on ABC operations,and future directions and ways of working. In 2005-06, over 500 people participated in a variety of events of this kind, including a Cross Media Production Conference inSydney sponsored by New Media and DigitalServices, and smaller workshops coveringtopics such as podcasting. Similar innovativeevents were also organised in Melbourneand the smaller states. Future Workforce Planning Forward projections indicate that theproportion of Australians in the labour forcewill shrink over the coming decades. Thistrend will reflect both the retirement of thelarge \"Baby Boomer\" generation (peopleborn between 1946 and 1961) and decliningnumbers of younger people entering theworkforce as a result of the relatively lowfertility rates of recent decades. Moreover,the increasingly-rapid rate of change in thedigital media environment is beginning tochange the skills mix required by mediaorganisations such as the ABC. In response to these anticipated changes, ABC Human Resources has begun to develop aholistic workforce planning strategy to ensurethat the Corporation's future organisationalneeds are met. In 2005-06, the Division heldconsultations with ABC stakeholders andundertook comparative research into bestpractice workforce planning in similarorganisations. Based on this research and consultation, Human Resources willdesign a strategy in 2006-07 to address the ABC's needs.ABC People continuedThe ABC's corporate governance system is subject to continuing review and refinement.Poor governance practices in an organisationmay be readily seen to result in under-performance. Yet compliance with \"betterpractice\" governance processes does notalone guarantee strong performance in ademanding industry. For that reason the ABCendeavours to maintain a balanced approachto its performance as a creative broadcasterand its need to comply with the formalobligations of a modern statutory corporation. The success of this balanced approach found acknowledgment in 2005-06 not only in theform of strong audience and communitysupport but also the findings of a Government-appointed ABC Funding Adequacy and Efficiency Review conducted by KPMG (see below). The Government took account of thefindings of this Review in making its decisionto provide additional funding to the ABC forthe 2006-09 triennium. ABC corporate objectives, strategies, policies and activities derive from the requirementsof the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (\"ABC Act\"). Of particular relevance are section 6 of the Act\u2014the ABC Charter\u2014and section 8, which lays out the duties ofthe Board (see page 240). The Act providesfor both the editorial and administrativeindependence of the Corporation, therebyinvesting the Board with considerablediscretion. In acknowledgment of thatindependence, the ABC accepts theobligation to meet the highest standardsof public accountability. Changes to the ABC Board In June 2006, the Parliament amended theABC Act to abolish the position of staff-electedDirector, the first legislative change to theCorporation's governance structure since the Act took effect in 1983. The Minister forCommunications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator the Hon Helen Coonan,said the change was intended to improvecorporate governance. She described theposition of staff-elected Director as ananomaly among Australian Governmentagency boards that gave rise to concernsabout conflicts of interest and the effectivefunctioning of the ABC Board. The ABC Chairman, Donald McDonald, said in a public statement that amendments tothe Act were a matter for the Governmentand ultimately the Parliament. Mr McDonaldsaid he had worked with three staff-electedDirectors, each of whom had sought to makea contribution to the Board. \"Inevitably therehas been a tension between the expectationsplaced by others on their role and theirestablished duties as directors of acorporation\", he said. The interests of staffand the ABC's audiences would continue to be among the main concerns of the Board. On 15 June 2006, Senator Coonan announced the reappointment of Mr McDonald as ABCChairman for six months until 31 December2006 (his second, five-year term was to haveconcluded on 24 July 2006). The Ministersaid the reappointment would provide aconsistency of leadership during a transitionalperiod following the appointment of MarkScott as Managing Director. The Ministeralso announced the appointment of two newnon-executive Directors for five-year terms\u2014bringing the Board up to full strength for thefirst time since early 2005. Board Governance The Board held twelve meetings during2005-06, including two special meetings in January 2006. Details of the six BoardCommittees and Board members' attendancesat meetings are provided in Appendix 4(page 188). ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0653 Corporate GovernanceDuring the year, Directors continued to place considerable emphasis on the role and performance of the following Board Committees: Audit and Risk Committee (four meetings) ABC Advisory Council Committee (three meetings) Editorial Policies Committee (three meetings) Executive Remuneration Committee (two meetings). Each Committee is entitled to the resources and information it requires, including directaccess to employees and advisers. SeniorExecutives and other selected staff are invitedto attend Committee meetings. A quorum of a Committee is at least two members.Following each Committee meeting, generallyat the next Board meeting, the Chairmanof each Committee provides a verbal report.Committee minutes are tabled at Boardmeetings. The performance of Committeesis discussed and reviewed, initially withineach Committee, and then as part of theBoard's performance review. The Board's Editorial Policies Committee continued work on a review of the 2002edition of the ABC Editorial Policies . This is the principal document of direction andguidance for all ABC program productionand media services. Under section 8 of the ABC Act, the Board exercises specificresponsibilities reflected in the Editorial Policies . These include a duty to ensure the independence and integrity of theCorporation, that news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objectivejournalism, and to develop codes of practicerelating to programming matters.KPMG Funding Adequacy and Efficiency Review The Corporation welcomed a decision by the Government\u2014originally at the suggestion of the ABC Board\u2014to engage independentconsultants to review the adequacy of itsfunding and the efficiency with which it usedthat funding. Undertaken by KPMG, thisbecame one of the most comprehensiveexternal performance reviews of theCorporation in several decades, uniquely so in its focus on financial management and funding. At 30 June 2006, the Government had not released publicly the KPMG report, which it dealt with in the context of the 2006-07Budget process. Specifically the Governmenttook account of the report when consideringthe ABC's Triennial Funding Submissionfor the 2006-09 period. The Government'sdecision to provide the ABC with a total of$88.2 million of additional funding over thenew triennium appeared to reflect the generallyfavourable conclusions of the Review. Thisadditional funding was significant but not the entire amount requested in the TriennialFunding Submission. An ABC project team convened by the Chief Operating Officer worked throughout 2005 toensure the consultants, when appointed, wouldhave immediate access to comprehensiveand accurate performance information andanalysis. KPMG independently reviewed andanalysed this data, supplemented it andapplied a range of comparative performancebenchmarks to the ABC. The ABC demonstrated that it operated efficiently and effectively, providing a highvolume of outputs and high levels of quality,relative to the funding it received fromthe Parliament. Like other broadcastersinternationally and in Australia, the ABC54 Corporate Governance continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0655 continued to adapt to the challenges of digital media, expanding its service offering.As a public broadcaster with particularCharter-based obligations, the Corporationincurred significant unique costs, including:a geographic spread of television and radiooperations across 60 metropolitan and regionalcentres at a time when commercial mediatended to consolidate their operations;extensive audience complaint and feedbackmechanisms not provided by other broadcastersand comprehensive archiving and libraryservices required in the national interest. During the course of the KPMG Review, the ABC believed the analysis confirmed that its level of Appropriation (including annualindexation) was not adequate to sustain its existing range, quantity and mix ofprogramming and services. This remainedso after taking account of a small number of additional efficiency measures to beexplored further. On 11 May 2006, the Minister wrote to the ABC Chairman to notify him of the Corporation's2006-09 triennial funding arrangements. She asked to receive an annual update of theABC's progress in following up additionalefficiency measures\u2014and a report byOctober 2006 in relation to the Corporation'sproperty holdings. Planning and Performance Reporting The Corporate Plan 2004-07 continued to operate, framed around four high-levelObjectives derived specifically from the ABC Act: contribute to a sense of nationalidentity; engage audiences with relevant andinnovative programs and services; ensurethe ABC's independence, integrity and highstandards; and provide maximum benefit tothe people of Australia. Strategic prioritiesfor the period reflect the Corporation'scontinuing work to position itself for the accelerating transformation of theAustralian media environment.The Board received two performance progress reports during the year, with measurementsat three levels: the overall effectiveness ofthe ABC in providing benefit to the community;the performance of ABC outputs acrossRadio, Television and New Media and DigitalServices; and the achievement of specificactions and targets set for each of theCorporation's 15 strategic priorities. The ABC's performance against the three levels of measurement is set out in theCorporate Plan Summary (page 13) andPerformance Against the Corporate Plan 2004-07 (page 112). Management Structure The ABC's executive management structure is built around four broad streams of activity:content and channel management, strategicpositioning, operational support andrevenue-generating enterprises. The Executive Committee operates as the peak management body of the Corporation,chaired by the Managing Director andconsisting of the Directors of Radio,Television and New Media and DigitalServices; the Director of News and CurrentAffairs; the Chief Operating Officer (who is also the chief financial officer); and the Director of Corporate Strategy and Communications. The Director of Enterprises reports directly to the Managing Director but is not a memberof the Executive Committee. Other Directorsof operational support areas\u2014Technologyand Distribution, Production Resources,Human Resources and Business Services\u2014report to the Chief Operating Officer. In 2005-06, the Corporation changed the reporting arrangements for the Head ofLegal Services who also performs the role of General Counsel. This position previouslyreported through the Chief Operating Officerbut now reports to the Managing Director.The Head of Group Audit reports to the Board Audit and Risk Committee, withadministrative accountability to the ChiefOperating Officer. Risk Management The ABC takes a Corporation-wide approachto risk management. In 2003, the ABCdeveloped strategies in relation to its keyrisks and the operational controls in place to manage them. In February 2006, as part ofa three-year planning cycle, the Corporationundertook a review of these strategies todetermine whether they still applied or ifother risks had emerged, and to identifyappropriate compliance processes. The ABC also engaged an independent review of the Corporation's risk management andcompliance framework. It included anassessment against better practice and riskmanagement standards (such as AS/NZ:4360 and COSO\u2014the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission).It also considered the impact of proposedamendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 on risk management compliance. The results of the review wereto be provided to the Board's Audit and RiskCommittee meeting in July 2006. The Comcover 2006 Risk Management Benchmarking Survey of 124 governmentagencies rated the ABC's risk managementpractices as \"comprehensive\" and one of thehighest amongst the Commonwealth agencies. The annual workers' compensation premium paid for 2005-06 totalled $3 141 600. Thiscomprised a 24% increase on to higher average claim costssince 2002-03, despite the number and costof claims having decreased in 2004-05. Thisresulted in an increase in the ABC's 2005-06premium rate in 2004-05 to The ABC's 2005-06 premium rate of 1.14% of its total salary costs comparesfavourably with a Commonwealth average of 1.77% of salary costs. As a result of lowerclaims and costs than originally forecast, theABC received a $609 000 rebate from Comcare. Further information is provided in Appendix 12 (page 193). Internal Audit ABC Group Audit aims to provide anindependent internal audit service thatcontributes to the achievement of theCorporation's objectives and providesassurance to the Board and management. In 2005-06, it completed 41 audits in accordance with the 2005-06 Strategic AuditPlan, was in discussion with managementabout two audits and had another 13 inprogress. As in previous years, Group Auditused a combination of in-house staff andoutsourced contractors so as to have accessto the most appropriate expertise. The unitalso provided advice and guidance on goodgovernance, policies and controls, as well as advice on a number of projects andinitiatives of the Corporation. Group Audit conducted staff awareness sessions in each capital city, some regionallocations, during staff induction programsand to Divisional conferences and meetings.The purpose was to improve knowledge andawareness of ABC policies and procedures,fraud, the responsibility for controls and the ABC's Confidential Hotline. Further information is provided in Appendix 5 (page 189).56 Corporate Governance continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0657 ATO Tax Audit In 2005-06, the Australian Taxation Office undertook an audit of the ABC's Taxation-Business Activity Statements. The ATO issuedthe ABC with a favourable report. It notedthat the ABC fully complied with all GSTobligations, charging and remitting the correctGST amounts and claiming the correct InputTax Credits. The ATO noted there were noissues for further action. Symphony Orchestras As reported in 2004-05, the FederalGovernment commissioned Mr James Strong to chair a review of the effectivenessand efficiency of orchestral services inAustralia. Seven orchestral companiesaround Australia operated as wholly-ownedsubsidiaries of the ABC, governed by separateboards and with sources of funding separatefrom the ABC. The Strong committeepublished its report, A New Era: Orchestra Review Report 2005 , on 14 March 2005. The Report recommended that the ABC's symphony orchestra companies bereconstituted as public companies limited by guarantee. Throughout 2005-06, theABC participated in a cross-agency workinggroup to assist Government with theimplementation of the Strong Committee'srecommendations. The ABC anticipates that six of the seven symphony orchestracompanies will be divested from the ABC in the 2006-07 financial year. The seventhcompany, Symphony Australia, will be woundup. It is likely that a new shared-servicescompany, with no connection to the ABC, willthen be constituted to provide ongoing servicesto the other six orchestra companies. Annual Report Awards For the third successive year, the ABC AnnualReport received a Gold Award in the 2006Australasian Reporting Awards. The ABC's2004-05 Annual Report fulfilled the fivequalitative criteria, including overall excellencein annual reporting.Election Coverage Review Committee When a state, territory or federal election is called, the ABC convenes an ElectionCoverage Review Committee. The task of theCommittee is to review ABC election contentduring coverage of the campaign to ensurethat ABC Editorial Policies requirements of accuracy, impartiality and balance are met.The Committee also oversees the Boardgrant of party election broadcasts to eligiblepolitical parties, and reviews any complaintsabout election coverage. In addition tointernal monitoring of editorial performanceduring campaign coverage, the Committeeengages an external research company to track ABC coverage. The results of this analysis are reported to the ABC Board and published on the ABC website. Audience Contacts All complaints received by the ABC, such asconcerns about factual inaccuracy, lack ofbalance, bias or inappropriate content, arereferred to the Audience and ConsumerAffairs unit of the Corporate Strategy andCommunications Division. Audience andConsumer Affairs is independent of ABCprogram areas and investigates all writtencomplaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC's Editorial Policies , Code of Practice or Charter. The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programmingand policy enquiries. In 2005-06, the ABC received over 165 000 audience contacts, a 3% decrease on 2004-05.This total included 50 329 letters and emails(a 9% decrease) and 115 321 calls toswitchboards in state and territory capitalsand particular ABC programs and services (a 1% increase). 1 1Combined audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs, News and Current Affairs and the ReceptionAdvice Line (phone, letter and email).Key concerns reflected in the audience contacts this year included the decision to take The Bill off air on Saturday nights for eight weeks from August to October 2005,which generated 1 035 written and telephonecomplaints, and changes to the schedulingof an Enough Rope interview with the former Opposition Leader and author, Mark Latham,which resulted in 744 complaints. The ABCalso received 1 705 contacts regarding thevarious series of Doctor Who broadcast. The ABC's coverage of the 2006 Tasmanian and South Australian State Election campaignsresulted in 164 audience contacts, of which149 were complaints. Of these, 143 complaintsrelated to program standards and scheduling, while four complaints alleged party politicalbias, one complaint alleged inaccuracies andone complaint alleged a lack of balance. Of the total 27 187 complaints received, 1 991 were claims of party political or other bias,645 alleged lack of balance and 1 281 wereclaims of factual inaccuracy. These complaintsrelated to a broad range of ABC programsand services. During 2005-06, Audience and Consumer Affairs finalised 8 708 written complaints, of which 500 (5.7%) were upheld.

Since January 2003, the ABC has published a quarterly Public Report on Audience Comments and Complaints , in order to increase transparency and accountability of the ABC complaints process. The reportprovides summaries of audience contactsand upheld program complaints finalised byABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and allreviews finalised by the ABC's ComplaintsReview Executive. It is published on the ABC website. As outlined in the ABC Editorial Policies , the ABC endeavours to respond to all audiencecontacts within 28 days. Between 1 July 2005and 30 June 2006, ABC Audience andConsumer Affairs responded directly to 24 298 audience contacts. Of these, 22 218(91%) received responses within 28 days. Complaints Review Executive The Complaints Review Executive (CRE)provides an additional level of internal reviewfor complainants who express dissatisfactionwith ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs'response to their complaint. This does notpreclude the complainant seeking externalreview via the Independent Complaints ReviewPanel or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Independent of both ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs and all program units, theCRE has broad scope to review the content inquestion, the manner in which the complaintwas originally handled by Audience and Consumer Affairs, and to determine whetherthe ABC acted appropriately. All CRE findingsare reported to the ABC Board. In the year ending 30 June 2006, the CRE reviewed a total of 35 complaints, comparedwith 41 in 2004-05. Of these, Audience andConsumer Affairs referred 29 for review aftera complainant was dissatisfied with theinitial response to their complaint. Two ofthese matters were upheld in part or full. The CRE also adjudicated on six disputes between Audience and Consumer Affairs andABC Divisions over responses to complaints,compared with three in 2004-05. In four ofthe disputed matters, the CRE found in favourof Audience and Consumer Affairs, leading to the initial complaints being upheld, whileon the other two disputes, the CRE found infavour of the Divisions concerned and thecomplaints were not upheld. A summary of the CRE's findings is published quarterly on the ABC website. Independent Complaints Review Panel For persons not satisfied with the ABC's response to a written complaint, the ABCBoard has appointed the IndependentComplaints Review Panel (ICRP) to undertakeindependent review of complaints at no costto the complainant. The ICRP is empoweredto adjudicate on matters related to seriousbias, lack of balance, unfair treatment orfactual inaccuracy. It has three membersexternal to the ABC. Two of the three membersare nominated by two independent externalbodies (the Communications Law Centre andthe St James Ethics Centre). The ABC Boardappoints a Convenor of the ICRP and twopanellists selected from the nominations. In the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, the Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP)received 20 requests to review complaints, of which six were accepted for review. Thefourteen requests not accepted for review either did not constitute serious cases of factual inaccuracy, bias, lack of balance orunfair treatment, or involved matters outside of the ICRP's area of responsibility. The Panel concluded reviews of seven complaints during the year, none of whichwas upheld. In each case, a report of thePanel's findings was made available on the ABC website. As at 30 June 2006, one reviewwas in process. Appendix 18 (page 200) provides details of matters reviewed by the ICRP and thedecisions of the Panel. Australian Communications and Media Authority Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by theCorporation's Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response or the handling of their complaint or theadjudication of the ICRP may seek review from the Australian Communications andMedia Authority (ACMA). During 2005-06, the ACMA finalised its investigations into ten such matters (19 in2004-05). In each of these cases, the ACMA's investigation concluded that there had beenno breach of the ABC's Code of Practice . Transmission Failures As the national broadcaster, the ABC is expected to provide uninterrupted radio and television services. During 2004, specific incidents relating to disruptions of commercial power systems at transmitter sites operatedby Broadcast Australia (BA), the ABC'stransmission provider, led to a series of initiatives to better ensure continuity of service. In 2004-05, BA instigated a number of measures to improve the reliability of itsemergency power plants (EPPs) used asstand-by power systems, including anaudit of all EPPs to review their designconfigurations and asset condition. Thiswork continued in 2005-06, with theimplementation of a comprehensiverefurbishment and upgrade program ofworks. The program included the replacementof a number of EPPs, mains switchboardsand associated control systems, voltage regulation and earthing systems. BA revisedservicing, maintenance and testing practices,as well as implementing various telemetryimprovements to enhance remote monitoringand control capabilities. As a result of these initiatives, the annual performance of emergency generatorsused as stand-by power systems improved from 96% in 2004-05 to 97.5% in 2005-06. A target of 98% is projected for 2006-07. While BA and the ABC are working toimprove the reliability of services duringpower failures, increasing numbers ofcommercial power f ailures across the country during 2005-06, particularly in regional areas, led to a rise in outages at transmission facilities where there are no emergency power plants. The ABC andBA are continuing to seek improvements to mains power reliability from state andterritory utility companies. The performance of the transmission and distribution network is reported in detail in the Operations Group section (page 99).60 Corporate Governance continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-0661 Completion of Annual Financial Statements On July 2006, the Audit and Risk Committee endorsed the signing of the 2005-06Financial Statements and the AustralianNational Audit Office (ANAO) issued anunqualified audit opinion.

Digitisation of the ABC's unique audio and video media archive commenced this year.Networked systems for storing and managingthe digitised content were installed in allstate capital locations, and are based aroundStorage Area networks and Tape Libraries. A conversion centre was established inthe Ultimo Centre, with the task of initiallyconverting 60 000 hours of analog contentover the 2005-07 period. The network ofdigital libraries has established a platformfor preservation and online access to existingand future archival material. In 2005-06,Business Services Archives DigitisationProject, a key component of the ABC'sdigitisation strategy, preserved 12 000hours of radio and video in digital format. The ABC commenced several major capital projects in 2005-06. The Corporation is inthe process of replacing its Television Newsand Current Affairs acquisition, editing andreplay facilities, including cameras, edit andplay-out technology. The replacements andintroduction of new and integrated technologieswill provide greater efficiency, and in thecase of the new cable-less cameras, bettercompliance to stringent ABC operationalhealth and safety requirements.Supporting Public Broadcasters in the Region The ABC continued to strengthen ties with public broadcasters in the Asia Pacificregion through various training anddevelopment projects. In addition to smaller-scale training activities in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Fiji funded byvarious donors, the ABC continued to delivertwo major AusAID-funded projects duringthe year: the Papua New Guinea MediaDevelopment Initiative and the SolomonIslands Broadcasting CorporationCapacity-Building Initiative. The Papua New Guinea Media Development Initiative Phase I, designed and delivered inconjunction with Radio Australia, providedassistance to the National BroadcastingCorporation (NBC) of PNG. Two new programs,a social history program and a serial dramaaimed at development issues, were producedand put to air by NBC. The digitisation ofNBC's archive began, and assistance withthe development of corporate planning andeditorial guidelines was delivered. The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC) Capacity-Building Initiative was devisedin association with the Regional AssistanceMission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Theproject enables two ABC staff members towork with SIBC management and staff,providing advice and training on productionwork and management. In addition, a numberof infrastructure projects designed to boosttransmission, improve production facilitiesand introduce new information technologysystems were delivered. Notably, the projectenabled the SIBC to deliver its first livecoverage of the Solomon Islands electionsand their troubled aftermath.Operations Group continued104 ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2005-06 Performance as Reported by Broadcast Australia ABC Broadcast Australia Distribution Transmission Total Network Total \"On-Air\" No. of Network Network Availability Availability ABC Service Transmitters (See Note 1) (See Note 2) (See Note 3) (See Note 4) 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 99.93 99.57 99.72 99.82 ABC Notes 1. ABC Distribution Network (included contracted service providers): The ABC distribution network ensures that programs are delivered from the studio to local transmitters throughout Australia. It includes outsourced satellite and terrestrialbroadcast distribution services from telecommunications carriers such as Optus and Telstra. This measure has beendesigned to be consistent with the contracted transmission targets and represents the aggregated performance of morethan 60 agreements the ABC has in place to distribute programs. The ABC's overall performance in this area improved in2005-06 relative to 2004-05. The failure of the Optus satellite distribution service affected the performance of triple j and digital television. Note: Local Radio, which serves remote and regional Australia, is reliant on non-redundant Telstra broadcast lines. These performed below expectation due to an increase in the time taken to repair a small number of lines failures to remotesites in 2005-06. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The reported transmission network performance, provided by Broadcast Australia, was close to the targets in most cases, but declined in 2005-06 relative to2004-05. Performance of the Local Radio network and the services in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Tasmania were below their targets. The installation of new digital television services and the introduction of improved monitoring equipmentat transmission sites throughout the year resulted in the disruption of existing transmission services. Cyclones in Queensland,the Northern Territory and Western Australia and commercial power and stand-by power system failures adversely affectedthe reported network performance. The new digital television services performed above the target, but below expectation, declining relative to 2004-05. Broadcast Australia have included the performance of services that were subject to unexpected interference issues that were notanticipated during the planning and construction phases of a number of the new services this year. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages of the overall network. It reflects the delivered service availability to the audience, regardless of the source of the fault or interruption. In practice, during the majority of reported outages, a reduced level of service continued to be provided. This accounts for the difference between the contracted and overallnetwork performance. Overall, these statistics show the delivery of services to ABC analog network audiences in 2005-06 declined relative to 2004-05 . Except for South Australia and Western Australia, all networks and states performed below expectation. Digital televisionservices' performance remained well below expectation, due in part to resolution of post-commissioning adjustments to a large number of the new services. Three new digital television services in Victoria were switched off due to interference,affecting overall performance. The data does not include all instances where Broadcast Australia operated services below minimum performance levels. The ABC is endeavouring to monitor and rectify such services. 4. Total \"On-Air\" Availability shows the direct impact of all outages experienced by the audience, where some level of service continued to be provided throughout faults and maintenance. That is, where there was no total loss or denial of service tothe majority of the audience. In 2005-06, Broadcast Australia reported an overall increase in the total period services were\"off\", in comparison to 2004-05. Reported digital television performance deteriorated in comparison to the previous year. The Northern Territory was affected by the loss of the three inland High Frequency (HF) Vertical Incidence Local Radio services that were switched off for long periods to facilitate the installation of new transmitters for these services. Atemporary replacement service was provided from the Broadcast Australia HF transmission facility at Shepparton in Victoriaduring most daylight hours over this period.Gary DawsonActing Director of Corporate Strategyand Communications Gary Dawson has been Acting Director of Corporate Strategy and Communications since March 2006 and is the Head of Strategy andDevelopment for the Division.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Corporation and the consolidated entity, and thatcomply with Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , Accounting Standards and other mandatory financial reporting requirements in Australia. The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records andinternal controls that are designed to prevent and detect fraud and error, and for the accountingpolicies and accounting estimates inherent in the financial statements. Audit Approach I have conducted an independent audit of the financial statements in order to express an opinionon them to you. My audit has been conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit OfficeAuditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards, in orderto provide reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of materialmisstatement. The nature of an audit is influenced by factors such as the use of professionaljudgement, selective testing, the inherent limitations of internal control, and the availability ofpersuasive, rather than conclusive, evidence. Therefore, an audit cannot guarantee that all materialmisstatements have been detected. While the effectiveness of management's internal controls over financial reporting was considered when determining the nature and extent of audit procedures, the audit was not designed to provideassurance on internal controls. I have performed procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial statements present fairly, in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , Accounting Standards and other mandatory financial reporting requirements in Australia, a view which is consistent with my understanding of theCorporation's and the consolidated entity's financial position and of their financial performanceand cash flows.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS140 Independent Audit Report The audit opinion is formed on the basis of these procedures, which included: examining, on a test basis, information to provide evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; and assessing the appropriateness of the accounting policies and disclosures used, and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors. Independence In conducting the audit, I have followed the independence requirements of the Australian NationalAudit Office, which incorporate the ethical requirements of the Australian accounting profession. Audit Opinion In my opinion, the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and theconsolidated entity:(a) have been prepared in accordance with Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 ; and (b) give a true and fair view of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's and the consolidated entity's financial position as at 30 June 2006 and of their performance for the year then ended,in accordance with: (i) the matters required by the Finance Minister's Orders; and(ii) applicable Accounting Standards and other mandatory financial reporting requirements in Australia.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the \"Corporation\" or \"ABC\") and the consolidated financial statementsof the Corporation, its controlled entities and the entities it controlled from time to time duringthe period, are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. Thesepolicies have been applied consistently by all entities in the consolidated entity. The financial report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2006 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 27 July 2006. 1.1 Basis of Accounting The financial statements are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and are a general purpose financial report. The statements have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) (being the Commonwealth Authority and Companies (Report of Operations) Orders 2005 (Financial Statements for reporting periods ending on or after1 July 2005) ); Australian Accounting Standards issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period; and Interpretations issued by AASB and Urgent Issues Group (UIG) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's and consolidated entity's Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Equity have been prepared on an accruals basis and are in accordance with thehistorical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities, which, as noted, are at fairvalue. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the resultsor the financial position. The financial report is presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless disclosure of the full amount is specifically required. Derivative financial instruments and financial assets which are held for trading are measured at fair value. Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Corporation's and consolidated entity's Balance Sheet when and only whenit is probable that future economic benefits will flow and the amounts of the assets or liabilitiescan be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under agreements equallyproportionately unperformed are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard.Liabilities and assets that are unrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments andthe Schedule of Contingencies (other than unquantifiable or remote contingencies, which arereported at note 14). Unless alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard, revenues, gains and expenses are recognised in the Corporation's and consolidated entity's Income Statementwhen and only when the flow or consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and canbe reliably measured. 1.2 Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions Significant Accounting JudgementsIn the process of applying the accounting policies listed in this note, the Corporation has madethe following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significantimpact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements: The fair value of land and buildings has been taken to the market value of similar properties as determined by an independent valuer.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS150 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions No accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causinga material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next accounting period. 1.3 Statement of Compliance The financial report complies with Australian Equivalents to International Financial ReportingStandards (AEIFRS). This is the first financial report based on AEIFRS and comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2005 have been restated. Management applied the exemption provided in AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards which permits entities not to apply the requirements of AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosures and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the financial year ended 30 June 2005. These standards apply from 1 July 2005 and as a result no restatement of prioryears comparatives are required for changes under these standards. Reconciliations of AEIFRSequity and profit for 30 June 2005 to the balances in the 30 June 2005 financial report are detailedin note 1.32. The Corporation has elected to early adopt AASB 119: Employee Benefits (December 2004) in line with FMOs. The following standard and amendments were available for early adoption but have not been applied by the ABC in these financial statements: * Application date is for the annual reporting periods beginning on or after the date shown in the above table. The ABC plans to adopt the above in the 2006-07 financial Disclosure and Presentation , AASB 1: First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards , AASB 1023: General Insurance Contracts , and AASB 1038: Life Insurance Contracts AASB 1: First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards , and AASB 139: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Disclosure and and Measurement , AASB 1: First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards , AASB 4: Insurance , AASB 1023: General AASB 1038: Life Insurance Contracts AASB 1: First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards AASB 7: Financial Instruments: DisclosuresApplication date*1 January2006 1 January 2006 1 January 2007 30 June 2006 1 January 2007Nature of impending changeAmends AASB 139, AASB 1023and restrict value profitor loss and makes consequentialamendments to AASB 1 andAASB 132.

Investments in controlled entities are carried in the Corporation's financial statements at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Controlled entities have annual reporting periods ending 31 December. Accounts of the controlled entities are prepared for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 for consolidation using accountingpolicies which are consistent with those of the Corporation. Control exists where the Corporation has the capacity to dominate the decision making in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so the controlled entity operates to achievethe objectives of the Corporation. The controlled entities of the Corporation include seven independent orchestral companies as detailed in note 20. The companies have been incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 and are each governed by an independent Board of Directors. Each company is audited annually bythe Auditor-General. The effects of all transactions and balances between the entities are eliminated in full. Details of controlled entities are contained in note 20. 1.5 Taxation The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive since the year ended 30 June 2000 up to and including 30 June 2006. Other controlled entities are exempt from income tax by virtue of being cultural organisations established for the encouragement of music, and are charitable institutions.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS152 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.5 Taxation continued The Corporation and controlled entities are subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT) and goods and services tax (GST). The following controlled entities are subject to payroll tax: Adelaide Symphony Orchestra Pty Limited; Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra Pty Limited. Goods and Services Tax Revenues, gains, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where theamount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In thesecircumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.The net amount of GST recoverable from the ATO is included as a current asset in the Balance Sheet.Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a gross basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATOare classified as operating cashflows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority. 1.6 Foreign Currency Transactions Both the functional and presentation currency of the Corporation and its subsidiaries isAustralian dollars ($). The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains andlosses on cash flow hedges held at 30 June 2006 are taken to equity. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amountspayable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian currency at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 1.7 Derivatives The Corporation has elected to apply the option available under AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards of adopting AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 July 2005. Outlined below are the relevant accounting polices for derivative financial instruments and hedging, applicable for the years ending 30 June2006 and 30 June 2005. Accounting policies applicable for the year ending 30 June 2006 The Corporation uses forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreigncurrency fluctuations. Forward currency contracts are initially recognised at fair value on thedate on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently revalued to fair value. Forwardcurrency contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilitieswhen their fair value is negative.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS153 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.7 Derivatives continued Any gains or losses arising from hedges in the fair value of forward currency contracts, except for those that qualify as cash flow hedges, are taken directly to profit or loss for the year. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular riskassociated with a recognised asset or liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the riskmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includesidentification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the riskbeing hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsettingthe exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedgedrisk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair valueor cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have beenhighly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when aforecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of thenon-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminatedor exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amountspreviously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the relatedtransaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the Income Statement. Accounting policies applicable for the year ending 30 June 2005 The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts whereby it agrees to buy or sell specifiedamounts of foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined exchange rate. The objective is tomatch the contract with anticipated future cash flows from sale and purchases in foreign currenciesto protect the Corporation against the possibility of loss from the future exchange rate fluctuations. Forward foreign exchange contracts were recognised at the date the contract was entered into. Exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts were recognised in net profit exceptthose relating to hedges of specific commitments, which were deferred and included in themeasurement of the sale or purchase. When a purchase or sale was specifically hedged, exchange gains or losses on the hedging transaction arising up to the date of purchase or sale and costs, premiums and discounts relativeto the hedging transaction were deferred and included in the measurement of the purchase orsale. The exchange gains or losses are held as an asset or liability in the Balance Sheet until the underlying transaction is affected. 1.8 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes specified in the Appropriation Acts relevant to the Corporation ispresented in note 21. Any intra-government costs included in the figure 'net cost to Budgetoutcomes' are eliminated in calculating the actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operatepredominantly in one industry and in one geographical area, Australia.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS154 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.9 Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; the seller retains no managerial involvement nor effective control over the goods; the revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow to the entity. Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of the goods and services tax upon delivery of the goods and servicesto customers. Revenue from rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date. Revenue is recognised when: the amount of revenue, stage of completion and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits with the transaction will flow to the entity. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Receivables for goods and sales, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due less any provision for bad and doubtful debts. Collectability of debts is reviewed atthe balance date. Provisions are made when the collectability of the debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method as set out in AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . Revenues from Government Amounts appropriated for Departmental output appropriations for the year (adjusted for anyformal additions and reductions) are recognised as revenue, except for certain amounts thatrelate to activities that are reciprocal in nature, in which case revenue is recognised only when it has been earned. Appropriations receivable are recognised at their nominal amounts.Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordancewith the agreement. Income from disposal of non-current assets is recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. 1.10 Grants The Corporation and its controlled entities receive grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation and controlled entities to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues isrecognised to the extent the services or facilities have not been provided or eligibility criteriahave not been met. 1.11 Bills of Exchange Premiums or discounts are amortised through the Income Statement each year from the date of purchase so that investments attain their redemption value by maturity date and income isrecognised on an effective yield basis.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS155 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.11 Bills of Exchange continued Any profits or losses arising from the disposal prior to maturity are taken to the Income Statement in the period in which they are realised. These assets are intended to be held to maturity and arecarried at cost adjusted for discounts and premiums. 1.12 Employee Benefits As required by the FMOs, the Corporation has early adopted AASB 119 Employee Benefits as issued in December 2004. Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extentthat they have not been settled. Liabilities for short-term employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119 Employee Benefits ) and termination benefits due within twelve months are measured at their nominal amounts. The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. Noprovision has been made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leavetaken in future years by employees is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during servicerather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave for the Corporation has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, Professional Financial Consulting Pty Ltd. The estimate of the present valueof the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. The liability for long service leave for controlled entities represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the employers resulting from employees' servicesprovided up to the balance date. Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the PublicSector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) or the PSS Accumulation Plan (PSSap). The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Commonwealth. The PSSap is a defined contribution scheme. The liability for superannuation benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Commonwealth and is settled by the Commonwealth in due course. The Corporation and controlled entities make employer contributions to the Commonwealth at rates determined by the actuary to be sufficient to meet the cost to the Commonwealth of thesuperannuation entitlements of the employees. From 1 July 2005, new employees are eligible to join the PSSap.The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2006 represents outstanding contributions for the final fortnight of the year.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS156 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1.

Finance leases effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownershipof leased non-current assets. An operating lease is a lease that is not a finance lease. Inoperating leases the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. The net present value of future net outlays in respect of surplus space under non-cancellable lease agreements is expensed in the period in which the space becomes surplus. Lease incentives taking the form of 'free' leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expenseand reduction of the liability. 1.14 Borrowing Costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. 1.15 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-termdeposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents arerecognised at their nominal amounts. 1.16 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrading orenhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. 1.17 Transactions by the Commonwealth as Owner Appropriations From 1 July 1999, the Commonwealth Budget has been prepared under an accruals framework.Under this framework, Parliament appropriates monies to the Corporation as revenueappropriations, as loan appropriations and as equity injections. The full amount of appropriations for departmental outputs for the year is recognised as revenue.Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as 'contributedequity' in accordance with the FMOs. Other Distributions to Owners The FMOs require that distributions to owners be debited to contributed equity unless in thenature of a dividend. 1.18 Financial Risk Management The Corporation's activities expose it to normal commercial financial risk. As a result of the natureof the Corporation's business, its internal and Australian Government policies dealing with themanagement of financial risk, the Corporation's exposure to market, credit, liquidity, cash flowand fair value interest risk is considered to be low. 1.19 Investments Investments are measured at their fair value. 1.20 Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities All investments are initially recognised at cost. These investments are classified as held tomaturity. Cash and receivables will be recognised at cost.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS157 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.20 Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities continued As required by AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , forward foreign exchange contracts are deemed as held for trading, gains and losses on these items held fortrading are recognised in the Income Statement except if they are classified as a cash flow hedgewhere they are recognised in equity. Financial assets have been assessed for indicators of impairment (refer note 1.21).Loans and payables are classified as non-trading liabilities and measured at amortised cost. 1.21 Impairment of Financial Assets As prescribed in the FMOs, the Corporation has applied the option available under AASB 1 First-time Adoption to Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standardsof adopting AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement from 1 July 2005 rather than 1 July 2004. Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance date.Financial assets carried at cost which were not held to generate net cash inflows, were assessed for indicators of impairment. If such indicators were found to exist, the recoverable amount ofthe assets was estimated and compared to the assets carrying amount and, if less, reduced tothe carrying amount. The reduction was shown as an impairment loss. There were no indicators of impairment identified at 30 June 2006. 1.22 Receivables Receivables are carried at nominal amounts due less allowance for losses on receivables.Trade debtors are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due. The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the probability of recovery of those debtsand taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. 1.23 Trade Creditors Trade creditors and accruals are recognised at their nominal amounts, being the amounts atwhich the liabilities will be settled. Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods andservices have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). Settlement is on normal commercial terms. 1.24 Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised in the Balance Sheet but are discussed in the relevant schedule and note 14. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or asset, or represent an existing liability or asset in respect of which settlement is not probableor the amount cannot be reliably measured. Remote contingencies are part of this disclosure.Where settlement becomes probable, a liability or asset is recognised. A liability or asset isrecognised when its existence is confirmed by a future event, settlement becomes probable(virtually certain for assets) or reliable measurement becomes possible. 1.25 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includesthe fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Financial assets areinitially measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS158 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.25 Acquisition of Assets continued Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 1.26 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment Asset Recognition ThresholdPurchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Balance Sheet. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisitionexcept where they form part of a project or group of similar items which are significant in total. Basis of Revaluations Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at fair value, being revaluedwith sufficient frequency such that the carrying amount of each asset is not materially different,at reporting date, from its fair value. Valuations undertaken in each year are as at 30 June.Revaluations are at fair value. Fair values for each class of asset are determined as shown below.Asset Class Fair Value Measured at: Land Market selling priceBuilding Market selling priceLeasehold improvements Depreciated replacement costInfrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Following initial recognition at cost, valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary, with the assets' fair values as at thereporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movementsin market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of asset revaluation reserve, except to the extent that it reverses a previousrevaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised through profit andloss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit and lossexcept to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the revalued amount. Assets that are surplus to requirements are measured at their net realisable value. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.The Corporation's motor vehicles, shop fitouts and overseas bureaus were revalued in 2002-03. The Corporation's infrastructure, plant and equipment assets, and land and buildings (freeholdand leasehold) were revalued in 2003-04. All asset classes are subject to an independentrevaluation at least every five years. Formal valuations are carried out by an independent qualified valuer.Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimatedresidual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method of depreciation.Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimateduseful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS159 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.26 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment continued Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2006 2005 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold improvements 5 to 99 years 5 to 99 years Infrastructure, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years 3 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation and amortisation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in note 6C. Non-Current Assets Held for Sale Non-current assets held for sale are stated in the Balance Sheet at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 1.27 Impairment of Non-Current Assets All non-current assets except: inventories; assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations ; are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment. At the reporting date, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired. Where indications of impairment exist the asset's recoverable amount isestimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less thanits carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Wherethe future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generatefuture cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset,its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. For 2005-06 and 2004-05 there were no indicators of impairment identified. 1.28 Intangibles The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use. These assets are carried at cost.These are assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amount of impaired assets must be written down to the higher of its net market selling price or depreciated replacement cost. All software assets were assessed for indicators of impairment as at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005. Software to the value of $nil (2005 $261 000) was written down. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives.Useful lives: 2006 2005 Software 3-6 years 3-6 yearsANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS160 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.29 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and replacement cost. Television programs areproduced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and productionoverheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated toprograms are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Produced Programs External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offsetagainst production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Balance Sheet. The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics\u2014100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies\u2014straight-line over three years from completion; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; and Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. The costs of programs produced for Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur.Write-downs of Inventory Merchandise InventoryThe amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventoryare recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of anyreversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value, willbe recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense in the periodin which the reversal occurs. Inventory Held for Distribution The amount of any write-down of inventories to current replacement costs and all losses ofinventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amountof any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in current replacementcost, will be recognised as a reduction in the expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. 1.30 Loans Loans from government and bank loans are recognised at their principal amounts. Interest isexpensed as it accrues. Loans will be classified as non-trading liabilities and measured at amortised cost. 1.31 Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economicbenefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of theamount of the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS161 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.32 Impact of Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AEIFRS) Major Policy Changes (a)Reclassification of cash and cash equivalents Under AASB 107 Cash Flow Statements , due to a definitional change to cash, investments with maturities less than 90 days are classified as cash. A reclassification was required as at 1 July2004, increasing Cash by $35 753 000 and decreasing Receivables by $35 753 000 on transitionto AEIFRS. There was no impact on the 2004-05 financial year. (b)Employee benefits Under AASB 119 Employee Benefits , annual leave which is expected to be paid out or taken more than 12 months from balance date must be discounted to present value, previously nodiscounting was allowed. The 2003-04 financial report noted that AEIFRS may require themarket yield on corporate bonds to be used as a discount rate. The AASB has decided that adeep market in high quality corporate bonds does not exist and therefore national governmentbonds will be referenced. The discounting of greater than 12 months annual leave results in a change to our group accounting policy and an adjustment as at 1 July 2004 on transition to AEIFRS to reduce theannual leave provision by $2 106 000 and increase accumulated surplus by $2 106 000. Furtherto this adjustment an increase to annual leave provision of $306 000 and decrease in net profitof $306 000 for 2004-05 was required. (c) Borrowing costs Under AASB 123 Borrowing Costs , borrowing costs are to be either recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, or where they are directly attributable to the acquisition,construction or production of a qualifying asset they may be capitalised as part of the costof the asset. The FMOs require all borrowing costs to be expensed. On transition to AEIFRS, an adjustment was required as at 1 July 2004 to reflect this change as follows: Reduce Non-current assets\u2014land and buildings $ 133 000 Reduce Non-current assets\u2014software intangibles $ 268 000Reduce Accumulated provision for amortisation $ 191 000Reduce Accumulated surplus $ 3 678 000Increase Asset Revaluation Reserve $ 3 468 000 A further adjustment for the 2004-05 financial year was required:Reduce Non-current assets\u2014land and buildings $ 765 000 Reduce Accumulated provision for amortisation $ 42 000Reduce Accumulated provision for depreciation $ 10 000Reduce Profit $ 713 000 (d)Non-current assets held for sale Under AASB 5 Non-current assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations , a non-current asset will be classified as held for sale if its carrying amount is to be recovered principallythrough a sale transaction rather than through continued use. The asset will be measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale will be presented separately from other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. This is a change in accounting policy.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS162 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.32 Impact of Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AEIFRS) continued As at 1 July 2004, the ABC held one asset which met the criteria at the date of transition, which was the Gore Hill property. On transition at 1 July 2004, the ABC reclassified $34 000 000 from Property, Plant and Equipment and reflected $33 400 000 as Assets Held for Sale and reduced accumulated surplusby $600 000 being the estimate of future costs to sell at the date of transition. During the 2004-05 financial year, the Gore Hill property was sold. Proceeds of $35 000 000 were received and $1 337 000 were incurred as costs to sell the property. On disposal of the asset,under AEIFRS a profit from sale of $263 000 is shown in the Income Statement, while underAustralian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP) a net loss of $337 000 is reflected. (e)Financial instruments Management has applied the exemption provided in AASB 1 First-time Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards which permits entities not to apply the requirements of AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Disclosures and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the financial year ended 30 June 2005. The FMOs stipulate that the exemption is to be applied. The standards applyfrom 1 July 2005. The FMOs require the Corporation to designate all financial instruments traded in markets as 'held at fair value through profit and loss'. Such instruments must be measured at fair value,with changes in fair value being recorded as income or expense. Under AEIFRS the term 'Impairment losses' replaces references to provisions for doubtful debts. Impairment losses are recognised under AEIFRS only when there is objective evidence that afinancial asset or group of assets is impaired. Prior to AEIFRS the Corporation recorded aprovision for doubtful debts when the collection of the debt or part thereof is judged to be lessrather than more likely. The Corporation has reviewed each financial asset in line with theimpairment provisions of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and has determined that no material adjustment to carrying amounts is required. Financial assets and liabilities are to be accounted for as 'held at fair value through profit and loss' or available-for-sale where the fair value can be reliably measured (in which case, changesin value are initially taken to equity). Fair values will be published prices where an activemarket exists or by appraisal. Cash and receivables are measured at cost. Financial assets, except those classified as 'held at fair value through profit and loss', are subject to impairment testing. (f) Revenue disclosures in relation to the sale of non-current assets Under AEIFRS, the income recognised in relation to the sale of non-current assets is the netgain on the sale. This is in contrast to the previous AGAAP treatment where gross proceedsfrom the sale were recognised as revenue and the carrying amount of the assets sold wasrecognised as an expense. There is no net impact on profit or loss, only a presentation impact. (g)Reclassification of other income Under AEIFRS, foreign exchange gains are classified as other income. This is in contrast to the previous AGAAP treatment where such items were classified as revenue. There is no netimpact on profit or loss, only a presentation impact.ANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS163 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued 1.32 Impact of Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AEIFRS) continued (h)Impairment The policy on impairment of non-current assets is stated at note 1.27. The effect as a result of AEIFRS to the Corporation and controlled entities is the requirement to assess at each balance date if there is any indication that a non-current asset may beimpaired. If there is an indication of impairment, measurement of recoverable amount mustbe conducted. Impairment losses are accounted for as expenses for assets measured at cost,or revaluation decrements for assets measured at fair value. At the date of transition to AEIFRSand 30 June 2005 there were no indicators of impairment.

The Corporation and its controlled entities are dependent upon direct and indirect appropriations of monies by Parliament. In excess of 78.1% of normal activities are funded in this manner, and without these appropriationsthe Corporation and its controlled entities would be unable to meet their obligations.

Financial Instruments (Consolidated) continued B. Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the net fair values: Cash, receivables, payables and short term borrowings The carrying amount approximates the net fair value because of the short term maturity. Investments The carrying amount for non traded investments has been assessed by the Directors based on the underlyingnet assets, expected cash flows and any particular special circumstances of the investee as approximatingnet fair values. Long-term borrowings The net fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based oncurrent interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. Forward exchange contracts The net fair values of forward exchange contracts are taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance datecalculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

Credit Risk Exposures Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties to financial instruments fail to perform as contracted. The consolidated entity has no significant exposures to any concentrations of credit risk.Financial Assets The consolidated entity's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class ofrecognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of allowance for doubtful debts, of those assets asindicated in the Balance Sheet. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The consolidated entity has no material concentration of credit risk withany single counterparty and, as a matter of policy, only transacts with financial institutions that have a highcredit rating. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by thenet fair value of the contracts, as disclosed. D. Hedging Instruments Specific HedgesThe net gain of $37 860 (2005 unrecognised gain $2 846) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases from July 2006 to October 2006 has been recognised at balance date in the Statement of Changesin Equity.

The ABC's performance in this area is measurable through: Implementation of a comprehensive OHS management system. Incident statistics. Performance against the National Targets. ABC workers compensation premium rates. ABC OHS Management System The ABC has in place a range of strategies to ensurethe continued improvement of its OHS ManagementSystem including: ABC WorkSafe Return to Work module to enable the ABC to better manage the return to work ofill and injured employees. Development of ABC A-Z of Safety online advice for managers, supervisors and other employeesto manage operational risks. A National OHS Management Group to coordinate approaches to address common and cross-divisional safety issues. Continued roll-out of an OHS risk management training course tailored to specific divisionalhazards and hazardous operations. Online and CD OHS Induction Course to provide better safety induction accessibility for ABCemployees in all work locations. Individual role-based safety accountabilities included in employee job plans. Centrally-funded national approach to introducing full compliance testing and tagging electricalequipment. Inter-divisional planning for a coordinated approach to the safety and security of events inwhich the ABC participates or that it organises ormanages. This was illustrated by the successfulcompletion of the high-risk Peking to Parisexpedition\u2014without major injuries orcompensation claims. Increased attention to design and commissioning of ABC vans, trailers and other equipment tobetter meet OHS requirements. CRS Australia engaged to undertake a manual- handling review and to develop training to reducemanual-handling injuries in the ProductionResources Division. New Managers' Training Program to support and encourage good management behaviours. Response to the IHR Australia Bullying Review. Discussions between Human Resources (HR) and Group Audit are seeking the commencement of auditsof ABC OHS management systems in high-riskdivisions in 2007. These follow-up audits will assistthe ABC in measuring its progress against its auditresults in 2002 and to evaluate the OHS management system's ability to meet national targets. Compensation and Rehabilitation Management continues to: Expedite access of employees to necessary services and support. Promote appropriate management of claims. Promote early and durable return-to-work outcomes through the implementation ofrehabilitation programs. Collect and analyse incident data to identify trends within the workplace. Control claims costs through the implementation of return-to-work programs to reduce \"lost time\". Incident Statistics 2005-06 A total of 298 incidents were logged in ABC WorkSafeto 30 June 2006. This represented a significantincrease from the 127 OHS-related incidents reportedfor 2004-05. However, the earlier figures predateABC WorkSafe. It was anticipated that incidentreporting would rise due to the accessibility andusability of the new incident-reporting system. Comcare issued the ABC with one Prohibition Notice and one Improvement Notice under Sections 46 and47 of the Act for Studio 81 Darwin. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) continued to provide and receive wide support to and from ABCmanagers, staff and families, with 6.18% (annualised)of employees/employee families utilising this servicein the half year to 31 March 2006. At 30 June 2006, 95 OHS claims for 2005-06 had been made, of which 47 were for body stressing, and theircost to date is $334 923.34. This compares with 95claims at 30 June 2005 which led to 119 claims for2004-05, of which 53 were for body stressing, and a cost to date of $753 001.09. Tw enty-two Comcare claims were accepted for Oc cupational Overuse Syndrome (OOS) type injuries, while two Comcare claims were accepted for psy chological injury. An analysis of the ABC's claims for worker's compensation shows that the main types of injuriescontributing to the ABC's worker's compensationpremium are body stressing, slips, trips and fallsand mental stress. These injuries are spread acrossall divisions, although some divisions, given the typeof work they do, are more prone to certain types ofinjuries than others. These injuries also have thelargest cost impact on the ABC, with injuries in themental stress group having the greatest average cost.However, the average cost of mental stress claimsfor the ABC is lower than the Commonwealth averagefor the same period ($98 755.89 vs $102 939.34).Nonetheless, the ABC is moving Health and SafetyANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES194 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 intervention to help prevent and minimise the costs and occurrence of these injuries. National Targets The ABC is committed to meeting national OHStargets by 2012 of a 40% reduction in incidents,injuries and time off work, and zero workplacedeaths. In 2004-05, the trend in the ABC's number of claims for workplace injury and disease resultingin a fifth day of incapacity suggested these targetswere achievable. However, in 2005-06, there was a17.4% increase in the number of claims, particularlyfor body stressing. To arrest this increase and worktowards achieving the OHS target, the ABC hascommissioned a major review of manual handling by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service.The ABC will introduce measures reflecting therecommendations of that report in 2006-07. Thetrend for the ABC is similar to the trends for allAustralian Government jurisdictions. ABC Workers' Compensation Premium Rates The ABC's workers' compensation premium (payable to Comcare) for 2005-06, rose by nearly 27% to$3 985 100. It follows a 24% increase in 2004-05.These premium increases are attributable to: The number and cost of injury claims suffered in 2005. A penalty amount of $98 700 due to a revision of the 2005-06 premium based on developmentof ABC claims for injuries against all agencies. An increase of $18 million in the ABC salaries budget, of which the new premium is a percentage. The ABC's premium rate for 2006-07 is 1.12% of its total salary costs. This represents a 0.05%improvement from 1.17% (2005-06) and is substantiallylower than the Commonwealth static average of1.77% of salary costs in both 2005-06 and 2006-07. Accidents / Dangerous Occurrences /Investigations In 2005-06, the ABC undertook a range of tests and investigations regarding a cluster of breast cancercases at its Toowong site in Brisbane. No link to theworkplace was identified. Unfortunately another staffmember at the ABC's Toowong site was diagnosedwith breast cancer, bringing the total to nine reportedcases in the past 12 years. The ABC has soughtfurther professional advice and at this point in timethere has been no evidence found to support a claimthat the workplace is responsible for the cancers. Compliance with Performance Reporting Framework The ABC is required to report on its performance in meeting the Commonwealth Disability Strategyunder two of the designated core government rolesof Employer and Provider. Employer Employment policies, procedures and practicescomply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . The ABC Disability Action Plan, which forms part of the 2003-06 Equity and Diversity Management Plan(EDMP), includes strategies for recruitment, selection,training, development and support. Strategies includedin the EDMP are linked to the Corporation's divisionalplans and retain the target of 5% representation ofstaff with disabilities of the total workforce. The ABC's representation of non-casual employees with disabilities was 10.1% at 30 June 2006, comparedwith 10.4% in 2005.The ABC's Equity and Diversity Policy includes references to people with disabilities and the ABChas a general policy for access and equity for peoplewith disabilities. Recruitment and selection guidelinesadvise on selection processes, merit selection,and avoidance of stereotyping, assumptions anddiscrimination.

Relevant plans, policies and guidelines are available to staff on the ABC's intranet site. State HumanResources Division managers have access toinformation on external disability organisations,contacts and resources to assist managers and staff. The ABC joined the Comcare Interagency Job Placement program that facilitates the redeploymentof injured workers, with accepted Comcare claims,between federal government agencies where thereis medical advice that the employee can no longerwork at their own agency.Appendix 12\u2014Occupational Health and Safety 13\u2014Commonwealth Disability StrategyANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES195 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 The News and Current Affairs Division has provided a job opportunity as part of a program arranged byan external disability agency. The ABC continued to improve access for both employees and visitors with disabilities. This wasachieved by an upgrade of the ABC's Mt Isa premises,the relocation of its Shepparton premises, the tenancyrefit on level eight of its Collinswood premises andthe stage 1 upgrade of its Darwin premises, all ofwhich included improvements for employees andvisitors with disabilities, including general accessand toilets. Upgrades for toilets were undertaken in the Toowong Radio and Television Buildings. Information on the needs of staff with disabilities during workplace emergencies was provided to theABC's property area for consideration. The ABC has selected a product that enables staff with vision impairment to utilise the full functionalityof the new on-line radio program-making andbroadcast facility. The ABC hosted two forums with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission at the ABC UltimoCentre in Sydney during the year. These provided theopportunity for consultation and feedback from arange of public and private sector organisations on a discussion paper on discrimination in employmenton the basis of disability. The ABC is a member organisation of the Australian Employers' Network on Disability, which providesresources, seminars and information sharingopportunities in regard to disability employment. Recruitment information for potential job applicants is available in accessible formats on request. Accessible formats are available for potential job applicants and were provided on request during theyear by mail, fax, email and online. The turnaroundfor responding to accessible format requests wasusually the same as for other requests. Advertisementshave also been provided on the Internet. The ABC did not receive any requests from applicants with disabilities for formats other than thosealready available. Agency recruiters and managers apply the principle of reasonable adjustment. Information on the principles of reasonable adjustment was provided to managers and those responsible forrecruitment. Both training and information wereprovided to ABC State Human Resources managersand Health and Safety Representatives. Research wasundertaken and provided to State Human Resources managers on recent case law about disabilitydiscrimination, reasonable adjustment and meetingthe inherent requirements of work duties. The EEOdata collection form included a question aboutindividual staff needs and adjustments in the workplacefor staff with disabilities. Those employees whorequested assistance were followed up and assistedindividually with their needs. A number of staff were accommodated with equipment, facilities and flexible work arrangementsduring the year. Training and development programs consider the needs of staff with disabilities. The ABC's Disability Action Plan includes strategies on training, development and support. Through itsperformance management system, the ABC ensuresthat all staff, including people with disabilities, havetheir training needs identified and addressed. As aRegistered Training Organisation, the ABC is requiredto meet standards of training and accommodationinclusive of people with disabilities. ABC PropertyServices has been consulted about the need foraccessible training rooms and facilities. Training and development programs include information on disability issues as they relate to the content of the program. The ABC's mandatory training program, Creating a Better Place to Work, continued to be deliverednationally during 2005-06. A total of 4 237 staff,including executive directors and managers, havebeen trained since its introduction.

This site includesinformation on what discrimination, harassment andbullying mean; the responsibilities of managementand staff; complaint and grievance support andprocedures; access to external complaints mechanismsand the appointment and role of grievance contactofficers. Contact officers receive specific trainingwhen appointed.Appendix 13\u2014Commonwealth Disability Strategy continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES196 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 The ABC's employment agreements include provisions for consultation and settlement of individualgrievances and other disputes, and the performancemanagement system has provision for appeals. A widely-publicised professional counselling service for staff and their families is provided through theABC Employee Assistance Program. Provider Providers have established mechanisms for qualityimprovement and assurance. Several mechanisms assist with quality improvement and assurance within the ABC, such as the ABC'sEditorial Policies and Code of Practice . Importantly, the Editorial Policies cover a range of areas and include program standards on portrayal, labellinggroups or individuals, discrimination and stereotypes,including reference to people with disabilities andthere is a section on accessibility. The 2006 draftversion of the Editorial Policies includes a new section on the usage of the term mental illness andprovides program makers with an external specialistreference for additional information. The ABC Advisory Council also makes recommendations to the ABC Board on programming issues and holdssmall group consultations to obtain community viewson ABC programs and services. Members of theCouncil include people with disabilities.Providers have an established service charter that specifies the roles of the provider and consumerand service standards which address accessibilityfor people with disabilities. A statement of what audiences and customers can expect in their dealings with the ABC is incorporatedin the Service Commitment (page 208). Access for people with disabilities is provided throughcaptioning, accessible television and websites.Guidelines have been developed specifically to makeABC television services more accessible for peoplewho are blind or have a visual impairment or limitedreading comprehension.

Statistics current as at 25 June 2006. The ABC continued to ensure its compliance with the requirements of section 516A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999(\"EPBC Act\"). In 2005-06, the ABC developed a Heritage Strategy for identification and care of heritage property in itscontrol to comply with the requirements of Division5 of the EPBC Regulations 2000, \"ManagingCommonwealth Heritage Places\". In August 2005, the ABC returned its annual National Environment Protection Measures (NEPM)Questionnaire to the Environmental Protection and Heritage Council, retaining its low-risk agencystatus. In October 2005, the ABC lodged its annualtotal Annual Energy Consumption report on the Department of Environment and Heritage online Energy Data Gathering and Reporting(EDGAR) database.The ABC has developed an Environmental Management System (EMS) to manage its impact onthe environment. As part of the EMS implementation,newly-established Environmental and Energy policieswere published internally. At all ABC sites, energyusage was recorded to prepare site profiles by whichto gauge the effectiveness of energy efficiencyinitiatives. In July 2005, the ABC received the reportand recommendations of a waste audit conducted atthe Ultimo Centre in Sydney in June 2005. Followingthat, the Corporation commenced work to identifyappropriate initiatives to reduce its waste to landfill(including recycling). Further waste audits wereconducted at the ABC Offices in Canberra andAdelaide in 2005-06.

These guidesshould be in an easy manageable format and sold toevery overseas tourist and \"grey nomad\" who takesto the road. Director of Radio: The Travellers' Guide has been available for some years. It continues to be updatedannually and sold through ABC Shops and Centresacross Australia. ABC Radio understands that feedbackon the Guide's Z-card format has been positive. Itsells for $1 a piece and is promoted on ABC Radio,particularly during summer holiday periods. R2/3/05 Songs Of Worship Council recommends that ABC Television produceSongs of Worship in Australia , a series of programs for Sunday viewing that celebrate worship in song,using the BBC's Songs of Praise as a template. These programs should allow for the richness and diversityof worship, and not be restricted to big-city churchesand age-old hymns. Director of Television: Planning is underway and a concept has been developed for an Australianequivalent of Songs of Praise . The series is expected to be transmitted in 2006-07. R3/3/05 Podcasting Council recommends that the ABC actively promoteits podcasting services internationally, consistentwith its Charter obligations. Podcasts could betargeted specifically at Australians living, working and travelling overseas, as well as the wider RadioAustralia audiences. The ABC might considerinvestigating whether the Department of ForeignAffairs and Trade (DFAT) could promote ABCpodcasting through its public diplomacy initiatives. Director of Radio: ABC Radio appreciates Council's interest in and support for the ABC podcastinginitiative. There has been strong international interestin the ABC's podcasting service, with 40% of itsaudience based outside Australia. Feedback indicatesthat many of these are Australian expatriates,although a large number of non-Australians are also interested in the content. ABC Radio's science programs\u2014 All in the Mind , Ockham's Razor , Dr Karl and The Science Show \u2014 regularly feature in the Top 100 podcasts in Britainand in the USA. There has been considerable demandfrom Chinese audiences for Radio Australia's English for Tourism program (for Mandarin speakers), which received 38 725 downloads in the secondweek of 2005. ABC podcasts are promoted internationally in worldwide podcast directories such as iTunes andYahoo and cross-promoted on ABC Radio, Televisionand Online. Council's suggestion of investigating the possibility of promoting ABC podcasts through DFAT has meritand will be considered in planning the promotion ofABC podcasts. Director of New Media and Digital Services: The Division actively promotes podcasting servicesinternationally by targeting Australians overseas andseeking the help of DFAT in promoting the services. Website access statistics indicate that in broad terms 40% of podcast downloads are by internationalaudience members, of which a significant proportionof these are presumably Australians living, workingor travelling overseas. Networks and program areasproducing podcasts already actively promote theirofferings via the various podcast portals and gatewaysthat aggregate podcasts, such as through thepopular iTunes application. Council's suggestion that the ABC actively seek the assistance of DFAT to further promote the existenceof ABC podcast services is a good one. R4/3/05 Online Voting Council supports ABC Television's recent promotionof online voting for repeats of favourite episodes ofAustralian Story , as it develops a sense of ownershipAppendix 17\u2014ABC Advisory CouncilANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES199 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 and could enhance audience share through multi- platform access. Council recommends the extensionof this style of promotion to other programs, such as Rage . Director of New Media and Digital Services: Online voting that helps determine output content has beenan important element of ABC online for some yearsnow. ABC Television's The New Inventors features a weekly vote that has a direct impact on the programand its grand final. At the Movies has an annual vote of the best film of the year. There have been votesfor the best film and book which were the basis ofthe television programs My Favourite Film and My Favourite Book . This year Collectors will incorporate voting on audience-submitted collectibles and the outcomewill determine the content of the final episode. Onlinevoting will clearly continue to be one of the optionsavailable to the producers of television websites toenhance the engagement with their audiences. R5/3/05 Hack TV The Advisory Council recommends that the ABCexplore the possibility of migrating triple j's youth current affairs program, Hack , to television. Content and themes could include youth issues and concerns,music/art and \"vox pop\". This would be complementedby an online site carrying viewer polls and blogs. An additional feature might be \"mobile moments\",where viewers would contribute 3-5 minute snapshotsof their lives made from mobile phone images andvideo camera material. Director of Television: ABC Television welcomes the suggestion and advises that development is underwayfor Hack to be incorporated into a new program, jtv, which will begin in mid-2006. jtvwill be a multi-platform collaboration between Television, Radio and NewMedia and Digital Services to create a cross-platform30-minute television series that will be seen on ABCTelevision, ABC2 and broadband. The series will be a focus and forum for younger ABC Television audiences, with extensive interactivecomponents. jtvwill record triple j's weekly \"live at the wireless\" sessions and interviews with local andtouring artists. Another feature of the initiative willbejtv Live , which will record and broadcast new Australian bands. R1/1/06 ABC2: Use of Set-Top Boxes The community seems confused about ABC2. It haslittle understanding of digital television in generaland does not appear to realise that a set-top box isneeded to receive it in the absence of subscriptiontelevision. Little information about set-top boxinstallation or the benefits of digital television is available. To assist potential users of ABC2, Councilrecommends an active public relations campaignexplaining the benefits of digital television withplain-English directions for setting up the necessaryhardware on ABC Online and ABC Television and inABC Shops. Director of New Media and Digital Services: New Media and Digital Services, in cooperation with Strategyand Communications, is undertaking a publicity andmarketing campaign aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of digital television. The campaignfocuses on promoting digital television as offeringaudiences more choice through ABC2, with referenceto other benefits such as better picture and soundquality. It includes a colour brochure, to be distributedthrough all ABC centres, shops and via email in lateMay, as well as a media release to suburban andregional newspapers in late May and an updatedReception website. In addition to this campaign, New Media and Digital Services continues to work cooperatively with industrygroup Digital Broadcasting Australia (DBA) in promotingthe benefits of digital television to Australians. TwoDBA brochures produced in October 2005 with inputfrom the ABC have been widely distributed to thegeneral public. One promotes free-to-air digitaltelevision, while the second provides guidance onhow to connect digital set-top boxes. R2/1/06 Inclusion of the Middle Header in 7pm News Council recommends that the integrity and credibility of ABC Television News be maintained by carefulconcentration on the flow of the presentation.Council considers it important that the ABC Newsmaintains a different tone and style from commercialtelevision news. It encourages the removal of laptopsfrom all news sets. While accepting the inclusion of the mid-header in news bulletins where it recapson main stories, Council views it as an interruptionwhen it refers to upcoming stories. Director of News and Current Affairs: Council's views are noted. R3/1/06 Use of Expert Commentators In light of a perception that expert commentary ispredominantly sought from Americans, especially onRadio, Council recommends that a conscious effortbe made to seek views and expertise from a broaderbase. In particular, Council recommends that suitableAustralian expertise be given preference wheneverpossible. When no suitable Australian expertise isavailable, views should be sought from a wider rangeof sources than at present.Appendix 17\u2014ABC Advisory Council continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES200 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 Director of Radio: ABC Radio disagrees that expert commentary is predominantly sought from Americanson its services. It is more likely that there would be a predominance of Australian expertise, particularlyacross the talk networks\u2014Local Radio, RadioNational and ABC NewsRadio. However, the Division can appreciate how a perception of American predominance might arise, particularlyin recent years when there has been intense globalinterest in US international politics in relation to theevents of 9/11 and the Iraq war. Coverage of the FreeTrade Agreement between the US and Australia hasalso been dominant in coverage over recent years.ABC Radio has covered all these and related issuesthrough wide-ranging expertise which has includedmany American voices, along with Australian andother respected commentators from around the globe. Director of Television: ABC Television seeks to draw from a wide range of experts in its programming,especially focusing on Australian expertise in a givenfield. In the Division's programming, this expertise is most commonly presented in programs such asCompass , Catalyst and Gardening Australia . Director of News and Current Affairs: Council's views are noted.Commendations The ABC Advisory Council commended the followingprograms and publications: Spicks and Specks ; jmag; We Can Be Heroes , including its supplementary website; Reality Bites ; MDA ; Four Corners ; Background Briefing ; Asia Pacific Focus ; Great Artists ; The Chaser's War on Everything ; Radio National Breakfast with Fran Kelly; and Dr Who . Council commended the ABC's coverage of thedeaths of Graham Kennedy and Paul Hester, and of the Northern Territory Elections. The Council also commended: Carole Whitelock for The Long Lunch ; ABC 783 Alice Springs for its local broadcast of the Finke Desert race and sensitivehandling of the fatality that occurred; the Country Hour on its 60-year anniversary; Irene Poinkin and the Standing Committee on Spoken English (SCOSE);Australian Story for its initiative in voting for the best episodes and allowing young people to submitprogram ideas; Peter Goers on Local Radio in SouthAustralia; and Margaret Throsby and CharlesSouthwood on ABC Classic FM. The ABC Advisory Council commended the ABC for its participation in community events, its people forthe presentation of key lectures and communitydiscussions, its participation in writers festivals and ideas festivals, providing people for discussiongroups dealing with community activities and itspodcasting and transcribing of important lectures. The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) investigated complaints from seven people during2005-06. A viewer complained that the Lateline program took an unbalanced and partial view in favour ofLabor policies, had a pre-conceived position opposingthe Federal Government's counter-terrorismlegislation, and showed serious imbalance and used a disrespectful interviewing style withAttorney-General Phillip Ruddock. The Panel dealt with each of these allegations separately, and concluded that none should be upheld. In response to the allegation that Lateline took an unbalanced view, the Panel concluded that the wayin which the information and points of view werepresented in the program was not unbalanced anddid not result in the presentation of a partial view in favour of Labor policies and people. In response to the complaint that the program andpresenter had a pre-conceived position on the issue of counter-terrorism legislation, the Panel consideredthat the questions raised by the program werereasonably based upon available material and raisedpoints of public interest. The Panel did not uphold thecomplaint that the program was, in effect, the resultof a hidden agenda, as alleged by the complainant. In response to the allegation that the interviewing style of the presenter was disrespectful, the Panel statedthat it was \"satisfied that the presenter did, as theprogram aims to do, be 'provocative, challenging and(act as an) intelligent window on today's world.' In thiscontext the Panel believed that the presenter actedappropriately and had regard for the Attorney-General'sposition\". The Panel concluded that the allegeddisrespect and partiality had not been established. A listener complained about an edition of Radio National's documentary program Hindsight entitled \"Papua New Guinea: Nation State or Failed State\",which dealt with the colonisation of Papua NewAppendix 17\u2014ABC Advisory Council continued Review PanelANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES201 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 Guinea. The listener considered that the program was inaccurate in many respects, was seriouslyunbalanced and denigrated Australia's administrationof Papua New Guinea. The Panel accepted the ABC's submissions that the program should be considered against the editorialpolicy requirements for \"factual content\", and thattherefore the requirement for balance did not arise.In relation to accuracy, the Panel was satisfied thatthe passages to which the complainant objected didnot constitute factual material, but were ratherexpressions of opinion or inferences. The Panel'sreport found no breach of the ABC Editorial Policies . A viewer complained that he had been treated unfairly by Stateline (NSW) in the program's examination of a proposed development of theformer Queen Victoria Hospital site in the BlueMountains, and that the program containedinaccuracies and was unbalanced. The Panel found no serious inaccuracies in the program. The Panel noted that a small degree of imbalance was evident, but in view of thecomplainant's own actions in failing to respond toquestions put to him by the program, the Panel wassatisfied that there had been no breach of the ABC Editorial Policies or Code of Practice . The Panel did not believe that the imbalance it observed warrantedany further action by the Stateline program. The complaint was not upheld. A listener complained that coverage of a speech by US President George W. Bush on AM, PMand The World Today had shown bias as it had not mentioned the \"Downing Street Memo\" in relation to the invasionof Iraq. The complainant appeared to believe that theABC had sought to protect the Federal Government'sinterests by not questioning the Government rigorouslyabout the contents of that memo and believed thiswas evidence of the ABC's bias. In determining the merits of the complaint, the Panel focused on the ABC's coverage of President Bush'sspeech at Fort Bragg, which dealt with the war in Iraq.The Panel noted that it was clear that the intentionof the broadcasts complained of was to set out brieflythe main features of the President's speech and torefer to its reception in America. The broadcasts didnot purport to do more than this and clearly did notset out to present any in-depth analysis of the warand the motivations that may have led to it. The Panelwas satisfied that neither the Editorial Policies nor Code of Practice required that the broadcasts in question be more critical of the President's speechand, in particular, did not require reference to the\"Downing Street Memo\". The Panel noted that theABC, in its response, referred to its comprehensive coverage of the Iraq war, provided over several years.This has included references, in various programs to the memo. The complaint was not upheld. A viewer requested review of his complaint about Andrew Denton's interview with Palestinian authorSuad Amiry on Enough Rope . The viewer believed that the program contained an inaccuracy and wasbiased against the Israeli viewpoint. The Panel was satisfied that Enough Rope was not a news and current affairs program comprising \"bothnews and information relating to current events\".Rather, it was essentially an entertainment program.Insofar as the complainant's issues raised the questionof factual inaccuracy in the content of the program,the Panel noted that the Australian BroadcastingAuthority had considered the requirement for accuracyin factual programs, and indicated that for them\"expressions of opinion, implications and inferencesdo not constitute factual content and are not subjectto the requirement of accuracy.\" The Panel wassatisfied that, when the relevant editorial policyrequirements were applied, the allegations made by the complainant were not established, since allfour allegations related to opinions expressed byMs Amiry, which did not attract the factual accuracyprovisions of the Editorial Policies . Therefore the Panel did not uphold any part of the complaint madeagainst the Enough Rope program. The Panel accepted for review a complaint that the ABC had declined to remove a transcript fromthe PMwebsite, which the complainant considered was having a detrimental impact on his professionalreputation. He was also concerned by the ABC'sdecision not to entertain his complaint, on the groundsthat it was received more than six months after thebroadcast of the program. The interview on whichthe transcript was based was broadcast in 1999. The complainant felt that he had been unfairlytreated by the ABC. The Panel accepted that the record of the actual interview with the complainant was no longeravailable, commenting that such a record wouldhave provided definitive evidence of the content andgeneral tone and atmosphere of the interview. Dueto the passing of time and the absence of a recordingof the interview, the Panel felt that it could not cometo any meaningful decisions in regards to thecomplaint. In considering the complainant's requestfor the transcript to be removed from the website,the Panel acknowledged the ABC's submissionsthat archived transcripts of current affairs programs,such as PM, provide a valuable public record of the issues of the day, and that they should not be Appendix 18\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel contANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES202 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 removed except for compelling and significant reasons. The Panel found no such reasons in the present case.In particular, it found that no relevant breach of theEditorial Policies or Code of Practice had been established and consequently, it declined to recommendthe removal of the transcript from the ABC website. A viewer made three separate complaints of bias against interviewer Kerry O'Brien on The 7.30 Report . The viewer considered that interviews with PrimeMinister John Howard and then Environment MinisterDr David Kemp were more aggressively undertakenthan an interview with then Opposition Leader MarkLatham. The viewer cited three interviews on The 7.30 Report : an interview between Mr O'Brien and Dr David Kemp MP broadcast on 15 June 2004, aninterview between Mr O'Brien and Prime MinisterJohn Howard, broadcast on 5 October 2004 and an interview between Mr O'Brien and the thenOpposition Leader Mark Latham, broadcast on 7 October 2004. The viewer also complained thatseveral letters of complaint sent to The 7.30 Report had not been responded to. In relation to the interviews with Dr Kemp and the Prime Minister, the ICRP found that Mr O'Brien wasnot biased or aggressive and that both interviews wererobust. In relation to the interview with Mr Lathamthe Panel found that Mr O'Brien was not biased inhis handling of the interview with the then Leader ofthe Opposition. In comparing this interview with theinterview with Prime Minister Howard, the Panelformed the view that Mr Latham did not receivefavourable treatment and therefore there was no biasin these two segments. The Panel also found that itwas not possible to determine why the complainant'sletters were not received and suggested someimprovements for the processing of future complaints. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (\"FOI Act\") gives the public the right to access documents heldby the ABC. Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act givesthe ABC an exemption in relation to material that isprogram related.During the past year, the ABC received five requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. One request was granted in full, one in part, and three were refused. One FOI matter from 2004-05 is stillbefore the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Introduction The ABC's place in the media industry is distinctive.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , gives the Corporation particular responsibilities suchas the provision of an independent news service.The ABC Charter (section 6 of the Act) sets out thefunctions of the Corporation and can be found on the Internet at<http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/ABCcharter.htm >. The ABC Act guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation's programs. The ABC holds thepower to make programming decisions on behalf of the people of Australia. By law and conventionneither the Government nor Parliament seeks tointervene in those decisions. This Code of Practice applies to ABC Radio and Television, Online and other emerging new mediaservices. Some parts of the Code apply to aparticular medium such as Section 8: TelevisionProgram Classifications. Where this is the casematerial is marked accordingly.The word 'program' is used throughout the Code and covers programs broadcast on ABC Radio andTelevision, content provided on ABC Online andthrough emerging new media services. This Code of Practice summarises the major principles which guide ABC programs. The ABC Editorial Policies 2004 sets out programming policies and guidelines in full. The ABC's Editorial Policies can be found at <www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/edpols.htm >. 2. General Program Codes The guiding principle in the application of the following general program codes is context. What is unacceptablein one context may be appropriate and acceptable inanother. However, the use of language and imagesfor no other purpose but to offend is not acceptable. The code is not intended to ban certain types of language or images from bona fide dramatic orliterary treatments, nor is it intended to excludesuch references from legitimate reportage, debateor documentaries. Where appropriate, audiences willbe given advance notice of the content of the program.Appendix 18\u2014Independent Complaints Review Panel cont Appendix 19\u2014Freedom of Information Appendix 20\u2014ABC Code Broadcast ProgramsANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES203 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 2.1 Violence Particular care must be taken in the presentation or portrayal of violence. The presentation or portrayalof violence must be justifiable, or else the materialshould not be presented. In news, current affairs and information programs, violent events should never be sensationalised orpresented for their own sake. In drama programs, the aim is not to see how much violence will be tolerated, but how little isnecessary to achieve honest ends without unduedramatic compromise. 2.2 Language Variations of language favoured by different groupsof Australians are valid and have their place inprograms. On occasions, the language of one groupmay be distasteful to another. Use of such languageis permitted provided it is not used gratuitously andprovided the language can be justified in the contextof, for example, news or current affairs reporting,fiction, documentary, dramatisation, comedy or song lyrics. 2.3 Sex and Sexuality Provided it is handled with integrity, any of thefollowing treatments of sex and sexuality may be appropriate and necessary to a program: it can be discussed and reported in the context of news, current affairs, informationor documentary programs; it can be referred to in drama, comedy, lyrics or fictional programs; and it can be depicted, implicitly or explicitly. 2.4 Discrimination To avoid discrimination, programs should not use language or images in a way which is likely to disparage or discriminate against any person or section of the community on account of race,ethnicity, nationality, sex, marital or parental status,age, disability or illness, social or occupationalstatus, sexual preference or any religious, culturalor political belief or activity. The requirement is notintended to prevent the presentation of materialwhich is factual, or the expression of genuinely-heldopinion in a news, current affairs, information orfactual program, or in the legitimate context of a humorous, satirical or dramatic work. 2.5 Privacy The rights of individuals to privacy should be respectedin all ABC programs. However, in order to provideinformation which relates to a person's performanceof public duties or about other matters of publicinterest, intrusions upon privacy may, in some circumstances, be justified. 3. Specific Program Codes 3.1 Children's Programs While the real world should not be concealed fromchildren, special care is to be taken to ensure programschildren are likely to access, unsupervised, will notcause alarm or distress. 3.2 Religious Programs Religious programs include coverage, explanation,analysis, debate and reports about major religioustraditions, indigenous religions and new spiritualmovements, as well as secular perspectives on religious issues. The ABC does not promoteany particular belief system or form ofreligious expression. 3.3 Indigenous Programs Program makers and journalists should respectAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.Particular care should be exercised in the coverageof traditional cultural practices such as the namingor depicting of the deceased. 3.4 Avoidance of Stereotypes Programs should not promote or endorse inaccurate,demeaning or discriminatory stereotypes. Programswill take care to acknowledge the diverse range ofroles now performed by women and men. Irrelevantreferences to physical characteristics, marital statusor parental status will be avoided. In programs usingexperts, interviewees and other talent to presentopinions, program makers should ensure a genderbalance of commentators and experts where possible. 3.5 Television Programs: Closed Captioning for People who are Hearing Impaired or Deaf. * Closed caption programs will be clearly marked whenprogram information is provided to the press or whencaptioned programs are promoted. Where possible,open captioned advice will be provided if technicalproblems prevent scheduled closed captioning. Television programs broadcast between 6pm and 10.30pm and news, current affairs and informationprograms broadcast at any time are captioned inaccordance with the Broadcasting Service Act 1992 . Addresses to the nation and events of nationalsignificance will also be transmitted with closedcaptioning. The ABC will continue to increase closedcaptioning to achieve a target of 55% of all programsbroadcast between 6am and midnight by the end of2005, and 70% by the end of 2007.Appendix 20\u2014ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES204 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 3.6 Television Programs: Accessible Television for People who are Blind or Have a Visual Impairment or Limited Reading Comprehension. * Where material appears in text format on ABCTelevision, the ABC will endeavour to provide it in audio as well, subject to availability of resourcesand considerations of creativity, editorial integrityand immediacy. 4. News, Current Affairs and Information Programs This section applies to all programs produced by the News and Current Affairs Division of the ABC andother information programs that comprise both newsand information relating to current events. ABCprograms with significant factual content, whichdo not comprise both news and information relatingto current events, are dealt with in section 5 below. 4.1Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that the factual content of news, current affairs andinformation programs is accurate. Demonstrableerrors will be corrected in a timely manner and in a form most suited to the circumstances. 4.2Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that programs are balanced and impartial. Thecommitment to balance and impartiality requiresthat editorial staff present a wide range of perspectivesand not unduly favour one over the others. But itdoes not require them to be unquestioning, nor togive all sides of an issue the same amount of time. 4.3Balance will be sought through the presentation, as far as possible, of principal relevant viewpoints onmatters of importance. This requirement may notalways be reached within a single program or newsbulletin but will be achieved as soon as possible. 4.4 Editorial staff will not be obliged to disclose confidential sources which they are entitled toprotect at all times. 4.5Re-enactments of events will be clearly identified as such and presented in a way which will notmislead audiences. 4.6 If reported at all, suicides will be reported in moderate terms and will usually avoid details of method. 4.7Sensitivity will be exercised in presenting images of or interviews with bereaved relatives and survivorsor witnesses of traumatic incidents.4.8 Television Programs: News Updates. Care will be exercised in the selection of sounds and imagesused in television news updates and considerationgiven to the likely composition of the audience. 4.9 Television Programs: News Updates During Children's Viewing Times. News updates should generally not appear during programs directed atchildren. In exceptional circumstances, news updatesmay appear during children's viewing times, butmust not include any violent content. 4.10 Television Programs: News Flashes. Because the timing and content of news flashes on televisionare unpredictable, particular care should beexercised in the selection of sounds and images and consideration given to the likely composition ofthe audience. This should be done, notwithstandingthe need to get a news flash to air as quickly aspossible. Prior to any news flash during children'sand other G classified programs, a visual and audioannouncement will be broadcast advising viewersthat regular programming will be interrupted with a news flash. 5. Factual Programs This section applies to all ABC programs withsignificant factual content but which do not compriseboth news and information relating to current events. 5.1The ABC is committed to providing programs of relevance and diversity which reflect a wide range ofaudience interests, beliefs and perspectives. In orderto provide such a range of views, the ABC may provideprograms which explore, or are presented from,particular points of view. 5.2Every effort must be made to ensure that the factual content of such programs is accurate and in context and does not misrepresent viewpoints. 5.3Demonstrable errors of fact will be corrected in a timely manner and in a form most suited to the circumstances. 5.4Editorial staff will not be obliged to disclose confidential sources which they are entitled toprotect at all times. 6. Promotions for Programs Program promotions will be scheduled so as to beconsistent with the nature of surrounding programs. 7. Warnings Where appropriate, the audience will be given advancenotice of programs or program segments whichsome could find distressing or disturbing.Appendix 20\u2014ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES205 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 8. Television Program Classifications * This system of television program classification applies the Guidelines for the Classification of Filmsand Computer Games issued by the Office of Filmand Literature Classification and current at the timeof publication of this Code of Practice. The classifications cover all programs broadcast on ABC Television, with the exception of news, currentaffairs and information programs as described inSection 4, which are not subject to classification.Programs having a particular classification under theOffice of Film and Literature Classification Guidelinesmay be modified so that they are suitable for broadcastor suitable for broadcast at particular times. 8.1 Classification of Television Programs G\u2014General (suitable for all ages)G programs may be shown at any time. This categoryis considered suitable for all viewers, and includesprograms designed for pre-school and school agechildren. The G classification symbol does notnecessarily indicate that the program is one thatchildren will enjoy. Some G programs contain themesor story-lines that are not of interest to children. Parents should feel confident that children can watch material in this classification without supervision.Whether or not the program is intended for children,the treatment of themes and other classifiableelements will be careful and discreet. Themes: the treatment of themes should have a very low sense of threat or menace and be justifiedby context. Violence: may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone; or have a very low sense of threat or menace; be infrequent; and not be gratuitous. Sex: activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references; be infrequent; and not be gratuitous. Nudity in a sexual context is not permitted in G.Language: coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent; and not be gratuitous. Drug use: should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context.Nudity: outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent; not detailed; and not gratuitous. PG\u2014Parental Guidance (parental guidance recommended for audiences under 15 years)PG programs may be shown between 8.30am and4.00pm on weekdays and 7.30pm and 6.00am on any day of the week. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, mayrequire the guidance of an adult. The PG classificationsignals to parents that material in this categorycontains depictions or references which could beconfusing or upsetting to children without adultguidance. Material classified PG will not be harmfulor disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the materialwith their children. Others might find it sufficient tobe accessible during or after the viewing to discussthe content. Themes: supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. The treatment of themes should bediscreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themesare not generally dealt with at PG level. Violence: may be discreetly implied or stylised, and should also be: mild in impact; and not shown in detail. Sex: activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet; be infrequent; not be gratuitous; and verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug use: discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, butthese should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous.Appendix 20\u2014ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES206 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 M\u2014Mature audience (recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over)M programs may be shown between noon and 3.00pmon weekdays that are school days and 8.30pm and5.00am on any day of the week. The M category is not recommended for viewers under 15 years. Programs classified M containmaterial that is considered to be potentially harmfulor disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictionsand references to classifiable elements may containdetail. While most themes may be dealt with, thedegree of explicitness and intensity of treatment willdetermine what can be accommodated in the Mcategory\u2014the less explicit or less intense materialwill be included in the M classification and the moreexplicit or more intense material, especially violentmaterial, will be included in the MA classification. Themes: most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet, and the impact shouldnot be high. Violence: generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail; and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent; not have a high impact; and/or not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if thisdoes not increase the impact. Verbal and indirect visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent; and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: activity may be discreetly implied.Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: coarse language may be used.Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent; and not be gratuitous.Drug use: may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA\u2014Mature Adult audience (suitable only for mature audiences aged 15 years and over)MA programs may be shown between 9.30pm and5.00am on any day of the week. MA programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are suitable only forviewing by mature audiences aged 15 years and over. Material classified MA deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective.This is because the impact of individual elements ora combination of elements is considered likely to beharmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years ofage. While most themes may be dealt with, thedegree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in theMA category\u2014the more explicit or more intensematerial, especially violent material, will be includedin the MA classification and the less explicit or lessintense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: the treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should be discreet. Violence: generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. Depictions with a strong impactshould be infrequent, and should not be prolongedor gratuitous. Realistic treatments may contain detailed depictions, but these should not be prolonged. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent than depictions ofviolence in close to real situations or in realistictreatments if this does not increase the impact. Visual suggestions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitousor exploitative. Sex: activity may be implied.Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: coarse language may be used.Appendix 20\u2014ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs continuedANNUAL REPORT 20 05-06 APPENDICES207 Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2006 Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug use: may be shown, but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: should be justified by context.8.2 Implementation Guidelines. The time zones for each program classification are guides to the mostlikely placement of programs within that classification.They are not hard and fast rules and there willbe occasions on which programs or segments ofprograms appear in other time-slots. For example, a PG program or segment of a program designed for teenage viewers could appear before 7.30 pm ifthat is the time most suitable for the target audience,or a PG segment in an arts program could appearduring a weekend daytime program. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside theirnormal classification period provided that a clearindication of the nature and content of the programis given at its commencement. Note: Due to local scheduling arrangements, some programs will be broadcast to Broken Hill outsidetheir classification time zone. 8.3 Television Classification Symbols. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA program(except news, current affairs, information or sportingprograms) being shown will be displayed at thecommencement of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA program (except news, current affairs, information or sportingprograms) being promoted will be displayed duringthe promotion. 8.4 Consumer Advice. Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA classificationwill be given prior to the commencement of an M or MA program. 9.
