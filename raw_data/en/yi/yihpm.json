Children through 18 years of age who meet eligibility requirements can receive VFC vaccine. Since its inception in 1994, the VFC program has improved vaccine availability, increased immunization coverage, and reduced disparities in access to health care. The Montana Immunization Program implements the VFC program within the state. [Resources for Current VFC Providers](VaccinesforChildren/index) Who is eligible for VFC vaccine? Children through 18 years of age who meet at least one of the following criteria are eligible to receive VFC vaccine: - Medicaid eligible: A child who is eligible for Healthy Montana Kids Plus.
