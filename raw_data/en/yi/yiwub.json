In 2011, Marc Andreessen the co-founder of Netscape, famously stated that \"software is eating the world\". His prediction was proven correct as companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook changed the way we live our lives. However, not many people are aware that these companies were able to change the world because they are standing on the shoulders of giant platform ecosystems like Windows, Android, iOS, and AWS. Being built on a stable platform allowed these companies Dear Shareholders,to share information, rapidly innovate, and build software that is so intuitive, even children can download an app the first time they pick up a phone. Unfortunately, the healthcare industry does not benefit from a platform that allows multiple programs to interact with one another. We are rigidly isolated from progress made in the consumer technology industry due to the complexity of the existing systems. Contrary to popular perception, hospitals are not the safest places for patients. Despite having world class hospitals and intense regulation, it's estimated that if 200 patients spend just one night in an American Hospital, 1 of them will die due to medical error. Medical error is widely acknowledged to be the 3rd commonest cause of death in hospitals, after heart disease and cancer. According to the Joint Commission of the USA, medical error usually happens due to a \"communication failure\". The foundation of patient care is built on the ability of doctors, nurses and paramedics to communicate with each other in real time and take critical decisions. However, existing electronic medical record systems don't do a good job of addressing the communication gap in healthcare. Despite costing tens of millions of dollars, the dominant EMR systems in the west don't have happy end users and is cited as one of the most common reasons for the physician burnout in the US. There needs to be a new platform that allows multiple sources of information, and multiple methods of communicating patient data among doctors, nurses, and technicians. As a senior doctor, I believe that technology will make healthcare safer, more affordable and restore the joy of taking care of patients. However, I also believe that if a technology company builds software far away from the patient's As a senior doctor, I believe that technology will make healthcare safer, more affordable and restore the joy of taking care of patients. 02 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedbedside, it won't be acceptable to the doctors. This inspired us to start our digital journey which eventually gave birth to the ATHMA platform for healthcare delivery and MEDHA platform for healthcare analytics and AI. Today ATHMA includes AADI app for inpatient care, Namah app for nursing care, ATHMA LIS for managing laboratories, ATHMA RIS for radiology and reporting and the NHCare app for patients. True to our mission, we can seamlessly integrate with third-party applications to unlock the full potential of our data. ATHMA enables mobile first, seamless communication between all our doctors, nurses, paramedics, administrators, patients, and medical equipment. About 1.5 million messages flow everyday between all our stakeholders. This has dramatically improved the quality of patient care across our hospitals. Here's an example of how our doctors have vastly improved our patient care routine because of the new tools available to us. Before I go to bed at 11 pm, I conduct my ICU rounds sitting in the comfort of my home. I'm able to do this through the AADI app on my iPhone, which shows all the relevant patient information from ATHMA. My day begins at 4:30 in the morning with a fresh cup of coffee and checking up on all my patients virtually. Today, I can be anywhere in the world, and still see my ICU patients, interact with my colleagues, see the cardiac monitor of a particular patient, check the latest X ray, change the medication, or even speak to the patient's family from my phone. For the first time in my professional life as a heart surgeon, I can see everything about my patients from anywhere I choose and at any time I want to see it. We are among the few hospitals in the world that can remotely treat critically ill patients with all the medical reports at our fingertips. For someone like me who used to spend many nights in the hospital as a young surgeon, this is nothing short of magical. Young students join the medical profession because they are inspired to heal the sick and reduce suffering in this world. But modern healthcare systems have a lot of mindless and rote tasks that kills that spark. We designed Athma to restore the joy of patient care by eliminating pointless tasks while improving clinical outcomes and administrative efficiency. Our study on nurses' routine revealed that over 50% of their time is spent simply copying information from machines and entering it into another system or writing on paper. After deploying Namah nursing app, we were able to reduce the time spent on this kind of monotonous work to less than 5%. This means that nurses are now able to spend more time performing their clinical tasks and caring for their patients with empathy. These innovations dramatically enhance patient satisfaction and improves the quality of care. Our MEDHA Analytics team has gathered mountains of clinical data to build the Normal Heart Score - a risk scoring algorithm which can predict an adverse cardiac event in post operative patients. In a recently published peer reviewed study, the NH Score outperformed both the existing benchmarks: STS and Euroscore II for all outcomes in an Indian population. The MEDHA team is currently working on predicting cardiac function from a simple ECG with better accuracy than the existing models. Building ATHMA and our technology platform is the most complex project we have ever undertaken. It is my belief that world class software for our industry can only be built by brilliant engineers coding at the patient's bedside, interacting with doctors in the halls of the ICU, and experiencing the joys of healing patients and relieving suffering. We are truly blessed to have the opportunity to run an institution that attracts both talented clinicians and world class software engineers with magic in their fingers. The end result is truly special. I would like to thank the Ministry of Health, Government of India for encouraging hospitals and diagnostic centres to adopt electronic medical records and bring about EMR as the next UPI moment for India. In a world where a vast majority of hospitals don't use an EMR or modern software, there is an immense opportunity to improve the quality and affordability of healthcare through digital tools. We want Athma to be embraced by hospitals around the world at a price they can afford. This will save millions of lives and will be a fitting tribute to the brilliant software developers who worked tirelessly for years to create a masterpiece. We are extremely grateful for your trust in us and for giving us an opportunity to make the world a better place. Thank you so much. Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty Chairman CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 03 Government Role in Healthcare The Indian government's unparalleled vaccination campaign, which administered over 2 billion vaccine doses and saved countless lives, exemplifies the robust healthcare expertise of the Indian healthcare system and contributed to the normalisation of economic activities. The Pandemic has highlighted the need to improve the healthcare infrastructure, and as a result, the government has increased the budget allocation for healthcare by over 13% and announced the establishment of multiple medical and nursing colleges. The Budget increased access to ICMR laboratories for the manufacturing and corporate sectors, which is a positive development for medtech entrepreneurs. In addition, a proposal to implement holistic courses in the medical device segment was unveiled. These initiatives are intended to foster innovation and cultivate the talent pool required to meet the nation's expanding medical requirements. We are confident that the government will continue to support the healthcare ecosystem with additional initiatives in accordance with developing trends. Robust Financial Performance The fiscal year 2023 exhibited robust financial performance which is normalized performance compared with the fiscal year 2022. The performance in the current fiscal strides the improvement quarter on quarter except for the marginal dip in the third quarter due to seasonality across the healthcare industry. We are pleased to report the highest-ever revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter, as well as for the financial year, which is attributed to increased patient footfalls along with improvements in speciality and payor mix.First and foremost, I would like to express sincere gratitude to our clinical and non-clinical staff members who have worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the Company. Their dedication and commitment were instrumental in attaining our objectives and aims. While we are pleased with our achievements, we also remain aware of the challenges we faced throughout the year.I am delighted to have this opportunity to share with you the achievements and how the Company has grown during the fiscal year 2023. Dear Shareholders,CEO's Insight Our team is currently focused on developing novel healthcare concepts with the potential to significantly enhance patient outcomes. 04 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedWe have reported the highest consolidated revenue of INR 45,248 Million reflecting YoY growth of 22.2% over the last fiscal year 2022. We are delighted to report the highest profitability of INR 10,313 Million in the current fiscal year translating into an EBITDA margin of 22.8% and PAT of INR 6,066 Million reflecting PAT margin of 13.4%. The performance improvement is supported by the growth in business across our flagship units, other hospitals, and newer hospitals, in addition to the increased contribution of international patients. Our Cayman business demonstrated continued growth post relaxation of COVID restrictions and strict quarantine rules placed by the authorities for most of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023. Despite the holiday seasonality nature of the third quarter, the Cayman unit generated revenue of USD 109 Million reflecting growth of 18.9% compared to the previous fiscal year. To complement our overseas expansion sphere, we acquired the ENT clinic and closed the deal in Q4 FY23. Also, our green field expansion of the radiotherapy block and hospital unit are moving forward as planned; these additional investments will strengthen our overseas brand presence and augment our future growth trajectory. We remain optimistic about the robust growth prospects of overseas business in the Cayman as we continue to explore investments in surrounding islands on an opportunity basis. Our return ratios improved due to robust business performance and RoE stood at 30% at the Group level. Also, strength of our overall balance sheet and liquidity profile remains strong with Group cash and liquid investments of over INR 6.3 Billion against gross borrowings of INR 7.6 Billion (Net debt of INR 1.3 Billion) as of 31st March 2023. Our debt-to-equity ratio has further improved to 0.06 against 0.16 in FY22, with low leverage and strong cash flows giving us sufficient room to fund our expansion through our mix of borrowings and internal accruals. We believe our recent acquisition of Orthopaedic Hospital of Sparsh situated in Hosur Road, apart from our inorganic growth strategy, will help us to take rapid strides in Orthopaedic specialty care and increase the spectrum of our multispecialty program run by our flagship unit, Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre in Health City campus, Bengaluru, helping us to consolidate our position in the Health City campus, Bengaluru to create a strong regional network that brings synergies. Strategic Initiatives In pursuance of our mission to provide comprehensive healthcare to wide sections of society, we have piloted a subscription program in Bengaluru to cover individuals and their family members. We have recently surpassed a landmark milestone of 1,000 subscription plans in the first four months of launch and we continue to gain traction. These results are encouraging and gives us the confidence to implement a comprehensive, personalized, and seamless healthcare service at the doorstep through digitally integrated patient touchpoints. To further amplify and strengthen our focus on retail healthcare, we have incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary NH Integrated Care Private Limited and undertaken the slump sale of clinics. We are optimistic on providing a gamut of comprehensive quality healthcare services to the larger section of society at an affordable cost. We undertake and cultivate strategic initiatives and relationships with startup partners as a result of our adaptability and dynamism with respect to current and rapidly developing healthcare trends. Our doctors at Mazumdar Shaw Medical Centre, in partnership with our local start-up and research partner, Immunnel, are conducting a groundbreaking trial involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy. This therapy is being offered to patients with certain blood cancers that have not responded to other treatments or have recurred despite standard therapy. Upon receiving regulatory approvals for clinical use, our patients will greatly benefit from this treatment. Leveraging Technology With our commitment to technology orientation, we continued to invest in inhouse technology across clinical, operational, and digital channels. We are also delighted to announce the soft launch of ATHMA's SaaS version for small healthcare facilities such as diagnostic laboratories, nursing homes, and stand-alone hospitals, which leverages our technology investments and in-house expertise. ATHMA SaaS provides a streamlined, integrated solution for a segment of the market that is underserved in Tier II and Tier III cities. The team is enrolling foundational consumers in order to collect valuable usage data and feedback to further improve and refine the platform. Besides, we have other technological initiatives aimed at enhancing the clinical and operational excellence and digital infrastructure. NH has been an early adopter of cloud technology for healthcare services in India, and we remain committed to cloud-first technology strategy. By centralising our workloads and moving away from on-premises servers, we have achieved a single instance that powers all our Group facilities. This has enabled CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 05 us to exchange patient data seamlessly and implement standardised processes across all our facilities. Moreover, the enterprise cloud provides us with superior availability and security, which are crucial for providing high-quality healthcare services. Also, staff members can access the data from any location in India as well as from remote locations. NH has implemented in-house Lab Information System (LIS) across its network hospitals. Additionally, Lab Automation and the use of digital time stamps have enabled us to monitor and improve our turnaround times more effectively. Currently, 70% of our lab results are made available within 2 hours and we continue to strive towards improving this further. We are excited to announce the introduction of our most recent digital innovation, DISHA, which provides a seamless and NH has implemented in-house Lab Information System (LIS) across its network hospitals. Additionally, Lab Automation and the use of digital time stamps have enabled us to monitor and improve our turnaround times more effectively. 06 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedOur Paediatric Cardiac Program is the largest in India and one of the largest and the most comprehensive cardiac programs in the world.contactless discharge process. With DISHA, regular updates will be provided from the moment a discharge decision is made until the discharge process is complete. In addition, the discharge formalities can be completed digitally, making the process quicker and more efficient and significantly improving the discharge experience for all our patients. Our emphasis on technology extends beyond merely enhancing patient experience and efficacy. In order to collect patient feedback, we have also implemented a faceless, digital system, which enables patients to express themselves more candidly and without feeling compelled to satisfy the interviewer. This has resulted in a more precise measurement of patient satisfaction and a substantial optimisation of resource utilisation. Significant progress has been made in the applicability and utilisation of our in-house ATHMA Hospital Information System as we continue to adopt new technologies and innovative methods. Our ATHMA Application for Doctor Insights (AADI) provides physicians with real-time information, facilitating the transmission of information in a seamless and instantaneous manner and minimising delays in the care we provide to our patients. Our ultimate objective is to implement a paperless system, which will eliminate the need for paper-based medical records and further streamline operations. Automation will play a crucial role in enhancing patient care by decreasing the time and effort required to perform administrative duties, thereby allowing our clinical staff to focus more on patients. Our organisation has placed a significant emphasis on improving healthcare through the application of sophisticated technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. We have effectively developed a risk prediction model capable of accurately predicting risk in patients undergoing bypass surgery by implementing machine learning techniques. The model was trained particularly on our patient population, resulting in greater accuracy compared to existing prediction systems that are primarily based on data from the European or American population. Notably, this study has been accepted for publication in a prestigious journal, demonstrating the scientific rigour and clinical significance of our research. Our team is currently focused on developing novel healthcare concepts with the potential to significantly enhance patient outcomes. One of these projects entails the development of a real-time risk prediction model for intensive care unit patients. By identifying patients at high risk of developing complications early on, we expect to reduce their length of stay and improve their overall care. In addition, we are investigating the use of ECG to predict cardiac function, which could have significant implications for the early detection and management of cardiac disorders. We are dedicated to enhancing patient care using cutting-edge technology, and our ongoing research efforts reflect this commitment. Mastering Complexity: An Overview of Our Comprehensive and Specialized Healthcare We are proud to announce that our Paediatric Cardiac Program is the largest in India and one of the largest and the most comprehensive cardiac programs in the world. Last year, as a Group, we performed over 10,000 adult cardiac operations and over 5500 congenital operations. We also performed nearly 60,000+ diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures in the adult and paediatric segment which includes about 4000 cases in the advanced electrophysiology segment. We also carried out highly specialized and complex cardiac surgical procedures in the year which includes 400+ Aortic Surgery, 150+ Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), 25 Heart Transplants and Ventricular Assist Devices, and 50+ Pulmonary Endarterectomies. Despite the increasing complexity of cases, we have continued to improve our clinical outcomes, with one of our outstanding achievements being performing bypass surgery with a success rate higher than 99%. This compares favourably with the outcome reported by the most authoritative report from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database which reports a success rate lower than 98%. Our clinical accomplishments were not restricted to cardiac sciences alone. We are expanding our Robotic Surgical Program, which currently involves 4 of our centres which have performed over 2000 robotic procedures.

Our commitment to ongoing education and training for healthcare professionals is unwavering, as we continue to train and supervise nearly 1000 medical graduates through our 100+ accredited academic programs. By doing so, we are creating the future generation of doctors who will continue to uphold our high values and ideals wherever they go. Commitment to Environmental Sustainability As we move forward with our mission to make quality healthcare accessible to all, we hope to do so in a manner that yields shared value for all our stakeholders, advances environmental and societal progress, and forges a greener energy future. Sustainability permeates our entire business strategy. We are aware that healthcare as a whole is an energy and water intensive industry; therefore, it is imperative that we make efficient use of energy and water to reduce our environmental footprint and make significant strides in reducing emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We intend to continue focusing on and investing in the expansion of our renewable energy mix. We have effectively met 27% of our energy needs through 08 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedNarayana Hrudayalaya Limitedthe use of renewable energy in all of our hospitals and have made additional efforts towards the adoption of alternative energy sources in all of our hospitals. To increase our positive impact on the environment, we have also taken concrete steps to ensure the proper disposal of waste. We have implemented an Environment Management System (EMS) across all our hospitals to ensure that refuse is processed, segregated, and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations. Continuous and concerted efforts are being made to ensure the health and well- being of people of all ages. To further our vision of 'All for Health and Health for All,' we have adopted new, improved, and innovative ways to engage with larger communities and raise awareness about the significance of good health, healthy lifestyles, and the right to quality healthcare services, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population. We are creating a safe, fair, equitable, and inclusive working environment within our network so that our staff members can reinforce our commitment to making affordable healthcare a reality.

The country has made significant strides in cancer research, which has improved the quality of life for cancer patients. In addition, doctors can now rely on novel approaches to cancer screening thanks to technological developments. NH Cancer Care has been at the forefront of research, investigations, and clinical trials to improve our understanding of cancer and its treatment. We have expanded our pool of potential Study and Trial Sites in FY -23. Our oncologists were the faces of NH cancer care on national and international stages. Our doctors have a platform to present their work thanks to iNHouse, an internal programme that links all our units. One of the landmark Trials was CAR-T cell therapy. CART cell Therapy is a revolutionary treatment modality. CAR-T cell therapy is an individualized cell-based technique that involves removing some of your own white blood cells, including T cells. To make CAR-T cells, the collected T cells are genetically treated in the lab to produce special receptors called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs. These CARs allow the T cells to recognize an antigen at the surface of cancer cells and activate T cells' ability to kill these cancer cells. The CAR-T cells are infused back into your body to identify and destroy certain cancers. This immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas of cancer treatment. NH is one of the few sites which was selected to conduct phase 2 trials for this breakthrough treatment. 26 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedOur liver transplant programme has demonstrated significant progress in 2023.

These changes have not only helped hospitals navigate the pandemic but also offer valuable lessons for shaping the future of healthcare. Post-COVID, hospitals have undergone significant transformations in their outlook. The pandemic served as a catalyst for change, leading to various key learnings and adaptations. First and foremost, hospitals have recognized the importance of prioritizing infection control measures. Enhanced protocols, such as rigorous sanitization practices, strict visitor restrictions, and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, have become standard practices. Additionally, hospitals have embraced telemedicine and digital health solutions on a larger scale. Virtual consultations, remote patient monitoring, and telehealth platforms have gained prominence, enabling healthcare professionals to provide care Patient Bed Days1Mn+Preventive Health Check-ups1.2lacs+ CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 29 To provide safe, high- quality care, we staff our Hospitals with highly trained clinicians and healthcare staff and implement policies and protocols to identify and reduce harm to patients from medical errors.remotely and reduce the burden of in-person visits. This shift has improved access to healthcare, especially for individuals in remote areas or those with limited mobility. Hospitals have also focused on improving their surge capacity and emergency preparedness. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in healthcare systems, leading to investments in additional ICU beds, ventilators, and improving the inventory of essential medical supplies. Hospitals are now better equipped to handle sudden surges in patient volumes and respond to future crises effectively. Furthermore, there has been an increased emphasis on collaboration and information sharing among healthcare institutions. Hospitals have recognized the benefits of collective knowledge, research, and data analysis to improve patient outcomes. Collaboration between hospitals, researchers, and public health agencies has accelerated, fostering a more connected and resilient healthcare ecosystem. NH organisational ethics is entrenched in its mission and vision statement, which states, \"Health for all and all for health,\" as well as ICARE-innovation and efficiency, compassionate care, accountability, and respect for everyone. Everything we do revolves around these two statements. NH uses the two statements to promote affordable health care. Only when there is efficiency, accountability, and mechanisms in place to drive quality and safety, is affordable care achievable. For example, if a patient is admitted for X treatment and develops a bedsore or thrombophlebitis or a clot in the leg, or an infection- the length of stay for the patient increases, as do additional diagnostics and extra medications, all of which cost the patient and the organisation. Our aim of affordable care will be lost if there is no fool proofing or redundancies in the system. This is where systems and practises, referred to as clinical governance , come into play. With Clinical governance embedded into the system, our aim of affordable care will be attainable. 30 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedRaising the bar for Safer Health Care Your healthcare organisation, Narayana Health strives to deliver the safest clinical care possible amongst Hospitals. To that end, we had informed you all in the last annual report that we had implemented a Clinical Governance Framework and review mechanism that holds our hospitals accountable for ongoing service improvement by fostering a culture of safety and excellence in care. Just like good doctors, great Hospitals invest in their patients. Positive outcomes depend on carefully coordinated care, communication, and policies designed to protect patients from harm. Patient safety improves when Hospital leaders make a deliberate commitment to these practices. 1At Narayana Health, leadership structures and systems are established to ensure and perpetuate a Culture of Safety. We ensure patient safety culture is measured, the feedback is provided to all levels of the organization, and interventions are undertaken that reduce patient harm. The measure assesses whether our hospitals have acted across four dimensions: Awareness, including ensuring regular board conversations about safety issues, engaging healthcare stakeholders in safety and quality committees, feedback and communicating with staff and conducting a culture of safety survey, reporting benchmarked results, and debriefing with staff. 2Accountability, including sustaining a patient safety program, appointing safety-specific leadership, incorporating system performance into performance reviews and compensation, and reporting events to accountability programs, sharing the results with senior leadership and the use of the survey in improvement efforts.3Ability, including dedicating patient safety program budgets to permit investments to support patient safety activities including conducting staff education programs and provisioning for future surveys. 4Action, including engaging the CEO and senior leadership in patient safety meetings. Identifying performance improvement interventions, wide dissemination of the results, and developing policies and procedures to measure culture.

Material developments in Human Resources / Industrial Relations front, including number of people employed 2022-23 was a year of consolidation and growth for the business, after the Covid impact of 2020 and 2021. As the industry recovered from the impact of covid years, the Human Resource function at NH, stepped up the ante in delivering relevant and critical functional expertise to support the business in the best possible manner. We brought in practices, processes and automation efforts, to ensure that we provide our employees an organisational environment that is designed to engage and motivate employees and help them deliver superior performance at work. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 43 The NH brand continues to carry a respectable goodwill in the field of Healthcare delivery and is one of the most sought-out workplaces for good talent. Being spread across geographical locations have helped us to leverage our expertise across the group entities. We leveraged on this equity of the brand in developing customised agenda to attract talent from the market, engage them meaningfully, and retain them effectively to create a bench of talent in the organisation. The Company acknowledges the value every employee brings with him / her and continuously strives to nurture competence and potential. We introduced a significant upgrade to the agenda of HR automation, with a strategic call to transition onto SAP Success factors. This enabled us to link each role with clear deliverables which can be measured and reviewed on a continuous basis. The launch of the performance assessment module online had a huge adoption rate. Trainings continue to be conducted for both Clinical and Non-Clinical areas which has helped us raise the quality of performance and output. As an organisation, we continue to strongly believe in being compliant with all statutes and labour-related Acts, we also ensure that our partners and vendor organisations who work as an integral part of service delivery at NH, are also following the same standards of compliance. This is closely monitored by a central team and also at each location where NH has its presence. Training and Development There was renewed focus on learning and development for the employees, which was implemented through a refreshed L&D strategy. A tiered approach to learning and development for building the leadership pipeline of the organisation, was introduced. This approach proposes to build the leadership pipeline for the organisation. At NH we continue to invest significantly in training of our workforce on a continuous basis. Further to this, we have invested in building our L&D offering on a digitised platform to enable remote and continuous access to training material and programmes, for all our associates. We have also developed several online modules on training nursing group on skill enhancement and capability building. The nurses are encouraged to take these courses and qualify through an assessment. This helps in building the capability, while also creating an environment of sustained learning and development. During the year, the L&D Team continued to roll out specific initiatives that are aimed at enhancing customer experience, through the Service Excellence initiative. Recruitment This year we consolidated our core operating strategy to align the new business initiatives, business on retail, managed care and clinics. We have fulfilled several key positions in core clinical areas of expertise in several units. Recruitment of nursing talent continued to be a challenge for the team. However, with our integrated offering of brand, learning opportunity, development agenda, deployment exposure, and retention plans, all culminating to create a positive employee value proposition, we have managed to maintain our position as the most-sought after place to work, for nurses. Compensation Being a critical function of Human Resources, our compensation strategies ensure there is fair balance in work-employee relation by providing competitive monetary and non-monetary benefits which are as per market standards. As part of the strategy, we review market forces to align the compensation philosophy of the organisation, thereby providing all associates with a good balance of compensation and benefits. This year also, we have benchmarked salaries against market and implemented a merit based increment to critical roles like nursing, which are core to the success of the hospital. Risks and Concerns At NH, we strongly believe that better Risk Management is an important ingredient of the esoteric mix that transforms an organization from Good to Great. Proactively identifying, managing, avoiding where possible and mitigating risk is vital for maintaining consistent profitable growth. Business in general and Healthcare industry has emerged successfully from the pandemic depths of the past 2 years. In the post covid period, cyber risks including phishing, denial of service and ransomware attacks have emerged as a serious threat to business. Healthcare institutions seem to be particularly vulnerable targets given that they necessarily need to hold and protect precious patient care data. Ceaseless vigilance and deployment of sophisticated tools is helping us keep ahead of this risk curve. NH continues to invest in the right technologies, processes and people to identify risks well on time and manage them with minimal adverse impact to the organizational goals. During the year, time and efforts were invested in a companywide initiative to map the processes to mitigate and handle all critical risks that could potentially destabilize the operations. Detailed SOPs, tweaked to accommodate unit level specificities have been rolled out to all the business units and these will be operationalised, tested and perfected in the next two quarters. Internal Control Systems and their adequacy The Company has adequate Internal Control Systems, commensurate with the size, scale and complexity of its operations.

Brief Hrudayalaya CSR Policy (NH CSR): Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited aims to make a positive difference in the lives of the people by engaging in activities that eliminates or alleviates pain and suffering to the under privileged sections of the society by: Promoting healthcare facilities for the upliftment of people at large and creating a positive impact by addressing issues of accessibility and affordability. Promoting educational facilities to help and assist in unfolding the creative potentials and talents of the children and amateurs. Strive for socio-economic development thereby reducing inequality between rich and poor. 1.1 Overview of projects/programs undertaken during the financial year 2022-23 EDUCATION PROGRAM - UDAAN The Udaan scholarship program was started in December 2014 in Karnataka with an objective to nurture the potential of rural students from disadvantaged backgrounds and create a platform which they could leverage towards realizing medical education and become doctors. Students from our Udaan program can be motivated to use their medical education in improving health care systems in their villages and small towns. It is hoped that these enabled students would fulfil their dreams of becoming able physicians, have a multiplier effect among students and practice ethical healthcare thereby serving the larger community. The program follows a very careful selection process to ensure we are reaching out to the brightest and most deserving students who have an aptitude and are committed towards taking up science as a subject after class X and choosing the medical profession as their careers. The social and economic background of the students is verified before they become part of our program. This year 254 Students were supported under the Udaan Program for NEET Coaching and 50 MBBS students were selected for scholarship program. FEEDING PROGRAM The feeding program was initiated this year with intent to provide breakfast in government schools and to support orphanages and children shelter home with basic meal supplements. With help of local NGOs, Clubs, and shelter home, the program supported 360+ kids in the year. It was observed that the school attendance improved with improvement in Body Mass Index (BMI) and overall weight of students. The project continues this year also with intent to reach more govt schools and orphanages with wider coverage. PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER AND BETTER TOILETS AT SCHOOLS The Project was initiated in government schools for improving basic facilities related to safe drinking water and providing toilets in govt schools. It was observed that majority of girls students were not attending schools due to unavailability of basic toilets and change facilities in schools, also drinking water facilities were not present in these schools and thus students were falling sick with water borne diseases which lead to poor attendance and dropouts in govt schools. Through this project, school attendance improved and female students could attend schools with better toilets and around 1200+ school students benefitted this year. FREE COVID VACCINATION DRIVE The Company is committed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and towards this end, apart from the efforts and steps taken by the Company in fighting the pandemic in the normal course of business as a hospital operator, the company launched Free vaccination drives for the underprivileged communities and helped in inoculating the semi urban, slums and marginalized communities with help of Local NGOs to drive free vaccination program. The Company took precautionary measures in assembling large crowds with government permissions and further inoculating vaccinations in the marginalized communities. The company inoculated about 20,000 underprivileged citizens with COVID vaccination free of cost and this helped in fighting omicron variant which was spreading in third COVID-19 wave.

Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 131 Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response Impairment of investment has been identified as a key audit matter due to: The significance of the carrying value of the assets being assessed; and The assessment of the carrying value of the Investments involves assumptions and exercising significant judgements in estimating the recoverable value of the CGU. Any adverse changes to these assumptions could result in lower recoverable value than the carrying amount. Compared the actual revenues and cash flows generated by the Subsidiary during the year with the plan and estimates considered in the previous year. Verified if the cash flow projections of the Subsidiary considered for the assessment of impairment were as per cash flow projections reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and the Subsidiary. Evaluated the Management's future cash flow projections, with regard to the appropriateness of key assumptions considered, including discount rate, growth rate, sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions etc. duly considering and also considering the historical accuracy of the Company's estimates in the prior periods, and comparison of the assumptions with observable market data wherever available. Involved our valuation specialists to review key assumptions considered in the future cash projections such as discount rate etc. 2. Accounting for Business Combination During the year, the Company has entered into a business transfer agreement with Shiva and Shiva Orthopaedic Hospital Private Limited to acquire its Orthopedic and Trauma Centre for a consideration of Rs.2000 Million. (Refer Note 42 to the standalone financial statements) Accounting for this acquisition involved judgement relating to: Identification and measurement of the fair value of the identifiable assets (tangible and intangible) acquired and liabilities assumed. Allocation of the consideration between identifiable assets and liabilities and goodwill. Determination of the discount rate, revenue growth rate and projected margins to develop the fair value of the intangible assets This was a significant acquisition for the Company and given the level of estimation and judgement required, we considered it to be a key audit matter.Principal audit procedures performed Assessed the appropriateness of accounting policy for acquisition of business as per relevant accounting standards. Read relevant clauses of the business transfer agreement and assessed the Company's conclusion as regard business combination accounting in accordance with Ind AS 103 and its impact on the standalone financial statements. Obtained an understanding of management's process and tested the Design, Implementation and Operating effectiveness of controls over Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) performed by the management in consultation with external fair valuation specialist (Management expert) and internal controls relating to accounting for the business combination. Assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the management expert engaged by the Company and obtained understanding of the work of the management experts by reviewing the valuation reports. Involved our valuation specialists to review key assumptions considered in the valuation of intangible assets such as expected contributory margins, discount rate, growth rate and tested mathematical accuracy of the calculations used in the PPA. Evaluated the appropriateness of the accounting and disclosures in the standalone financial statements in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, for example, Corporate Overview, Key Highlights, Director' Report, Report on Corporate Governance, Management Discussion & Analysis Report, etc., but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 132 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya LimitedResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Company's Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 133 From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Company overview Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited ('the Company') was incorporated on 19 July 2000 under the Companies Act, 1956. The Company headquartered in Bengaluru is primarily engaged in the business of rendering medical and healthcare services. The Company was rebranded as 'Narayana Health' in 2013. It has a network of multispecialty and superspeciality hospitals spread across multiple locations. The Company owns and operates certain hospitals and also enters into management agreements with hospitals under which the Company acquires the operating control of the hospitals. 2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements 2.1. Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance of Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 notified under Section 133 of Companies Act 2013 (the 'Act') and other relevant provisions and amendment rules issued thereafter. The financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on 19 May 2023. Details of the accounting policies are included in Note 3. 2.2. Functional and presentation currency These financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (H), which is also the Company's functional currency. All amounts are presented in H in million, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated. 2.3. Basis of measurement The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items: Items Measurement basis Certain financial assets and liabilitiesFair value Net defined benefit (asset)/ liabilityFair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit obligations 2.4. Use of estimates and judgments In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 36 - Leases Note 29 - Assessment of contingent liabilities and commitments Note 43 - Financial instruments Note 39 - Share based payments Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment in the year ending 31 March 2023 is included in the following notes: Note 38- recognition of deferred tax assets Note 34 - measurement of defined benefit obligation; key actuarial assumptions Note 29- recognition and measurement of contingencies; key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of outflow of resources. Note 4 - useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Note 6 to 8, 12, 13 and 43 - recognition of impairment of financial assets 2.5. Measurement of fair values A number of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 147 to the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notes When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes: Note 43 - financial instruments; Note 39 - share based payment arrangement; 3. Significant accounting polices 3.1. Financial instruments a. Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables issued are initially measured (initial recognition method) at their transaction price when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. b. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at - amortised cost; - FVTPL Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Company changes its business model for managing financial assets. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Financial assets: Business model assessment The Company makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes: - the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Company's management; - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; - how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and - the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated 148 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Noteswith the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Company considers: contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features; prepayment and extension features; and terms that limit the Company's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non- recourse features). A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition. Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial assets at FVTPLThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised costThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost represented by borrowings, trade and other payables are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Derivative financial instruments Hedge accounting: The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations relating to foreign currency loan taken by the company. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss Cash flow hedge: The Company has designated derivative financial instruments taken for interest rate as 'cash flow' hedges relating to foreign currency loan taken by the company. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Company's policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such instruments consistent with the Company's risk management strategy. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cashflow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in statement of profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit & loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. Others: Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 149 to the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notesin the statement of profit and loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses). Financial Guarantee Contracts A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the beneficiary fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are measured at their applicable fair values. c. Derecognition Financial assets The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised in profit or loss. d. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when and only when, the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.3.2. Inventories The inventories of medical consumables, drugs and surgical instruments are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. In the absence of any further estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale, the net realizable value is the selling price. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item by item basis. Cost of these inventories comprises of all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location after adjusting for Goods and Service Tax wherever applicable, applying the first in first out method. 3.3. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 3.4. Treasury Shares The Company has created an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for providing share based payment to its employees. The Company treats EBT as its extension and shares held by EBT are treated as treasury shares. Own equity instruments that are acquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares are issued to the employees by EBT , the amount received is recognized as an increase in other equity and the resultant is transferred to securities premium. 3.5. Cash flow statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. Bank overdrafts are classified as part of cash and cash equivalents as they form an integral part of an entity's cash management. 3.6. Revenue recognition Revenue from operations The Company recognizes revenue from medical and healthcare services to patients, on sale of medical consumables and drugs within the hospital premises and on providing services towards patient amenities. Revenue is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of 150 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notespromised products or services to customers/patients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Sales and Service Income exclude Goods and Service Tax (GST) and are net of trade / volume discounts, where applicable 'Unbilled revenue' represents value to the extent of medical and healthcare services rendered to the patients who are undergoing treatment/ observation on the balance sheet date and is not billed as at the balance sheet date. 'Unearned revenue' comprises billings in excess of earnings. Other healthcare services Revenue is recognized on pro-rata basis on the completion of such services over the duration of the program. Interest Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive dividend is established. 3.7. Property, Plant and Equipment Recognition and measurement Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and other non-refundable taxes or levies, freight, any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and estimated cost of dismantling and restoring onsite; any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible fixed asset are added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. Cost includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation and amortization The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over the estimated useful life on a straight- line basis from the date the assets are ready for intended use. Assets acquired under finance lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lower of estimated useful life and lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets for the current and comparative period of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Building 60 years Electrical installation 10 years Medical equipment 13 years Office equipment 5 years Other equipment including air conditioners15 years Furniture and fixtures 10 years Computers 3 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted appropriately. The Company believes that the useful life as given above best represent the useful life of the assets based on the internal technical assessment and these useful lives are as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except vehicles where useful life considered by management is lower. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or disposition of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Amounts paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date are recognized as capital advance and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready for intended use before such date are disclosed under capital work- in-progress. 3.8. Business Combination, other intangible assets and Goodwill Business combination Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 151 to the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notesbusiness combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Company in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that. deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 and Ind AS 19 respectively. liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share based payment arrangements of the Company entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 at the acquisition date (see below); and assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 are measured in accordance with that Standard. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess, after reassessment, is recognised in capital reserve through other comprehensive income or directly depending on whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reason for classifying the business combination. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of financial instrument is classified as equity, then its not remeasured subsequently and settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately Intangible assets that are acquired separately are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives of intangibles are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Computer software 3 years Non Compete and Non Solicit 5 years Customer Relationship 5 years Amortisation method The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Useful life and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year. Internally generated intangible assets An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognized if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 152 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notes The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Amortisation The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. The estimated useful lives of intangibles are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Computer software 10 years Goodwill Goodwill is recognized and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the company's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro- rata on the basis of carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.3.9. Investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries is measured at cost. 3.10.Government grants Grants from the Government are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that: (i) the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them; and (ii) the grant will be received Government grants related to revenue are recognised on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted in reporting the related expense. Government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, shall be presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. The grant set up as deferred income is recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset 3.11. Employee benefits Short term employee benefits Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving services are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include salary and wages, bonus and exgratia. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for employee services is recognized as an expense as the related service is rendered by the employees. Post-employment benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays specified contributions to separate entity and has no obligation to pay any further amounts. The Company makes specified obligations towards employee provident fund to Government administered provident fund scheme which is a defined contribution plan. The Company's contributions are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee renders the related service. Defined benefit plans The Company's gratuity benefit scheme is a defined benefit plan. The Company's net obligation in respect of a defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned and returned for services in the current CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 153 to the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notesand prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The calculation of Company's obligation under the plan is performed periodically by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The gratuity scheme is administered by a third party. Re- measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income (OCI). The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the net defined obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Company recognizes gains and losses in the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. Compensated absences The employees can carry-forward a portion of the unutilized accrued compensated absences and utilize it in future service periods or receive cash compensation on any leave accumulated in excess of sixty days or on termination of employment. Since the employee has unconditional right to avail the leave, the benefit is classified as a short term employee benefit. The Company records an obligation for such compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increase this entitlement. The obligation is measured on the basis of independent actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which the related service are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service conditions at the vesting date.3.12. Borrowing cost Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 3.13. Leases The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land & buildings and equipment. The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. This policy has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. 154 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notes The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. 3.14. Earnings per share The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year relating to the dilutive potential equity shares, by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the net profit per share. 3.15. Income tax The Income-tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit and loss except to the extent that is relates to an item recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current income tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted by the reporting dates. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the assets and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. Minimum Alternative tax According to Section 115JAA of the Income tax Act, 1961, Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT') paid over and above the normal Income tax in a subject year is eligible for carry forward for fifteen succeeding assessment year for set-off against normal Income tax liability. The MAT credit asset is assessed against the entity's normal income tax during the specified period. 3.16. Foreign exchange transactions and translations Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at prevailing rate at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non- monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in the statement of profit or loss. 3.17. Impairment a. Impairment of financial instruments The Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost; CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 155 to the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notes At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) are credit - impaired. A financial asset is 'credit - impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit - impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. The Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured as 12 month expected credit losses: - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative, qualitative information and analysis based on the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward- looking information. Measurement of expected credit losses Expected credit losses are a probability -weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). Presentation of allowance for expected credit losses in the balance sheet Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Write-off The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the trade receivable does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due. b. Impairment of non-financial assets The Company's non-financial assets, inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash- generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset). The Company's corporate assets do not generate independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of a corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs. 156 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023Notes An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. 3.18. Segment Reporting Operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') who makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Segment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 3.19. Non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Losses on initial classification held for sale and subsequent gain and losses on re- measurement are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties are no longer amortized or depreciated. 3.20. Provisions and contingencies Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract.3.21. Share issue expenses Share issue expenses are adjusted against the securities premium account as permissible under Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent any balance is available for utilisation in the securities premium account. 3.22. Dividend Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. 3.23. Operating Cycle Based on the nature of products / activities of the Company and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the Company has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as current and non-current. 3.24. Standards Issued but Not Effective On March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023.

The recoverable amount of the underlying CGU, i.e., Orthopaedic and Trauma Hospital, is based on its value in use, estimated on present value of the projected future cash flows. Following key assumptions were considered in performing impairment assessment: Key assumptions As at 31 March 2023 Annual growth rate 12.00% Discount rate 15.55% The values assigned to the key assumptions given in the table above represent management's assessment of future trends and based on historical data from both external and internal sources. Discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the risks specific to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The discount rate is estimated based on the capital asset pricing method for the CGU. The cash flow projections included specific estimates developed using internal forecasts. The planning horizon reflects the assumptions for short-to-midterm market developments. The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to materially exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash generating unit. 4 (v) Notes (a) includes land in possession and occupation of the Company to the extent of 9 acre 25 guntas out of total 17 acres 44 guntas in Bangalore allotted by Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board ('KIADB') to the Company on lease cum sale basis for which the Company is yet to execute the sale deed as at 31 March 2023.

The Board supervises overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, credit risk and use of financial instruments. (ii) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to financial loss. The credit risk arises principally from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. The collection from the trade receivables are monitored on a continuous basis by the receivables team. The Company establishes an allowance for credit loss that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on the past and the recent collection trend. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to H 2,145.46 million (previous year: H 2,032.80 million).

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, compare with the financial statements of the subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, is traced from their financial statements audited by the other auditors. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 207 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the Group including its Associates in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its associates. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 208 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedthe audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Group overview Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited ('the Company' or 'the Holding company') together its subsidiaries referred to as 'Narayana Hrudayalaya Group' or 'the Group') and associates is primarily engaged in business of rendering medical and healthcare services. Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited, the flagship company of the Group, was incorporated on 19 July 2000 under the Companies Act, 1956 with its registered office in Bengaluru. The Group was rebranded as 'Narayana Health' in 2013. It has a network of multispeciality, and super speciality hospitals spread across multiple locations. The Group owns and operates certain hospitals and enters into management agreements with hospitals under which the Group acquires the operating control of the hospitals. 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements 2.1. Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 notified under Section 133 of Companies Act 2013 (the 'Act') and other relevant provisions and amendment rules issued thereafter. The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on May 19, 2023. Details of the Group's accounting policies are included in Note 3. 2.2. Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (H), which is also the Company's functional currency. All amounts are presented in H in million, except share data and per share data, unless otherwise stated. 2.3. Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items: Items Measurement basis Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments)Fair value Net defined benefit (asset)/ liabilityFair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit obligations2.4. Use of estimates and judgements In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: - Note 30 - Assessment of contingent liabilities and commitments; - Note 31 - leases and lease classification; - Note 35 - consolidation: whether the Group has control over an investee; - Note 48 - Provision for taxes; - Note 50 - financial instruments and - Note 41 - share based payments Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting. in a material adjustment in the year ending March 31, 2023, is included in the following notes: - Note 49 - recognition of deferred tax assets - Note 32 - measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions; - Note 30 - recognition and measurement of contingencies; key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources; and - Note 4 - useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 2.5. Measurement of fair values A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 219 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notesdirectly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. Further information about the assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes: - Note 50 - financial instruments - Note 41 - share-based payments 3. Significant accounting polices 3.1. Basis of consolidation a. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases (Refer note.35). b. Non-controlling interests (NCI) NCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. c. Loss of control When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. d. Equity accounted investees The Group's interests in equity accounted investees comprise interests in associates. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of profit or loss and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of equity- accounted investees until the date on which significant influence ceases. e. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 3.2. Financial instruments a. Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables issued are initially measured (initial recognition method) at their transaction price when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. b. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at - amortised cost; or - FVTPL Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except if and in the period the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: 220 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Financial assets: Business model assessment The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes: the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities, or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets; - how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management. - the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed. - how managers of the business are compensated - e.g., whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and - the frequency, volume, and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity. Financial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g., liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers: contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows. terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable interest rate features. prepayment and extension features; and terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g., non- recourse features). A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition. Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial assets at FVTPLThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised costThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost represented by borrowings, trade and CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 221 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notesother payables are initially recognized at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Derivative financial instruments Hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations relating to foreign currency loan taken by the group. Derivatives are recognized and measured at fair value. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss. Cash flow hedge: The Group has designated derivative financial instruments taken for interest rate as 'cash flow' hedges relating to foreign currency loan taken by the group. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group's policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such instruments consistent with the Group's risk management strategy. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cashflow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in statement of profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss. Others: Changes in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized in the statement of profit and loss and reported within foreign exchange gains/ (losses). c. Derecognition Financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. If the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the modified terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognised in profit or loss. d. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 3.3. Inventories The inventories of medical consumables, drugs and surgical instruments are valued at lower of cost or net realizable value. In the absence of any further estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale, the net realizable value is the selling price. The comparison of cost and net realizable value is made on an item-by-item basis. Cost of these inventories comprises of all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location after adjusting for goods and service tax wherever applicable, applying the first in first out method. 3.4. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 222 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes3.5. Treasury Shares The Company has created an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for providing share-based payment to its employees. The Company treats EBT as its extension and shares held by EBT are treated as treasury shares. Own equity instruments that are acquired (treasury shares) are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. When the treasury shares are issued to the employees by EBT , the amount received is recognized as an increase in equity and the resultant gain / (loss) is transferred to / from securities premium. 3.6. Cash flow statement Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of the Group are segregated. Bank overdrafts are classified as part of cash and cash equivalents, as they form an integral part of an entity's cash management. 3.7. Revenue recognition Revenue from operations The Group recognizes revenue from medical and healthcare services to patients, on sale of medical consumables and drugs within the hospital premises and on providing services towards patient amenities. Revenue is measured at the amount of transaction price(net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers/patients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Sales and Service Income exclude Goods and Service Tax (GST) and are net of trade / volume discounts, where applicable. 'Unbilled revenue' represents value to the extent of medical and healthcare services rendered to the patients who are undergoing treatment/ observation on the balance sheet date and is not billed as at the balance sheet date. 'Unearned revenue' comprises billings in excess of earnings. Other healthcare services Revenue is recognized on pro-rata basis on the completion of such services over the duration of the program. Interest Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive dividend is established. 3.8. Property, Plant and Equipment Recognition and measurement Property, plant, and equipment are measured at cost which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. The cost of an item of Property, Plant and Equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and other non-refundable taxes or levies, freight, any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use and estimated cost of dismantling and restoring onsite; any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. Subsequent expenditures related to an item of tangible fixed asset are added to its book value only if they increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed standard of performance. Cost includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation and amortization The Group depreciates property, plant, and equipment over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis from the date the assets are ready for intended use. Assets acquired under finance lease and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lower of estimated useful life and lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets for the current and comparative period of significant items of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Building 40-60 years Electrical installation 10 years Medical equipment 13 years CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 223 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023NotesBlock of assets Useful life Office equipment 5 years Other equipment including air conditioners 15 years Furniture and fixtures 10 years Computers 3 years Vehicles 5 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted appropriately. The Group believes that the useful life as given above best represent the useful lives of the assets based on the internal technical assessment and these useful lives are as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for building at Grand Cayman and vehicles. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements upon sale or disposition of the asset and the resultant gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Amounts paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding as of each reporting date are recognized as capital advance and the cost of property, plant, and equipment not ready for intended use before such date are disclosed under capital work- in-progress. 3.9. Business combination, goodwill, and other intangible assets Business combination Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that. deferred tax assets or liabilities and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12 and Ind AS 19 respectively. liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102 at the acquisition date (see below); and assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105 are measured in accordance with that Standard. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess, after reassessment, is recognised in capital reserve through other comprehensive income or directly depending on whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reason for classifying the business combination. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of financial instrument is classified as equity, then its not remeasured subsequently and settlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill Goodwill is recognized and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro- rata on the basis of carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 224 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes Transaction costs incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives of intangibles are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Computer software 3 years Third party contracts and Electronic medical records 5 years Customer relationship 5-10 years Non-Compete and Non-Solicit 5 years Amortisation method The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Internally generated intangible assets An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognized if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. The amount initially recognized for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized, development expenditure is recognized in statement of profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Amortization The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. The estimated useful lives of intangibles are as follows: Block of assets Useful life Computer software- Internally generated 10 years 3.10. Government grants Grants from the Government are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that: (i) the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them; and (ii) the grant will be received. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate. Such grants are deducted in reporting the related expense. Government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, shall be presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. The grant set up as deferred income is recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. 3.11. Employee benefits Short term employee benefits Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of receiving services are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include salary and wages, bonus, and ex-gratia. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits to be paid in exchange for employee services is recognized as an expense as the related service is rendered by the employees. Post-employment benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays specified contributions to CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 225 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notesseparate entity and has no obligation to pay any further amounts. The Group makes specified obligations towards employee provident fund and employee state insurance to Government administered provident fund scheme and ESI scheme which is a defined contribution plan. The Group's contributions are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss during the period in which the employee renders the related service. Defined benefit plans The Group's gratuity benefit scheme is a defined benefit plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of a defined benefit plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned and returned for services in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The calculation of Group's obligation under the plan is performed periodically by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The gratuity scheme is managed by a third-party administrator. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income (OCI). The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined liability (assets) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the net defined obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company recognizes gains and losses in the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs. When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Compensated absences The employees can carry-forward a portion of the unutilized accrued compensated absences and utilize it in future service periods or receive cash compensation on any leave accumulated in excess of forty five days or termination of employment. Since the employee has unconditional right to avail the leave, the benefit is classified as a short-term employee benefit. The Group records an obligation for such compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increase this entitlement. The obligation is measured on the basis of independent actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) The grant date fair value of equity settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognized as expense is based on the estimate of the number of awards for which the related service is expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service conditions at the vesting date. 3.12. Borrowing cost Borrowing costs are interest and other costs (including exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 3.13. Leases The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land & buildings and equipment. The Company, at the inception of a contract, assesses whether the contract is a lease or not lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a time in exchange for a consideration. This policy has been applied to contracts existing and entered into on or after April 1, 2019. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company's estimate of 226 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notesthe amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension, or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. 3.14. Earnings per share The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year relating to the dilutive potential equity shares, by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per share and the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Potential equity shares are deemed to be dilutive only if their conversion to equity shares would decrease the net profit per share. 3.15. Income tax The Income-tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. It is recognized in profit and loss except to the extent that is relates to an item recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current income tax Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted by the reporting dates. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, and it is intended to realize the assets and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. Minimum Alternative tax According to Section 115JAA of the Income tax Act, 1961, Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT') paid over and above the normal income tax in a subject year is eligible for carry forward for fifteen succeeding assessment years for set-off against normal income tax liability. The MAT credit asset is assessed against the entity's normal income tax during the specified period. 3.16. Foreign exchange transactions and translations In preparing the financial statements of the Group entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 227 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for: Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks and Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment. For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a foreign exchange translation reserve. On the disposal of foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the Group disposes off part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to OCI. When the Group disposes off only part of an associate while retaining significant influence, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. 3.17. Impairment a. Impairment of financial instruments The Group recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on: - financial assets measured at amortized cost; At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost are credit - impaired. A financial asset is 'credit - impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit - impaired includes the following observable data: - significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; - the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; - it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or - the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, except for the following, which are measured as 12 month expected credit losses: - debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and - other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument) has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Loss allowances for trade receivables are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months). In all cases, the maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative, qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward- looking information. Measurement of expected credit losses Expected credit losses are a probability -weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e., the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). 228 Annual Report 2022-23 Narayana Hrudayalaya Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes Presentation of allowance for expected credit losses in the balance sheet Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Write-off The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the trade receivables does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write- off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due. b. Impairment of non-financial assets The Group's non-financial assets, inventories, and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are grouped together into cash- generating units (CGUs). Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of a CGU (or an individual asset) is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU (or the asset). The Group's corporate assets do not generate independent cash inflows. To determine impairment of a corporate asset, recoverable amount is determined for the CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 3.18. Segment Reporting Operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') who makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Segment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 3.19. Non-current assets or disposal group held for sale Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets or disposal groups are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Losses on initial classification of assets held for sale and subsequent gain and losses on remeasurement are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and investment properties are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted. 3.20. Provisions and contingencies Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset, if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract. 3.21. Share issue expenses Share and debenture issue expenses are adjusted against the securities premium account as permissible under Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent any balance is available for utilisation in the securities premium account. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 229 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes3.22. Dividend Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees and are subject to applicable taxes. 3.23. Operating Cycle Based on the nature of products / activities of the Company and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents, the Company has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for the purpose of classification of its assets and liabilities as current and non-current. 3.24.

NHPL was unable to start the project on the specified date and received a show cause notice from the Government of Gujarat on December 22, 2010. Subsequent to the show cause notice, NHPL replied on January 19, 2011 assuring the Government of Gujarat that the entire project will be completed by June 2016. As per the letter dated January 19, 2011, the timelines committed by NHPL are as follows: Commissioning timelines a) 500 bed multispecialty hospital June-2012 b) 1000 bed multispecialty hospital (expansion) June-2012 c) 100 seat Medical College June-2013 d) 5000 bed Health City June-2016 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 263 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes The Company commenced operations in its Ahmedabad unit on May 3, 2012. As of March 31, 2023, the Group is yet to achieve the above timelines. The Group based on its past projects with government and other authorities believes that the terms/ conditions of grant of leasehold land at concessional rate would be renegotiated and no liability or adjustment to recorded assets is required as at March 31, 2023. 40 In the year 2008-09, NHPL was allotted 35 acres of land by Jaipur Development Authority ('JDA') for establishing a medical college at Bagrana Grama, Jaipur (\"\"Bagrana\"\"). Subsequently, NHPL has surrendered 25 acres of land to JDA and retained 10 acres of land. However, in the year 2013-14 JDA intimated NHPL that 6,000 sq. meters of land out of the 10 acres land retained will be utilised for the completion of ring road project. Subsequently, JDA gave another proposal of land allotment at Govind Pura Ropada, in lieu of 10 acres at Bagrana, NHPL gave its consent on the same through letter dated April 24, 2015. Since this land is given in lieu of land allotted at Bagrana, NHPL has requested JDA that the land at Govind Pura Ropada to be valued the same as it was during the time of allotment of land in Bagrana in March 2008. As at March 31, 2023, NHPL had paid H 54.44 million (March 31, 2022 : H 54.44 million) to JDA and accrued the balance payable of H 53.39 million (March 31, 2022 : H 53.39 million). NHPL would capitalize this amount along with any other payment once NHPL gets the land registered in its name. As at March 31, 2023, NHPL has assessed the status of the advance paid and on grounds of prudence has recorded a provision for the above advance amounting to H 54.44 million. The Company continues to engage with JDA for resolution of the above. 41 Share based payment expense During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company introduced the NH ESOP 2015 (\"NH ESOP\") for the benefit of the employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and associates, as approved by the Board of Directors in its meeting held on September 12, 2015.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 275 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023NotesB. Financial risk management The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk. (i) Risk management framework The Group's risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Board supervises overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, credit risk and use of financial instruments. (ii) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to financial loss. The credit risk arises principally from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. The collection from the trade receivables are monitored on a continuous basis by the receivables team. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on the past and the recent collection trend. The maximum exposure to credit risk as at reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to H 5,165.31 million (previous year: H 4,958.09 million). The movement in allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables during the year was as follows: (H in million) Allowance for credit loss As at March 31, 2023As at March 31, 2022 Opening balance 589.44 502.33 Foreign translation - 260.87 112.32 Closing balance 850.31 589.44 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenue as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. There is no significant concentration of credit risk. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group generally transacts with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. (iii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. In addition, the Group maintains line of credit as stated in Note 17. The table below provides details regarding the undiscounted contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as of March 31, 2023: (H in million) Particulars Less than 1 year1 - 2 years 2-5 years more than 5 Limitedto the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes The table below provides details regarding the undiscounted contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as of March 31, 2022: (H in million) Particulars Less than 1 year1 - 2 years 2-5 years more than 5 Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Foreign currency risk The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through operating and borrowing activities in foreign currency. The currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are as follows: Particulars As at March 31, 2023 (USD in Million)As at March 31, 2022 (USD in Million) Financial assets Trade receivables 21.78 26.23 Cash and cash equivalents 13.03 5.80 Other financial assets (current) 4.36 2.99 Other current assets 4.99 5.62 Financial liabilities Borrowings 32.01 29.83 Trade payables 15.65 6.27 Other financial liabilities 3.36 0.14 Net assets / (liabilities) (6.86) 4.40 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in exchange rates arises mainly from foreign currency denominated financial instruments and the impact on other components of equity arises from foreign exchange forward/option contracts designated as cash flow hedges. (H in million) Particulars Impact on profit or loss As at March 31, 2023As at March 31, 2022 USD Sensitivity INR/USD - Increase by 1% (5.64) 3.34 INR/USD - Decrease by 1% 5.64 (3.34) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group's main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with variable rates, which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 277 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023Notes (a) Interest rate risk exposure Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. In order to optimize the Group's position with regard to interest income and interest expenses and to manage the interest rate risk, treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by balancing the proportion of fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments in its total portfolio.

Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2023 the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognized at fair value.

In the last 6 - 7 years, there has been a substantive increase in the number of medical seats at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, from 82,000 seats in the year 2014 to 1.48 lakhs in 2022. This increase in the strength of doctors and medical professionals was one of the greatest supporting pillars of the Indian healthcare system which helped us fight the pandemic. In a country like India, with a vast popula- tion of more than 1.4 billion, it is very crucial that medical specialists are deployed in every corner of the country, especially in rural areas, to ensure that the healthcare requirements of all citizens are met equally. To this end, two years ago, The National Board of Examination (NBE) launched a two-year diploma in medical courses like paediatrics, anaes- thesia, gynaecology, and other basic specialties. This was a remarkable step that ensured that any hospital could become a medical academic institution and nurture qualified medical specialists. Another remarkable healthcare initiative implemented by the government in the past couple of years, is the establishment of National Medical Commission that has proved to be pivotal in selecting the right medical talent, which in turn ensures effective implementation of policies in the long run.Throughout my professional life as a heart surgeon, I have made constant efforts to make healthcare affordable and accessible to all. I have also believed in a realistic dream that India will be the first country to dissociate healthcare from affluence and prove to the world that the wealth of a nation has nothing to do with the quality of healthcare its citizens can enjoy.I am optimistic that this dream will be achieved in the next 5 - 10 years. The instrumental initiatives taken by the government in the past few years, especially during the unprecedented COVID crisis, reaffirm my hope for a healthier future.ESG Report 2022-23284ESG Report 2022-23 EMERGING STRONGER FROM THE COVID-19 CRISISENGINEERING INNOVATION IN HEALTHCARE THE ADVENT OF DIGITAL HEALTHCAREThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic posed incredible challeng- es but also offered unique opportuni - ties for the healthcare industry. Narayana Health's (NH) response to the pandemic aimed at reducing the healthcare infrastructure gap. During the onset of COVID-19, we arranged for 300 ICU beds, which went up to 800 ICU beds amidst the peak of the pandemic to meet any eventuality. We also converted the nursing college in Bengaluru associated with our hospi- tals, with a student capacity of 1,000, to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). During the initial days of the lockdown as the cases were rising, we tried to gather useful insights from similar scenarios in countries like Europe & USA to gain a better understanding of the disease & coping mechanism. We also understood that for us to continue treating patients, the lives of our doctors and nurses need to be safeguarded as a priority. At a time when skepticism and appre- hensions confounded decision making regarding the uptake of vaccines to prevent the COVID infec- tion, we not just adopted a universal vaccination programme for all the healthcare workers but conducted clinical research to evaluate the effica- cy of vaccination. In the largest study carried out in the country till date, we critically examined the effects of vacci- nation in 14,837 healthcare workers across 20 different hospitals. The findings of the research were duly acknowledged by one of the leading journals in the world - The American Journal of Infection Control. Being a member of the Supreme Court nominated National Task Force for COVID management, I observed that what healthcare can offer today is nothing short of magic! COVID also sped up digital transformation in the healthcare industry, among many others, with the introduction of services like telemedicine. We have treated 53,000 patients at NH through teleconsultations, which was earlier not considered valid and acceptable. At Narayana Health we believe that with all the digitalisation that is happening, healthcare can also be delivered online. Just as Uber is the biggest rental transport business without owning a single vehicle, or Airbnb is the largest hotel provider without owning any property, the largest healthcare provider in the future will be a hospital without any beds and will use software for manag- ing healthcare. We have implemented several digital initiatives such as the AADI app for doctors, that enables them to monitor ICUs remotely, get real-time status of their patients, and deliver better patient experience. At Narayana Health, we have tied up with Honeywell for easing the lives of our nurses by providing them with a patch for capturing patient parameters digitally. All parameters like BP , Respi- ration Rate, Oxygen saturation are displayed on the Nursing Station TV and an analytical tool is developed to show risk score of the patients. We believe in the idea of developing technology for doctors, nurses and technicians to enable them in provid- ing the best quality of healthcare while achieving time & cost efficiency and minimising clinical errors in healthcare delivery. About 14% of heart surgeries in India are being performed at Narayana Health. Heart failure is the common cause of death that can be prevented by implanting an artificial heart run by a rechargeable battery. 15 years ago, NH was the 1st Hospital in Asia to implant an artificial heart on a patient. The cost of normal artificial heart implant ranges between Rs. 50 - 100 lakhs and is beyond the reach of a common man. To ensure that artificial heart implants are affordable and accessible, Narayana Health with the help of IIT Kanpur, is in the process of developing affordable advanced artificial hearts. We firmly believe that the future of healthcare will be totally dependent on the interaction between man and the machine. Throughout history, when engineering students have worked closely with doctors, they have produced innovative technology that has transformed the medical profession. With all these endeavors, we aim to be a pioneer and the trusted partner of choice in the healthcare industry underpinned by a sustainable, robust & quality healthcare delivery model. This can only be achieved with the concerted efforts of our stakeholders, employees, and leaders. I would like to use this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all our stakehold- ers for their incessant support and faith in us. Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty Chairman285 While we move forward on our mission to provide quality healthcare that is accessible to all, we wish to achieve it in a manner that creates shared value for all our stakeholders, stimulates environmental and socie- tal progress, and forges a cleaner energy future. Sustainability is inher- ent across our business strategy. By embracing responsible business practices, we aim to thrive on the benefits of a resilient business model so that we can continue to provide responsible and quality clinical care even in the face of disruption.To fulfill and further our sustainability ambitions, we at Narayana Health have articulated goals within the frameworks of tangible metrics, established guidelines, set a clear roadmap, and adopted international - ly benchmarked practices across our networks and lines of operation. We have long acknowledged the nega- tive impact of climate change and incorporated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into our business model.CEO's InsightOUR BEDROCK COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY We care for the health of our communities and for the health of our planet.We are aware that healthcare as a whole is an energy and water-intensive industry and therefore, efficient use of energy and water is imperative for us to reduce our environmental footprint and make mean- ingful progress in lowering emissions and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Our interventions in the fields of water and energy efficiency have not just enhanced environmental performance but have had a positive impact on patient safety. We wish to lead by example, so that as the healthcare industry grows it can have the best possible impact economically, socially, and environmen- tally. We, therefore, aim to continue to focus and invest in enhancing our renewable energy mix. Through the use of renew- able energy across our hospitals, we have successfully sourced 27% of our energy requirements and have made further efforts towards adoption of alternate sources of energy in all our hospitals. To deepen our positive impact on the environment, we have also made tangi- ble efforts to ensure safe handling of waste. We have established an Environ- ment Management System (EMS) across our hospitals to ensure proper process - ing, segregation, & disposal of waste in compliance with the applicable regula- tions.ESG Report 2022-23286INCLUSIVE HEALTHCARE FOR SOCIETAL WELL BEING A ROBUST GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK TO FOSTER CLINICAL EXCELLENCEHealthy people are the foundation of healthy economies and we at Naraya- na Health are making continuous and concerted efforts to ensure healthy lives and well-being at all ages. To progress on our vision of 'All for Health and Health for All', we search for new, improved, & innovative ways to engage with larger communities and raise awareness about the importance of good health, healthy lifestyles as well as people's right to quality health- care services, especially for the most vulnerable sections of the society. In line with our commitment, we have collaborated with Narayana Hrudaya- laya Foundation as a knowledge partner for the community radio named Namma Nadi which focuses on health, education, environment, culture, and civic issues within the primary & secondary zones of NH Health City. To further our dedication to improving people's access to health and health- care, we have partnered with various government bodies, local leaders, and invested towards free COVID-19 vacci- nation drives for communities of all age group. Our commitment towards supporting the scholarship education programme for NEET aspirants contin- ues and we have supported large volumes of students this year. For patients who walk through our doors expecting a healthier and safer future, we are devoted to providing them with the highest standards of clinical care and services. We, there- fore, continue to invest in cutting-edge technology and research to achieve the peak of clinical excellence. Within our network, we are creating a safe, fair, equitable & inclusive working environment so that our people can work towards reinforcing our commit- ment to make affordable healthcare a reality. Providing the safest clinical care by upholding responsible business prac- tices is at the core of everything we do at Narayana Health, supported by our clinical service excellence. Being one of the leading providers of quality healthcare in the country, we are cognizant of the onus of our responsi - bility when being trusted by millions of Indians with their lives and hence, are committed to the highest standards of clinical care & ethical business conduct. To deliver on the trust of our patients we have implemented a robust clinical governance structure through which hospitals are account- able for continually improving the quality of their services and safeguard - ing high standards of care through an environment which flourishes excel - lence in clinical care. Adherence to the framework also helps us in enhancing our relationship with our stakeholders through trans- parent and timely disclosures of our progress as well as challenges. Clinical Care for All is the cornerstone of our sustainability efforts, but at NH, the horizon of our sustainability actions expands way beyond. We have a dedicated ESG Policy in place that captures our position and responsibilities related to Environmen- tal Conservation, Community, Occu- pational Health & Safety (OHS) prac- tices. We also have ESG Committees at the corporate and unit levels to ensure holistic implementation of ESG-focussed initiatives across NH.I take great pride in our teams who relentlessly work toward our commit- ment to building a healthier and green- er future. As we remain committed to achieving the goal of making high-quality healthcare accessible to all, I would like to extend my gratitude to all our stakeholders for their constant support and guidance in driving significant progress so far. Dr. Emmanuel Rupert Managing Director and Group CEOESG Report 2022-23287Being a socially responsible organi - sation, we at Narayana Health are aware that measuring our perfor- mance solely against financial metrics does not provide a holistic view of our overall impact on the environment and society. Our values and the unwavering trust that our employees, community, and inves- tors have placed in us have enabled us to make affordable healthcare a reality. In our 20+ years of excellence in the healthcare industry, we have left no stone unturned to finding new, improved, and innovative ways to enhance the effective use of our financial capital to achieve better health outcomes. As an affordability-focussed business we believe that transparent pricing equips our consumers to make crucial healthcare decisions better. We follow a scientific process of price determination and disclose our service prices on our microsites on the first day of every year. This initiative has helped us bridge the trust deficit prevalent in the health- care industry. CFO's InsightINVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY FOR EFFICIENT HEALTHCARE DELIVERY The integration of technologies across our day-to-day operations & clinical specialties has helped us provide quality & affordable healthcare services to our patients with enhanced clinical capabili - ties. To this end, we have made signifi - cant investments to integrate best-in-class technologies across our focussed specialties which include Oncology, Cardiac Sciences, and Robot- ics, among others. Adding to our pool of technological competence are our state-of-the-art equipment like Linear Accelerator (LINAC), Brachy Therapy, Robotic Surgery System, PET CT , Cath lab, etc. We have invested in a state-of-the-art Hospital Information System (HIS) called ATHMA which demystifies, digitises, and democratises care in a way that we believe healthcare must be delivered in the future. Our AADI App for doctors enables them to effectively monitor and manage patients in real time across various medical departments through a single platform. As custodians of the environment, we emphasise minimising e-waste by explor- ing ways to extend the life of our equip- ment by bringing in advanced & robust technologies which would stay relevant till & beyond the life of the equipment. By upgrading the existing systems to their latest platforms, we extend the life of an equipment by an average of 5-8 years. We have been able to upgrade various radiation and radiotherapy equipment across our facilities. Recently, we upgraded our existing LINAC from ELEKTA to the Agility platform, and Brachytherapy from Varian to the latest platform. As a company, we don't just focus on financial metrics, but also on our social impact. FOSTERING CONSUMER TRUST THROUGH A COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCYESG Report 2022-23288TRANSFORMING HEALTHCARE ACCESSIBILITYPOLICY ADVOCACY FOR DRIVING IMPACTFUL CHANGE PRIORITISING PATIENT FEEDBACK We believe that the only way to improve is to listen. To date, we have collated feedback from over one hundred thousand patients and have been rated 4.8 out of 5 on Google ratings. Our internal workflows are designed to address patients' grievances in a prompt fashion. Our average time for closure of all patient grievances raised is less than 24 hours and all the feed- back is addressed & closed within 48 hours, in cases where no clinical interventions are required. We dream that India will be the first country in the world that will disassoci - ate healthcare from affluence. Our sustainability centered business model is deeply rooted in the princi- ples of conscious capitalism, and we believe that eventually this may be the only way to deliver healthcare in the future. Sandhya J Group CFOESG Report 2022-23289Our ESG governance framework leverages the collective expertise of our Board of Directors, ESG Steering Committee, and Functional Committees. We have continued to expand our operational excellence while prioritising environmental and social aspects. Since 2015, we have been committed to building a sustainable future by constantly monitoring our ESG performance. Our first E&S manager was appointed on the recommendation of our investor - CDC, to oversee ESG performance across all Narayana Health hospitals. Since then, there has been no looking back. Fast forward to 2023, Narayana Health has a well-established ESG Policy and ESG Steering Committee with an E&S Manager, an Energy Manager, and a Fire Safety Officer reporting to the senior manage- ment. Our ESG Steering Committee is a cross-functional management committee that supports and reviews the organisation's sustainability progress and priorities, ensuring accountability at all levels. The committee holds a quarterly meeting to monitor ESG performance, discuss trends, and propose new initiatives to support the group's strategy. The team has been instru- mental in developing and implementing a compelling environment and social management system across all 19 hospitals. To ensure performance-aligned implementation of plans, resolve teething issues, and strategise plans for upcoming activi- ties, a monthly meeting is held by the ESG Functional Committees.

In the past three years, we have made concerted efforts to establish a robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework for the organisation. A three-tiered approach (Corporate, Regional, and Unit Level) is followed for the identification, evaluation, mitigation, and resolution of strategic, operational, financial, reputational, and compliance risks. The process is overseen through half-yearly updates to the Audit, Risk & Compliance Com- mittee. The ERM Policy and Frame- work are constantly updated by the committee members and the execu - tive leadership team to address the varying nature and dynamics of risks faced by the company. We have also taken the initiative to formulate a detailed SOP and action plan to effectively address potential risks/threats with minimal impact on all the stakeholders in case of critical external or internal risks. After due testing and fine-tuning, this would be formally adopted and deployed across all NH units. PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABILITY At Narayana Health, we are constantly striving to use our position to benefit the communities in which we operate and the broader healthcare industry. We proactively engage in shaping the regulatory ecosystem in which we operate. Our Chairman and Founder, Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty, leads this culture by example by regularly PAVING THE WAY FOR A HEALTHIER AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE As an organisation and employer, we prioritise sustainability and recognise the impact it has on our planet and people's lives. Our continued focus on sustainability is reflected in the organi - sation's growing understanding of this participating in various avenues to drive positive change in the healthcare sector, some of which are listed below (i) Medical Education Reforms have been made through continuous efforts towards generating more opportuni - ties for creating specialists, a cadre of nurses, and nursing assistants.

Today, a robust corporate governance frame- work charts the best path forward for our environmental efforts while empowering us to improve people's lives everywhere. Since 2015, we have appointed an Environment & Safety Manager to maintain our ESG vision and timely monitor our performance. To monitor and communicate our ESG progress we have further aligned our efforts with the United Nation's Sustainable Devel - opment Goals (UN SDGs). This has enabled us to advance in all our sustainability initiatives and make significant strides in the process.ESG Report 2022-23297Our Bedrock Commitment to Environmental Sustainability HOW OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SUPPORTS THE SDG s At Narayana Health, as we strive towards expanding our operational footprint to fulfill our commitment of making clinical care accessible to all, we are adopting practices that accelerate our progress toward our environmental aspirations. We have long acknowledged climate change and its adverse effect on human health, and we are committed to taking initiatives to transition to a low-carbon economy, with the collective strength of our people, processes, and policies. Healthcare is an energy and water-intensive industry. To reduce our environmental footprint, we ensure effective and efficient utilisation of resources and enhance our renewable energy mix. To further deepen our positive impact on the environment, we have implemented measures to ensure the safe handling of waste. WATER MANAGEMENT REDUCE RECYCLEOur day-to-day operational activities require intensive water usage, making water a major contributor to our environmental footprint. Our hospitals use water for distinct purposes such as cooling, cleaning, medical process rinses, drinking, etc. The availability of clean water is a basic human need and must be addressed by every enterprise. At NH, we understand the importance of responsible water usage and have implemented several measures to ensure water efficiency in our oper- ations. These initiatives have not only inched us closer to a smaller water footprint, but have also helped us attain lower operational costs, and a positive social impact by mitigating water scarcity risks for local communities in water-stressed areas. We are guided by the 3R model that alleviates the burden on potable water supply and wastewater systems: REUSE 13CLIMATE ACTION 6CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION 7AFFORDABLE AND ENERGYESG Report 2022-23298MAPPING OUR PATH: MAPPING OUR PATH: 5% reduction in water intensity (Water Consumed (KLs)/Occupied Bed/Day) Achieved a 5% reduction in biomedical waste generated (KG/Occupied Bed/Day)Recycled more than 95% of wastewater WASTE MANAGEMENT A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENTNH understands that responsible waste management is essential to minimise our environmental impact. Organisational managing of waste generated through healthcare activities requires even more diligence and attention as it poses a poten- tially adverse impact on the environment and the health of our communities. Excess waste also represents an inefficient use of both business and natural resources. Therefore, as stewards of the environment, we have adopted a comprehensive approach to waste management, that priori - tises the well-being of our patients and employees while ensuring the safe management of waste. Our sustainable approach to waste management entails a clearly defined process for the safe, reliable, and appropriate handling, storage, & disposal of all types of waste.

At Narayana Health, we are aware of our high dependency on electricity and the associated costs. Hence, we are equally committed to protecting the environment by reducing our carbon footprint. With sustainable development and climate change gaining momentum, we are leading from the forefront in the healthcare industry by implementing energy efficiency and energy conservation initia- tives such as the introduction of energy-efficient technologies and equipment, and the use of alternative renewable power sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower plants. As a responsible enterprise, we are making constant efforts to turn India's climate aspirations of becoming Net-Zero by 2070 into action. ENHANCING ENERGY EFFICIENCY TOWARD A CLEANER ENERGY FUTURE To fulfill and further our commitment to environmental stewardship, we recognise the need for robust investment in renew- able energy. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind & hydropower can help us collectively achieve reduced depen- dency on fossil fuels, reduced energy costs, and improved public health. We have initiated efforts to integrate renewable sources of energy throughout our network. The renewable energy projects at different sites are tailored to suit the local climate & energy needs, viability, regulatory permissions, and compliance with the state electricity board RPO (Renewable Power Obligation) mandated by the Indian government. CASE STUDY: Narayana Health City, Bengaluru, demonstrates the organisation's commitment to sustainability through the develop- ment of a solar project from a solar park under a captive model. The health city now uses up to 77% renewable energy for its operations, with approximately 23% of its annual energy needs being met by non-renewable energy resources. The utilisation of 13.8 million units from a solar, wind & hydro farm has resulted in a reduction of 13.17 Kilotons of carbon emissions in FY 2022~23 . ASSURING STATEMENTS THAT REFLECT OUR COMMITMENT TO FORGING A CLEANER AND GREENER FUTURE \"India installed around 1.9 GW of open access solar capacity in the first nine months of the calendar year 2022, an increase of 96% year-over-year, with a majority of projects set up for units in the C&I segment. The commercial & indus- trial (C&I) segment in India has seen a rapid increase in renewables adoption to save on energy costs and to deliver on sustainability targets. The increased adoption of renewable sources of energy is a testament to the responsible change in business strategies. These organisations are setting a positive example for other enterprises as to how a sustainable approach to business can foster wealth and value creation. One such notable organisation in the healthcare industry is Narayana Health, a multi-specialty hospital, heart centre & primary care facility chain with a presence across 18 cities in India.

For patients who walk through our doors expecting healthier and longer lives, we are committed to providing them with the highest standards of clinical care and services. Within our network, we are creating a safe, fair, equitable and inclusive working environ- ment so that our people can work towards reinforcing our commitment to make afford - able and quality healthcare a reality. OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR PATIENTS We strive to provide the best possible clinical care and experience to our patients, through our clinical excellence powered by cutting-edge technology, clinical research, a robust clinical governance framework, and our core values of innovation & efficiency, compassionate care, accountability, respect for all, and excellence. We aim to emerge as the leader in patient-centric care by fostering an environment that nurtures clinical excellence. EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE ACCESS We strive to decrease disparities in access to care for patients, especially children and those with Thalassemia and Blood Cancer. Paediatric Cardiac Programme: We have endeavoured to provide congenital heart surgery to children all over India and neighbouring countries from all sections of society. In FY23, we have treated more than 5000 children at subsidised charges as part of our congenital programme. Bone Marrow Transplant: Bone marrow transplant is a highly specialised treatment for cancer, and we are committed to ensuring that patients from diverse socio-economic backgrounds can access this life saving procedure. These treat - ments require extensive hospitalisation and follow-up causing significant strain on the patients emotionally and financially. With the largest BMT Programme in the country, we are dedicated to ease the burden of this journey by enabling access to high quality care with needful financial support. We have waived off 10-100% of the treatment cost for these and other economically weaker patients to the tune of approxi- mately INR 100 Crores in FY23. In addition, we have also raised substantial funds from various sources to support patients from socio -economically weaker sections.5GENFER EQUALITY 8DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 3GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEINGESG Report 2022-23302COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND HEALTH Through our Udaan Programme, we support underprivileged academically bright students aspiring to become doctors and appearing for NEET and help in reducing the financial cost of the MBBS course. We believe that these doctors will be motivated to practice in rural communities to give back to society. Through our community health programmes, we provide government schools and orphanages with meals, safe drinking water and better toilet facilities. We believe that this will increase attendance in schools. CARE COMPANION PROGRAMME NH launched a pilot programme in Mysore in September 2013 in collaboration with the Stanford University School of Design's course called the Care Companion Programme (CCP) which is designed to educate patient's family mem - bers with low or no prior medical knowledge on attending to the needs of the patient. Our nurses spend daily qualitative time educating care givers. This data is captured via the Care Companion app and close to an average of 4,000+ beneficiaries are educated on a monthly basis. EMPOWERING INNOVATION THROUGH CLINICAL ADVANCEMENT AND RESEARCH INITIATIVES - FY 2022~23 We have consistently prioritised providing our patients with the highest caliber of healthcare possible. This is achieved by leveraging the benefits of cutting-edge technology, ongoing clinical advancements, and the experience and knowledge of our doctors across the network.

Monitoring Clinical Outcomes: NH is committed more than ever to ensuring the highest possible quality and safety standards for our patients when they use our services. To live up to our commitment we have implemented a Clinical Governance Framework. The framework entails a variety of procedures and techniques intended to evaluate & enhance the standard of care delivered, recognise & reduce risks, and hold our hospitals accountable for ongoing service improvement. Our 5-layer Governance Framework plays a critical role in assisting the organisation in taking a transparent and holistic approach to care. By developing transparent and rigorous review and assurance processes, the staff are provided with the data and feedback they require to engage better with their patients. It also ensures that the board, governance, clinical team, quality department, audit team, and front-line workers are all moving in the same direction. The framework's design focusses primarily on the engagement of stakeholders at all levels. We carefully select a range of appropriate parameters and data, which are presented in a format that all stakeholders can easily comprehend. Within the clinical governance structure, there are committees, sub-committees, and groups; each have designated responsibilities to deliver strategic goals and objectives. Some of the initiatives taken under this framework are: Attention to detail through a strengthened and tailor-made clinical KPI monitoring process has helped define specific measures for over 25+ clinical specialities at NH. Over 100+ speciality specific KPIs are clearly defined, benchmarked, and rolled out across the group. Performance is measured against these KPIs, including monthly trends across departments, units, and NH Group. Overview of our performance across key Clinical Outcomes: International Patient Safety Goals (IPSG) are global goals for accredited organisations aimed to enhance patient safety by addressing specific areas of concern in some of the most problematic areas of patient safety.

Venous Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), is a significant reason for morbidity and mortality in surgical and medical patients in hospitals. Most hospitalised patients have one or more risk factors for VTE. Despite the frequency with which VTE occurs in hospitalised patients and the well-estab- lished efficacy and safety of preventative measures, prophylaxis (preventive care) is often underused or used sub-optimally. We aim to ensure timely risk assessment and initiate preventive care right from the admission stage. Group level mortality review compliance using the IHI tool is more than 95% and lessons learned are discussed on the forum in order to institutionalise the same across the group3. Mortality Review: We have developed a mortality review tool using the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) references to identify causes for mortality as per the World Health Organisation's classifications. This tool helps identify process gaps, enabling the implementation of evidence-based measures proven to reduce mortality.ESG Report 2022-2330598% of all newly admitted patients are seen within 2 hours across the NH Group4. Escalation Matrix: To ensure nurses provide safe, quality, and timely patient care to the newly admitted, they are encouraged to escalate patient evaluation and re-evaluation to the highest level on a need basis. This process facilitates a prompt escalation with a primary goal to complete the initial assessment in under 60 minutes with a turnaround escalation response time of under 2 hours. NH Group's compliance with Patient Safety Rounds is 98%5. Safety Rounds (PSR) This project aims to improve patient safety and satisfaction by implementing purposeful two hourly rounds by the nurse supervisor. It is an evidence-based model of care that entails patient evaluation against the 5P's, namely Pain, Potty, Positioning, Possessions, and Personal needs, every two hours. Our inhouse learning and development team has trained senior nurses via script-assisted modules developed inhouse on specific nursing care related indicators to ensure programme effectiveness. During the day, the nurse sees patients every two hours, and night visits are limited to every 4 hours. Each patient is visited ten times daily with the help of standard scripts to ensure safety throughout. This project has resulted in higher patient satis - faction, lower fall rates, and fewer call bells, enabling our nurses to provide enhanced care to all patients admitted to our wards.ESG Report 2022-23306What do our nurses say? Ms. Shylaja S Nursing Superintendent Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Jammu Patient Safety Rounds (PSRs) for nurse Shylaja have been revolutionary in scaling new heights in her patient safety performance. \"PSR is a highly meaningful strategic initiative that caters to multiple aspects of patient care through something as simple as hourly nursing rounds. PSRs have yielded numerous benefits related to patient care which our doctors and patients highly value. Initiatives like pain management through maintaining a pain management score, optimal patient positioning, avoiding accidents such as patient falls, through constant monitoring, and maintaining the privacy and dignity of vulnerable patients by limiting unnecessary body exposure, have equipped us to deliver quality care and experience to our patients. We perform a simple check of the patient's surroundings to ensure the availability of necessities like filled water jugs, spectacles and hearing aids, and train the patient on call bells, all of which have assisted our nurses in developing a personal touch with the patients and their families. Our two-hourly safety rounds, paired with ALERT (A-Assess, Look for comfort, Scan the environment, R-Remember to ask, T -Tackle the issue), have enhanced patient happiness and experience across our network. It has also contributed to an exceptional patient experience, as evidenced by positive feedback and a rating of 4.8 out of 5 on Google Review. The capacity building of our nurses on IV Line and Catheter checks has enabled NH to detect and prevent the progres - sion of the elusive Grade 1 Phlebitis. Our most current data reveals that 300 Grade 1 Phlebitis are detected each month with zero progression. This promising trend demonstrates that our efforts successfully ensure patient safety and quality.\" Furthermore, our nurses across all wards have shared that the script and the checklist have been beneficial. Their patients felt reassured that someone was checking in on them regularly. The frequency of call bells has significantly declined as patients now know that a check-in by the nurse at NH is just around the corner.ESG Report 2022-23307\"Implementation of Escalation Matrix has instilled great confidence amongst the nurses. Our nurses feel empowered to use this matrix as they are now better equipped to handle critical situations without experiencing any fear. The Escalation Patient Care Matrix approach defines the hospital's decision-making boundaries and channels. This matrix has proved to be even more helpful for nurses working night shifts because patient accountability now exclusively rests in the hands of the assigned nurses. Because we closely abide by the escalation matrix, the assigned nurses understand the first approach and how to manage patients' family expectations better. These programmes have enhanced the detection of patients whose health has shown no significant improvement and the timely assessment of patients by doctors and nurses, resulting in high patient satisfaction by lowering the incidence of falls, pressure ulcers, medication errors, and call bell usage.\"Amala Samuel Nursing Superintendent NMH Ahmedabad Nurse Amala is better equipped to handle critical medical cases with the Escalation Patient Care Matrix.ESG Report 2022-23308Clinical Research Clinical research is at the heart of development in healthcare services. Investment in clinical research is a catalytical force to further our clinical excellence. It leads to ground breaking scientific advances, deepens our understanding of the subject, and sometimes provides path-breaking insights that can help us expand our strategic vision and enhance patient care. In the last 15 years, we have participated in over 600 sponsored studies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we undertook several independent and collaborative research projects. One of the largest studies by NH, acknowledged by the leading American Journal of Infection Control, was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine spanning across 20 hospitals and 15,000 healthcare workers in India. The initial studies at Narayana Health included observational and registry studies that have expanded to randomised controlled trials, data management platforms, hospital based registries, and multicentric studies with global collaboration. Our research activities have included neurology, respiratory medicine, nephrology radiology, rheumatology, vascular surgery, paediatrics, endocrinology, cardiovascular sciences, oncology, and others. As a part of the research activities, we have published 1652 papers in peer reviewed journals since 2002. At NH, we believe that the responsible conduct of any research rests on four essential pillars: We obtain \"informed consent\" before clinical trials. We hold our patient's autonomy above everything else. The Hippocratic moral obligation to \"do no harm\" and the commitment to maintaining confidentiality are essential facets of our clinical research.Autonomy (Self Determina- tion)Beneficence (For the benefits of Others)Justice (Fairness to all)Non-maleficence (Do not harm) ADOPTION OF A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO CLINICAL RESEARCHESG Report 2022-23309Driving Innovation Through Technology MAPPING OUR PATH: 2000+ Bone Marrow Transplants (BMT's) conducted to date 9 comprehensive Cancer Centres established 75,000 Chemotherapies administered 1.5 lakhs Radiation fractions administeredAt Narayana Health, we are revolutionising healthcare by harnessing the power of technology and digitisation. Our Founder and Chairman, Dr Devi Prasad Shetty, ardently advocates that a robust technology platform, intuitive persona focussed apps, advanced analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are crucial to making healthcare more accessible, affordable, and safe for everyone. INTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY WITHIN OUR SPECIALITIES Embracing sophisticated technology into our specialities enables a more efficient and responsible healthcare ecosystem sustained by improved patient care and innovative surgical/medical procedures. ONCOLOGY: NH is one of India's foremost private cancer care providers. Oncology is, therefore, one of the most focussed specialities for us. We are expanding our capabilities and equipping our facilities with best-in-class technologies. We have integrated True Beam System from Varian for radiation therapy treatment, delivering various treatments like IMRT , 3DCRT , VMAT , and SRS. We also have a wide-bore treatment planning system that enables radiation therapy treatment planning for many patients. We have added PET CT and Discovery IQ 5 ring from Wipro GE to our pool for more accurate identification of the cancer tissues and their growth in the body. Our other technological capabilities for radiation therapy treatment include the Brachytherapy system, Gamma Med, and iX from Varian.

However, the incredible skills of the surgeons at Narayana Health Orthopaedics, Spine and Trauma Care in Bengaluru, combined with Charan's resilience, led to an awe-inspiring arm replantation surgery. As a farmer's son, Charan found himself in harm's way while assisting his parents with their cattle. In an attempt to dislodge a wooden stick from the operating grass-cutting machine, his left hand was tragically severed. Promptly receiving primary treatment at a local medical college, Charan was later referred to Narayana Health in Bengaluru for specialised care. With his severed hand carefully preserved, Charan was rushed to the emergency department at Narayana Health. A collaborative effort led by Dr. Ravi D Dr. Mayur Shetty, Dr. Rakesh Koudki, Dr. Reddy from Department, Dr. Vikas Ellur from the Paediatric Orthopaedic Department, and Dr. Prasad from the Anaesthesia Department commenced a complex 6-hour surgery at noon on the same day. Dr. Ravi D R explained, \"Replantation of limbs has a higher success rate within the golden period of six hours. However, we faced the challenge of performing the replantation surgery on Charan's hand, which reached us after more than 6 hours from the time of injury. Determined to overcome this hurdle, our skilled team of plastic surgeons and orthopaedics embarked on the surgery.\" During the extensive operation, the plastic surgery team meticulously repaired all injured structures of Charan's hand, re-establishing blood flow to the amputated portion of his upper forearm. The procedure, further complicated by the challenges presented by a child's small blood vessels and nerves, required several blood transfusions. Despite these obstacles, Charan's resilience shonethrough. Following the successful surgery, Charan underwent 10 days of intensive observation and medication to ensure a smooth recovery. Thankfully, he experienced no complications and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition, with full functionality restored to his arm. Charan's inspiring journey of recovery serves as a testament to the remark- able advances in medical expertise and the indomitable spirit of individuals facing adversity, fostering hope in many.Stories of Hope Remarkable Recovery: Master Charan's Arm Reattachment Surgery Inspires Hope and Resilience ESG Report 2022-23325Little Fighter: Premature Baby's Inspiring Battle for Life and Triumph over Challenges Her Trust, Our Expertise: Overcoming Abnormal Uterine Bleeding and Ovarian Cyst through Robotic Hysterectomy Mrs. Manju delivered her baby prematurely at the 235th day, which is considered previable as babies born before 24 weeks usually have little chance of survival outside the womb. Due to the baby's critical condition, they were referred to us for preterm care. At birth, the baby weighed a mere 665 grams and faced numerous health challenges including severe respiratory distress syndrome, renal immaturity, feeding intolerance, neonatal sepsis, and laryngomalacia. Recognising the urgency, we immediately admitted the baby to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for a duration of 6 months. Additionally, the baby also developed severe retinopathy of prematurity, which wassuccessfully treated with laser treatment by the skilled team at Narayana Nethralaya. Currently, the baby still requires minimal oxygen support due to chronic lung disease associated with prematurity. However, there has been a positive progress as the baby has gained 2.7 Kgs in weight and is now able to take oral feeds. Considering the improvements observed, the baby has been referred back to the primary hospital and will be discharged with minimal oxygen support. It is important to note that survival at such an early gestation is extremely challenging. Against all odds, with the dedicated care of our medical teams and the unwavering support of their family, this little one has overcome numerous challenges. As they prepare to embrace the next chapter of their life, we celebrate their incredible progress and wish them a future filled with health and happiness. Mrs. Papiya Kundu Poddar approached Dr. Monika Meena, gynaecologist robotic surgery at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Howrah, seeking relief from her persistent abnormal uterine bleed- ing and the presence of an ovarian cyst. She had been enduring heavy bleeding for up to 12 days, requiring multiple pads daily, along with severe abdominal pain during menstruation. Additionally, she experienced discomfort during urination and bowel movements. Upon evaluation, an ultrasound revealed the presence of multiple fibroids in her uterus, alongside normal ovaries. Considering the prolonged nature of her condition and her desire for surgical intervention, Dr. Monika Meena recommended a robotic hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. With access to state-of-the-art robotic surgical technology, the medical team performed the procedure with exceptional precision and minimal blood loss, completing it within a remarkably short time of one hour. Mrs. Poddar's post-operative recovery progressed smoothly, allowing her to be discharged on the same day. She experienced minimal pain and quickly resumed her regular daily activities. This successful outcome showcases the significant advantages of robotic surgery in gynaecological procedures. The advanced robotic platform facilitated precise surgical interventions, minimising trauma, reducing blood loss, and promoting faster recovery. Mrs. Papiya Kundu Poddar's success - ful journey exemplifies the transformative impact of robotic surgery in resolving complex gynaecological conditions, offering patients improved outcomes and a return to normal life sooner.ESG Report 2022-23326Breaking Boundaries: Robotic Surgery Unlocks a New Chapter of Health Mrs. Murshidha Begum, burdened by morbid obesity and a range of co-mor- bidities including uncontrolled diabe- tes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea, suffered from frequent illnesses. Recognising the complexity of her condition, a local doctor in Bangladesh referred her to Narayana Health City in Bengaluru, renowned for its expertise in minimally invasive gastric bypass surgery. Under the skilled guidance of Dr. Ashwini Kumar Kudari, consultant GI & Robotic Surgeon, Mrs. Murshidha underwent robotic mini gastric bypass surgery, a procedure that reduces the size of the stomach and re-routes the digestive system. Remarkably, she was discharged on the third day after the surgery. During her one month follow-up, her markers and blood sugar levels were under control, and she required only minimal doses of oral hypoglycemic drugs. Within a month, she shed an impressive 8 to 10 kilograms and gained mobility with the aid of minimal support, significantly enhancing her quality of life. This successful outcome was made possible by the collaborative efforts of a highly qualified clinical and nursing team, working alongside an advanced technological setup. The synergy between medical expertise, cutting-edge robotics, and person- alised care played a pivotal role in Mrs. Murshidha Begum's transformative journey towards improved health and well-being.
