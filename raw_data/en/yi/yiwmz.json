The new procedure coding system was developed to replace ICD-9-CM procedure codes for reporting inpatient procedures. Unlike the ICD-9-CM classification, ICD-10-PCS was designed to enable each code to have a standard structure and be very descriptive, and yet flexible enough to accommodate future needs. Information about the structure, organization, and appli-cation of ICD-10-PCS codes, along with reference material for coding with ICD-10-PCS, is provided in this manual. This chapter contains the following parts: What is ICD-10-PCS? ICD-10-PCS code structure ICD-10-PCS system organization ICD-10-PCS design ICD-10-PCS additional characteristics ICD-10-PCS applications More specific information on coding with ICD-10-PCS is found in chapters 2-4 of this manual.1.4 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary What is ICD-10-PCS? ICD-10-PCS is a procedure coding system that will be used to collect data, determine payment, and support the electronic health record for all inpatient procedures performed in the United States. History of ICD-10-PCS The World Health Organization has maintained the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for recording cause of death since 1893. It has updated the ICD periodically to reflect new discoveries in epidemiology and changes in medical understand-ing of disease. The International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10), published in 1992, is the latest revision of the ICD. The WHO authorized the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to develop a clinical modification of ICD-10 for use in the United States. This version of ICD-10 is called ICD-10-CM. ICD-10-CM is intended to replace the previous U.S. clinical modification, ICD-9-CM, that has been in use since 1979. ICD-9-CM contains a procedure classification; ICD-10-CM does not. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for maintaining the in patient procedure code set in the U.S., contracted with 3M Health Information Systems in 1993 to design and then develop a procedure classification system to replace Volume 3 of ICD-9-CM. ICD-10-PCS is the result. ICD-10-PCS was initially released in 1998. It has been updated annually since that time. ICD-9-CM Volume 3 compared with ICD-10-PCSWith ICD-10 implementation, the U.S. clinical modification of the ICD will not include a procedure classification based on the same principles of organization as the diagnosis classification. Instead, a separate procedure coding system has been devel-oped to meet the rigorous and varied demands that are made of coded data in the healthcare industry. This represents a signifi-cant step toward building a health information infrastructure that functions optimally in the electronic age. The following table highlights basic differences between ICD-9-CM Volume 3 and ICD-10-PCS.What is ICD-10-PCS? ICD-10-PCS ICD-9-CM 3 ICD-10-PCS Follows ICD structure (designed for diagnosis coding)Designed/developed to meet healthcare needs for a procedure code system Codes available as a fixed/finite set in list formCodes constructed from flexible code components (values) using tables Codes are numeric Codes are alphanumericCodes are 3-4 digits long All codes are seven characters long1.6 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary ICD-10-PCS code structure Undergirding ICD-10-PCS is a logical, consistent structure that informs the system as a whole, down to the level of a single code. This means that the process of constructing codes in ICD-10-PCS is also logical and consistent: individual letters and numbers, called \"values,\" are selected in sequence to occupy the seven spaces of the code, called \"characters.\" Characters All codes in ICD-10-PCS are seven characters long. Each character in the seven-character code represents an aspect of the proce-dure, as shown in the following diagram of characters from the main section of ICD-10-PCS, called M EDICAL AND SURGICAL . An ICD-10-PCS code is best understood as the result of a process rather than as an isolated, fixed quantity. The process consists of assigning values from among the va lid choices for that part of the system, according to the rules governing the construction of codes. Values One of 34 possible values can be assigned to each character in a code: the numbers 0-9 and the alphabet (except I and O, because they are easily confused with the numbers 1 and 0). A finished code looks like the example below. 02100Z4This code is derived by choosing a specific value for each of the seven characters. Based on details about the procedure per-formed, values for each character specifying the section, body system, root operation, body part, approach, device, and quali-fier are assigned. Because the definition of each character is a function of its physical position in the code, the same value placed in a differ-1 2 34 56 7Section Body systemRoot operation Characters:ICD-10-PCS code structure ICD-10-PCS overview 1.7Preliminary 12/10/07 ent position in the code means something different. The value 0 in the first character means something different than 0 in the second character, or 0 in the third character, and so on. Code structure: Medical and Surgical sectionThe following pages define each character using the code 0LB50ZZ, \"Excision of right lower arm and wrist tendon, open approach\" as an example. This example comes from the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section of ICD-10-PCS. Character 1: Section The first character in the code determines the broad procedure category, or section, where the code is found. In this example, the section is M EDICAL AND SURGICAL . 0 is the value that repre- sents M EDICAL AND SURGICAL in the first character. For definitions of characters used in the Medical and Surgical section, please refer to the Glossary. The sample code looks like this so far: Character 2: Body system The second character defines the body system\u2014the general physiological system or anatomical region involved. Examples of body systems include L OWER ARTERIES , CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM , and R ESPIRATORY SYSTEM . In this example, the body system is T ENDONS , represented by the value L.

Some examples of root operations are B YPASS, DRAINAGE , and R EATTACHMENT . In the sample code below, the root operation is E XCISION . When used in the third character of the code, the value B represents E XCISION . For the complete list of root op erations and their definitions, please refer to appendix A. Character 4: Body part The fourth character defines the body part, or specific anatomi-cal site where the procedure was performed. The body system (second character) provides only a general indication of the procedure site. The the body part and body system values together provide a precise description of the procedure site. Examples of body parts are K IDNEY, TONSILS , and T HYMUS . In this example, the body part value is 5, L OWER ARM AND WRIST, RIGHT. When the second character is L, the value 5 when used in the fourth character of the code represents the right lower arm and wrist tendon. Character 5: Approach The fifth character defines the approach, or the technique used to reach the procedure site. Eight different approach values are used in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section to define the approach. Examples of approaches include O PEN and PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC . In the sample code below, the approach is O PEN and is represented by the value 0.

Character 6: Device Depending on the procedure performed, there may or may not be a device left in place at the end of the procedure. The sixth character defines the device. Device values fall into four basic categories: Grafts and Prostheses Implants Simple or Mechanical Appliances Electronic Appliances In this example, there is no device used in the procedure. The value Z is used to represent N O DEVICE, as shown below. Character 7: Qualifier The seventh character defines a qualifier for the code. A quali-fier specifies an additional attribute of the procedure, if applicable. Examples of qualifiers include D IAGNOSTIC and S TEREOTACTIC . Qualifier choices vary depending on the previous values selected. In this example, there is no specific qualifier applica-ble to this procedure, so the value is N O QUALIFIER , represented by the letter Z.Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4 Body Part Character 5 Approach Character 6 Device Character 7 Qualifier MEDICAL AND SURGICALTENDONS EXCISION LOWER ARM AND WRIST, RIGHTOPEN 0LB 5 0 Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4 Body Part Character 5 Approach Character 6 Device Character 7 Qualifier MEDICAL AND SURGICALTENDONS EXCISION LOWER ARM AND WRIST, RIGHTOPEN NO DEVICE 0LB 5 0 ZICD-10-PCS code structure 1.10 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary 0LB50ZZ is the complete specification of the procedure \"Excision of right lower arm and wrist tendon, open approach.\" Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4Body Part Character 5 Approach Character 6 Device Character 7 Qualifier MEDICAL AND SURGICALTENDONS EXCISION LOWER ARM AND WRIST, RIGHTOPEN NO DEVICE NO QUALIFIER 0LB 5 0 Z Z ICD-10-PCS overview 1.11Preliminary 12/10/07 ICD-10-PCS system organization ICD-10-PCS is composed of 16 sections, represented by the numbers 0-9 and the letters B-D and F-H. The broad proce-dure categories contained in these sections range from surgical procedures to substance abuse treatment. Medical and Surgical section The first section, M EDICAL AND SURGICAL , contains the great majority of procedures typically reported in an inpatient setting. As shown in the previous section discussing ICD-10-PCS code structure, all procedure codes in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section begin with the section value 0. More complete information on coding procedures in the Medi- cal and Surgical section is found in chapter 2 of this manual. Medical and Surgical-related sectionsSections 1-9 of ICD-10-PCS comprise the Medical and Surgi- cal-related sections. These sections include obstetrical procedures, administration of substances, measurement and monitoring of body functions, and extracorporeal therapies, as listed in the table below.Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4Body Part Character 5 Approach Character 6 Device Character 7 Qualifier MEDICAL AND SURGICALTENDONS EXCISION LOWER ARM AND WRIST, RIGHTOPEN NO DEVICE NO QUALIFIER 0LB 5 0 Z Z Section value Description 1 Obstetrics2P l a c e m e n t3 Administration4 and organization 1.12 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary In sections 1 and 2, all seven characters define the same aspects of the procedure as in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section. Codes in sections 3-9 are structured for the most part like their counterparts in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section, with a few exceptions. For example, in sections 5 and 6, the fifth character is defined as duration instead of approach, as in this code for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP): Additional differences include these uses of the sixth character: Section 3 defines the sixth character as substance. Sections 4 and 5 define the sixth character as function. Sections 7-9 define the sixth character as method. More complete information on coding procedures in the Medical and Surgical-related sections is found in chapter 3 of this manual. Ancillary sections Sections B-D and F-H comprise the ancillary sections of ICD-10-PCS. These six sections include imaging procedures, nuclear medicine, and substance abuse treatment, as listed in the following table. The definitions of some characters in the ancillary sections dif- fers from that seen in previous sections. In the I MAGING section, the third character is defined as type, and the fifth and sixth characters define contrast and contrast/qualifier respectively, as in the CT scan example below.Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4 Body System Character 5 Duration Character 6 Function Character 7 Qualifier EXTRACORP .

Section F defines the tdefines the fifth character as type qualifier and the sixth character as equipment. Sections G and H define the third character as a type qualifier. More complete information on coding procedures in the ancillary sections is found in chapter 4 of this manual. Tables The complete ICD-10-PCS is presented in three parts: the Tables, the Index, and the List of Codes. The Tables are organized in a series, beginning with section 0, M EDICAL AND SURGICAL , and body system 0, C ENTRAL NERVOUS , and proceeding in numerical order. Sections 0-9 are followed by sections B-D and F-H. The same convention is followed within each table for the second through the seventh charac-ters\u2014numeric values in order first, followed by alphabetical values in order. The following examples use the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section to describe the organization and format of the ICD-10-PCS Tables. The M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section (first character 0) is orga- nized by its 31 body system values. Each body system subdivision in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section contains an introductory table that lists the possible values fo r the remaining characters, given that body system. The following example shows the introductory table for the URINARY system.Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Type Character 4 Body Part Character 5 Contrast Character 6 Qualifier Character 7 Qualifier IMAGING CENTRAL NERVOUS COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHYBRAIN HIGH OSMOLAR UNENHANCED AND ENHANCEDNONE B02000ZICD-10-PCS system organization 1.14 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Following the introductory table are the root operation tables.

The values for characters 1-3 are provided at the top of each table. Four columns contain the applicable values for charac- ters 4-7, given the values in characters 1-3. A table may be separated into rows to specify the valid choices of values in characters 4-7. A built using values from more than one row of a table is not a valid code. For the complete list of ICD-10-PCS draft coding guidelines, please refer to appendix B. Index The ICD-10-PCS Index can be used to access the Tables. The Index mirrors the structure of the Tables, so it follows a consis-tent pattern of organization and use of hierarchies. The Index is organized as an alphabetic lookup. Two types of main terms are listed in the Index: Based on the value of the third character Common procedure terms0: MEDICAL AND SURGICAL 0: CENTRAL NERVOUS 1: BYPASS: Altering the route of passage of the contents of a tubular body part Body Part Character 4Approach Character 5Device Character 6Qualifier Character operationICD-10-PCS system organization 1.16 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Main terms For the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL and related sections, the root operation values are used as main terms in the Index. In other sections, the values representing the general type of procedure performed, such as nuclear medicine or imaging type, are listed as main terms. For the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL and related sections, values such as EXCISION , BYPASS, and T RANSPLANTATION are included as main terms in the Index. The applicable body system entries are listed beneath the main term, and refer to a specific table. For the ancillary sections, values such as F LUOROSCOPY and POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY are listed as main terms. In the example below, the index entry \"Bypass\" refers to the MEDICAL AND SURGICAL section tables for all applicable body sys- tems, including A NATOMICAL REGIONS and C ENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM . Bypass by Body System Anatomical Regions 0W1....Central Nervous System 001.... The body system listings may be followed by entries for specific body parts, as in the excerpt below.

Each entry begins with the seven-character code, followed by the full text description. The code descriptions are generated using rules that produce standardized, complete, and easy-to-read code descriptions.1.18 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary ICD-10-PCS design ICD-10-PCS is fundamentally different from ICD-9-CM in its structure, organization, and capa bilities. It was designed and developed to adhere to recommendations made by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS). It also incor-porates input from a wide range of organizations, individual physicians, healthcare professionals, and researchers. Several structural attributes were recommended for a new procedure coding system. These attributes include Multiaxial structure Completeness Expandability Multiaxial structure The key attribute that provides the framework for all other structural attributes is multiaxial code structure. Multiaxial code structure makes it possible for the ICD-10-PCS to be complete, expandable, and to provide a high degree of flexibility and functionality. As mentioned earlier, ICD-10-PCS codes are composed of seven characters. Each character represents a category of information that can be specified about the procedure performed. A character defines both the category of information and its physical position in the code. A character's position can be understood as a semi-indepen- dent axis of classification that allows different specific values to be inserted into that space, and whose physical position remains stable. Within a defined code range, a character retains the general meaning that it confers on any value in that posi-tion. For example, the fifth character retains the general meaning \"approach\" in sections 0-4 and 7-9 of the system. Any 1 2 34 56 7Section Body systemRoot operation Body partApproach DeviceQualifier Characters:ICD-10-PCS design ICD-10-PCS overview 1.19Preliminary 12/10/07 specific value in the fifth character will define a specific approach, such as O PEN. Each group of values for a character contains all of the valid choices in relation to the other characters of the code, giving the system completeness. In the fifth character, for example, each significantly distinct approach is assigned its own approach value and all applicable approach values are included to represent the possible versions of a procedure. Each group of values for a character can be added to as needed, giving the system expand ability. If a significantly dis- tinct approach is used to perform procedures, a new approach value can be added to the system. Each group of values is confined to its own character, giving ICD-10-PCS a stable, predictable re adability across a wide range of codes. In sections 0-4 and 7-9 of the system, for example, the fifth character always represents the approach. ICD-10-PCS' multiaxial structure houses its capacity for com- pleteness, expandability, and flexibility, giving it a high degree of functionality for multiple uses. Completeness Completeness is considered a key structural attribute for a new procedure coding system. The specific recommendation for completeness includes these characteristics: A unique code is available for each significantly different procedure. Each code retains its unique definition. Codes are not reused. In Volume 3 of ICD-9-CM, procedures performed on many dif- ferent body parts using different approaches or devices may be assigned to the same procedure code. In ICD-10-PCS, a unique code can be constructed for every significantly different procedure. Within each section, a character defines a consistent component of a code, and contains all applicable values for that character. The values define individual expressions (open, percutaneous) of the character's general meaning (approach) that are then used to construct unique procedure codes. Because all approaches by which a procedure is performed are assigned a separate approach value in the system, every proce-dure which uses a different approach will have its own unique code. This is true of the other characters as well. The same pro-cedure performed on a different body part has its own unique ICD-10-PCS design 1.20 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary code, the same procedure performed using a different device has its own unique code, and so on. Coronary bypass example In the case of the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), ICD-9-CM contains a total of nine codes to describe different versions of the procedure. These codes specify the version based on one aspect of the procedure, and the aspect defined is not consis-tent for all nine codes. Four of the codes specify the number of coronary arteries bypassed, four specify the source of the new blood flow, and one is an \"unspecified\" choice. By contrast, ICD-10-PCS components can be combined to pro- duce 34 unique codes defining all significantly different versions of the comparable CABG procedure. All 34 codes specify the same four aspects of the procedure: the number of coronary artery sites bypassed, the approach to the procedure site, the type of graft if used, and the origin of the bypass (source of the new blood flow). The differences are summarized in the table below. Table 1-3. Comparison of CABG procedure codes Unique definitions Because ICD-10-PCS codes are constructed of individual values rather than lists of fixed codes and text descriptions, the unique, stable definition of a code in the system is retained. New val-ues may be added to the system to represent a specific new approach or device or qualifier, but whole codes by design can-not be given new meanings and reused. ICD-9-CM Volume 3 ICD-10-PCS 36.11 Aortocoronary Bypass of One Coronary Artery (1 of 4)021009W Bypass Coronary Artery, One Site to Aorta with Autologous Venous Tissue, Open Approach(1 of 8) 36.15 Single Internal Mammary- Coronary Artery Bypass (1 of 2)02100Z8 Bypass Coronary Artery, One Site to Right Internal Mammary, Open Approach (1 of 16) 36.17 Abdominal-Coronary Artery Bypass (1 of 2)02100AF Bypass Coronary Artery, One Site to Abdominal Artery with Autologous Arterial Tissue, Open Approach (1 of 10) 36.10 Aortocoronary Bypass for Heart Revascularization, Not Otherwise Specified (1 of 1)No Equivalent ICD-10-PCS codes all contain a minimum level of specificityICD-10-PCS design ICD-10-PCS overview 1.21Preliminary 12/10/07 Expandability Expandability was also recommended as a key structural attribute. The specific recommendation for expandability includes these characteristics: Accommodate new procedures and technologies Add new codes without disrupting the existing structure ICD-10-PCS is designed to be easily updated as new codes are required for new procedures and new techniques. Changes to ICD-10-PCS can all be made within the existing structure, because whole codes are not added. Instead, one of two possible changes is made to the system: A new value for a character is added as needed to the system. An existing value for a character is added to a table(s) in the system. ICD-10-PCS update: PICVA An example of how the updating of ICD-10-PCS works can be seen in the coronary artery bypass procedure called Percutane-ous in-situ coronary venous arterialization (PICVA). This procedure is no more invasive than a percutaneous coronary angioplasty, but achieves the bene fits of a bypass procedure by placing a specialized stent into the diseased coronary artery, through its wall into the adjacent coronary vein, and diverting blood flow through the stent into the artery past the blockage. ICD-10-PCS was updated in 2004 to include an appropriate range of codes for the PICVA procedure (16 possible codes). This was accomplished simply by adding another row to the relevant table (see table 021, B YPASS, HEART AND GREAT VESSELS ) containing two approach values for the non-invasive approach, two device values for the possible types of stent, and a single qualifier defining the coronary vein as the source of the new blood flow, as in the example below. 0: MEDICAL AND SURGICAL 2: HEART AND GREAT VESSELS 1: BYPASS: Altering the route of passage of the contents of a tubular body part Body Part Character 4Approach Character 5Device Character 6Qualifier Character 7 0Coronary Artery, One Site 1Coronary Artery, Two Sites 2Coronary Artery, Three Sites 3Coronary Artery, Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Structural integrity As shown in the previous example, ICD-10-PCS can be easily expanded without disrupting the structure of the system. In the PICVA example, one new value\u2014the qualifier value CORONARY VEIN\u2014was added to the system to effect this change. All other values in the new row are existing values used to cre-ate unique, new codes. This type of updating can be replicated anywhere in the system when a change is required. ICD-10-PCS allows unique new codes to be added to the system because values for the seven characters that make up a code can be combined as needed. The system can evolve as medical technology and clinical prac-tice evolve, without disrupting the ICD-10-PCS structure. ICD-10-PCS overview 1.23Preliminary 12/10/07 ICD-10-PCS additional characteristics ICD-10-PCS possesses several addi tional characteristics in response to government and industry recommendations. These characteristics are Standardized terminology within the coding system Standardized level of specificity No diagnostic information No explicit \"not otherwise specified\" (NOS) code options Limited use of \"not elsewhere classified\" (NEC) code options Standardized terminology Words commonly used in clinical vocabularies may have multi-ple meanings. This can cause confusion and result in inaccurate data. ICD-10-PCS is standardized and self-contained. Characters and values used in the system are defined in the system. For example, the word \"excision\" is used to describe a wide vari- ety of surgical procedures. In ICD-10-PCS, the word \"excision\" describes a single, precise surgical objective, defined as \"Cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part.\" For the complete list of root op erations and their definitions, please refer to appendix A. No eponyms or common procedure namesThe terminology used in ICD-10-PCS is standardized to provide precise and stable definitions of all procedures performed. This standardized terminology is used in all ICD-10-PCS code descriptions. As a result, ICD-10-PCS code descriptions do not include eponyms or common procedure names. Two examples from ICD-9-CM are 22.61, \"Excision of lesion names are not included in a code description, nor are proce-dures identified by common terms or acronyms such as appendectomy or CABG. Instead, such procedures are coded to the root operation that accurately identifies the objective of the procedure. The procedures described in the preceding paragraph by ICD-9-CM codes are coded in ICD-10-PCS according to the root operation that matches the objective of the procedure. Here the ICD-10-PCS equivalents would be E XCISION and I NSPECTION respectively. By relying on the universal objectives defined in ICD-10-PCS additional characteristics 1.24 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary root operations rather than eponyms or specific procedure titles that change or become obsolete, ICD-10-PCS preserves the capacity to define past, present, and future procedures accu-rately using stable terminology in the form of characters and values. No combination codes With rare exceptions, ICD-10-PCS does not define multiple pro-cedures with one code. This is to preserve standardized terminology and consistency across the system. Procedures that are typically performed together but are distinct procedures may be defined by a single \"combination code\" in ICD-9-CM. An example of a combination code in ICD-9-CM is 28.3, \"Tonsillec- tomy with adenoidectomy.\" A procedure that meets the reporting criteria for a separate pro- cedure is coded separately in ICD-10-PCS. This allows the system to respond to changes in technology and medical prac-tice with the maximum degree of stability and flexibility. Standardized level of specificityIn ICD-9-CM, one code with its description and includes notes may encompass a vast number of procedure variations while another code defines a single specific procedure. ICD-10-PCS provides a standardized level of specificity for each code, so that each code represents a single procedure variation. The ICD-9-CM code 39.31, \"Suture of artery,\" does not specify the artery, whereas the code range 38.40-38.49, \"Resection of artery with replacement,\" provides a fourth-digit subclassifica-tion for specifying the artery by anatomical region (thoracic, abdominal, etc.). In ICD-10-PCS, the codes identifying all artery suture and artery replacement procedures possess the same degree of specificity. The ICD-9-CM examples above coded to their ICD-10-PCS equivalents would use the same artery body part values in all codes identifying the respective procedures. In general, ICD-10-PCS code descriptions are much more spe- cific than their ICD-9-CM counterparts, but sometimes an ICD-10-PCS code description is actually less specific. In most cases this is because the ICD-9-CM code contains diagnosis information. The standardized level of code specificity in ICD-10-PCS cannot always take account of these fluctuations in ICD-9-CM level of specificity. Instead, ICD-10-PCS provides a standardized level of specificity that can be predicted across the system.ICD-10-PCS additional characteristics ICD-10-PCS overview 1.25Preliminary 12/10/07 Diagnosis information excludedAnother key feature of ICD-10-PCS is that information pertaining to a diagnosis is excluded from the code descriptions. ICD-9-CM often contains information about the diagnosis in its procedure codes. Adding diagnosis information limits the flexi-bility and functionality of a procedure coding system. It has the effect of placing a code \"off limits\" because the diagnosis in the medical record does not match the diagnosis in the procedure code description. The code cannot be used even though the procedural part of the code description precisely matches the procedure performed. Diagnosis information is not contained in any ICD-10-PCS code. The diagnosis codes, not the procedure codes, will specify the reason the procedure is performed. NOS code options restricted ICD-9-CM often designates codes as \"unspecified\" or \"not other-wise specified\" codes. By contrast, the standardized level of specificity designed in to ICD-10-PCS restricts the use of broadly applicable NOS or unspecified code options in the system. A minimal level of specificity is required to construct a valid code. In ICD-10-PCS, each character defines information about the procedure and all seven characters must contain a specific value obtained from a single row of a table to build a valid code. Even values such as the sixth-character value Z, N O DEVICE and the seventh-character value Z, N O QUALIFIER , provide important information about the procedure performed. Limited NEC code options ICD-9-CM often designates codes as \"not elsewhere classified\" or \"other specified\" versions of a procedure throughout the code set. NEC options are also provided in ICD-10-PCS, but only for specific, limited use. In the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section, two significant \"not else- where classified\" options are the root operation value Q, R EPAIR and the device value Y, O THER DEVICE. The root operation R EPAIR is a true NEC value. It is used only when the procedure performed is not one of the other root operations in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section. OTHER DEVICE, on the other hand, is intended to be used to temporarily define new devices that do not have a specific value assigned, until one can be added to the system. No cate-gories of medical or surgical devices are permanently classified to O THER DEVICE. 1.26 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary ICD-10-PCS applications ICD-10-PCS code structure results in qualities that optimize the performance of the system in electronic applications, and maxi-mize the usefulness of the coded healthcare data. These qualities include Optimal search capability Consistent character definitions Consistent values wherever possible Code readability Some have argued that, in the world of the electronic health record, the classification system as we know it is outmoded, that classification doesn't matter because a computer is able to find a code with equal ease whether the code has been generated at random or is part of a classification scheme. While this may be true from an IT perspective, assignment of randomly generated code numbers makes it impossible to aggregate data according to related ranges of codes. This is a critical capability for provid- ers, payers, and researchers to make meaningful use of the data. Optimal search capability ICD-10-PCS is designed for maxi mum versatility in the ability to aggregate coded data. Values belonging to the same character as defined in a section or sections can be easily compared, since they occupy the same position in a code. This provides a high degree of flexibility and functionality for data mining. For example, the body part value 6, S TOMACH , retains its mean- ing for all codes in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section that define procedures performed on the stomach. Because the body part value is dependent for its meaning on the body system in which it is found, the body system value D, G ASTROINTESTINAL , must also be included in the search. A person wishing to examine da ta regarding all medical and surgical procedures performed on the stomach could do so sim-ply by searching the code range below. 0D*6***ICD-10-PCS applications ICD-10-PCS overview 1.27Preliminary 12/10/07 Consistent characters and valuesIn the previous example, the value 6 means S TOMACH only when the body system value is D, G ASTROINTESTINAL . In many other cases, values retain thei r meaning across a much broader range of codes. This provides consistency and readability. For example, the value 0 in the fifth character defines the approach O PEN and the value 3 in the fifth character defines the approach P ERCUTANEOUS across sections 0-4 and 7-9, where applicable. As a result, all open and percutaneous procedures represented by codes in sections 0-4 and 7-9 can be compared based on a single character\u2014approach\u2014by conducting a query on the code ranges below. [0-4,7-9]***0** vs. [0-4,7-9]***3** Searches can be progressively refined by adding specific val- ues. For example, one could search on a body system value or range of body system values, plus a body part value or range of body part values, plus a root operation value or range of root operation values. To refine the search above, one could add the body system value for G ASTROINTESTINAL and the body part value for S TOM- ACH to limit the search to open vs. percutaneous procedures performed on the stomach: 0D*60** vs. 0D*63**To refine the search even further and limit the comparison to open and percutaneous biopsies of the stomach, one could add the third-character value for the root operation E XCISION and the qualifier D IAGNOSTIC , as below. 0DB60*X vs. 0DB63*XStability of characters and values across vast ranges of codes provides the maximum degree of functionality and flexibility for the collection and analysis of data. The search capabilities dem-onstrated above function equally well for all uses of healthcare data: investigating quality of care , resource utilization, risk man- agement, conducting research, determining reimbursement, and many others. Because the character definition is consistent, and only the indi- vidual values assigned to that character differ as needed, meaningful comparisons of data over time can be conducted across a virtually infinite range of procedures.ICD-10-PCS applications 1.28 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Code readability ICD-10-PCS resembles a language in the sense that it is made up of semi-independent values combined by following the rules of the system, much the way a sentence is formed by combin-ing words and following the rules of grammar and syntax. As with words in their context, the meaning of any single value is a combination of its position in the code and any preceding val-ues on which it may be dependent. For example, in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section, a body part value is always dependent for its meaning on the body system in which it is found. It cannot stand alone as a letter or a num-ber and be meaningful. A fourth-character value of 6 by itself can mean 31 different things, but a fourth-character value of 6 in the context of a second-character value of D means one thing only\u2014S TOMACH . On the other hand, a root operation value is not dependent on any character but the section for its meaning, and identifies a single consistent objective wherever the third character is defined as root operation. For example, the third-character value T identifies the root operation R ESECTION in both the M ED- ICAL AND SURGICAL and O BSTETRICS sections. The approach value also identifies a single consistent approach wherever the fifth character is defined as approach. The fifth-character value 3 identifies the approach P ERCUTANEOUS in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section, the O BSTETRICS section, the ADMINISTRATION section, and others. The sixth-character device value or seventh-character qualifier value identifies the same device or qualifier in the context of the body system where it is found. Although there may be con-sistencies across body systems or within whole sections, this is not true in all cases. Values in their designated context have a precise meaning, like words in a language. As seen in the code example which began this chapter, 0LB50ZZ represents the text description of the spe-cific procedure \"Excision of right lower arm and wrist tendon, open approach.\" Since ICD-10-PCS values in context have a sin-gle, precise meaning, a complete, valid code can be read and understood without its accompanying text description, much like one would read a sentence.Preliminary 12/10/07 Chapter 2 2Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section2.2 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Contents Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section 2.5 Root operation groups 2.6 Root operations that take out some or all of a body part 2.8 Excision\u2014Root operation B 2.9 Resection\u2014Root operation T 2.11 Detachment\u2014Root operation 6 2.13 Destruction\u2014Root operation 5 2.16 Extraction\u2014Root operation D 2.18 Root operations that take out solids/fluids/gases from a body part 2.20 Drainage\u2014Root operation 9 2.21 Extirpation\u2014Root operation C 2.23 Fragmentation\u2014Root operation F 2.25 Root operations involving cutting or separation only 2.27 Division\u2014Root operation 8 2.28 Release\u2014Root operation N 2.29 Root operations that put in/put back or move some/all of a body part 2.31 Transplantation\u2014Root operation Y 2.32 Reattachment\u2014Root operation M 2.34 Transfer\u2014Root operation X 2.36 Reposition\u2014Root operation S 2.38 Root operations that alter the diameter/route of a tubular body part 2.40 Restriction\u2014Root operation V 2.41 Occlusion\u2014Root operation L 2.43 Dilation\u2014Root operation 7 2.45 Bypass\u2014Root operation 1 2.47 Root operations that always involve a device 2.49 Insertion\u2014Root operation H 2.50 Replacement\u2014Root operation R 2.52 Change\u2014Root operation 2 2.54 Removal\u2014Root operation P 2.55 Revision\u2014Root operation W 2.57 Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section 2.3Preliminary 12/10/07 Root operations involving examination only 2.58 Inspection\u2014Root operation J 2.59 Map\u2014Root operation K 2.60 Root operations that define other repairs 2.61 Control\u2014Root operation 3 2.62 Repair\u2014Root operation Q 2.63 Root operations that define other objectives 2.65 Fusion\u2014Root operation G 2.66 Alteration\u2014Root operation 0 2.68 Creation\u2014Root operation 4 2.70Preliminary 12/10/07 Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section 2.5Preliminary 12/10/07 Chapter 2 Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section THIS CHAPTER PROVIDES reference material for the root operations in the M EDICAL AND SURGICAL section of ICD-10-PCS.

Coding note: Lymph nodes When an entire lymph node chain is cut out, the appropriate root operation is R ESECTION . When a lymph node(s) is cut out, the root operation is E XCISION . Example: Right hemicolectomy ...a vertical midline incision was used to enter the abdominal cav-ity. There was noted to be a mass in the region of the cecum. The mass was easily mobilized and it was felt that a right hemicolec-tomy was indicated. The right colo n was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and reflecting colon medially.

Careful sharp dissection was made down to the bone, and care was taken to avoid the fourth toe's neurovascular bundle. There was obvious osteomy-elitis of the proximal phalanx of the fifth toe and the toe itself was disarticulated, the proximal head of the fifth lower extremity metatarsal, without difficulty. Specimens were sent to pathology for culture and examination. Next, both sharp and blunt dissection were used to adequately expose the head of the fifth metatarsal, and this was done with-out difficulty. A small rongeur was then used to remove the head of the fifth metatarsal, and soft spongy bone was felt beneath this area. Examination of the patient's x-ra ys revealed that there was an area of cortical lucency at the base of the head of the fifth meta-tarsal, and the decision was made to extend the amputation to the midshaft of the fifth metatarsal, and this was done without difficulty using a rongeur. The wound was then flushed with normal saline, and bleeding viable tissue was observed through-out the wound. There was adequate flap coverage of the remaining fifth metatarsal...Thumb, finger, or toe0 Complete: Amputation at the metacarpophalangeal/metatarsal-phalangeal joint 1 High: Amputation anywhere along the proximal phalanx 2 Mid: Amputation through the proximal interphalangeal joint or anywhere along the middle phalanx 3 Low: Amputation through the distal interphalangeal joint or anywhere along the distal phalanxBody Part Qualifier ValueDefinition Character 1 SectionCharacter 2 Body System Character 3 Root Operation Character 4 Body Part Character 5 Approach Character 6 Device Character 7 Qualifier MEDICAL AND SURGICALLOWER EXTREMITIESDETACHMENT FOOT, LEFT OPEN NO DEVICE PARTIAL 5TH RAY 0Y6N0ZFRoot operations that take out some or all of a body part Procedures in the Medical and Surgical section 2.15Preliminary 12/10/07 Coding note: Qualifier value The surgeon uses the word \"toe\" to describe the amputation, but the operative report says he extends the amputation to the midshaft of the fifth metatarsal, which is the foot, so the qualifier is P ARTIAL 5TH RAY.

This root operation defines a broad range of common procedures, since it can be used anywhere in the body to treat a variety of conditions, including: Skin and genital warts Nasal and colon polyps Esophageal varices Endometrial implants Nerve lesions Example: Radiofrequency coagulation of the trigeminal nerve ...The right cheek was infiltrated dermally with Xylocaine, and a small nick in the skin 2.5 cm lateral to the corner of the mouth was performed with an 18 gauge needle. The radiofrequency needle with 2 mm exposed tip was then introduced using the known anatomical landmarks and under lateral fluoroscopy guidance into the foramen ovale. Confirmation of the placement of the needle was done by the patient grimacing to pain and by the lateral x-ray. The first treatment, 90 seconds in length, was administered with the tip of the needle 3 mm below the clival line at a temperature of 75 degrees C. The needle was then advanced further to the mid clival line and another treatment of similar st rength and duration was also administered. Finally the third and last treatment was adminis- tered with the tip of the needle about 3 cm above the line. The needle was removed.

Instead, the objec-tive is to remove solid material such as a foreign body, thrombus, or calculus from the body part. Example: De-clotting of AV dialysis graft ...the right upper extremity was properly prepped and draped. Local anesthesia was used to explore the graft. A transverse inci-sion in the previous site of the incision, 1 cm below the elbow crease, was performed. The venous limb of the graft was dis-sected free up to the venous anastomosis. A small incision on the graft was performed. Then a #3 Fogarty catheter was passed on the venous side. The cephalic vein was found obstructed, not on the anastomotic site, but about 4 cm proximal to the anastomosis. A large number of clots were extracted. After the embolectomy a good back flow from the venous side was obtained. Then the embolectomy was performed throughout the limb on the arterial side. More clots were extracted and a good arterial flow was obtained. The procedure was concluded, closing the incision on the graft with 6-0 prolene...

When the objective is to cut or separate the area around a body part, the attachments to a body part, or between subdivisions of a body part that are causing abnormal constraint, then the root operation R ELEASE is coded instead. Example: Anal sphincterotomy Manual examination of the rectum and anus was done, and examination showed that the patient has an anterior anal fis-sure. For that reason, lateral sphincterotomy was done at the 3 o'clock position using the closed approach, dividing only the internal sphincter using the #11 blade...

R ELEASE procedures are coded to the body part being freed. The proce-dure can be performed on the area around a body part, on the attachments to a body part, or between subdivisions of a body part that are causing the abnormal constraint. Example: Release of median nerve ...the right arm was scrubbed with Betadine and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A well-padded tourniquet was fixed to the right proximal arm but not inflated until after draping. After draping, the right arm was exsanguinated with a combination of elevation and an Esmarch bandage, placing a sponge in the palm. The tourniquet was inflated to 250. A transverse incision was made at the level of the proximal wrist crease between the palmaris long us and the flexor carpi ulnaris sharply through the skin with a knife, and subcutaneous tissue was dissected by blunt spreading. The volar fascia was identified and a transverse incision was made sharply with a knife. The flat synovial retractor was pushed through the underneath of the transverse carpal ligament, removing synovium from beneath the ligament. The entire carpal tunnel and the fat pad distally was visualized. The blade was inserted into the carpal tunnel, was elevated at the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament, and was pulled proximally, spreading and cutting through the transverse carpal ligament. It was visualized that the entire median nerve had been released, and that configuration of the end of the transverse carpal ligament was a rectangle, denoting that both the deep and the superficial fibers had been cut. The wound was then copiously irrigated with saline...Release Definition Freeing a body part N Explanation Eliminating an abnormal constraint of a body part by cutting or by use of force. Some of the restraining tissue may be taken out but none of the body part is taken out.

Qualifier valu es specify the genetic compati- bility of the body part transplanted. Example: Right kidney transplant (syngeneic) ...the abdomen was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and incision in the right flank, the Gibson technique, performed. In doing so the right pelvis was entered and Book-walter retractor appropriately posi tioned to provide exposure of the external iliac artery and vein. The artery was placed on vessel loop retraction. We then pro- ceeded with the kidney transplant, and the kidney which was trimmed on the back table was brought into the field. The right renal vein was cut short without reconstruction of the inferior vena cava, and single ureter was identified. Kidney was brought up in an ice blanket and an end-to-end anastomosis was per-formed in the usual fashion with 5-0 Prolene between donor renal vein and external iliac vein on the right. The long renal artery was brought into view, and end-to-side anastomosis performed in the usual fashion with 5-0 Prolene. We then turned our attention to performing the neoureterocys- tostomy after appropriate positioning of the graft and evaluation of the vessels. After the anastomosis was completed there was no evidence of leak. A Blake drain was brought out through a stab incision and the tip of the drain placed near the neoureterocystostomy and both wounds were closed. The infrainguinal wound was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl and the kidney transplant wound was closed with #1 PDS...Transplantation YDefinition Putting in or on all or a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or animal to physically take the place and/or function of all or a portion of a similar body part Explanation The native body part may or may not be taken out, and the transplanted body part may take over all or a portion of its function.

Nerves and blood vessels may or may not be reconnected in a R EATTACHMENT procedure. Example: Complex reattachment, left index finger A sharp debridement of grossly contaminated tissue was carried out. It was noted that the extensor mechanism distal to the PIP joint had been lost. There were circumferential lacerations about the finger, save for a cutaneous bridge and ulnar vascular pedi-cle present at the PIP level. Nonviable bony were re moved and then the distal por- tion of the PIP joint was reshaped with removal of cartilage using double- rongeurs. It was noted that the fractures through the proximal phalanx extended longintudinally. Stabilization was then carried out, with 0.062 K-wire brought down through the distal finger, out through the fingertip, and then back into the proximal phalanx centrally. The A2 pulley was restored, using figure of eight interrupted sutures of 4 and 5-0 Vicryl, reapproximating the flexor tendons. The extensor mechanisms ndons were repaired using 4 and 5-0 Vicryl, and anchored to the periosteum on the middle phalanx. A digital nerve was then carried out on the radial aspect of the digit at the PIP joint level using interrupted sutures of 9-0 Ethilon beneath the microscope. At this point, the skin was trimmed, removing skin margins, and then multiple lacerations were closed with 5-0 Prolene...Reattachment MDefinition Putting back in or on all or a portion of a separated body part to its normal location or other suitable location Explanation Vascular circulation and nervous pathways may or may not be reestablished.

In select musculoskeletal body systems, a qualifier is used to specify procedures involving composite tissue transfers, such as musculocutaneous flap transfer. Example: Fasciocutaneous flap from scalp to cheek ...development of the plane of dissection was completed into the superficial temporal fascia. Development of subgaleal dissection posteriorly was then completed, a distance of 7-8 cm, with hemo-stasis by electrocautery. The flaps were advanced to the cheek defect and secured with 2-0 inverted PDS sutures and 3-0 inverted Monocryl... Coding note: body system value The body system value describes the deepest tissue layer in the flap.

The range of R EPOSITION procedures includes moving a body part to its normal location, or moving a body part to a new location to enhance its ability to function. Example: Reposition of undescended right testicle from pelvic region to scrotum ...Following satisfactory induction of general anesthesia, an incision was made in the inguinal region and dissection car-ried down to the pelvic cavity, where the right testis was located and mobilized. The spermatic cord was located and freed from surrounding tissue, and its length judged to be sufficient. A one centimeter incision was made in the scrotum and a pouch created in the usual fashion. The right testicle was mobilized down through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, and stitched in place. Meticulous hemostasis was obtain ed, and the incisions closed in layers...Reposition SDefinition Moving to its normal location or other suitable location all or a portion of a body part Explanation The body part is moved to a new location from an abnormal location, or from a normal location where it is not functioning correctly.

R ESTRICTION includes both intraluminal or extralumi- nal narrowing the diameter. Example: Laparoscopic gastroesophageal fundoplication ...Insufflation was accomplished through a 5 infraumbilical incision. Five separate 5 mm ports were placed under direct visualization other than the initial port. Laparoscopy revealed a large hiatal hernia. Electrocautery was used to free up adhesions from the hernia sac to the stomach. Next, the fundus which had been mobilized was brought down into the stomach and it was felt there was enough mobilization to perform a fundoplication. A generous loose fundoplication was then performed by wrapping the fundus around the esophagus. Interrupted 0 Ethibond sutures were used to secure the stomach in this fashion. There was generally good hemostasis throughout the case. All instruments were removed and ports closed...Restriction Definition Partially closing an orifice or the lumen of a tubular body part V Explanation The orifice can be a natural orifice or an artificially created orifice.

O CCLUSION includes both intraluminal or extraluminal methods of closing off the body part. Division of the tubular body part prior to closing it is an integral part of the O CCLUSION procedure. Example: Uterine artery embolization ...catheter was advanced over a 0.18 Terumo gold guidewire and advanced several centimeters superselectively into the left uterine artery. Contrast injection was performed here, confirming filling of the uterine artery and subsequent opacification of large vascu-lar structures in the uterus compatible with uterine fibroids. A syringe and a half of 500-700 micron biospheres was then instilled slowly through the catheter, and at the conclusion of this infusion there was cessation of flow through the uterine artery. The catheter was then removed and hemostasis achieved...

The range of B YPASS procedures includes normal routes such as those made in coro-nary artery bypass procedures, and abnormal routes such as those made in colostomy formation procedures. Example: Aorto-bifemoral bypass graft ...the patient was prepped and draped, and groin incisions were opened. The common femoral vein and its branches were isolated and Teflon tapes were placed around the vessels. The aorta and iliacs were mobilized. Bleeding points were controlled with electrocautery and Liga clips. Tapes were placed around the vessel, the vessel measured, and the aorta was found to be 12 mm. A 12 x 7 bifurcated microvelour graft was then preclotted with the patient's own blood. An end-to-end anastomosis was made on the aorta and the graft using a running suture of 2-0 Prolene. The limbs were taken down through tunnels noting that the ureters were anterior, and at this point an end-to-side anastomosis was made between the graft and the femoral arteries with running suture of 4-0 Prolene. The inguinal incisions were closed...Bypass Definition Altering the route of passage of the contents of a tubular body part 1 Explanation Rerouting contents around an area of a body part to another distal (downstream) area in the normal route; rerouting the contents to another different but similar route and body part; or to an abnormal route and another dissimilar body part. It includes one or more concurrent anastomoses with or without the use of a device such as autografts, tissue substitutes and synthetic substitutes.

Procedures typical of those coded to I NSERTION include putting in a vascular catheter, a pacemaker lead, or a tissue expander. Example: Port-a-cath placement ...the right chest and neck were prepped and draped in the usual manner and 10 cc's of 1% Lidocaine were injected in the right infraclavicular area. The right subclavian vein was then punctured and a wire was passed through the needle into th e superior vena cava. This was documented by fluoroscopy. Intr oducer kit was introduced into the subclavian vein and the Port-a-cath was placed through the introducer and by fluoroscopy was placed down to the superior vena cava. The pocket was then made over the right pectoralis major muscle, superior to the breast, and the Port-a-cath reservoir was placed into this pocket and tacked down with #0 Prolene sutures.

R EPLACEMENT encompasses a wide range of procedures, from joint replacements to grafts of all kinds. Example: Prosthetic lens implantation ...a superior peritomy was made on the left eye and adequate hemostasis was achieved using eraser cautery. A posterior one-half thickness groove was placed posterior to the blue line. This was beveled forward toward clear cornea. The anterior chamber was entered at the 11:30 position with a blade. The eye was filled with viscoelastic substance. A can-opener type capsulotomy was performed with a cystotome. Hydrodissection was carried out and the lens was rocked gently with a cystotome to loosen it from the cortex. The wound was then opened with corneal scleral scissors. The lens was prolapsed in the ante rior chamber and removed. The anterior chamber was then tempor arily closed with 8-0 Vicryl sutures and cortical clean-up was performed. One of the sutures was removed and a posterior chamber intraocular lens (Alcon model #MZ50BD) was inspected, rinsed, and placed into a capsular bag. Miochol was then instilled into the anterior chamber. The conjunctiva was pulled over the inci-sion and cauterized into place...Replacement RDefinition Putting in or on biological or synthetic material that physically takes the place of all or a portion of a body part Explanation The biological material is non-living, or the biological material is living and from the same individual. The body part may have been previously taken out, previously replaced, or may be taken out concomitantly with the Replacement procedure. If the body part has been previously replaced, a separate Removal procedure is coded for taking out the device used in the previous replacement.

R EPAIR also functions as the \"not elsewhere classified (NEC)\" root operation, to be used when the procedure performed does not meet the definition of one of the other root operations. Fixation devices are included for procedures to repair the bones and joints. Example: Left open inguinal herniorrhaphy ...an incision in the left groin extending on the skin from the internal to the external inguinal ring was made. The external oblique aponeurosis was exposed. The hernia sac was then ligated at the internal ring with non-dissolving sutures. A hernia repair was then performed. The internal oblique fascia was sutured in interrupted stitches to the ilio-pubic fascia. The spermatic cord was then returned to its anatomical position. The external oblique aponeurosis was then repaired in inter- rupted sutures.

Beyond that they have little in common. A F USION procedure puts a dysfunctional joint out of service rather than restoring function to the joint. A LTERATION encompasses a whole range of procedures that share only the fact that they are done to improve the way the patient looks. C RE- ATION represents only two very specific sex change operations. Root operation Objective of procedure Site of procedure Example Fusion Rendering joint immobile Joint Spinal fusionAlteration Modifying body part for cosmetic purposes without affecting functionSome/all of a body part Face lift Creation Making new structure for sex change operationPerineum Artificial vagina/penisRoot operations that define other objectives 2.66 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Fusion\u2014Root operation G\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A limited range of procedures is represented in the root opera- tion F USION, because fusion procedures are by definition only performed on the joints. Qualifier values are used to specify whether a vertebral joint fusion is anterior or posterior. Example: Anterior cervical fusion C-2 through C-4 with bone bank graft ...after skull tong traction was applied, incision was made in the left neck, and Gardner retractors placed to separate the interver-tebral muscles at the C-2 through C-4 levels. Using the drill, a trough was incised on the anterior surface of the C-2 vertebra, and the C-2/C-3 space evacuated with a rongeur, and the accompanying cartilage removed. This procedure was then repeated at the C-3/C-4 level. Bone bank patella strut graft was trimmed with a saw and fash- ioned to fit the C-2/C-3 interspace. After adequate adjustments in the size and shape had been made, the graft was tapped securely into place. The procedure was repeated for the C-3/C-4 level. X-rays revealed good alignment and final position. Traction was gradually decreased to maintain position. Retractors were removed and the fascia was reapproximated with 0 Vicryl...Fusion GDefinition Joining together portions of an articular body part rendering the articular body part immobile Explanation The body part is joined together by fixation device, bone graft, or other means.

All methods, approaches, and devices used for the objective of improving appearance are coded here. Coding note: Alteration Because some surgical procedures can be performed for either medical or cosmetic purposes, coding for A LTERATION requires diagnostic confirmation that the surgery is in fact performed to improve appearance. Example: Cosmetic blepharoplasty ...attention was turned to the redundant upper eyelid skin. The ellipse of skin as marked preoperatively was excised bilaterally. The medial and lateral fat compar tments were open bilaterally. The medial compartment had severe fatty excess and periorbital fat herniation. This was resected.

Root operations MEASUREMENT describes a single level taken, while M ONITORING describes a series of levels obtained at intervals. For example, A single temperature reading is considered M EASUREMENT . Temperature taken every half hour for 8 hours is considered M ONITORING . Instead of defining a device, the sixth character defines the physiological or physical function being tested.

It also includes other procedures, such as hemodialysis and hyper-baric oxygen treatment. These procedures all use equipment to support a physiological function in some way, whether it is breathing, circulating the blood, or restoring the natural rhythm of the heart. The fifth and sixth characters in this section define duration and function respectively. These characters describe the duration of the procedure and the body function being acted upon, rather than the approach and device used. Root operations ASSISTANCE and P ERFORMANCE are two variations of the same kinds of procedures, varying only in the degree of control exer-cised over the physiological function. Coding note: Assistance ASSISTANCE defines procedures that support a physiological function but do not take complete control of it, such as intra-aortic balloon pump to support cardiac output and hyper-baric oxygen treatment.

The body part may have been previously taken out, previously replaced, or may be taken out concomitantly with the Replacement procedure. If the body part has been previously replaced, a separate Removal procedure is coded for taking out the device used in the previous replacement. Examples Total hip replacement, free skin graft Reposition Definition Moving to its normal location or other suitable location all or a portion of a body part Explanation The body part is moved to a new location from an abnormal location, or from a normal location where it is not functioning correctly. The body part may or may not be cut out or off to be moved to the new location. Examples Reposition of undescended testicle, fracture reduction Resection Definition Cutting out or off, without replacement, all of a body part Explanation None Examples Total nephrectomy, total lobectomy of lung Restriction Definition Partially closing an orifice or the lumen of a tubular body part Explanation The orifice can be a natural orifice or an artificially created orifice. Examples Esophagogastric fundoplication, cervical cerclage Revision Definition Correcting, to the extent possible, a malfunctioning or displaced deviceRoot operations ICD-10-PCS definitions A.7Preliminary 12/10/07 Explanation Revision can include correcting a malfunctioning or displaced device by taking out or putting in components of the device such as a screw or pin. Examples Adjustment of pacemaker lead, adjustment of hip prosthesis Transfer Definition Moving, without taking out, all or a portion of a body part to another location to take over the function of all or a portion of a body part Explanation The body part transferred remains connected to its vascular and nervous supply. Examples Tendon transfer, skin pedicle flap transfer Transplantation Definition Putting in or on all or a portion of a living body part taken from another individual or animal to physically take the place and/or function of all or a portion of a similar body part Explanation The native body part may or may not be taken out, and the transplanted body part may take over all or a portion of its function.

It is not possible to construct a procedure code from the alphabetic index. The purpose of the alphabetic index is to locate the appropriate table that contains all information neces-sary to construct a procedure code. A.2. All seven characters must contain valid values to be a valid procedure code. If the documentation is incomplete for coding purposes, the physician should be queried for the necessary information. A.3. The columns in the Tables contain the values for characters four through seven. The rows delineate the valid combinations of values. Any combination of values not contained in a single row of the Tables is invalid. A.4. \"And,\" when used in a code description, means \"and/or.\" Example: Lower Arm and Wrist Muscle means lower arm and/or wrist muscle.B.4 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary B.

Body systems contain body part values that include con- tiguous body parts. These general body part values are used: a. When a procedure is performed on the general body part as a whole. b. When the specific body part cannot be determined.c. In the root operations Change, Removal and Revision, when the specific body part value is not in the table. Example: Esophagus is a general body part value; Esopha- gus, Upper is a specific body part value. B2.2. Three body systems contain body part values that repre- sent general anatomical regions, upper extremity anatomical regions, and lower extremity anatomical regions respectively. These body part values are used when a procedure is per-formed on body layers that span more than one body system. Example: Debridement of skin, muscle, and bone at a proce- dure site is coded to the anatomical regions body systems. Exception: Composite tissue transfers are coded to the specific body systems (Muscles or Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia). In these body systems, qualifiers delineate the body layers involved. B2.3. Body systems designated as upper or lower contain body parts located above or below the diaphragm respectively. Example: Upper Veins body parts are above the diaphragm; Lower Veins body parts are below the diaphragm. Root operation guidelines B3.1. In order to determine the appropriate root operation, the full definition of the root operation as contained in the Tables must be applied. B3.2. Components of a procedure necessary to complete the objective of the procedure specified in the root operation are considered integral to the procedure and are not coded separately. Example : Resection of a joint is in tegral to joint replacement. ICD-10-PCS draft coding guidelines B.5Preliminary 12/10/07 Multiple procedures B3.3. During the same operative episode, multiple procedures are coded if: a. The same root operation is performed on different body parts as defined by distinct values of the body part character. Example: Diagnostic excision of liver and pancreas are coded separately. b. The same root operation is repeated at different body sites that are included in the same body part value. Example: Excision of the sartorius muscle and excision of the gracilis muscle are both included in the upper leg mus- cle body part value, and multiple procedures are coded. Destruction of separate skin body sites on the face are all included in the body part value Skin, Face, and multiple procedures are coded. c. Multiple root operations with distinct objectives are per- formed on the same body part. Example: Destruction of sigmoid lesion and bypass of sig- moid colon are coded separately. d. The intended root operation is attempted using one approach, but is converted to a different approach. Example: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted to an open cholecystectomy is coded as endoscopic Inspection and open Resection. Discontinued procedures B3.4. If the intended procedure is discontinued, code the procedure to the root operation performed. If a procedure is discontinued before any other root operation is performed, code the root operation Inspection of the body part or anatomi-cal region inspected. Example: Ureteroscopy with unsuccessful extirpation of ure- teral stone is coded to Inspection of ureter. Bypass B3.5. Bypass procedures are coded according to the direction of flow of the contents of a tubular body part: the body part value identifies the origin of the bypass and the qualifier identi-fies the destination of the bypass. Example: Bypass from stomach to je junum, stomach (origin) is the body part and jejunum (destination) is the qualifier. Note: Coronary arteries are coded differently. The body part value identifies the number of coronary artery sites bypassed. The qualifier identifies the origin of the bypass.B.6 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary B3.6. If multiple coronary artery sites are bypassed, a separate procedure is coded for each coronary artery site that uses a dif-ferent device and/or qualifier. Example: Aortocoronary artery bypass and internal mammary coronary artery bypass are coded separately. Control B3.7. If an attempt to stop postprocedural bleeding is unsuc- cessful and requires performing Bypass, Detachment, Excision, Extraction, Reposition, Replacement, or Resection to stop the bleeding, then that root operation is coded instead of Control. Example: Resection of spleen to stop postprocedural bleeding is coded to Resection instead of Control. Diagnostic excision B3.8. If a diagnostic excision (biopsy) is followed by a thera- peutic excision at the same procedure site, or by resection of the body part during the same operative episode, code only the therapeutic excision or resection. Example: Biopsy of breast followed by partial mastectomy at the same procedure site, only the partial mastectomy procedure is coded. Inspection B3.9. Inspection of a body part(s) integral to the performance of the procedure is not coded separately. Example: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with irrigation of bronchus, only the irrigation procedure is coded. B3.10. If multiple body parts are inspected, the body part char- acter is defined as the general body part value that identifies the entire area inspected. If no general body part value is pro-vided, the body part character is defined as the most distal body part inspected. Example: Laparoscopy of pelvic orga ns is coded to the pelvic region body part value. Cystoureteroscopy with inspection of bladder and ureters is coded to the ureter body part value. Division and Release B3.11. If the sole objective of the procedure is separating a nontubular body part, the root operation is Division. If the sole objective of the procedure is freeing a body part without cutting the body part, the root operation is Release. B3.12. In the root operation Release, the body part value coded is the body part being freed and not the tissue being manipu-lated or cut to free the body part. Example: Lysis of intestinal adhesions is coded to one of the intestine body part values. ICD-10-PCS draft coding guidelines B.7Preliminary 12/10/07 Fusion of vertebral joints B3.13. If multiple vertebral joints included in the same body part value are fused, a separate procedure is coded for each joint that uses a different device and/or qualifier. Joints between two areas of the spine (e.g., cervicothoracic vertebral joint) have their own body part values and are coded separately. Example: Fusion of C-4/5 with fixation device and C-5/6 with bone graft are coded separately. Fusion of the C-5/6 joint and the C7-T1 joint are coded separately. Fracture treatment B3.14. Reduction of a displaced fracture is coded to the root operation Reposition. Treatment of a nondisplaced fracture is coded to the procedure performed. Example: Putting a pin in a nondisplaced fracture is coded to the root operation Insertion. Casting of a nondisplaced fracture is coded to the root operation Immobilization in the Placement section. Transplantation B3.15. Putting in a mature and functioning living body part taken from another individual or animal is coded to the root operation Transplantation. Putting in autologous or nonautolo-gous cells is coded to the Administration section. Example: Putting in autologous or nonautologous bone marrow, pancreatic islet cells or stem cells is coded to the Administra-tion section. Body part guidelines B4.1. If a procedure is performed on a portion of a body part that does not have a separate body part value, code the body part value corresponding to the whole body part. Example: A procedure performed on the alveolar process of the mandible is coded to the mandible body part. B4.2. If the prefix \"peri\" is used with a body part to identify the site of the procedure, the body part value is defined as the body part named. Example: A procedure site identified as perirenal is coded to the kidney body part. B4.3. If the procedure documentation uses a body part to fur- ther specify the site of the procedure, the body part value is defined as the body part on which the procedure is performed. Example: A procedure site identified as the prostatic urethra is coded to the urethra body part.B.8 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary Coronary arteries B4.4. The coronary arteries are classified as a single body part. They are further specified by number of sites treated, not by name or number of arteries. Separate body part values are pro-vided to indicate the number of sites treated, when the same procedure is performed on multiple sites in the coronary arteries. Example: Two dilations with stents of a coronary artery are coded as dilation of Coronary Artery, Two Sites, with intralumi-nal device. Two dilations, one with stent and one without, are coded separately as dilation of Coronary Artery, One Site, with intraluminal device, and dilation of Coronary Artery, One Site, with no device. Bilateral body part values B4.5. Bilateral body part values are available for a limited num- ber of body parts. They are included in the system on the basis of frequency and common practice. If the identical procedure is performed on contralateral body parts, and a bilateral body part value exists for that body part, a single procedure is coded using the bilateral body part value. If no bilateral body part value exists, code each procedure separately using the appro-priate body part value. Example: The identical procedure performed on both fallopian tubes is coded once using the body part value Fallopian Tube, Bilateral. The identical procedure performed on both knee joints is coded twice using the body part values Knee Joint, Right and Knee Joint, Left. Body parts near a joint B4.6. Procedures performed on tendons, ligaments, bursae and fascia supporting a joint are coded to the body part that is the focus of the procedure, in the respective body system. Proce-dures performed on joint structures are coded to the body part in the joint body systems. Example: Repair of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee is coded to the knee body part in the bursae and ligaments body system. Shoulder arthroscopy with shaving of articular cartilage is coded to the shoulder joint body part. B4.7. In body systems containing skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and tendon body part values, where a specific body part value does not exist for the area surrounding a joint, the corresponding body part is coded as follows: Shoulder is coded to Upper Arm Elbow is coded to Lower Arm Wrist is coded to Lower Arm Hip is coded to Upper Leg Knee is coded to Lower Leg ICD-10-PCS draft coding guidelines B.9Preliminary 12/10/07 Ankle is coded to Foot Fingers and toes B4.8. If a body system does not contain a separate body part value for fingers, procedures performed on the fingers are coded to the body part value for the hand. If a body system does not contain a separate body part value for toes, proce-dures performed on the toes are coded to the body part value for the foot. Example: Excision of finger muscle is coded to the hand mus- cle body part value. Humerus B4.9. Procedures performed on the distal (elbow) end of the humerus are coded to the humeral shaft body part value. Skin glands and ducts B4.10. Procedures performed on skin and breast glands and ducts are coded to body part values in the body system Skin and Breast. Forequarter and hindquarter B4.11. In the anatomical regions body system containing lower extremities body parts, the body part value Forequarter describes the entire upper limb plus the scapula and clavicle, and the body part value Hindquarter describes the entire lower limb including all of the hip and the buttock. Nerves and vessels B4.12. Nerves and vessels that are not identified by a separate body part value are coded to the closest proximal branch identi-fied by a body part value. Example: A procedure performed on the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve is coded to the trigeminal nerve body part value. Approach guidelines B5.1. Procedures performed using the open approach with per- cutaneous endoscopic assistance are coded to approach value 0, Open. Endoscopic assistance Example: Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy is coded to approach value 0, Open. B5.2. Procedures performed via natural or artificial opening with percutaneous endoscopic assistance are coded to approach value F, Via Natural or Artificial Opening with Percutaneous Endoscopic Assistance. Example: Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is coded to approach value F, Via Natural or Artificial Opening with Percutaneous Endoscopic Assistance.B.10 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07Preliminary External approach B5.3a. Procedures performed within an orifice on structures that are visible without the aid of any instrumentation are coded to approach value X, External. Example: Resection of tonsils is coded to approach value X, External. B5.3b. Procedures performed indirectly by the application of external force through the intervening body layers are coded to approach value X, External. Example: Closed reduction of fracture is coded to approach value X, External. Indwelling device B5.4a. Procedures performed via indwelling device are coded to approach value 3, Percutaneous. Example: Fragmentation of kidney stone performed via percuta- neous nephrostomy is coded to approach value 3, Percutaneous. B5.4b. Procedures performed on a device, as defined in the root operations Change, Irrigation, Removal and Revision, are coded to the procedure performed. Example: Irrigation of percutaneous nephrostomy tube is coded to the root operation Irrigation of indwelling device in the Administration section. Device guidelines B6.1. A device is coded only if a device remains after the proce- dure is completed. If no device remains, the device value No Device is coded. B6.2. Materials such as sutures, ligatures, radiological markers and temporary post-operative wound drains are considered integral to the performance of a procedure and are not coded as devices. B6.3. A separate procedure to put in a drainage device is coded to the root operation Drainage with the device value Drainage Device. B6.4. If, as part of a procedure, an autograft is obtained from a different body part, a separate procedure is coded. Example: Coronary bypass with excision of saphenous vein graft, excision of saphenous vein is coded separately. ICD-10-PCS draft coding guidelines B.11Preliminary 12/10/07 C.

The Obstetrics section includes only the procedures per- formed on the products of conception. Procedures performed on the pregnant female other than the products of conception are coded to a root operation in the Medical and Surgical section. Example: Episiotomy is coded to a root operation in the and Surgical section.B.12 ICD-10-PCS Reference Manual12/10/07PreliminaryGlossary G.1Preliminary 12/10/07 Glossary Character One of the seven
