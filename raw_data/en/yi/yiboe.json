Laboratory -confirmed case: A case that is confirmed by one or more of the laboratory methods listed in the case definition under Laboratory Confirmation Tests While other laboratory methods can be used in clinical diagnosis, only those listed are accepted as laboratory confirmation f or national and state reporting purposes. Probable case: A case that is classified as probable for reporting purposes Supportive o r presumptive laboratory results: Specified laboratory results that are consistent with the diagnosis, yet do not meet the criteria for laboratory confirmation Suspect case: A case that is classified as suspect for reporting purposes Normally sterile sit e: Invasive diseases typically cause significant morbidity and mortality. Sterile sites include: Blood (excluding cord blood) Bone or bone marrow Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Pericardial fluid Peritoneal fluid Pleural fluid The following are also considered sterile sites when certain other criteria are met: Internal body sites (brain, heart, liver, spleen, vitreous fluid, kidney, pancreas, lymph node or ovary) when the specimen is collected aseptically during a surgical procedure Joint fluid when the joint su rface is intact (no abscess or significant break in the skin) Although placentas and amniotic fluid from an intact amnion are not considered sterile sites, isolation of Group B streptococ ci or Listeria from these sites may qualify as invasive disease. Con sult the Sterile Site and Invasive Disease Determination flowchart in Appendix A of the EAIDB Investigation Guidelines for mo re information: https://www.dshs.texas.gov/ID CU/investigation/Investigation -Guidance/ Normally sterile sites do not include : Anatomical areas of the body that normally harbor either resident or transient flora (bacteria) including mucous membranes (e .g., throat, vagina), sputum, and skin; abscesses; or localized soft tissue infection Table of Contents Revision date : March 2021 ~ viii ~ ABBREVIATIONS LABORATORY TEST ABBREVIATIONS CF - Complement fixation CIDT - Culture -independent diagnostic testing CLSI - Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute CSF - Cerebrospinal fluid DFA - Direct fluorescent antibody DNA - Deoxyribonucleic acid EEG - Electroencephalogram - Immunodiffusion IFA - Indirect fluorescent antibody test IgG - Immunoglobulin G IgM - Immunoglobulin M IHA - Indirect hemagglutination IHC - Immunohistochemistry LA - Latex agglutination MA -- Microa gglutination MIC - Minimum inhibitory concentration MRI - Magnetic resonance imaging NAT - Nucleic acid testing PCR - Polymerase chain reaction PRNT - Plaque reduction neutralization test RIBA - Recombinant immunoblot RIPA transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR - Reverse transcript ion polymerase chain reaction WB - Western blot HEPATITIS TEST MARKERS Hepatitis A - HAV Anti-HAV - hepatitis A antibody Anti-HAV IgM - hepatitis A IgM antibody Hepatitis B - HBV HBcAb or anti -HBc - hepatitis B core antibody HBc IgM or anti -HBc IgM - hepatitis B core IgM antibody HBeAb or anti -HBe - hepatitis B e antibody HBeAg - hepatitis B e antigen HBsAb or anti -HBs - hepatitis B surfac e antibody HBsAg - hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C - HCV Anti HCV - hepatitis C antibody HCV RNA - hepatitis C nucleic acid HCV NAT - hepatitis C nucleic acid testing HCV RIBA - hepatitis C recombinant immunoblot assay Hepatitis D - HDV Anti-HDV - hepatitis D antibody Hepatitis E - HEV Anti-HEV IgM - hepatitis E IgM antibody OTHER ABBREVIATIONS : ALT - Alanine transaminase ARDS - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome AST - Aspartate transaminase CDC - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DSHS - Department of State Health Services EAIDB - Emerging and Acute Infectious Disease Branch FDA - Food and Drug Administration HAI- Healthcare Associated Infections ILI - Influenza -Like Illness NDM -1 - New Delhi Metallo -beta-lactamase -1 NPDPSC - The National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center TAC - Texas Administrative Code VHF - Viral hemorrhagic fever Table of Contents Revision date : March 2021 ~ ix ~ NOTES Rickettsia Classification Rickettsial diseases can be difficult to distinguish between because of overlapping symptomatology and cross -reactivity in serology, which comprises the majority of diagnostic testing for these diseases. The Rickettsia are divided into two antigenic groups for surveillance purposes: spotted fever group and typhus group. The condition spotted fever rickettsiosis is defined as infection with spotted fever group Rickettsia spread by tick vectors. Flea -borne (murine) typhus, caused primarily by R. typhi and spr ead by fleas, and epidemic typhus, caused by R. prowazekii and transmitted by lice, belong to the typhus group. A table classifying Rickettsial species known to cause disease in humans by antigenic group, disease, primary vector, and reservoir occurrence c an be found in the CDC's Traveler's Health Yellow -positive organisms that often occur as chains or pairs. There are four different classification systems for Streptococcus species, c linical (pyogenic, Lancefield group Streptococci are subdivided into groups by antibodies that recognize surface The serologic reactivity of antigens were established, Lancefield A -H and K -U. Clinically significant Lancefield groups include A, B, C, F, and G. Some streptococci such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci group nontypeable. Hemolytic reaction The type of hemolytic reaction displayed on blood agar has also been used to classify the streptococci. Beta-hemolysis is associated with complete lysis of red cells surrounding the colony, whereas alpha -hemolysis is a partial or \"green\" hemolysis associated with reduction of red cell hemoglobin. Nonhemolytic colonies have been termed ga mma -hemolytic. The property of hemolysis is not very reliable for the absolute identification of streptococci, but it is widely u sed in rapid screens for identification . Reportable Streptococcus Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) - Most strains -hemolytic but can cause \u00df -hemolysis during anaerobic incubation. They are nontypeable by Lancefield group. Table of Contents 10 Revision date : March 2021 CASE CRITERIA Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Acute Flaccid Myelitis 11120 An illness with onset of acute flaccid limb weakness (low muscle tone, limp, hanging loosely, not spastic or contracted ) of one or more limbs . Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical symptoms AND confirmatory laboratory /imaging evidence in the absence of a clear alternative diagnosis attributable to a nationally notifiable condition . Probable: A case that meets the clinical symptoms AND presumptive laboratory/imaging evidence in the absence of a clear alternative diagnosis attributable to a nationally notifiable condition . Presumptive laboratory/imaging evidence: MRI showing spinal cord lesion where gray matter involvement is present, but predominance cannot be determined, AND Excluding persons with gray matter lesions in the spinal cord resulting from physician diagnosed malignancy, vascular disease, or anatomic abnormalities. Supportive laboratory/imaging evidence: MRI showing spinal cord lesion in at least some gray matter and spanning one or more vertebral segments, AND Excluding persons with gray matter lesions in the spinal cord resulting from physician diagnosed malignancy, vascular disease, or anatomic abnormalities. Suspect : A case that meets the clinical symptoms with supportive laboratory/imaging evidence AND available information is insufficient to classify case as probable or confirmed. Other classification criteria: Autopsy findings that include histopathologic evidence of inflammation largely involving the an terior horn of the spinal cord spanning one or more vertebral segments. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) showing spinal cord lesion with predominant gray matter* involvement and spanning one or more vertebral segments, Excluding persons with gray matter lesions in the spinal cord resulting from physician diagnosed malignancy, vascular disease, or anatomic abnormalities. * Terms in the spinal cord MRI report such as \"affecting mostly gray matter,\" \"affecting the anterior horn or anterior cells,\" \"affecting the central cord,\" \"anterior myelitis,\" or \"poliomyelitis\" would all be consistent with this terminology. 11 Revision date : March 2021 Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Amebic meningitis/encephalitis, Granulom atous amebic encephalitis (GAE) can include general symptoms and signs of encephalitis such as early personality and behavioral changes, depressed mental status, fever, photophobia, seizures, nonspecific cranial nerve dysfunction, and visual loss. GAE neur ologic infections are generally fatal within weeks or months; however, a few patients have survived. Confirmed: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Note: Acanthamoeba species and Balamuthia mandrillaris can also cause disseminated disease (affecting multiple organ systems) or cutaneous disease. For B. mandrillaris disease, painless skin lesions appearing as plaques a few millimeters thick and one to several centimeters wide have been observed in some patients, especiall y patients outside the U.S., preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms by 1 month to approximately 2 years. Skin lesions and sinus disease may be seen in Acanthamoeba disease. Disseminated disease and cutaneous disease caused by free -living amebae are onl y voluntarily reportable in Texas unless they progress to meningitis or encephalitis. See also Amebic another non free-living ameba a clinical specimen or culture via: Detection of nucleic acid (e.g., PCR), OR Detection of antigen (e.g., immunohistochemistry) Contact the DSHS epidemiologist for meningitis (amebic) at 800 -252-8239 if suspected.

Collection & shipping procedures can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/ and http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/balamuthia/ Note: Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris can cause clinically similar illnesses and might be difficult to differentiate using commonly available laboratory procedures. Definitive diagnosis by a reference laboratory might be required. A negative test on CSF does not rule out Acanthamoeba or Balamuthia infection because these organisms are not commonly present in the CSF. 12 Revision date : March 2021 Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary (PAM) 80750 An infection presenting as meningoencephalitis or encephalitis. The clinical presentation of PAM is like that of acute meningitis caused by other pathogens and symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, lethargy, and stiff neck. Disorientation, mental status changes, seizure activity, loss of consciousness, and ataxia may occur within hours of initial presentation. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually results in d eath within 3 to 7 days. Confirmed : A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case that meets at least one of the supportive laboratory criteria (listed below) and does not meet confirmatory lab criteria Supportive laboratory evidence: o Visualization of motile amebae in a wet mount of CSF o Isolation of N. fowleri in culture from a clinical specimen See also Amebic meningitis/encephalitis, other Detection of Naegleria fowleri from a clinical specimen via: Detection of nucleic acid (e.g., PCR), OR Detection of antigen (e.g., immunohistochemistry) Notes: When available, molecular characterization [e.g., genotype] should be reported. Contact the DSHS epidemiologist for amebic meningitis at 800 -252-8239 if suspected. DSHS can assist in coordinating specimen and/or electronic images submission to the CDC for verification. Collection & shipping procedures can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/diagno sis-hcp.html Naegleria fowleri might cause clinically similar illness to bacterial meningitis, particularly in its early stages. Definitive diagnosis by a reference laboratory is required. Unlike Balamuthia mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba spp., N. fowleri is commonly found in the CSF of patients with PAM. Anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection ) 11090 Anaplasmosis by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum , transmitted primarily by blacklegged spp.). Initial symptoms may headache, myalgia, nausea /vomiting and diarrhea. Anaplasmosis may result in severe illness or even death in older or immunocompromised individuals or if treatment is delayed.

Fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy can accompany the lesion. Inhalation: A prodrome resembling a viral respiratory illness, followed by hypoxia and dyspnea, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with resulting cyanosis and shock. Radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening or pleural effusion is common. Ingestion presents as two sub -types: Gastrointestinal: Severe abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, bloody diarrhea, anorexia, fever , and septicemia. Oropharyngeal: Mucosal lesion in the oral cavity or oropharynx, with cervical adenopathy, edema, pharyngitis, fever, and possible septicemia. Injection : Severe soft tissue infection manifested as significant edema or bruising after injection. No eschar is apparent and p ain is not common. Nonspecific symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and nausea are sometimes the first indication of illness. Systemic involvement: May include fever, convulsions, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, leukocytosis, and /or meningeal signs (anthrax meningitis). These complications may be secondary to the above syndromes.

B. cereus expressing anthrax toxin isolates should be forwarded for confirmation. 14 Revision date : March 2021 fever 10065 Western equine encephalitis virus For the purposes of surveillance and reporting, arboviral disease cases are often categorized into two primary groups based on their clinical presentation: neuroinvasive disease and non -neuroinvasive disease. Many arboviruses cause disease such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). These illnesses are usually characterized by the acute onset of fever with stiff neck, altered mental status, seizures, limb weakness, CSF pleocytosis, and/or abnormal neuroimaging. Less common neurological manifestations, such as cranial nerve palsies, also occur . AFP is characterized by rapid -onset extremity, facial, and/or respiratory weakness and flaccid muscle tone in the a ffected area; AFP may result from anterior myelitis, peripheral neuritis -infectious peripheral demyelinating neuropathy (Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome ). Meningitis is infection or inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain; symptoms can include fe ver, headache, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity . Encephalitis is infection or inflammation of the brain tissue itself and may present with fever, altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits; meningitis may also be present simultaneously, known as meningoencephalitis. Most arboviruses are capable of causing an acute systemic febrile illness (e.g., West Nile fever) that may include headache, myalgias, arthralgias, rash, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Some viruses also can cause more char acteristic clinical manifestations, such as severe polyarthralgia or arthritis due to chikungunya virus or other alphaviruses. Clinical evidence of neuroinvasive disease: Meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, or other acute signs of central o r peripheral neurologic dysfunction, as documented by a physician, AND Absence of a more likely clinical explanation Clinical evidence of non -neuroinvasive disease : Fever or chills as reported by the patient or a health -care provider, AND Absence of neuroinvasive disease, AND Absence of a m ore likely clinical explanation Neuroinvasive: Confirmed : A clinically compatible case (meets neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with laboratory confirmation Probable: A clinically compatible case (meets neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with virus -specific IgM antibodies in CSF or serum but no other testing OR with lower levels of neutralizing antibodies for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred . Non-neuroinvasive: Confirmed : A clinically compatible case (meets non -neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with laboratory confirmation Probable: A clinically compatible case (meets non -neuroinvasive clinical evidence criteria) with virus -specific IgM antibodies in serum but no other testing OR with lower levels of neutralizing antibodies for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred Note: If lab evidence, clinical manifestations, and exposure history cannot distinguish between two arboviruses, the case should be reported as \"Arbovirus, other.\" Neuroinvasive Isolation of virus from, or demonstration of specific viral antigen or nucleic acid in, tissue, blood, CSF, or other body fluid, OR Four-fold or greater change in virus -specific quantitative antibody titers in paired sera , OR Virus IgM antibodies in serum with confirmatory virus -specific neutralizing antibodies in the same or a later specimen, and negative neutralizing antibody results for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exposure occurred, OR Virus -specific IgM antibodies in CSF and a negative result for other IgM antibodies in CSF for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region where exp osure occurred Non-neuroinvasive Isolation of virus from, or demonstration of specific viral antigen or nucleic acid in, tissue, blood, or other body fluid, excluding CSF , OR Four-fold or greater change in virus -specific quantitative antibody titers in paired sera, OR Virus -specific IgM antibodies in serum with confirmatory virus -specific neutralizing antibodies in the same or a later specimen and negative neutralizing antibody results for potentially cross -reactive* arboviruses endemic to the region wh ere exposure occurred *Viruses in the same genus (the majority of pathogenic arboviruses are in the flavivirus, alphavirus, or orthobunyavirus genus) are generally considered potentially cross - reactive. Consider area of exposure, clinical manifestations of each arbovirus, and level of arbovirus activity when assessing which viruses must be ruled out .15 Revision date : March 2021 Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Ascariasis 80770 infection caused by spp. are asymptomatic. Live worms, passed in stool or occasionally from the mouth, anus, or nose, are often the first recognized sign of infection . Larval migration may result in pulmonary manifestations such as wheezing, cough, fever, eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltration in some patients. Light infections may result in minor abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, and loss of appetite. Heavy infections may result in severe abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, or weight loss. In children, these symptoms can result in nutrient deficiencies resulting in growth retardation and/or cognitive impairment. Serious complications are rare but can be fatal and includ e intestinal obstruction by a bolus of worms, or obstruction of bile duct, pancreatic duct or appendix by one or more adult worms. Confirmed: A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable : A clinically compatible case with evidence of infection such as An ultrasound showing Ascaris spp. worms in the pancreas or liver, OR CT scans or MRI showing Ascaris spp. worms present in the ducts of the liver or pancreas .Microscopic identification of Ascaris spp. (A.lumbricoid es or A. suum ) eggs OR Microscopic asc arid larvae in sputum or gastric washings, OR Identification of A. lumbricoides or A. suum adult worms passed from the anus, mouth, or nose Babesiosis 12010 Babesiosis is a parasitic disease caused by organisms in the Babesia genus.

Some strains of C. auris are resistant to the three major classes of antifungals, severely limiting treatment options. C. auris can spread in healthcare settings and cause outbreaks. C. auris can colonize patients' skin and other body sites, perhaps indefinitely, and colonization poses a risk both for invasive infection and transmission. C. auris persists in the healthcare environment for weeks, and certain routinely used disinfectants in heal thcare settings are not effective against the organism. Past epidemiological investigations have demonstrated that one -third to half of all patients on a given unit, especially in a long -term care setting, can become colonized with C. auris within weeks of an index patient entering the facility. Confirmed : A case that has confirmatory laboratory test. Probable : A case that has an isolate that is a Candida haemulonii or a yeast isolate that was unable to be identified that is from a person who is within s ame household, same healthcare facility, or in a healthcare facility that commonly shares patients with a facility, with another person with confirmatory laboratory evidence. Confirmatory laboratory evidence: Detection of C. auris from any body site using either culture or a culture independent diagnostic test (CIDT) (e.g., Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR]). Note: As required by TAC, all isolates identified as Candida auris must be submitted to the DSHS Laboratory. Any yeast isolate identified as C. haemulonii or any yeast isolate that had identification attempted without successful identification can be sent to DSHS Laboratory.

The organism may also rarely cause extra -intestinal infections such as bacteremia, meningitis or other focal infections. Confirmed : A case that is laboratory confirmed Probable: A case with Campylobacter spp. detected. in a clinical specimen using a culture independent diagnostic test (CI DT) OR A clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically linked to a case that meets the probable or confirmed laboratory criteria for diagnosis Notes: A case should not be counted as a new case if laboratory results were reported within 30 days of a previously reported infection in the same individual, unless additional information is available indicating a separate inf ection, e.g., different species. Isolation of Campylobacter spp. , are gram - negative bacilli that are resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae have the ability to break down the carbapenem antibiotic rendering it ineffective. Carbapenem resistance by Enterobacteriaceae can occur by many different mechanisms, such as KPC and NDM, which can be transmitted from one Enterobacteriaceae to another. Although Enterobacter species can be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, Enterobacter species are not included in this CRE definition. Klebsiella aerogenes , previously known as Enterobacter aerogenes , does meet the case definition. CRE can colonize or infect any body site. The most common types of CRE infections include bloodstream infections, ventilator -associated pneumonia, and intra-abdominal abscesses. Confirmed: A Klebsiella species, E. aerogenes , or E. coli from any body site that is laboratory confirmed.

The acute phase is characterized by the first 8 weeks of infection, detectable parasitemia, and asymptomatic (most common) or symptomatic manifestations of disease which can include any of the following: Fever, malaise, rash, body aches, headache, loss o f appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, Chagoma (nodular swelling at site of (unilateral swelling of the eyelid), acute myocarditis, and/or meningoencephalitis. Confirmed : A case (asymptomat ic or symptomatic) that has confirmatory laboratory testing. Asymptomatic individuals must have evidence of parasitemia based on microscopy or PCR. Probable A clinically compatible case with positive diagnostic serology for T. cruzi IgG antibodies in a sa mple collected within 8 weeks of illness onset . Notes: T. cruzi IgM tests are unreliable and are thus insufficient evidence of infection. Samples forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing which test negative cannot be classified as cases. Please refer to the DSHS website for guidance on Chagas disease testing: www.dshs.texas.gov/IDCU/disease/Chagas/humans/ Identification of T. cruzi by microscopy including: Microscopic of T. cruzi by: Wet mount - motile trypanosomes OR Thick & thin smears - Giemsa stain OR Detection of T. cruzi DNA by PCR OR Positive diagnostic serology confirmed by testing at CDC Note: Congenital infections are considered acute up to 8 weeks of age and can be diagnosed by confirmatory tests. Infants < 12 months and epidemiologically -linked need to be retested after 12 months of age. Chagas disease, chronic indeterminate 12043 Following the acute phase, most infected people enter into a prolonged, asymptomatic form of disease (called \"chronic indeterminate\") during which few or no parasites are found in the blood. During this time, most people are unaware of their infection. Man y people remain asymptomatic for life and never develop chronic Chagas -related symptoms. Confirmed : An asymptomatic case >12 months of age with confirmatory lab results Probable : An asymptomatic case >12 months of age with positive diagnostic serology for T. cruzi IgG antibodies Suspect: An asymptomatic case 12 months of age with positive (reactive) blood donor screening Notes: Samples forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing which test negative cannot be classified as cases. Patients with positive diagnostic serology should have confirmatory testing performed at the CDC. Patients with positive blood donor screening should have T. cruzi IgG testing at a commercial lab. Women with chronic indeterminate disease can transmi t infection to their unborn babies. Infants <12 months of age with a mother from an endemic area, in absence of direct detection of the organism, cannot be classified or ruled out due to maternal antibodies; perform serology at 12 months of age and classif y based on presence or absence of symptoms as chronic symptomatic or chronic indeterminate case definition . Please refer to the DSHS website for guidance on Chagas disease testing: www.d shs.texas.gov/IDCU/disease/Chagas/humans/ Detection of antibody specific to T. cruzi by TWO distinct diagnostic tests performed at CDC Note: No single supportive test has the sensitivity and specificity to be relied on alone, thus two different methods or antibodies specific to T. cruzi are used. 20 Revision date : March 2021 Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Chagas disease, chronic symptomatic 12042 Much like the chronic indeterminate phase, the chronic symptomatic phase of disease (more than 8 weeks post infection) is characterized by undetectable parasitemia. However, an estimated 20 - 30% of infected people will develop debilitating and sometimes l ife- threatening medical problems over the course of their lives. Complications of chronic Chagas disease may include heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause sudden death, a dilated heart that doesn't pump blood well, and/or a dilated esophagus or colon, leading to difficulties with eating or passing stool. Confirmed : A clinically compatible case of physician -diagnosed chronic Chagas disease in a patient >12 months of age with confirmatory laboratory results Probable : A clinically compatible case of physician -diagnosed chronic Chagas disease in a patient >12 months of age with positive diagnostic serology for T. cruzi IgG antibodies Suspect: A clinically compatible case of physician -diagnosed chronic Chagas disease in a patient 12 months of age with positive (reactive) blood donor screening Notes: Samples forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing which test negative cannot be classified as cases. Patients with positive diagnostic serology should have confirmatory testing performed at the CDC. Patients with positive blood donor screening should have T. cruzi IgG testing at a commercial lab. Women with chronic indeterminate disease can transmit infec tion to their unborn babies. Infants < 12 months of age with a mother from an endemic area, in absence of direct detection of the organism, cannot be classified or ruled out due to maternal antibodies; perform serology at 12 months of age and classify based on presence or absence of symptoms as chronic symptomatic or chronic indeterminate case definition.

Infection occurs when the tapeworm eggs are ingested, hatch into larvae, and migrate to tissues where they f orm cysticerci (cysts). The signs and symptoms of cysticercosis reflect the development of cysticerci in various sites. Subcutaneous cysticerci may be visible or palpable. When cysticerci are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis, which can cause diverse manifestations including seizures, mental disturbances, focal neurologic deficits, and signs of space -occupying intracerebral lesions. Death can occur suddenly. Extracerebral cysticercosis can cause ocular, cardiac, or spinal lesio ns with associated signs and symptoms. Asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules and calcified intramuscular nodules can be encountered. Confirmed: Laboratory confirmation of the presence of cysticercus in tissue Notes: Documentation of biopsy or imaging results is required . Demonstration of T. solium eggs and proglottids in the feces are diagnostic of (see Taenia solium and undifferentiated Taeniasis ), not cysticercosis. who are found to have eggs or prog lottids in their feces should be evaluated serologically since autoinfection, resulting in cysticercosis, can occur. Blood tests are availabl e to help diagnose an infection but are not always accurate. While suggestive, it does not necessarily prove that c ysticercosis is present. Diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is usually made by MRI or CT brain scans in order to identify the presence of cysticerci. If surgery is necessary, confirmation of the diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the cysticercus in the ti ssue involved (biopsy). Radiographs can identify calcified cysticerci in tissues other than the brain. 24 Revision date : March 2021 Dengue-like Illness 11704 Dengue a potentially fatal febrile illness caused by infection with any of the four dengue viruses (DENV -1, -2, -3 and -4). Dengue is transmitted primarily through the bite of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. For the purposes of surveillance and reporting, based on their clinical presentation, dengue cases can be categorized into three primary groups: dengue -like illness, dengue, and severe dengue.

Transmission occurs through the ingestion of tapeworm eggs in contaminated food, water, soil, dog feces, or on the contaminated coats of dogs and cats. Infection may also occur through the ingestion of cysts in the undercooked internal organs of infected intermediate hosts, such as sheep, goats and swine. Many infect ions are asymptomatic for years before the growing cysts cause clinical signs and symptoms associated with the affected organs. Liver involvement is associated with abdominal pain, hepatic masses, and biliary duct obstruction. Pulmonary involvement can pro duce chest pain, cough, and hemoptysis. Other organs, including the brain, bone, and heart, may also be involved with resulting clinical signs and symptoms. Ruptured cysts may cause fever, urticaria (hives), eosinophilia and anaphylactic shock. Confirmed: An asymptomatic or symptomatic case that meets one or more confirmatory laboratory criteria.

Infection may or may not be sympyomatic. In early infection (acute phase), t he immature larval flukes migrate through the intestinal wall, the abdominal cavity, and the liver tissue, into the bile ducts, where they develop into mature adult flukes. Symptoms may include fever; gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; a swollen liver (hepatomegaly); liver function abnormalities, skin rashes; shortness of breath; and abdomi nal pain or tenderness. The chronic phase (after the parasite settles in the bile ducts), is marked by inflammation and hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts and gall bladder, leading to biliary lithiasis or obstruction. Symptoms of this phase may include: biliary colic, nausea, intolerance to fatty food, right upper quadrant pain, epigastric pain, obstructive jaundice, and pruritus, are the result of a blockade in the biliary tract and inflammation in the gall bladder.

Other less common symptoms include arthralgia, diarrhea, pruritus, and urticarial rash. The period of infectivity following acute infection h as not been determined, but viral excretion in stools has been demonstrated for up to 14 days after illness onset. In most hepatitis E outbreaks, the highest rates of clinically evident disease have been in young to middle -age adults; lower disease rates in younger age groups can be the result of anicteric and/or subclinical HEV infection. No evidence of chronic infection has been detected in long -term follow -up of patients with hepatitis E. The case fatality rate is low except in pregnant women where it can reach 20% among those infected during the third trimester of pregnancy. Confirmed : A case that meets the clinical case description and is laboratory confirmed Probable: A case that meets the clinical case descr iption with supportive laboratory evidence (positive IgM antibody from labs other than CDC), OR negative tests for other acute hepatitis markers and an epidemiological link to other confirmed cases or travel history to an endemic area during exposure perio d IgM anti -HEV from CDC laboratory or PCR positive from reference laboratory Note: No FDA approved tests to diagnose HEV infection are available in the United States.

It can cause mild to severe illness and at times can lead to death. Symptoms of flu may include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches. Stomach symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) can occur but are more common i n children than adults. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. Confirmed : Case that is clinic ally compatible and laboratory confirmed Outbreak: See the Texas Influenza Surveillance Handbook for more information on influenza (flu)-associated outbreaks including operational influenza -like illness (ILI) and flu -associated outbreak definitions.

A case can be considered epidemiologically linked to a laboratory - confirmed case i f at least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory confirmed. Suspect: A case meeting the clinical criteria in which influenza A has been detected but is pending laboratory confirmation. Any case of human infection with an influenza A virus tha t is different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 viruses is classified as a suspect case until the confirmation process is complete. Note: Typically, sporadic novel/variant influenza cases will have a history of either close contact with ill animals known to transmit novel subtypes of influenza A (such as wild birds or poultry, swine , or other mammals) OR travel, within 14 days, to any country where a novel influenza A virus (such as highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1) has been rece ntly identified in animals or people. Identification of an influenza A virus subtype or strain that is different from currently circulating human influenza H1 and H3 strains as confirmed by CDC's influenza laboratory, by public health laboratories using CD C-approved protocols for that specific strain, or by labs using FDA - authorized tests for specific strains. Novel/variant subtypes include, but are not limited to, H2, and H9 subtypes. Influenza from a non -human specie s or from genetic re - assortment between animal and human viruses are also novel/variant subtypes or strains. Methods available for detection of currently circulating human influenza viruses at public health laboratories (e.g., rRT -PCR) will also detect sus pected novel/variant subtypes and strains. Initial confirmation that a specific influenza A virus represents a novel/variant virus will be performed by CDC's influenza laboratory. Currently, only viral isolation, RT -PCR, gene sequencing, or a 4 -fold rise i n strain -specific serum antibody titers are considered confirmatory for case classification purposes. 37 Revision date : March 2021 Condition/Code Case Definition/Case Classification Laboratory Confirmation Tests Influenza -associated pediatric mortality 11061 An influenza -associated death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness that was confirmed to be influenza by an appropriate laboratory or rapid diagnostic test. There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death. Influenza -associated deaths in all person s aged <18 years should be reported. A death should not be reported if there is no laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection, the influenza illness is followed by full recovery to baseline health status prior to death, the death occurs in a per son 18 years of age or older, or after review and consultation there is an alternative agreed upon cause of death which is unrelated to an infectious process (For example, a child with a positive influenza test whose death clearly resulted from trauma after a car accident would not qualify as a case. However, a child with a respiratory illness and a positive influenza test whose death is attributed to another infectious cause such as staphylococcal pneumonia would still qualify as a case.).

The Leishmania parasite is transmitted via the bite of phlebotomine sand flies. There are several forms of the disease in humans: cutaneous, the most common, which causes skin lesions; visceral, which may affect multiple internal organs, including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; and mucosal, a less common form that affects mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, or throat. Most leishmaniasis cases reported in Texas are the cutaneous form and are travel -associated, albeit autochthonous cases occur occasionally. Cutaneous leishmaniasis infection can present as one or more skin sores weeks or months after a sand fly bite. Over time, the sores may change in size and appearance \u2014they may start out as papules or nodules and may end up as ulcers which might scab over. Lesions can heal spontaneously within weeks to months, or last for a year or more. Some Leishmania strains can dissem inate to cause mucosal lesions (espundia) years after the primary cutaneous lesion has healed. Without treatment, this sequela can progress and lead to destruction of the naso -oropharyngeal mucosa, which can be severely disfiguring. Visceral leishmaniasis infection can be asymptomatic or result in manifestations such as fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Severe cases of visceral leishmaniasis are often fatal without treatment.

Human prion diseases include sporadic forms of disease (sporadic CJD, sporadic insomnia (sFI), CJD (iCJD) , Kuru (described only in the Fore population of Papua New Guinea), and variant CJD (vCJD) ). Classical sporadic CJD presentation consists of rapidly prog ressive dementia, visual abnormalities, myoclonus, or cerebellar dysfunction (where both balance abnormalities and muscle incoordination are seen which commonly present as gait, speech, and swallowing disorders). Most patients eventually develop pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction , such as abnormal reflexes (hyperreflexia), spasticity, tremors, and rigidity. Akinetic mutism appears late in the disease. Median duration of illness is 4 -5 months; the duration of illness rarely exceeds 12 months. For purp oses of surveillance and notification : prion diseases such also includes SFI, syndrome , humans.

In Texas, skunks, bats, coyotes, and foxes are the most commonly infected animals. Domestic dogs, cats, and livestock usually acquire rabies infections from wild animals. Medical authorities distinguish between \"furious\" and \"dumb\" rabies on the basis of clinical signs. In the furious variety, the \"mad dog\" symptoms are pronounced. The animal is irritable and will snap and bite at real or imaginary objects. It can run for miles and attack anything in its path. The animal is extremely vicious and violent. Paralysis sets in shortly, usually affecting the hind legs first. Death follows four to seven days after t he onset of clinical signs. In dumb rabies, the prominent symptoms are drowsiness and paralysis of the lower jaw. The animal can appear to have a bone lodged in its throat, sometimes causing owners to force open an animal's mouth to investigate and become unwittingly exposed to rabies. Animals with dumb rabies have no tendency to roam but will snap at movement. They are completely insensitive to pain, and usually become comatose and die from three to ten days after first symptoms appear.

Borrelia spirochetes that cause TBRF are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected \"so ft ticks\" of the genus Ornithodoros . Each relapsing fever group Borrelia species is usually associated with a specific tick species: B. hermsii is transmitted by O. hermsi , B. parkeri by parkeri by O. turicata ticks. Disease incubation averages one week following a tick bite. Illness is characterized by periods of fever, often exceeding 103oF, lasting 2 -7 days, alternating with afebrile periods of 4 -14 days. Febrile periods are often accompanied by shaking chills, sweats, headache, musc le and joint pain, and nausea/vomiting. TBRF may be fatal in 5 -10% of untreated cases. TBRF contracted during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, premature birth, and neonatal death. Clinical evidence: Measured fever >38.3oC (101oF) alone OR one or more episodes of subjective or measured fever <101oF AND two or more of the following: headache, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, or arthralgia.

The onset is variable, often sudden and marked by headache, chills, fatigue, fever, and general body aches. A macular rash may appear on the 5th or 6th day, initially on the upper trunk, followed by spread to the entire body, but usua lly not to the face, palms or soles. Absence of louse infestation, geographic and seasonal distribution, and sporadic occurrence of the disease help to differentiate it from louse -borne typhus.

Detection of ZIKV by culture, viral antigen or viral RNA in serum, C SF, tissue, or other specimen ( e.g., amniotic fluid, urine, semen, saliva) with a validated diagnostic test , OR Positive ZIKV IgM antibody test in serum or CSF with positive ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers against dengue or other flaviviruses ende mic to the region where exposure occurred.
