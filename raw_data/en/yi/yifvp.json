I wonder how a klotho injection would stack with creatine supplements.Interesting. My son has working memory problems. I wonder if low klotho is a contributor, I hear you. But when it comes down to it from many other conditions, the odds are high, we will discover methods to treat old age conditions, rather than cure them. Maybe we will find a cure for dementia and Alzheimer's. Maybe we will find ways to cure old age cognition decline. Maybe we will find a way to permanently treat steam cell decline as we age. Or DNA damage. Etc.This is the worrisome part. Okay, really cool that brain power gets a boost for up to two weeks, but if it cannot be sustained, this is just another addictive drug for Pharma to dangle in front of humans ... for a price you know...

Cool science, amazing discovery....no thanks if my life is controlled by some CEO who's motto is profit over people. Heck, I am 6'1' and 200 (okay, maybe a little change). I am pretty fit, but at the same time, I've got 10-15 I know I could stand a lose. 20 and I still wouldn't be emaciated and probably more like 20 if I am being real self honest. If there was something I could take without extreme impacts that would help me skim 10 off, I'd be absolutely delighted. That isn't life changing for me, but hauling around 10lbs less still means a decent difference. And at middle age, with a job that keeps me too busy, and teen/tween kids, finding time for structured exercise is hard and my diet is, though probably better than your average American, still not great. And I tend to snack when sitting around. Which is all the time since I WFH. Hard for me to control that impulse.The history of weight-loss drugs (indeed many supposedly clear success stories) is littered with once highly touted successes which turned to iron pyrite. Semaglutide is very, very new to the weight loss market. I am hesitant to claim it an unmitigated success, yet. (Fingers crossed though). I, personally, would not take it for that condition. But I barely meet the parameters. If I was 5'10\" and 300lb instead of 5'10\" and 200lb? I would definitely would consider it. That one does have me incredibly excited. I hope not for nothing. I don't think we have a good handle on side effects at the dosage levels required, but we do know as a general supplement and high dietary values we don't think there are real side effects.Okay, so I just started a course of taurine for my tinnitus. Actually remarked to my wife that I felt sharper. Anecdotally, I would say we have a bingo. No worries.This is the worrisome part.

Give the oral version 5 years of open market use with little to no serious adverse events and I am on board.Heck, I am 6'1' and 200 (okay, maybe a little change).

And I tend to snack when sitting around. Which is all the time since I WFH. Hard for me to control that impulse. So I am kind of excited that an oral version of Semaglutide seems to be proving out in trials. I am years away from considering it, even though sure I am not close to being a current candidate. But if years from now it or similar spawned from that breakthrough seem like they also work for people who are just struggling with \"10-20lbs I'd like to lose\" and there seem to be no serious negative health impacts, yeah I'd try it. That's how I am looking at it. If in 5 years and oral version has no signal of serious side effects, I'd be down. I cannot imagine losing 10-20lbs wouldn't be good for my health even if I am not actually obese and not really overweight based on my real muscle mass. But it would make me feel a lot better and throwing around 5-10% less body weight isn't going to hurt my stamina working hard, hiking, etc.Give the oral version 5 years of open market use with little to no serious adverse events and I am on board. I had/have similar hunger issues. I tried a prolonged fast (water/electrolytes only) for 28 days a few years ago. I had a lot of excess fat to live off so don't try this at home without consulting your physician etc, but...That's how I am looking at it. If in 5 years and oral version has no signal of serious side effects, I'd be down.

But it would make me feel a lot better and throwing around 5-10% less body weight isn't going to hurt my stamina working hard, hiking, etc. Part of my issue is I feel hungry a lot of the time. The only times I don't feel particularly hungry is when I am sleeping or just waking up. Like the first hour or two after waking up I almost never feel hungry. Basically if I am sleepy/still waking up I don't feel hungry. Or if I am working hard at something physically I don't feel hungry. Otherwise I spend a lot of my time feeling at least mildly hungry. It's annoying. And certainly leads me to snacking more than I should. Hey, remember when science making animals smarter used to be science fiction? Between this and the smarter rats I am started to get a bit worried... Yeah, an obvious possibility is that it is just helping to kick out some waste products that clog up the works.Well it's boosting performance on tests that involve memory so that kinda sounds like boosting memory, rather than attention. But they also say that: Produced by the kidney, klotho circulates in the blood and has been linked to health and lifespan. Orson Moe, a kidney specialist and professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, describes it as a housekeeper that helps regulate the kidneys and metabolism. \"It protects us and keeps us healthy,\" he says. Which may mean its mechanism of action in boosting cognitive performance could be pretty indirect. Maybe your brain just works better because your whole body is working better. And that's way better news, if true, than just some improvements in cognition. So far as I can remember, I've never had a good memory... (See what I did there?). I'd give almost anything for an injection to improve it, even if it's just by 20% I've spent most of my life having to explain to people that I'm not being ignorant.. A lot of the time, it's like I've not been told something at all, or ever had a particular conversation. Most of my family/friends get it and are patient as hell with me, but it's exhausting having to convince new people that come into my life that I AM actually listening, I just can't recall a lot of conversations (names/faces too come to think of it. I literally forget the kinds of stuff I forget heh) It's fairly debilitating, though I've learned to work around it using notes/reminders/calendar entries for even minor things on my phone etc. but being able to say ask how someone's holiday was, and not having to be told they'd even gone anywhere for the 10th time would be wonderful If this research comes to anything, sign me right up and the team then retested the monkeys over the next two weeks. Overall, the animals made correct choices more often than they did before receiving the injection. In a predictable turn of events, one of the apes found a way to access the internet, where he was dismayed to find a whole apestechnica story about him and his enhanced chums. He was quite defensive and hostile towards the experimenters. I mean, wouldn't you be? Sadly his remarkable acumen went unrecognized amongst the humans, who down-voted him thinking he was just one of their own...Maybe the apes got better at your dumb game on their second attempt? Talk about a bogus trial. I don't get itThis is the worrisome part.

Cool science, amazing discovery....no thanks if my life is controlled by some CEO who's motto is profit over people. Thanks for the link to the Mucke lab paper - that is really interesting. I've passed it along to colleagues that work on microglial activation in neurodegen. A long time ago, I worked on the choroid plexus (imprinted gene expression), it's a complex and poorly understood structure. And it's pretty!(Neurobiologist here): This is super interesting and definitely worth further study. It's worth noting that Klotho is not only produced in the kidney, but also much closer to the brain in the choroid plexus. This is one of the \"barrier tissues\" between blood vessels and brain, in this case it's a structure that sits in the ventricles and produces the Cerebrospinal Fluid, i.e. the soup that the brain bobs around in. As a barrier tissue between the body and the immunologically tightly controlled brain, the choroid plexus is super important for controlling immune action on the brain, i.e. low-level neuroinflammation. Mouse studies have shown that when local Klotho production is lost in the choroid plexus, neuroinflammation results. Source: [Klotho controls the brain-immune the choroid plexus. Zhu et al., PNAS 2018] So, supplying extra Klotho protein via the blood stream (either from the kidney or by injection, as has been done here) could well explain the improvements in brain function seen here - essentially, it would reduce neuroinflammation below the baseline level, and those would take a while to bump back up to normal (or even pathological) levels. Edit: a word A saline injection is an appropriate sham treatment. The monkeys get handled and treated the same way, so that eliminates any question about whether the stress of being handled has affected their behavior.This is an interesting proof of concept, but I think it's worth pointing out that they don't have a real control group. They inject saline, or the klotho enzyme. There's no output to show that klotho is active here; it could be a (small, but) general response to injection of a foreign protein (which they don't test). To some extent this is warranted (the experiment was to look at dosing and efficacy), but it seems to me that this is a prime setup for something that will fail to translate to humans because of poorly designed experiments. I know a large group of mostly younger people, with specific memory issues but not so far gone that they cannot report effects, who would chase down the researchers and beg them for a chance to be involved in clinical trials: Long COVID suffers with brain fog.Verdin thinks that if klotho moves into human testing, the first to receive it in clinical trials will likely be older people who are already showing cognitive decline. Maybe they meant to test it earlier, but forgot? Anyway, here's hoping that this clortho stuff turns out to be the keymaster to unlocking things we've Nice! I have gotten into (mouse) brain clearing and imaging over the past few years, and the choroid plexus is a beautiful, if often annoyingly autofluorescent, structure. Quite fascinating to see how neuro-immune interactions show up in so many disorders, it feels like every time people care to look there is something. If only the brain and the immune system weren't the two most complex adaptive systems in the body, we'd have made more progress by now...Thanks for the link to the Mucke lab paper - that is really interesting. I've passed it along to colleagues that work on microglial activation in neurodegen. A long time ago, I worked on the choroid plexus (imprinted gene expression), it's a complex and poorly understood structure. And it's pretty! (Aesthetics matter in science. Big respect to the lab that named klotho) Ooof... powerful memories. In a more article-focussed note, this is something that sounds interesting given I'm now over 40, and finding my own senior moments more comment and annoying all the time. Edit I'm going to keep the commenttypo in, and just say - see? Of course I meant common. Ooof... powerful memories.
