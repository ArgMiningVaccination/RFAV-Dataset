In fact, some modern medicines have their origins in herbal remedies. A common example of this is aspirin, which is a form of salicylic acid - a compound that occurs naturally in willow bark. Herbal remedies can vary in their quality, effectiveness, and safety. The [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements) It is always best to discuss health conditions and herbal supplements with a qualified medical professional wherever possible. In this article, we look at what herbal remedies are, how they compare with medications, and some popular herbal remedies for conditions such as allergies, coughs, migraine, and [anxiety](/articles/323454). Herbal remedies are a form of traditional medicine. They consist of herbs or compounds that come from herbs. They can also contain fungi or algae. Herbal products come in a variety of formats, [including](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/BotanicalBackground-Consumer/) - capsules or tablets - whole dried plant parts, such as seeds, leaves, flowers, bark, or roots - powders that a person can add to liquids or food - tinctures, which people make by soaking plant parts in a liquid, such as alcohol, to extract compounds - herbal teas or tonics Historically, herbs were one of the main ways people treated disease.

It is important to be aware of these differences before using them. Testing and quality In the United States, the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements) Companies are responsible for ensuring the labels of their products do not contain inaccurate or misleading information.

By contrast, medical products have to meet strict standards before a company can sell them in the U.S. Safety Many people believe natural products are safer or gentler than prescription drugs.

This is especially important for people who are: - pregnant or nursing - trying to conceive - undergoing surgery or other medical treatments - taking other medications If a herbal remedy is safe to use, follow the instructions on the label or the instructions of a doctor. If symptoms develop or get worse, or a person takes too much, stop using the product and seek medical attention.

In the U.S., people [can look for](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/BotanicalBackground-Consumer/) - companies that follow \"good manufacturing practices,\" or GMPs - seals of quality from ConsumerLab, NSF International, or U.S. Pharmacopeia - gas chromatography and mass spectrometry testing for essential oils These qualities indicate a product has no hidden ingredients or harmful levels of a substance. But they do not guarantee a product will be safe or effective, so it is still important to speak with a healthcare professional about using them. Never give herbal remedies to others As with medications, it is important not to give herbal products to others. What helps one person may harm another, so it is essential that others seek their own medical advice when it comes to treating conditions. Never give herbal remedies to children unless instructed to do so by a doctor.

But it is important to remember that herbal remedies are not always effective or safe. Always discuss taking herbs with a doctor before use, and look for products that are high quality and have scientific evidence to support their use. "}
