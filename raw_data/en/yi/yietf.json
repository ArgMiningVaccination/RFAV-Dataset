But before you jump on the turmeric, or curcumin, bandwagon you should know what it is, how it may help you, why you may need to heed caution, and how to choose the best supplement. What are Turmeric and Curcumin? Turmeric is the dried, ground root of a plant in the ginger family and is native to Southeast Asia. Curcumin is an active compound found in the turmeric root. So although they are used interchangeably, there is a difference. It is the curcumin compound within the turmeric root that has scientists all abuzz. In fact, there are over 10,000 peer-reviewed articles on the subject of turmeric and specifically on its healing compound - curcumin. Many studies are revealing curcumin to be a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, but its benefits go well beyond these two power hitters. What are the Benefits of Curcumin? A 2013 scientific review of 50 years' worth of clinical trials found many conditions were positively affected by curcumin, including - arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, Chrohn's disease, diabetes, gastric ulcer, irritable uveitis, and many more. Curcumin's ability to reduce inflammation may be part of the reason for its profound effect on these conditions - all of which are rooted in inflammation. Below is a list of known benefits of curcumin: Reduced Inflammation. Studies have shown that curcumin is so powerful that it matches the effectiveness of some anti-inflammatory drugs. Decreased Oxidative Stress. Curcumin's antioxidant power neutralizes free radicals (which lead to oxidative stress) and can even boost the activity of your body's own antioxidant enzymes. Improved Brain Function. Curcumin has been found to increase the capacity to form new neuronal connections in the brain which may delay or even reverse age-related decline in brain function. Reduced Risk of Heart Disease. Curcumin has many beneficial effects that play a role in heart disease including improved endothelium function. Decreased Risk of Cancer. Many studies have indicated curcumin may reduce the growth of cancerous cells and inhibit growth of tumors in animal studies. Prevent and Treat Alzheimer's Disease. Curcumin has been shown to clear Amyloid plaques, a known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, inflammation and oxidative damage play a role in Alzheimer's - both of which improve with curcumin. Reduced Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms. The suffix \"itis,\" as in arthritis, means inflammation. Therefore, curcumin may help relieve arthritis symptoms. Improved Depression. Several animal studies have indicated curcumin has antidepressant properties and one human study showed curcumin was as effective as Prozac in managing depression. Manage Diabetes. One study showed curcumin was 400 times more potent than Metformin in activating AMPK, an enzyme that regulates insulin sensitivity. Additionally, curcumin's anti-inflammatory effects have been shown to delay diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Reduced Pain. Recent research discovered curcumin naturally activated the body's pain-relieving response in rats, reducing pain. Do I Need to Worry About Side Effects? Although side effects are rare with curcumin, it is still something to consider before choosing to supplement. Below are some potential side effects to watch out for if you take a turmeric or curcumin supplement, especially at higher doses. Nausea Diarrhea Increased menstrual flow Hyperactive gallbladder contractions Hypotension (lowered blood pressure) Increased liver function tests Increased risk of bleeding Uterine contractions in pregnant women Curcumin and turmeric can also interact with several medications including anti-coagulants such as warfarin and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammtory drugs) such as ibuprofen. Additionally, some folklore suggests it may have been used as a birth control. So before you try supplementing, always speak with your doctor. What is the Best Way to Supplement? I am a big proponent of whole foods first. So if your diet isn't already whole-foods based, then start with dietary changes that will naturally reduce inflammation before adding in supplementation. But, if you are focused on eating whole foods, and cleared by your doctor, curcumin may be a great addition to your health regimen. When choosing to supplement keep in mind that turmeric root is only 3% curcumin by weight and most studies have been conducted with much higher percentages of curcumin. This will make it very difficult to get the full effects of curcumin with food alone, so supplementation may be your best option. Another thing to consider when supplementing is that curcumin is actually poorly absorbed on its own. Yet, when combined with piperine, a compound found in black pepper, absorption of curcumin is enhanced by 2000%! The best supplement will be one that also includes black pepper or piperine. Additionally, curcumin is fat soluble so taking your supplement with a meal full of healthy fats will also enhance your absorption. Although there is still a need for more human studies, and you should never bet your health on one action (supplementation), curcumin has some promise in helping manage and prevent disease while also optimizing your health "}
