The trail, lined with birch trees against a backdrop of hemlocks lightly coated with snow, exuded a mystical forest atmosphere. The temperature was quite nippy, the terrain bumpy, even icy in spots. Blustery winds seemed to add insult to injury on this frigid day, threatening to cut my hike short and send me scurrying indoors to warmth and safety. Undaunted, I decided to persevere. After all, the trail was leading to a magnificent waterfall, frozen into sparkling crystal forms that only Mother Nature could create. As I took in this wintery scene, I was instantly renewed by its natural beauty. In retrospect, this cold and difficult sojourn seemed akin to the challenging school year that teachers, leaders, trustees, and parents are experiencing across the continent and beyond. Each day is strewn with obstacles as school personnel exert themselves to the limit in order to serve and support their students through the ever-changing landscapes and rocky terrains of Covid-19. It surely has been difficult at times, yet the elation arising from the beauty of an inspiring hike is complemented by thoughts of our [Renewal](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001LXpiESGWlp-1hMuWupWt4ck2EVU-Tl5ejIwYDrEhOiaEiFC98tchvcV27uREqg1WbzvHa2vKPW5xVfL9yXlCWbaaShUIQ-838AopmEekbjBB7v0fs8kA6hvCra6-h0Aggj1JDbs6yB_c8xJB3I_FhXJNmeFaDUkjdHsmwCez1_rg0FThNq6Gl19V6nQUK-pu8yggOjh_taQ=&c=awYwx4JBwHBSjE7kzS3CAsOs5_tVJObOmaIJmOx9UFHdTlsbK766WQ==&ch=UO-OUuo6PXxQOGo_nf7pnPsBzyPtTo9votsIJ3arJxDh-VNe_NxHrw==) community and how wonderful it will be to experience the joyful renewal of learning together this summer!

Dear Friends, The Center for Anthroposophy is launching a new program this summer: the [Kairos Institute](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001LXpiESGWlp-1hMuWupWt4ck2EVU-Tl5ejIwYDrEhOiaEiFC98tchvZWAmP28_giIVD-gsso9fHNdg8sDo0_R5uIFKATfuWsn1Fy-kezUXPZr7_sXIU2Qce1ujohx-TRqlJqjk4Y7e7cfrGUWwM8WBra8rOULRaXDx_kcQESV5tBs6CBhKhOLSKoCE3OZ45OfSefeIWFA7DY=&c=awYwx4JBwHBSjE7kzS3CAsOs5_tVJObOmaIJmOx9UFHdTlsbK766WQ==&ch=UO-OUuo6PXxQOGo_nf7pnPsBzyPtTo9votsIJ3arJxDh-VNe_NxHrw==) , dedicated to developing pathways for training in artistic therapies. We are delighted that Bernd Ruf, founder of the Parzival Schule in Southern Germany, will help us launch Kairos during the week of 3-8 July 2022 with the first module in his course on Emergency Pedagogy. During a five-day course Bernd will lead morning sessions on trauma and the dangers of the various stages of PTSD. This course is for school leaders, care group leaders, and educators who seek to bring more understanding and healing approaches to our schools. It is also for those who wish to become art therapists and those who wish to enrich their empathetic practices. Afternoons will be devoted to introducing therapies designed to address physical and psychological trauma in children and adolescents. The day will end with conversations with Bernd Ruf. Author of Educating Traumatized Children, Bernd Ruf is the founder of the worldwide Emergency Pedagogy crisis intervention center, based in Karlsruhe, Germany. Skilled teams are sent out to help traumatized children in places of the strife of war, or ecological disasters. The Emergency Pedagogy center is located on the campus of the Parzival Centrum, where over 700 children--aged infant to twenty--attend a large Waldorf school that includes a wealth of artistic therapies, including animal therapy on a small farm in the heart of the school grounds. These therapies serve children who have suffered the effects of trauma and PTSD, including those with emotional-social developmental challenges, refugee children who have experienced the loss of their homeland, and adolescents who have experienced incarceration. These children are integrated into the classes of the Waldorf school, which has developed conscious structures to address the various needs in their student body. We have much to learn from Bernd Ruf, who will provide an overview of trauma and the different stages of PTSD and how to recognize and address these stages, from the initial shock to the challenges of the more settled PTSD. Ines Kindchen will serve as Bernd's translator. Afternoons will be dedicated to how we can address active trauma or PTSD with artistic therapies. Participants, who will choose one hands-on artistic therapy that addresses and heals trauma, will work with the same class throughout the week for optimum learning. Choices include: * From Soul Paralysis to Inner Movement through Painting Therapy (Karine Munk Finser) * Rediscovering the Self after Trauma: Engaging Movement for Healing and Harmonization (Connie Helms) * Circus Arts with Clowning and Puppetry (Laura Geilen) * Animal Therapy (Dionna Waterson from Amazing Grace Animal Sanctuary and others) * Addressing Trauma in the Early Years though Music, Stories, the Mood of the Fifth (Juliane Weeks and Monica Amstutz) * Clay Therapy (faculty tba) * The Healing Art of Speech (Debbie Spitulnik) * Therapeutic Eurythmy: Addressing Anxiety and Trauma (Maria Ver Eecke and Carsten Callesen) For more information and to register, please visit our website: I hope to see many of you this summer!

This course was designed to help independent and public Waldorf school administrators, staff, trustees, and pedagogical leaders build skills, capacities, and understanding of their vital roles in Waldorf schools. Through a combination of virtual and in-person classes, participants engaged in seminars designed to cultivate the capacities needed for serving in leadership positions. The current cohort of this inaugural group will conclude in April with an in-person long weekend, in Keene, NH. The culminating seminars and presentations have been designed to bring these steadfast leaders together to explore prevalent leadership topics and to engage in the social arts of painting, drawing, sculpture, and eurythmy.

Here is a brief description. Waldorf education is uniquely positioned to bring healing and strength to young people and those who care for them. And yet, in order to be effective as agents of healing, Waldorf schools need to have effective Waldorf teachers. While the 40 Waldorf high schools in North America are holding remarkably steady despite a nationwide decline in the number of independent schools, the number of trained Waldorf high school teachers continues to dwindle. And yet the need for trained teachers is great \u2014 even greater now, perhaps, than it was when the first Waldorf high school was launched a century ago, a year after the grades school opened in the fall of 1919 on the Uhlandsh\u00f6he bluff overlooking Stuttgart's city center. In light of this need, the Center for Anthroposophy is launching a new cycle of its \"Explorations\" program with specific emphasis on [Waldorf high school education](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001LXpiESGWlp-1hMuWupWt4ck2EVU-Tl5ejIwYDrEhOiaEiFC98tchvcV27uREqg1WM67cmaRWyfJau9Kf9bVToWZO0xvDF6PXjq8IDZnGa_1EDyRs_e73ydth15ig56oRWrZxhsaJjltks-cJ-sIrzKyX9kZP6JAWn4DtYrTeKwhNgg9tg3i8HZmXUrMVA-JHMpgobJo8KRWSY4bRsZc6x9XKrRn6fQ-1EfVSSLNRz4Wd1agMEB4Dcw==&c=awYwx4JBwHBSjE7kzS3CAsOs5_tVJObOmaIJmOx9UFHdTlsbK766WQ==&ch=UO-OUuo6PXxQOGo_nf7pnPsBzyPtTo9votsIJ3arJxDh-VNe_NxHrw==) .

Dateline Punxsutawney, PA: The Significance of Groundhog Day for High Schools For some, this day offers a clue each year as to the length of winter. But for applicants to the Waldorf High School Teacher Education Program, this date represents quite another landmark. Douglas Gerwin, Chair of this program, explains. According to a medieval legend imported by German settlers to this town in Western Pennsylvania, the presence or absence of sunshine on February 2nd foretells the length of winter remaining. In the American version of this ritual, if the groundhog pops out of its hole and sees its shadow on this day, the remainder of winter will be long and cold; if it does not, winter is on its way out. Though it may sound counter-intuitive, a sunny day on February 2nd means lingering cold, according to this tradition; a cloudy day presages an early spring. For the record, the day was sunny. In the Christian calendar, the date is known as Candlemas, a lesser-known holiday celebrated 40 days after Christmas that marks the exact mid-point between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox.

Dateline Wilton, NH: Taking Orders for Our Alumni Conversation Caf\u00e9s As part of its expanded activities, the Alumni Association for CfA and Antioch graduates is planning some new events for the coming months. Bev Boyer, liaison representative for this group, explains. The leadership team of the Alumni Association for Antioch and CfA graduates continues to be excited by the possibilities inherent in this organization. The creation of an online platform allowing alums to easily connect with one another remains a top priority for the near future. In the meantime, the group is pleased to announce a series of three online gatherings during the upcoming months. Called \"Conversation Caf\u00e9s\", these hour-long events will provide an opportunity for all alums from CfA and Antioch's Waldorf teacher training program to connect as colleagues and friends. These events are scheduled for Tuesday evenings - February 8th, March 8th, and April 5th, at 8:00-9:00 p.m. EST (5:00-6:00 p.m. PST). The theme of the first caf\u00e9 will be \"Memories\". We are looking forward to sharing stories and reflecting on the times we experienced at Antioch and CfA. What is your favorite memory or story? Who or what inspired you during your time as a student? What ideals drew you there? We look forward to welcoming as many as possible as we look back at shared times together!
