What is the aim of this research? This questionnaire is part of a broader research programme conducted by the University of Antwerp and funded by the Flemish Fund for Scientific Research. With this research we want to find out what different people in Europe think about vaccination and which aspects about vaccinations are important for themselves, or, if they are a parent, for their children to decide whether or not to accept one of the vaccines in the National Immunization Programme. The term vaccination is used in this questionnaire; this is also referred to as inoculations or jabs (such as in the flu jab). This survey is strictly about preventive vaccinations. Preventive vaccination is a way of preventing an infectious disease and is therefore not a medicine to treat a disease. The first part of the questionnaire consists of some general questions about your background. In addition, we also ask you to respond to a number of statements, using a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate your opinion. The second part contains a total of 10 multiple choice questions in which you are presented with two vaccines that have different characteristics. Each time, we ask you to choose the vaccine that appeals to you the most. This questionnaire will take about 5-10 minutes in total. Participation and anonymity We emphasize that participation in this study is completely voluntary and anonymous. You can therefore stop your participation in this survey at any time, without any further consequences. If you fill in and submit the survey, the data will be stored in a database by an independent marketing bureau. This database will be stripped of all potential identifiers and then sent to researchers at the University of Antwerp. The researchers will analyse the anonymous database while respecting your privacy, guaranteeing continued anonymity and treating all answers confidentially. The researchers only receive and process the information that you have entered on the following pages, and never your name or contact details. Contact If you have any questions or if any problems arise when completing the survey, you can contact the Helpdesk.
