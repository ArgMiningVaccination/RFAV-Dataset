Toronto has a flourishing gay community, which, after facing the epidemic for more than 20years, has a well-established HIV/AIDS support network. Not so much for the heteros. Karl Jennrich knows from experience how hard it can be to connect with other HIV-positive heteros. In 2002, he took matters into his own hands and started Toronto's Pozitive Hetero Socials. As its name suggests,the group aims to bring HIV-positive hetero people together to hang out in a relaxed social setting, share food, gossip and make new friends. Along the way Karl met Angela (on a poz dating site), and the two newly- weds now host the group together. About 10to20people show up to each event, and there are always a few new faces each time the groupmeets (every six to eight weeks). These socials take it well beyond the standard venues of coffee shops and bars\u2014there's a summer BBQ at Centre Island and a Halloween house party (extra points awarded for not losing your Sarah Palin wig while bobbing for apples!). Though most of the members are already connected to the multiple services available in the city, Pozitive Hetero Socials lls a void by creating a place to meet socially. \"Many laughs are shared and a good time is had by all,\" Jennrich says. \"And although the group's basis isn't sup-port, it does give people a chance to talk about health,meds, personal issues and, most importantly, life.\" For a good time contactpozitiveheterosocials@gmail.com!ATLANTIC The In French jaser means to chat, and once a month HIV-positive youth in Montreal get together to do just that. While there's a lot of talk of the movie they watched last weekend or who was seen bumpin' and grindin' on the dance floor, there's also a serious side to the group. \"The youth get to meet other people in their situation and share how they feel, create a social network and understand what HIVis and what the treatment options are,\" says Pascal, who has facilitated the group for the past ve years. Discussions revolve around important questions like relationships (and heartbreak), sex (however you like it) and HIVtreatment information (now there's a sexy topic!). The get-togethers are led by an HIV- positive youth so that participants are as comfortable as possible, and the information is always geared specically toward young people. This is particularlyimportant, says Pascal, given the lack of HIV resources for this demographic. The evenings often include guest doctors and experts, giving participants a chance to get the 411about the latest hot topics. If you're under 30and you 3TC) since Decem- ber2007. It's my second regimen. The only reason I switched is because I was on Sustiva and Combivir ( AZT+ 3TC) before and I was having issues with the Combivir\u2014some noticeable lipodystrophy around my shoulderarea and a bit in my cheeks. It was my choice to switch and my doctor was more than will- ing to look at it. She thought Kivexa wouldbe a good drug for me. She put me on it afterwe did the hypersensitiv- ity test and found out that it was safe for me to take abacavir. Knowing a number of other people who've had issues with their drugs,I've had it pretty easy. My drugs are working and I'm happy, and that's all that matters. Considering where I was ve years ago, I have to think positively. I was diagnosed in the hospital. I was really sick and didn't know what was going on. At rst they thought I had tuber- culosis. Then they did an HIVtest and I tested positive. I was in really bad shape. My CD4count was 33and my viral load was half a million. I had pneumonia ( PCP). I also was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Within a week I was on HIVmedica- tions. It took between four and six months before I started to feel almost normal again. My viral load droppedquickly and dramatically\u2014I've been undetectable for about four years now\u2014but it was a struggle to get my CD4count back up. I've been a slow climber ... slow and steady. DANI\u00c8LE,44 MontrealDiagnosedwith HIVin1984 CD4count:169 Viralload:150-200 I refused to start HAART for many years. I made several attempts but the diarrhea, headaches and fatigue made me give up. I was skeptical that the treatments would work, and I also didn't feel like I really had to start because I had never come down with an opportunistic infection. I made the decision to really start after attending a workshop at Maison Plein Coeur. It explored the meds throughdifferent discussions and through art. Everyone had different opinions and experiences about HAART . I came away with a different take on the meds. I stopped seeing only the nega- tive side of HAART . I've been seeing the same doctor for several years and he always respected and supported my right not to take meds. When I did start, I didn't feel forced in any way because I made the decision myself. We agreed that I would start HAART and not stop for one year. The decision about which com- bination to take was made on the adviceofmydoctor.Hewasaware of my concerns about adherence , so he was careful to prescribe a com- bination that can be taken just twice aday. In January 2008, I started taking etravirine (Intellence), Truvada ( FTC + tenofovir) and Norvir (ritonavir). I was part of a clinical trial, but I didn't feel like a research guinea pig. Instead, I felt more like I had achieved a per- sonal victory through all the work I did in accepting to start treatment andmaking a contract with my doctor. Many people might find that a CD4 count of 169is pretty low, but I lived with between 0and 4CD4cells for 13 years, so I see my combination as a great success. I have no regrets about waiting so long to start HAART , as I have the hope of living for many more years. JAKEHILLS ,45 Vancouver Diagnosedwith HIVin2000 CD4count:540 Viralload:undetectable May 1, 2000: I tested positive. My virus was at very low levels and I was healthy and active. For the next fewyears I had regular tests and check- ups. Everything was going great. 2005: I could feel a change taking place. I was becoming doubtful of the most basic things, and I wasn't able to complete thoughts. By 2006, I started getting terrible pains in my legs. Sometimes my neuropathy was so painful that I couldn't walk. December 2006: I had a near- collapse at work. I had no energy andfelt mentally and physically empty. I wasn't on HIVmeds and I felt like the HIVwas taking over my system. My advocate at BCPWA told me to go to my doctor, who immediately sent me for blood work. My CD4count was 50and my viral load was over 100,000. I was very sick with else. It wasn't just that there weren't many drugs to choose from, but the ones that were available were harsh, although for- tunately they proved to be effective. Thanks to the arrival of protease inhibitors, I was pulled back from the brink. Initially, I was on a dual therapy of saquinavir (Invirase) and d4T (Zerit), and in 1998 I stepped into the world of HAART when a third drug, nel- navir, was added. Since then, there have been changes to my regimen in attempts to minimize side effects and take advan- tage of newer and hopefully less-toxic drugs. My choice of antiretrovirals has been limited due to my intoler- ance of ritonavir. The side effects of my regimen have been constant and chronic, and I am now eyeing drugs from new classes, such as the inte- grase inhibitor raltegravir (Isentress), that seem to be very well tolerated. I recently went through four months of test-driving several newcombos in an attempt to switch to a regimen that's less toxic. New classes of drugs, new drugs in old classes and drugs combined into one pill\u2014I tried them all. It was a rough ride and at the end I was left taking the same oldmeds\u2014saquinavir and nelnavir. Tenofovir (Viread), the third member of my HAART team, was signed on because it's a less toxic non-nuke than the older but still potent d4T. While my choices at first were pretty much by default and made by my doctors, 20yearsonitisadiffer- ent story. Now I learn about the drugs that are available. I review the literature and talk with people whoare taking the drugs, trying to weigh the benets and potential side effects before I meet with my HIVdoc. My doctor is open to discussing my options and considering possible com- binations of antiretrovirals. So, it's been through a combination of consultation and elimination that I've ended up on my current HAART regimen. \u001aI didn't go back on the meds until about two years ago. A change in lifestyle made me do it: I had my 13th grandchild and decided I wanted to live a little longer. Also, I got a job asOutreach Coordinator at All NationsHope AIDS Network. (Even though I didn't want to deal with my own problems, I still wanted to help otherpeople.) When I went to see the doctor, she put me on Kivexa and Sustiva. Basi- cally, she left the room, wrote out the prescription and put it in my hand. I didn't ask questions\u2014I gured thedoctor knows what she's doing. I think I put too much faith in the doctor. I was never given the opportunity to discuss the medica- tions. There could be something out there that's better for me, but nobody's ever given me the chance to talk about it. Plus, nobody has ever discussed with me the side effects of any of the meds I've been on. The only way I knowabout side effects is from the informa- tion package that comes with the meds. I've found out more about my medsand their side effects from that package than from my doc-tor. I get more help frommy pharmacist thanfrom anybody else. I'm also on methadone,and nobody's ever talked to me about drug interactions. I'm fortunate because I get the education I need about HIVfrom the eld I work in. What about the people out there who don't have that opportunity? MICHAELCONNIDIS ,54 Vancouver Diagnosedwith HIVin1985 CD4count:570 Viralload: <40(\"thenewundetectable\") How I chose my HAART regimen, or, life in the default lane: My choice was pretty limited in the early days, as itI met with my doctor and pharma- cist to discuss the immediate need for drug therapy. Thesideeffectissue was very high on my list. I didn't wanttobesickfromtakingdrugs that were supposed to help me. I also suffered terribly from anxiety and depression, and I wanted meds that wouldn't make those issuesworse. Given how sick I was, my doctor and pharmacist wanted an aggressive approach against the virus. We dis- cussed all the treatment options and decided on a combination of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) and Truvada. I was wary of Kaletra because of concerns about heart problemsas a possible sideeffect. However, I'd heard that in combina- tion with Truvada thedrugs worked well against HIV. February 2007: I started HAART . Initially I had strong side effects, but I never stopped taking the meds (the side effects only lasted one month). I rested a lot as my system repaired itself. Today: I've added relaxation thera- pies and tness to my health regimen.They've helped me gain weight andimprove my mental state. I've also learned the value of talking to my peers at BCPWA about their experiences. GORDONSINCLAIR ,48 Regina Diagnosedwith HIVin2000 CD4count:312 Viralload:25,000 I never really chose my meds; it was the doctor who did the choosing. Iwasn't even given any options. When I was rst diagnosed they put me on meds right away\u2014Viracept (nelnavir) and Combivir. I was on that combination for about two years.Then I went through a bad time in my life, and every day that I took those meds I was reminded of what I had, so I stopped taking them completely. I avoided going to the clinic and I put HIVin the background.

My participation in support groups taught me the impor- tance of listening to people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), including those with points of view different from my own. I discov- ered how important it was to pay attention to experiences that I had not lived myself, as well as the stages of denialand acceptance that varied from one person to the next. There is no single experience of being HIVpositive. There is, however, only one way to listen to these experiences: by imposing silence on one's ownexperiences and listening without judgment or comparison. Eventually I became involved in community work. I sat for sev-eral years on the board of CPAVIH (Comit\u00e9 des personnes atteintes duVIHdu Qu\u00e9bec), an AIDS service organization ( ASO) in Quebec that officially closed in 2008 amid widespread indifference. It was during my time at CPAVIH that I came to understand how important HIVinformation is to people living with the virus and that they prefer to receive this information from ASOs.W hen I learned I was HIVpositive, I had already devel- oped AIDS. I had Kaposi's sarcoma and my life expectancy was only a few months. It was one year before the combi- nation-therapy revolution. HAART arrived just in time to pull my head above water. In the beginning, when I spoke to my friends and family about what I was feeling physically and emotionally, their reactions often began with words like \"You should ...\" or \"If I were you. ...\" Inside I was thinking: \"How clueless!\" How could they truly feel what I was feeling? I knew their inten- tion was to reassure and encour- age me, but how could anyone who isn't infected truly understand what it is like to live with HIV? Several months went by before I joined my rst support group. By the end of the rst session, I left with the feeling that I was now part of a secret society\u2014the society of people living with HIV. In a way I was proud to be part of it, proud to have been accepted into it. It's far from an ideal society\u2014a fact I continue to discover year after year\u2014but it's the only one that ts us. It's a society that is prey toPROFILE A Voice for All Duringthe13yearsthat Albert Martin hashadHIV,hehaslearnedthatthe voicesofpeoplelivingwithHIVhave auniqueresonance.BycreatingFr\u00e9quenceVIHanditswebsite www.frequencevih.ca hehasmade certainthatthesevoicescanbeheardloudandclear. There is no single experience of being HIV positive.For many years CPAVIH was the only ASOin Quebec and it gave a voice to PHAs through its many accomplishments, including its treatment and legal information services and its magazine, Le Point de VIH, which I contributed to. With CPAVIH gone, I believe we will come to realize\u2014hopefully sooner rather than later\u2014that HIVactivism must nd new ways to express itself. I truly believe that HIVis here to stay for many years and we must collectively acknowledge who we are and afrm it. When I say afrm, I don't simply mean stating who we are in the public arena, but also among ourselves as HIV- positive people. We must establish relationships and build bridges between ourselves and the groups we represent. In my opinion, we will have a better chance of being heard if we speakwith a single voice. This is the only way to get our message across and it is urgent that we do so. It was this realization and my longtime experience as a journal- ist, scriptwriter and novelist thatled me to create Fr\u00e9quence VIH, a network whose main face is its website www.frequencevih.ca. The site is a mix of current news and in-depth reporting on HIV/AIDS , all in French. When the site was launched in 2005, there was no Internet site that focused on the realityof Quebec PHAs. Now, every week from Monday to Friday, there are stories about HIV/AIDS from around the world. This daily press review of general news about HIV/AIDS is unique in the French-speaking world. We provide information and allow all PHAs to make their voices heard, regardless of where they live or where they come from. I am always surprised and moved to receive the feedback of forgotten PHAs living in villages in Quebec, Guyana or Lebanon\u2014people seek-ing comfort in front of an anony- mous computer screen. Fr\u00e9quence VIHhas become a place where people with HIVcan feel at ease, can feel at home. I nd it atrocious that the sec- tion dealing with lipodystrophy places third on the list of the site's most visited pages\u2014more than 10,000 visitors during the past six months! I imagine the pain ofthese no-doubt isolated peoplewho visit the site day after day inthe hope of learning about a treat- ment that will free them from the ostracism they face. I am quite proud of the fact that \"Diane\" (not her real name)\u2014 10THEPOSITIVESIDE Winter 2008the HIV-positive Quebec woman accused and convicted of aggravated sexual assault for not disclosing her status before having sex with her ex-partner\u2014agreed to share her story in an exclusive interview with Fr\u00e9quence VIH. The organization supports Diane and COCQ -Sida in their appeal of the judgment. It is a major case for all HIV-positive people in Canada. A year ago, Fr\u00e9quence VIHstarted producing videos and, to date, has completed seven in partnership with other HIVgroups\u2014and more are coming. We have also produced more than 40radio shows, presenting inter- views with workers from Quebec and French HIVorganiza- tions and reports on pressing subjects such as lipodystro- phy or criminalization. There are also numerous personal accountsfrom PHAs. We have plans to open Fr\u00e9- quence VIHto other languages, for example, with a series of stories titled Si d'aventures en aventures (From One Adventure to the Next)written by HIV-positive Quebec youth and translated into Spanish.We will also have interviews inEnglish (with French transcripts). Fr\u00e9quence VIHwishes to con- tinue its role as spokesperson for those without a voice in the HIVcommunity. We want the voice of HIV-positive people to be heard and to nd its place in society. We wish to build bridges between the HIVcommunity and society in general. Despite the empathetic ear of many HIV-negative people, PHAvoices remain misunderstood and often incom- prehensible for the majority of people who are not living this reality. They do not know what we are talking aboutand often do not want to know. Every day I am outraged by this lack of understanding and openness, and it is one of the rea- sons why I never tire of ghting, either through my work with Fr\u00e9quence VIHor my work as a writer. I doubt my most recent novelwill ever nd a publisher. The story of a doctor who is fascinated by patients who actively search to be infected by HIVwill never be a best- seller\u2014it is too taboo. But such behaviour exists, and we should talk about it. Why is there resist-ance to talking about all the realitiesof HIV, even within the HIVcommu- nity? As long as these realities are suppressed or denied, Fr\u00e9quence VIHwill remind us of their exis- tence. It is my hope that Fr\u00e9quence VIHwill continue to reflect the expe- riences of all people living with HIV, even long after my departure. \u001afrequencevih.ca has become a place where people with HIV can feel at ease, can feel at home. Nothingto neezeat 11 Winter 2008THEPOSITIVESIDEhether it's your mother's chicken soup or a double dose of vitamin C, everyone has a \"prescription\" for keep- ing the flu at bay. When these tactics fail and the sniffles, chills and aches invade, most people treat the flu as an unwelcome and uncomfortable nuisance. But for people with weakened immune systems, influenza can be much more than a nasty bug. According to Dr. Curtis Cooper, an infectious disease specialist at The Ottawa Hospital, influenza is responsible for an average of 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths each year in Canada\u2014primarily among the elderly, young children and people with compromised immune systems. He explains that for people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), the flu can lead to complications like pneumonia and even death. Itcan also last longer and result in more heart- and lung-related hospitalizations.For many PHAs, an annual flu shot is part of the strategy to beat the bug each winter. Suzanne MacCarthy investigates how Canadianresearchers are working tomake the vaccine even more effective. with contributions fromJennifer ChungILLUSTRATIONS: MARK STAY/ISTOCKPHOTO.COMWith flu season prevention, prevention.\" Jos\u00e9 Sousa, who was diagnosed with HIVin1985, says he takes \"lots of vitamin C in order to prevent or shorten the duration of the flu.\" As a waiter who works closely with the public, Sousa is aware that he may be exposed to all kinds of contagious ill- nesses, so he tries to take good care of himself. Sousa knows the flu shot is an important part of his health strat- egy, and this year he'll be making extra efforts to get one. Cooper agrees that vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent specic strains of the flu virus. PHAs are especially encouraged to get a flu shot every year. \"If [your viral load] is undetectable, usually you won't experience the moresevere symptoms,\" says Sousa, who also chairs the commit- tee at the Canadian HIVTrials Network ( CTN) that reviews HIV/AIDS clinical research from a community perspective. \"But if you have a weakened immune system, chances are the flu is going to be worse no matter how old you are.\" The influenza vaccine is considered the standard of care to protect PHAs from the flu, and overall its benets outweigh its costs. Side effects associated with the vaccination include local injection-site pain, swelling and redness. Some people may experience brief periods of fevers and aches. However, his physician colleagues have observed over time that the vaccine does not always ward off the bug and that the number of cases of influenza among PHAs remains quite high in Canada. Two shots at the flu Aware that one flu shot a year isn't foolproof, Cooper and a team of Canadian researchers are currently investigating an innovative approach to maximize the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in PHAs. Their study examines whether receiving multiple doses of the vaccine results in improved protection from the flu. This past fall, eligible HIV-positive volunteers from across the country enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of Fluviral vaccine to help researchers nd the most effective treatment strategy. Study CTN 237set out to recruit 285people at clinics in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. \"There are not that many studies that examine flu vacci- nation strategies and HIV-positive people,\" says Sousa. \"This study will help determine whether a double dose of the vac- cine or booster shot will produce enough antibodies in the body to ght the flu.\" In addition to potentially beneting PHAs, Cooper explains that ndings from this study could also help other people with compromised immune systems. \"We're eager to see if results from this study might be applicable to other popula- tions, including those on corticosteroids as well as people living with autoimmune disease, organ transplantation and cancer,\" he says. Until one single strategy exists to avoid the flu entirely, Cooper will continue to advise his patients to take precau- tions in addition to getting their shot. Frequent hand-wash- ing with soap and warm water is a must, he says. If soap and water are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers or hand wipes containing 60to90percent ethyl alcohol or isopropanol can be very effective. Washing or sanitizing is particularly important if you touch your hands to your eyes,nose or mouth. Whether testing new strategies for vaccination or pro- viding advice for his patients, Cooper remains concerned that PHAs take the necessary precautions to protect them- selves from the perils of influenza. \"The rst step to avoid- ing the nasty flu bug is to get a free flu vaccination fromyour healthcare professional.\" \u001a To learn more about the flu vaccination study ( CTN237) visit www.hivnet.ubc.ca or call 1.800.661.4664.

You know the kind. Maybe you just spent hours at your local AIDS service organization in a meeting where you could have cut the tension with a knife. Or you're anxiously waiting to nd out if your last viral load test was just a blip or whether it shows that your meds are starting to fail. Or you're feeling weak and depleted by the various gastrointestinal side effects from your new drug combination. We all have these days, and they call for some tender, lov- ing self-care. With a little effort and next to no cost, you can create a spa-like oasis of calm and tranquility in your very own bathroom. For centuries, people have turned to the restorative powers of the bath to soothe body and soul. Ancient Roman bathhouses featured communal steam baths, stimulatingcold baths and relaxing warm baths. Islamic societies value thehammam for hygienic and religious purposes. Scandi- navians and Russians are renowned for their saunas, which they nish off with a dip in icy water or snow. Cana- dians have the thermal waters of Banff Springs as part ofour national heritage. Bath-time self-care doesn't depend on pricey lotions and potions. There are many options available straight from your garden or cupboard\u2014with the added bonus that theywon't damage the environment. Bypass the products that cost a small fortune. Many of us are living on a xed income and have little spare change for such luxuries. Besides,Cover girl and CATIE staffer Darien Taylor divulges her tips for transforming yourbath into a sanctuary of peace and especially some bubble baths, can be harsh on the skin or even aggravate yeast infections. A simple bath recipe is to mix Epsom salts (which cost a few dollars for a big bag and can be found at any pharmacy or grocery store) with a few drops of your favourite essen- tial oil. Epsom salts are rich in magnesium; simply soaking in a bath with them can boost our levels of this element,which eliminates toxins and helps with muscle, nerve and enzyme function. The key to using your bath as a therapeutic tool is to be mindful and intentional in nurturing your body andsoul. Enter the water with the intention to be cleansed, puriedand relieved of your pains and stresses\u2014be they emotional,physical or spiritual. Make your bath a feast for your senses. Put on some relaxing background music, dim the lights and burn some beeswax candles or incense. Treat yourself with something special to eat (maybe some berries or chocolate) or drink (a glass of wine, mineral water or a soothing herbal tea). A warm bath is very calming, and an inflatable neck pillow or rolled towel behind your head will help you truly relax. It's also a goodtime for a facial mask or hot oil treatment for your hair. And just in case you get a little too relaxed and start to drift off, set a timer for20to30minutes.15 Winter 2008THEPOSITIVESIDETherapeutic baths make such good use of natural ingredients to promote health that you are bound to feel lighter, happier and more in touch with your environment afterwards. Here are some hints to help these good feelings last. If you share the bath- room with others, be conscious of their needs. Noth- ing is more guaranteed to wake you out of your reveries than a sharp knock on the door from a roommate or family member who needs the bath- room for a more practical purpose. And rememberthat water is a precious resource\u2014use only whatyou need. Finally, lay back...exhale...enjoy! Youdeserve it. Driftoffonacloud: abathtohelpyousleep Many people who are living with HIVhave trouble sleeping due to stress, night sweats or side effects. A warm bath before bed can do wonders in terms of preparing you for a good night's sleep.

While relaxingin the tub, breathe deeply and mindfully, paying attention to your breathing as you inhale and exhale\u2014the extra oxygen will nourish your cells. Try to visualize your body as a temple of healthand healing. Or visualize yourself being success-ful at your goals: being loved and appreciated, triumphing over adversity, laughing.

Our recipes for body scrubs are made from natural ingredients that are literally good body and mind, dispels rest- lessness and promotes a relaxing sleep. To prevent the chamomile from plugging your drain, create a bath bag by placing a handful of chamomile in the centre of asquare of cheesecloth (approximately 20cm by 20cm) and tie securely with string. Hang the bag around the faucet while running a warm bath. You can dry and reuse the bag (and its contents) again for another two or three baths. GBe a flower child.

There are other potential negative consequences as well, such as PHAs feeling pressured to start treatment before it is medically necessary. The Swiss statement has been refuted by many national and inter- national organizations on the basis that there is not yet sufcient evi- dence for such a bold and potentially misleading conclusion. (For an in- depth analysis of the evidence be- hind the statement, read Treatment- Update #166, March 2008, available at www.catie.ca/tu.nsf.) Unfortunat- ely, there is currently no consensus among the global research commu- nity about how to interpret what little evidence there is. That's because the transmission of HIVcan depend dra- matically on several factors, and all of these factors can play out differently in different people. ne of the more important biologi- cal factors for HIVtransmission is viral load. There is mounting evidence that reduced viral load can mean reduced risk of HIV transmission for some people. The Swiss commission went so far as to say that PHAs with an unde- tectable viral load can be \"non-infec- tious\" in some circumstances. Recently, however, there have been several anec- dotal reports and one published case study of HIVtransmission in male couples who meet the cri- teria set out in the Swiss statement. So there is still a risk of HIVtransmission with an undetectable viral load. We know from existing research that, on average , undetectable viral load results in a low risk of HIVtrans- mission\u2014less virus, less chance of transmission. But we also have good reason to believe that this reduced risk does not happen all the time and does not apply to every- one, as the Swiss commission origi-nally claimed. Many studies have indicated that viral load, by itself,may not be an accurate indicator of risk for any one person at any one particular time. Viral load tests look only at the amount of virus in the blood, whichaccounts for less than 2%of the virusarlier this year, the Swiss National AIDS Commission sparked a global controversy when itreleased a provocative statement about viral load and HIVtransmission. The Swiss commission said that a personwith HIV/AIDS (PHA) would be sexually non-infectious if that person: a) is tak- ing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART ) with excellent adherence, b) has an undetectable viral load for the past six consecutive months, c) is in a stable and monogamous relationshipandd) neither partner has a sexually transmitted infection ( STI). The state- ment was an expert opinion based on a small number of studies in hetero-sexual people, but the implications were huge. If true, the statement seemed to say that some people with HIVmight not need to use condoms every time they have sex. The Swiss statement came in response to a growing climate of criminalization, in which PHAs are being accused of endangering the lives of others through unprotectedsexual relations. If scientific evi- dence showed that people with an undetectable viral load were not infectious, they would no longerbe a \"threat\" to their sex partners and arguments that support HIV criminalization laws would beweakened. Evidence of being non-infectious could also go a long way toward reducing stigma and discrimina- tion. PHAs might nd it easier to disclose their HIVstatus to sex partners, friends and family. Serodiscordant couples might become less fearful of sexual intimacy with the knowledge that HIVtransmission is less likely. Heterosexual couples could nd it easier to try having children without resorting to the often unaffordable or unavailable services of a fertility clinic. And sex could regain more joy and carry less stress than it did before. On the other hand, HIVprevention advocates noted that the conditions laid out by the Swiss statement arevery specic. There is a concern that the message will reach a broader audience than it was intended for. People who don't meet all the condi- tions may mistakenly assume they are safe and then change their sex habits, 18THEPOSITIVESIDE Winter 2008CATIE offers Beyond the Banana , a workshop for service providers that covers the biology of HIV transmission.

Even in people with undetectable viral load in the blood, virus can still sometimes be detected in the semen and genital fluids. Also, from time to time people onHAART with undetectable viral load can experience short bursts of viral activity, which cause a temporary detectable viral load (these are called blips). Viral load may also increase when a person does not take their HAART regimen faithfully on time and as directed. Any of these scenarios could lead to the transmission of HIV during unprotected vaginal or anal sex. y nature, estimates of HIVrisk are not very accu- rate because the risk of transmission is very difcult tomeasure. Since the Swiss statement, a group of Ameri- can HIVresearchers has conducted a systematic review of published data and found that current estimates of risk might be too low. More importantly, the review found that HIVrisk is extremely dependent on circum- stances, so there is no single measure of risk that applies to everyone. For example, studies have found that unprotected anal sex may be more than 30times more risky than unprotected vaginalsex. Researchers have also pointed out that the cumulative risk of transmitting HIVincreases with the number of sexual expo- sures. Over time, small risks can add up to a signicant overall chance of transmission. The picture that appears to be emerging is that HIV risk is dynamic. Over the course of time, PHAs may experience periods of heightened infectivity, while atother times their infectivity may be quite low. Likewise, the suscep-tibility of people who are negative can vary over time. Having a bet- ter understanding of how HIVis transmitted can help us make safer decisions about sex. Unfortunately, we don't yet know all of the factors involved in accurately predicting risk. Until recently, we had two ways to stop the spread of the virus: using condoms and choosing what kind of sex we have. The Canadian AIDS Society ( CAS) publishes guidelines (titled HIVTransmission Guidelines for Assessing Risk, available atwww.cdnaids.ca) that categorize dif-ferent sex activities as being high, low, negligible, or no risk. You know 19 Winter 2008THEPOSITIVESIDEDARIENTAYLOR has lived with HIVfor more than 20 years and has been active in the community and the cause for just as long. without a condom is high risk; kissing, with no blood, is no risk. People continue to use the CASguidelines as a starting point for making decisions around how to keep them- selves and their partners safe, but they are beginning to include in their decisions other factors that increase or decrease risk. Viral load is one such factor; stage of HIV infection is another. During the rst ve to six months of HIVinfection, the risk of passing on HIVis very high. Dur- ing this time, levels of virus in the body are very high, but there may also be other reasons for the increased risk. Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs), in either part- ner, can also heighten the risk. STIs can raise the amount ofHIVin genital and rectal fluids. In HIV-negative people, anSTIcan make it easier for HIVto enter the body. STIs also cause activated immune cells to collect near the infection, and HIVloves to infect activated immune cells. Some other factors that can make it easier for HIV- negative partners to contract HIVare imbalances in the bacteria that live in the vagina (bac- terial vaginosis) or rectum, inflam- mation, cuts or lesions, variations in the levels of sex hormones, and dryness of the fragile barriers that line the inside of the body. Youngwomen who are just entering puberty and older women who have entered menopause might also be athigher risk because the barriers in their vagina and cervix are not as strong as in other women. hile we don't yet know all of the factors involved in accurately predicting risk, there are some things we do know. Condoms dra- matically reduce risk\u2014when they are used properly and don't break. High viral load can increase the risk, as can STIs in either partner. Cir- cumcision can reduce the risk for an HIV-negative man who has unpro- tected sex with women, but not enough to make sex safe. The good news is that the things that we already do to manage our health\u2014like treating STIs, starting meds when it is time and sticking to our pill-taking schedule\u2014also reduce the chances that HIVwill be transmit- ted. How much this can contribute to HIVprevention is still an open ques- tion. But it is a question that we arenow talking about more openly. \u001a 20THEPOSITIVESIDE Winter 2008MARKYUDIN MD Obstetrician and Vancouver's Downtown East Side and researcher at the University of there were a couple of differences. One was the emphasis on human rights and con- centrated epidemics. It has never been emphasized so clearly that in order to scale up treatment and preventionservices we have to make some pro- gress on HIV-specic stigma and dis- crimination as well as other forms of discrimination against communities at risk of HIVinfection. Homosexuality is illegal in, I think, more than 80coun- tries, as one example, and it is difcult for a community to access services if its identity is criminalized or ignored. Another difference was the clear recognition of the need to strengthen overall health systems in developing countries. We've hit a wall in terms of expanding HIVservices in these coun- tries until health services are strength- ened. We need to pay close attention to the links between systems broadly and to the integration of HIVservices with other services\u2014primary care, mater- nal health, tuberculosis testing and treatment, and sexual and reproduc- tive health.Whatwasmostmemorableforyou abouttheconference? Meeting with the youth coalitions in the Global Village and seeing so much energy among young people. I don't think many of us realized 20years ago or more when we got involved thatthis was going to be a multigenera- tional ght. But I am now moving through middle age and it is that muchmore evident to me that it is going to be the next generation of advocates and researchers and healthcare work- ers that carries the torch. It is their ideas and creativity that will take us into the next phase of the epidemic. I was impressed by their forthrightness, assertiveness and demand to be at thetable. That strikes me as very powerful indeed. Whatdidyouhearorlearnaboutthe epidemicthatmadeabigimpression onyou? That the idea of eradication [that is, curing HIV] is back on the table. It was a presentation by Bob Siliciano at a basic science plenary session. It is the rst time that eradication has been on the table publicly since 1998. Also, the new guidelines from IAS- USA that recommend going back to earlier treatment\u2014to start at 350 CD4s, and in the small print the guide- lines talk about starting even earlier on an individualized basis, such as if someone has an HIV-negative partner or an underlying propensity for heart disease. The reason for this shift is the con- rmation that HIVdisease is really a chronic inflammatory disease, and that even before the immune systemstarts to be damaged, right from the beginning of infection the virus iscausing inflammation that is putting pressure on the heart, kidney and lungs. So, with gentler, more forgiv- ing drugs now, the argument to start treatment earlier is even stronger, to prevent damage to the body evenbefore the immune system starts to weaken. Whatdidyoulearnorrealizethat mightchangethewayyoudo yourwork? From where I sit, the conference is still grounded in HIV/AIDS but is mov- ing more and more toward a confer- ence about global health and human rights. This is an issue for the IAS board to think about\u2014how far do we want this to go? The more we respond to AIDS, the more we all realize that dealing with this disease is really about dealingwith human rights, including the right to health, and the lack of protection of human rights among the most mar- ginalized people in communitiesaround the world.

I remind people that they are the experts on themselves, and rather than give advice I try to offer questions for people to ponder. For example: What is depression telling you about yourself that is not true? What is depression stealing from you? Do you talk back to depression and what do you tell it? I would also ask people about their sup- port networks and who in their life is helpful. Are there people who are not helpful, and, if so, how can they be han-dled differently? I would ask about their exercise habits and talk about the need to take power back from depression by being more active rather than passive. Unlike anti-depressant medication, talk therapy helps people reflect on how they can be an active participantin their healing and not let depressiontake power away from them. This caninvolve journaling or any form of artis- tic expression that is life-giving.

This is accom- panied by a combination of the follow-ing: a change in appetite, problems sleeping, low energy, feeling slowed down, difculty concentrating, feeling worthless, and maybe thoughts of sui-cide or that life is not worth living. We know from studies that people with HIVare at higher risk of develop- ing depression. Biological factors, such as the effects of a chronic illness, may be one reason for this increased risk. Living with HIVcan also present certain stresses, including coping with stigma and coping with a chronic illness. As well, some anti- HIVmedications can cause side effects such as depression. The rst thing I do when I suspect someone is depressed is to learn as much as I can about the person and their symptoms of depression: Howlong has the person had symptoms? Are there any stressful events that trig- gered them? If there's a history of depression, how was it treated? Are there any medical causes for their symptoms? Is there a family history ofdepression? What supports does the person have in place to help them cope? I then try to create, with the per- son, an individualized treatment plan, usually a combination of therapy and medication. After I make a diagnosis of depres- sion, I may start someone's treatment with one of the SSRIs (selective sero- tonin reuptake inhibitors, such as Paxil, Zoloft and Celexa), primarily because they may be better toleratedthan some older medications. Cogni- tive-behavioural therapy (generally speaking, learning to understand the connection between your feelings, thoughts and actions) and interper- sonal therapy (helping someone work through grief, transitions, relationship disputes) are short-term treatments for depression. One or the other might be the best t for someone dealing with depression. People can talk with their family doctor, who can assist in diagnosis, treatment planning and referral to apsychiatrist if necessary. AIDS service organizations can be helpful whenlooking for resources in thecommunity. Many SSRIs are cov- ered by extended health plansand provincial formularies, but it's best to check with your pharmacist for the details in your province or territory.

When helping people who are depressed, I am rst inter-ested in hearing about when they began feeling depressed, and I ask them to describe what it was like before that in order to get a baseline for how they see their normal functioning. I help people understand that they are not the problem\u2014the problem is the problem. I help them to take control back from depression by externalizing it and seeing it as separate from them- selves. This can involve not accepting the identity that others put on them, which may be making them feel down. By objectifying the problem, clients can begin to form their own sense of selfthat is separate from the expectations that others, including society in gen- eral, have placed on them.

What I wanted to do in the Migrations series was show that when you are diagnosed with HIVyou become temporarily immobilized in your thinking, knowing it's a long journey ahead. For me, the whole experience after diagnosis was about how the landscape around me kept shifting and changing while I learned to stabilize. My life had to adjust in so many ways to being HIVpositive. The ve large-scale paintings in this series cover my expe- rience during my rst year post-diagnosis and identify dis- tinct transitions in acknowledging and accepting being HIV positive. The order of the paintings is Crash, Red Cloak, The Turning,StirringtheWaters andResolve . They were painted over one year at intervals when I was ready to explore each part of my personal recovery. Recovery, to me, has been the process of accepting the imposition of the virus and prepar- ing myself emotionally, mentally and physically for each hur- dle or setback that has presented itself along the journey. When I rst received my diagnosis, I was frozen by the shock of it and not feeling able to even deal with it. Over time, I realized I had to make the decision to get my head and my heart right. The paintings show the process of howI became grounded and overcame obstacles as I moved for- ward, while opening up to support from those around me. Whennaturecalls There is a lot of symbolism in the work but it's subtle. The paintings are a visual poem in which the landscape is very interpretive. Each one contains varied elements of coastline (rock, water, trees), and because I'm from the East Coast, I use seabirds. They represent the outside forces that you either embrace or resist. Though there is a bit of me in each of the paintings, the male form in each one is not nec- essarily my form. The AIDS Committee of Newfoundland and Labrador (ACNL) housed the series for World AIDS Day 2007 , and the paintings have remained in the lobby of our centre as an educational tool. They have opened the door for a lot of con- versations here. Art has been an integral component of the activity of ACNL's peer support project PIERS (PHAs Interact- ing and Engaging in Real Support).

It's a personal choice for any parent when to disclose, but I chose to reveal my HIVstatus a few months after my diagnosis, which opened the door for honesty and discus- sion.
