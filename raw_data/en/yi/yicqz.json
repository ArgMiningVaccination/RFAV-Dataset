The Commission recently approved a tentative recommendation on this topic,4 which is now being widely circulated for comment.5 The tentative recommendation proposes to move the CPRA to a new division of the Government Code (proposed Division 10 of Title 1) and reorganize the content of the CPRA in a more logical, readily accessible manner. Such relocation necessarily entails renumbering the provisions within the CPRA. Approximately 600 provisions throughout the codes refer to the CPRA, in whole or in part. If the proposed recodification is eventually enacted, each of those provisions will have to be revised to conform to the new numbering scheme. The staff prepared a draft of the necessary conforming revisions, which is framed as a separate tentative recommendation. The narrative portion (\"preliminary part\") of that draft is attached for Commissioners and other interested persons to review. The proposed legislation is voluminous (over 700 pages). It is available online at http://www.clrc.ca.gov/G400.html (click on the link for Memo 2019-38). A 1. See 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth & Chau)). 2. Any California Law Revision Commission document referred to in this memorandum can be obtained from the Commission. Recent materials can be downloaded from the Commission's website (www.clrc.ca.gov). Other materials can be obtained by contacting the Commission's staff, through the website or otherwise. The Commission welcomes written comments at any time during its study process. Any comments received will be a part of the public record and may be considered at a public meeting. However, comments that are received less than five business days prior to a Commission meeting may be presented without staff analysis. 3. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 4.

Comments may be submitted to bgaal@clrc.ca.gov. To receive optimal consideration, comments on the tentative recommendation should be submitted by August 26, 2019. - 2 - hard copy of the complete draft will be available for review at the upcoming meeting. After considering the matters discussed below and any other issues that come to its attention, the Commission will need to decide whether to approve this draft of the conforming revisions as a tentative recommendation (with or without modifications), to be circulated for comment. GENERAL APPROACH The vast majority of the conforming revisions in the attached draft are simple and straightforward. They were time-consuming for the staff to prepare, but there is not much for the Commission to discuss. The proposed amendments would conform each CPRA cross-reference to the new numbering scheme in the proposed CPRA recodification. For example, suppose a code section currently says that a particular report is subject to disclosure under \"the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code).\" The conforming revision of that section would amend it to say that the report is subject to disclosure under \"the California Public Records Act (Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code).\" The proposed amendments would also do some routine technical clean-up of statutory language, the kinds of revisions that the Office of Legislative Counsel normally incorporates in any pending bill (e.g., spelling and typographical corrections; elimination of gendered pronouns). Aside from such routine technical clean-up, the existing statutory language would generally be left alone. In some code provisions, an existing cross-reference to the CPRA is outdated or otherwise incorrect. In each of those instances, the staff determined the correct cross-reference and then updated it to the new numbering scheme, instead of perpetuating the error. Each such correction is explained in the accompanying Comment.6 6. See proposed amendment of Fish & Game Code \u00a7 2584 & Comment; 101848.2, 101848.9, \u00a7\u00a7 7443, 13519.4 & Comments; proposed amendments of Rev. & Tax. Code \u00a7\u00a7 408.3, 409 & Comments; proposed 14129.2, 15805, 16809.4 also proposed amendment of Ins. Code \u00a7 12921.2 & Comment (approved by Commission in April 2019). - 3 - A handful of provisions present other types of issues. The Commission has already considered and decided how to address some of those issues; the staff simply followed-up on its instructions in the attached draft.7 A few other matters are discussed below. PROVISIONS THAT MIGHT REQUIRE SPECIAL APPROVAL At least two of the provisions that require conforming revisions (Health and Safety Code Sections 125290.30 and 125290.50) were added to the codes by an initiative proposition. Consequently, special rules might apply when amending those provisions. Although the Commission previously examined such rules in the context of the Fish and Game study (Study R-100), the staff has not yet specifically assessed how those rules would apply here. We will do so and report our conclusions in a supplemental memorandum. There is also another provision in the draft of CPRA conforming revisions that might be subject to special amendment procedures: Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14165. See Section 3.5 of Article XVI of the California Constitution (special approval requirements for statute that amends or adds to provisions of Medi-Cal Hospital Reimbursement Improvement Act of 2013). The staff will look into and report on that matter as well. If time permits, the staff will also doublecheck whether any of the other conforming revisions pose this type of issue. MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE SECTION 7284.10 Two similar, but not identical, versions of Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7284.10 were added to the codes in 2018.8 Both versions include the same definition of \"local agency,\" which cross-refers to a CPRA provision (Government Code Section 6252). If the proposed CPRA recodification is enacted, that cross-reference will require updating. In the draft of CPRA conforming revisions, the staff made no attempt to resolve the conflict between the two different versions of Revenue and Taxation 7. See proposed amendment of Gov't Code \u00a7 11126 & Comment & Note; proposed amendment of Pub. Res. Code \u00a7 5096.513 & Comment & Note. See also proposed amendment of Health & Safety Code \u00a7 131052 & Comment (Proposed deletion of sentence in paragraph (7) on how to interpret Government Code Section 6254's erroneous reference to \"State Department of Health Services\" logically follows from Commission's May 2019 decision to correct that erroneous reference in recodifying Government Code Section 6254(s). See Memorandum 2019-31, pp. 4-5 & Attachment p. 104; Draft Minutes (May 2019), pp. 3-4)). 8. See 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 61, \u00a7 1; 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 88, \u00a7 1. - 4 - Code Section 7284.10. We just included a conforming revision of each version, followed by a Note that says: Note. Two similar, but not identical, versions of Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7284.10 were added to the codes in 2018: (1) 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 61, \u00a7 1 ... and (2) 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 88, \u00a7 1 .... Both versions include the same definition of \"local agency,\" which cross-refers to Government Code Section 6252. The Commission proposes to update that cross-reference in both versions of Section 7284.10, to conform to the Commission's proposed recodification of the California Public Records Act. If someone introduces a bill to resolve the conflict between the two versions, the Commission will coordinate its proposed legislation with that bill as needed. This approach seems most consistent with the nonsubstantive nature of this study. Is it acceptable to the Commission? GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS 15820.907 AND 15820.917 Government Code Section 15820.907 relates to jail facilities and correctional reentry facilities. As shown in italics below, it cross-refers to \"Section 6270:\" 15820.907 (a) Participating county matching funds for projects funded under this chapter shall be a minimum of 25 percent of the total project costs. The CSA9 may reduce matching fund requirements for participating counties with a general population below 200,000 upon petition by a participating county to the CSA requesting a lower level of matching funds. (b) The CDCR10 and CSA shall give funding preference to counties that assist the state in siting reentry facilities, pursuant to Section 6270.11 The CSA shall, to the extent possible, ensure that funds for the construction of new jail beds be coordinated with CDCR's efforts to site new reentry facilities. (c) The CDCR and CSA shall give funding preference to counties that assist the state in siting mental health day treatment and crisis care, pursuant to Section 3073 of the Penal Code, and to counties that provide a continuum of care so that parolees with mental health and substance abuse needs can continue to receive services at the conclusion of their period of parole. Pursuant to California drafting conventions, the cross-reference to \"Section 6270\" normally would be construed as a cross-reference to Section 6270 of the Government Code, because the cross-reference appears in a section of that code (Section 15820.907, shown above). However, Government Code Section 6270 has 9. \"CSA\" is an abbreviation for Corrections Standards Authority. See Gov't Code \u00a7 15820.901. 10. \"CDCR\" is an abbreviation for California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 11. Emphasis added. - 5 - nothing to do with correctional reentry facilities. It is a CPRA provision that prohibits a state or local agency from providing a public record to a private entity in a manner that prevents the agency from providing that record to the public directly.12 The Commission has tentatively proposed to repeal Government Code Section 6270 and recodify it as new Government Code Section 7921.000.13 The staff started to prepare a conforming revision of Government Code Section 15820.907 to reflect that renumbering, but then realized that the section probably is supposed to cross-refer to Penal Code Section 6270, not Government Code Section 6270. There no longer is a Penal Code Section 6270; it was repealed in 2012.14 However, there was a Penal Code Section 6270 relating to correctional reentry facilities when Government Code Section 15820.907 became law.15 Former Penal Code Section 6270 provided: 6270. The Legislature finds and declares the following: (a) The continuity of services provided both before and after an inmate's release on parole will improve the parolee's opportunity for successful reintegration into society. (b) Placing an inmate in a secure correctional facility within the community prior to parole into that community provides the opportunity for both parole officers and local law enforcement personnel to better coordinate supervision of that parolee.16 It seems likely that the Legislature intended to cross-refer to this material (and perhaps also some other material in the same chapter of the Penal Code)17 when 12. Section 6270 provides: 6270. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no state or local agency shall sell, exchange, furnish, or otherwise provide a public record subject to disclosure pursuant to this chapter to a private entity in a manner that prevents a state or local agency from providing the record directly pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this section requires a state or local agency to use the State Printer to print public records. Nothing in this section prevents the destruction of records pursuant to law. (b) This section shall not apply to contracts entered into prior to January 1, 1996, between the County of Santa Clara and a private entity for the provision of public records subject to disclosure under this chapter. 13. See Tentative Recommendation on California Public Records Act Clean-Up (May 2019). 14. See 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 42, \u00a7 11. 15. In fact, the two provisions (Gov't Code \u00a7 15820.907; former Penal Code \u00a7 6270) were enacted in the same bill. See 2007 Cal. Stat. ch. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 16. 16. 2007 Cal. Stat. ch. 7, \u00a7 16. 17. See West's Ann. Cal. Codes \u00a7 15820.907, p. 261 (2009) (indicating that cross-reference \"[p]robably should be Chapter 9.8 (commencing with Penal Code \u00a7 6270)\"). - 6 - it drafted Government Code Section 15820.907, but it inadvertently cross-referred to the CPRA instead. If former Penal Code Section 6270 was still good law, it might be tempting to try to fix Government Code Section 15820.907's erroneous cross-reference in the context of this study. Because Penal Code Section 6270 no longer exists, however, determining how to fix that cross-reference would require analysis of matters unrelated to this study (such as whether a comparable provision currently exists and should be cited instead). Rather than complicating the CPRA recodification with such matters, it may be preferable to address them in a study pursuant to the Commission's general authority to \"study and recommend revisions to correct technical or minor substantive defects in the statutes of the state ....\"18 In addition to examining the cross-reference in Government Code Section 15820.907, such a study could address a similar problem in Government Code 15820.917. Alternatively, the Commission could bring these problematic cross-references to the attention of the Assembly Public Safety Committee and/or the Senate Public Safety Committee, for possible inclusion in a public safety omnibus bill. How would the Commission like to proceed? CONTINGENT OPERATION Due to their bulk, it might be advisable to introduce the CPRA conforming revisions as a separate bill, instead of placing them in the same bill as the CPRA recodification. Otherwise, the conforming revisions might impede legislative review and consideration of the CPRA recodification itself. The decision about how many bills to introduce will be made later, primarily by the legislator (or legislators) who decides to introduce the Commission's proposed legislation. For present purposes, it seems best to assume that there will be two bills, not just one. That is probably the optimal approach and the one most likely to be used. If the conforming revisions are put in a separate bill, they should only become operative if (1) that bill is enacted and becomes operative and (2) the bill with the CPRA recodification is enacted and becomes operative. To accomplish that result, the draft of CPRA conforming revisions includes the following uncodified provision: 18. Gov't Code \u00a7 8298. - 7 - SEC. ___. This act shall only become operative if [the CPRA recodification bill] is enacted and becomes operative on July 1, 2021, and that bill would reorganize and make other nonsubstantive changes to the California Public Records Act, in which case this act shall also become operative on July 1, 2021. The appropriate bill number could be inserted in that uncodified provision (in place of the boldface language) after the recodification bill is introduced. If the conforming revisions wind up in the same bill as the CPRA recodification, it would be a simple matter to delete the above uncodified provision from the proposed legislation. Unless the Commission otherwise directs, the staff will monitor this situation and ensure that adjustments are made as needed. SUBORDINATION CLAUSE The draft of CPRA conforming revisions also includes a subordination clause, in case one or more of the many code provisions with a conforming revision is also amended in a substantive manner by another bill. The subordination clause provides: SEC. ___. Any section of any act enacted by the Legislature during the 2020 calendar year, other than a section of the annual maintenance of the codes bill or another bill with a subordination clause, that takes effect on or before July 1, 2021, and that amends, amends and renumbers, amends and repeals, adds, repeals and adds, or repeals a section that is amended, amended and renumbered, amended and repealed, added, repealed and added, or repealed by this act, shall prevail over this act, whether that act is chaptered before or after this act. This provision would ensure that the substantive reform overrides the conforming revision, regardless of which bill is chaptered first. Although the conforming revision would be nullified by the substantive reform, it could be reintroduced the following year and a stopgap provision in the proposed recodification (already approved by the Commission) would make the outdated cross-reference workable in the interim.19 19. See proposed 7920.105(b) in the Tentative Recommendation on California Public Records Act Clean-Up (May 2019), which states: \"A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the restatement and continuation.\" - 8 - The Commission has used this type of approach in the past and it is an efficient and effective means of dealing with potential bill conflicts when recodifying a large amount of statutory material. The Legislature routinely includes such a clause in the annual maintenance of the codes bill, to avoid having a minor stylistic reform nullify a substantive reform that entailed a lot of effort. For purposes of a tentative recommendation that presents the conforming revisions for the CPRA recodification, does the Commission want to include the subordination clause shown above, which is based on the assumption that the conforming revisions will be introduced in a separate bill? OTHER ISSUES Commissioners and other persons interested in this study should consider whether any other issues relating to the conforming revisions warrant discussion at the upcoming meeting. After addressing those issues (if any) and the issues described above, the Commission will need to decide whether to approve the draft of CPRA conforming revisions as a tentative recommendation (with or without modifications), to be circulated for comment. Respectfully submitted, Barbara Gaal Chief Deputy Counsel #G-400 STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION STAFF DRAFT TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATION California Public Records Act Clean-Up: Conforming Revisions July 2019 The purpose of this tentative recommendation is to solicit public comment on the Commission's tentative conclusions. A comment submitted to the Commission will be part of the public record. The Commission will consider the comment at a public meeting when the Commission determines what, if any, recommendation it will make to the Legislature. It is just as important to advise the Commission that you approve the tentative recommendation as it is to advise the Commission that you believe revisions should be made to it. COMMENTS ON THIS TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION NOT LATER THAN xxxx. The Commission will often substantially revise a proposal in response to comment it receives. Thus, this tentative recommendation is not necessarily the recommendation the Commission will submit to the Legislature. California Law Revision Commission c/o UC Davis School of Law Davis, CA 95616 650-494-1335 <commission@clrc.ca.gov> SUMMARY OF TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATION At the request of the Legislature, the Law Revision Commission prepared a tentative recommendation that proposes to recodify the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") in a more user-friendly manner without changing its substantive effect. The Commission released that tentative recommendation in June and it is now circulating for public comment. To facilitate logical reorganization of the CPRA, the proposed recodification would relocate the CPRA in a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. That would entail renumbering the entire CPRA. Hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer to the CPRA, in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, those provisions will need to be revised to conform to the new numbering scheme. This tentative recommendation proposes the necessary conforming revisions. The Commission seeks comments on these revisions. Comments from knowledgeable persons (whether positive, negative, or more nuanced) are crucial in the Commission's study process. This tentative recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 5 - CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP: CONFORMING REVISIONS In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission to conduct a 1 strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 2 and related provisions.2 The goal is to make the CPRA easier for the public to use 3 and understand.3 4 As requested, the Commission prepared a proposed recodification of the CPRA. 5 A tentative recommendation presenting the proposed recodification is currently 6 being circulated for public comment.4 Comments on that tentative recommendation 7 are due by August 26, 2019, and the Commission plans to consider those 8 comments at a public meeting in Sacramento on September 26, 2019. 9 To facilitate sound reorganization of the CPRA, the proposed recodification 10 would relocate the CPRA to a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the 11 Government Code. Every existing code section would be renumbered,5 some of 12 those sections (particularly the long ones) would be split into two or more new 13 sections, and substantively similar provisions would be placed together in a logical 14 order. 15 Literally hundreds of provisions throughout the codes cross-refer to the CPRA, 16 in whole or in part. If the recodification is enacted, those provisions will need to 17 be revised to conform to the new numbering scheme. 18 This tentative recommendation proposes the necessary conforming revisions. In 19 general, they are quite straightforward. A few key points are explained below. 20 Nonsubstantive Reform 21 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature said that the 22 Commission's recommended legislation should \"[c]learly express legislative intent 23 without any change in the substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand nor 24 contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open 25 to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act.\"6 The 26 1.

Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 6 - Commission was very careful to adhere to that limitation in preparing its proposed 1 recodification of the CPRA.7 2 The Commission took similar care in preparing the conforming revisions 3 presented in this tentative recommendation. In particular, the proposed legislation 4 would only update the cross-references to the CPRA and make other minor 5 technical revisions, such as: 6 Correction of spelling8 and typographical errors.9 7 Correction of grammatical errors, especially improper usage of \"which\" 8 instead of \"that.\"10 9 Elimination of gendered pronouns.11 10 Insertion of subdivision or paragraph labels (where this would not create 11 any ambiguity or necessitate additional conforming revisions).12 12 Other revisions to conform to legislative drafting conventions.13 13 Correction of erroneous cross-references. Each such correction is explained 14 in the accompanying comment.14 15 A few miscellaneous technical revisions.15 16 7.

See, e.g., proposed amendment of Gov't Code \u00a7 12894.5 infra (deleting phrase \"of the Government Code,\" which is not necessary when cross-referring to provision in same code); proposed amendment of Pub.

Code \u00a7\u00a7 408.3, 409 & Comments infra; proposed Comments infra. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 7 - Consistent with the limited scope of its legislative mandate, the Commission did 1 not consider, and is not proposing, any other kinds of changes to the provisions 2 affected by this tentative recommendation.16 3 Due to their bulk, the conforming revisions in this tentative recommendation 4 might be introduced as a separate bill, instead of being included in the same bill as 5 the CPRA recodification itself. Regardless of whether they are in a separate bill, 6 the Commission will make sure that they are statutorily defined to be part of the 7 \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020.\"17 8 That is important, because the proposed recodification includes the following 9 provision: 10 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 11 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 12 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division 13 and every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-14 reference in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 15 nonsubstantive intent of the act.18 16 This provision underscores the nonsubstantive nature of the recodification as a 17 whole and the updated cross-references in particular. It will help to ensure that the 18 courts and others interpret the recodification accordingly. 19 Contingent Operation 20 On the assumption that the conforming revisions will be introduced as a separate 21 bill, this tentative recommendation includes an uncodified provision that would 22 make the conforming revisions operative only if the recodification bill is enacted 23 and becomes operative.19 The Commission will insert the appropriate bill number 24 in that uncodified provision after the recodification bill is introduced. 25 Subordination Clause 26 This tentative recommendation also includes a subordination clause, in case one 27 or more of the code provisions with a conforming revision is also amended in a 28 15. See proposed amendment of Food & Agric. \u00a7 14407 & Comment infra; proposed amendment of Gov't Code \u00a7 11126 & Comment infra; proposed amendment of Health & Safety Code \u00a7 131052 & Comment infra. 16. Accordingly, readers of this tentative recommendation should not infer that the Commission has evaluated and approved language that would not be changed by this tentative recommendation. 17. If the conforming revisions are introduced in a separate bill (as seems likely), it will be necessary to revise proposed Government Code Section 7920.005, which defines \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020.\" The Commission will address that point when it considers the comments on the CPRA Recodification TR. 18. CPRA Recodification TR, supra note 4, at 28 (emphasis added). 19. See proposed uncodified provision on contingent operation (at the end of the proposed legislation) infra. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 8 - substantive manner by another bill.20 The subordination clause would ensure that 1 the substantive reform overrides the conforming revision, regardless of which bill 2 is chaptered first. Although the conforming revision would be nullified by the 3 substantive reform, it could be reintroduced the following year and a stopgap 4 provision in the proposed recodification would make the outdated cross-reference 5 workable in the interim.21 6 Request for Public Comment 7 The Commission seeks public comment on its tentative recommendation. It is 8 just as important to submit comments in support of the tentative recommendation 9 as it is to submit comments that raise concerns. Comments from knowledgeable 10 persons (whether positive, negative, or more nuanced) are invaluable in the 11 Commission's study process. 12 A few of the conforming revisions are accompanied by a boxed \"Note,\" which 13 provides background information or draws attention to an issue. The Commission 14 would especially appreciate comments on the issues raised in the Notes. 15 The Commission often substantially revises its recommendations as a result of 16 public comment. Comments can be in any format. To receive timely consideration, 17 comments should be submitted to bgaal@clrc.ca.gov by [insert date]. 18 ____________________ 20.

Comment. Section 12811.3 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L.

Legislative findings and declarations relating to Western Climate Initiative, Inc. SEC. ___. Section 12894.5 of the Government Code is amended to read: 12894.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares both of the following: (1) California's participation in the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, requires that its sole purpose be to provide operational and technical support to California in its implementation of Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code and to provide support to the greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs of other jurisdictions. Given its limited scope of activities, the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, does not have the authority to create policy with respect to any existing or future program or regulation undertaken pursuant to Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code. (2) The state recognizes the ongoing efforts of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, have resulted in policies that are consistent with the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) and the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code) as well as bylaws that meet the requirements of this section. (b) The California membership of the Board of Directors of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, as established pursuant to Section 12894, shall participate on the board so long as the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, maintains policies and bylaws according to all of the following: (1) An open meetings policy that is and remains consistent with the general policies of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1) and affords the public the greatest possible Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 209 - access consistent with the other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated. (2) A records availability policy that is and remains consistent with the general policies of the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1) and affords the public access to corporate records consistent with the operating needs and other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, and all applicable legal privileges. (3) Bylaws that limit the activities of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, to the technical and operational support of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs of California and other jurisdictions. These bylaws shall not allow the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, to have policymaking authority with respect to these programs. (c) The State Air Resources Board shall provide notice to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee for all procurements over one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) proposed by the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, that are expected to result in a contract no later than 30 days prior to the execution of those contracts. (d) Commencing January 1, 2014, the State Air Resources Board shall include information on all proposed expenditures and allocations of moneys to the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, in the Governor's Budget. Comment. Section 12894.5 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). The section is also amended to make technical changes. \u00a7 15570.42 (amended). Regulations establishing procedures and guidelines to access public records of Department of Tax and Fee Administration SEC. ___. Section 15570.42 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15570.42. Pursuant to Section 6253 Article 1 (commencing with Section 7922.630) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1, the department shall adopt regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to access public records. These regulations shall facilitate maximum public accessibility to the department's public records. These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types of public records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs administered by the department. Comment. Section 15570.42 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15570.42 was enacted in 2017, it was apparently modeled on Section 15652. It closely tracked the language of that section, including the cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" Compare 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 5 with 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 2. However, Section 15652's cross-reference to \"Section 6253\" was obsolete because former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 in 1998 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 4; see also Section 15652 Comment). Pursuant to the CPRA Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 210 - Recodification Act of 2020, Section 6253.4 has in turn been repealed and recodified as Article 1 of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1 (Sections 7922.530-7922.640). That article is now the proper cross-reference to include in Sections 15652 and 15570.42; it contains the CPRA material on adoption of regulations. \u00a7 15650 (amended). \"Public record\" SEC. ___. Section 15650 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15650. For purposes of this chapter, \"public record\" means any public record as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 6252 Section 7920.530. Comment. Section 15650 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to subdivision (d) of former Section 6252, which became obsolete when subdivision (d) was relabeled as subdivision (e). Compare 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 1049, \u00a7 2 (original version of Section 15650, which cross-refers to \"any public record as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 6252\") with 1994 Cal. Stat. ch. 1010, \u00a7 136 (version of former Section 6252 in place when Section 15650 was enacted); see also 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 2 (relabeling definition of \"public records\" as subdivision (e)); 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 537, \u00a7 20 (version of former Section 6252 repealed by CPRA Recodification Act of 2020); Section definition of \"public records\"). \u00a7 15652 (amended). Regulations establishing procedures and guidelines to access public records of State Board of Equalization SEC. ___. Section 15652 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15652. Pursuant to Section 6253 Article 1 (commencing with Section 7922.630) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1, the State Board of Equalization shall adopt regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to access public records. These regulations shall facilitate maximum public accessibility to the board's public records. These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types of public records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs maintained by the board. Comment. Section 15652 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15652 was added to the codes by 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 1049, \u00a7 2, the CPRA material on adoption of regulations was located in former Section 6253 (see Gov. Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1991, \u00a7 70). Shortly afterwards, former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 4, which became operative on Jan. 1, 1999). Pursuant to the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, Section 6253.4 has in turn been repealed and recodified as Article 1 of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1 (Sections 7922.530-7922.640). That article is now the proper cross-reference; it contains the CPRA material on adoption of regulations. \u00a7 15705 (amended). Truncation of social security numbers on lien abstracts and other disclosable records of Franchise Tax Board SEC. ___. Section 15705 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15705.

For purposes of this section, \"truncate\" means to redact the first five digits of a social security number. Comment. Section 15705 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (amended). \"Public agency\" SEC. ___.

(B) Crime rates, as documented by records maintained by the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction in the proposed plan area for violent or property crime offenses, that are at least 5 percent higher than the statewide average crime rate for violent or property crime offenses, as defined by the most recent annual report of the Criminal Justice Statistics Center within the Department of Justice, when data Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 238 - is available on the Attorney General's Internet Web site. The crime rate shall be calculated by taking the local crime incidents for violent or property crimes, or any offense within those categories, for the most recent calendar year for which the Department of Justice maintains data, divided by the total population of the proposed plan area, multiplied by 100,000. If the local crime rate for the proposed plan area exceeds the statewide average rate for either violent or property crime, or any offense within these categories, by more than 5 percent, then the condition described in this subparagraph shall be met. (C) Deteriorated or inadequate infrastructure, including streets, sidewalks, water supply, sewer treatment or processing, and parks. (D) Deteriorated commercial or residential structures. (e) As an alternative to subdivision (d), an authority may also carry out a community revitalization plan within a community revitalization and investment area if it meets either of the following conditions: (1) The area is established within a former military base that is principally characterized by deteriorated or inadequate infrastructure and structures. Notwithstanding subdivision (c), the governing board of an authority established within a former military base shall include a member of the military base closure commission as a public member. (2) The census tracts or census block groups, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, within the area are situated within a disadvantaged community as described in Section 39711 of the Health and Safety Code.

Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5), the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1), and the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Title 9 (commencing with Section 81000)). (g)(1) At any time after the authority is authorized to transact business and exercise its powers, the legislative body or bodies of the local government or governments that created the authority may appropriate the amounts the legislative body or bodies deem necessary for the administrative expenses and overhead of the authority. (2) The money appropriated may be paid to the authority as a grant to defray the expenses and overhead, or as a loan to be repaid upon the terms and conditions as the legislative body may provide. If appropriated as a loan, the property owners and residents within the plan area shall be made third-party beneficiaries of the repayment of the loan. In addition to the common understanding and usual interpretation of the term, \"administrative expense\" includes, but is not limited to, expenses of planning and dissemination of information.

Legislative findings and declarations relating to financial and legal records of California Indian tribes and tribal business enterprises SEC. ___. Section 63048.63 of the Government Code is amended to read: 63048.63. (a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares: (1) The financial and legal records of California Indian tribes and tribal business enterprises are records of a sovereign nation and are not subject to disclosure by private citizens or the state. This is explicitly recognized in amendments to tribal-state gaming compacts ratified by the Legislature, which provide for the securitization of annual payments to be received from the tribes by the state or by an agency, trust, fund, or entity specified by the state. (2) In order to review the records of any Indian tribe relative to this securitization, the compacts require the execution of nondisclosure agreements. (3) State entities statutorily charged with participating in the bond sale cannot perform those duties in the absence of that agreement, and the Legislature hereby acknowledges and agrees that documents containing tribal information are not public records, shall not be discussed in an open meeting, and that state officials privy to that information may execute nondisclosure agreements. (b) Nothing in Chapter 3.5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 6250) Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 or any other provision of law shall permit the disclosure of any records of an Indian tribe received by the state, or by an agency, trust fund, or entity specified by the state, in connection with the sale of any portions of the designated tribal-state gaming compact assets or the issuance of bonds, or any summaries or analyses thereof. The transmission of the records, or the information contained in those records in an alternative form, to the state or the special purpose trust shall not constitute a waiver of exemption from disclosure, and the records and information once transmitted to the state or special purpose trust shall be subject to this same exemption from disclosure. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 240 - (c) The state and the special purpose trust are authorized to enter into nondisclosure agreements with Indian tribes agreeing not to disclose the materials described in subdivision (b). (d) The nondisclosure agreements may include provisions limiting the representatives of the state and the special purpose trust authorized to review or receive records of the Indian tribe to those individuals directly working on the sale of portions of the designated compact assets or the issuance of the bonds. (e) Nothing in Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code shall be construed to prevent the bank from conducting a closed session to consider any records or information of an Indian tribe or any summaries or analyses thereof received by the state in connection with the sale of any portion of the compact assets or the issuance of bonds.

Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). \u00a7 65913.4 (amended). Streamlined, ministerial approval process for development application SEC. ___. Section 65913.4 of the Government Code is amended to read: 65913.4. (a) A development proponent may submit an application for a development that is subject to the streamlined, ministerial approval process provided by subdivision (b) and is not subject to a conditional use permit if the development satisfies all of the following objective planning standards: (1) The development is a multifamily housing development that contains two or more residential units. (2) The development is located on a site that satisfies all of the following: (A) A site that is a legal parcel or parcels located in a city if, and only if, the city boundaries include some portion of either an urbanized area or urban cluster, as designated by the United States Census Bureau, or, for unincorporated areas, a legal parcel or parcels wholly within the boundaries of an urbanized area or urban cluster, as designated by the United States Census Bureau. (B) A site in which at least 75 percent of the perimeter of the site adjoins parcels that are developed with urban uses. For the purposes of this section, parcels that are only separated by a street or highway shall be considered to be adjoined. (C) A site that is zoned for residential use or residential mixed-use development, or has a general plan designation that allows residential use or a mix of residential and nonresidential uses, with at least two-thirds of the square footage of the development designated for residential use. (3)(A) The development proponent has committed to record, prior to the issuance of the first building permit, a land use restriction or covenant providing that any lower income housing units required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) shall remain available at affordable housing costs or rent to persons and families of lower income for no less than the following periods of time: Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 241 - (i) Fifty-five years for units that are rented. (ii) Forty-five years for units that are owned. (B) The city or county shall require the recording of covenants or restrictions implementing this paragraph for each parcel or unit of real property included in the development. (4) The development satisfies both of the following: (A) Is located in a locality that the department has determined is subject to this subparagraph on the basis that the number of units that have been issued building permits is less than the locality's share of the regional housing needs, by income category, for that reporting period. A locality shall remain eligible under this subparagraph until the department's determination for the next reporting period. (B) The development is subject to a requirement mandating a minimum percentage of below market rate housing based on one of the following: (i) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by the time period required by Section 65400, or that production report reflects that there were fewer units of above moderate-income housing issued building permits than were required for the regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting period. In addition, if the project contains more than 10 units of housing, the project seeking approval dedicates a minimum of 10 percent of the total number of units to housing affordable to households making below 80 percent of the area median income. If the locality has adopted a local ordinance that requires that greater than 10 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to households making below 80 percent of the area median income, that local ordinance applies. (ii) The locality's latest production report reflects that there were fewer units of housing issued building permits affordable to either very low income or low-income households by income category than were required for the regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting period, and the project seeking approval dedicates 50 percent of the total number of units to housing affordable to households making below 80 percent of the area median income, unless the locality has adopted a local ordinance that requires that greater than 50 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to households making below 80 percent of the area median income, in which case that local ordinance applies. (iii) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by the time period required by Section 65400, or if the production report reflects that there were fewer units of housing affordable to both income levels described in clauses (i) and (ii) that were issued building permits than were required for the regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting period, the project seeking approval may choose between utilizing clause (i) or (ii). (5) The development, excluding any additional density or any other concessions, incentives, or waivers of development standards granted pursuant to the Density Bonus Law in Section 65915, is consistent with objective zoning standards, objective subdivision standards, and objective design review standards in effect at the time that the development is submitted to the local government pursuant to this Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 242 - section. For purposes of this paragraph, \"objective zoning standards,\" \"objective subdivision standards,\" and \"objective design review standards\" mean standards that involve no personal or subjective judgment by a public official and are uniformly verifiable by reference to an external and uniform benchmark or criterion available and knowable by both the development applicant or proponent and the public official before submittal. These standards may be embodied in alternative objective land use specifications adopted by a city or county, and may include, but are not limited to, housing overlay zones, specific plans, inclusionary zoning ordinances, and density bonus ordinances, subject to the following: (A) A development shall be deemed consistent with the objective zoning standards related to housing density, as applicable, if the density proposed is compliant with the maximum density allowed within that land use designation, notwithstanding any specified maximum unit allocation that may result in fewer units of housing being permitted. (B) In the event that objective zoning, general plan, subdivision, or design review standards are mutually inconsistent, a development shall be deemed consistent with the objective zoning and subdivision standards pursuant to this subdivision if the development is consistent with the standards set forth in the general plan. (C) The amendments to this subdivision made by the act adding this subparagraph do not constitute a change in, but are declaratory of, existing law. (6) The development is not located on a site that is any of the following: (A) A coastal zone, as defined in Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code.

(G) Within a special flood hazard area subject to inundation by the 1 percent annual chance flood (100-year flood) as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in any official maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. If a development proponent is able to satisfy all applicable federal qualifying criteria in order to provide that the site satisfies this subparagraph and is otherwise eligible for streamlined approval under this section, a local government shall not deny the application on the basis that the development proponent did not comply with any additional permit requirement, standard, or action adopted by that local government that is applicable to that site. A development may be located on a site described in this subparagraph if either of the following are met: (i) The site has been subject to a Letter of Map Revision prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and issued to the local jurisdiction. (ii) The site meets Federal Emergency Management Agency requirements necessary to meet minimum flood plain management criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program pursuant to Part 59 (commencing with Section 59.1) and Part 60 (commencing with Section 60.1) of Subchapter B of Chapter I of Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. (H) Within a regulatory floodway as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in any official maps published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless the development has received a no-rise certification in accordance with Section 60.3(d)(3) of Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(C) The development would require the demolition of a historic structure that was placed on a national, state, or local historic register. (D) The property contains housing units that are occupied by tenants, and units at the property are, or were, subsequently offered for sale to the general public by the subdivider or subsequent owner of the property. (8) The development proponent has done both of the following, as applicable: (A) Certified to the locality that either of the following is true, as applicable: (i) The entirety of the development is a public work for purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code. (ii) If the development is not in its entirety a public work, that all construction workers employed in the execution of the development will be paid at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for the type of work and geographic area, as determined by the Director of Industrial Relations pursuant to Sections 1773 and 1773.9 of the Labor Code, except that apprentices registered in programs approved by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may be paid at least the applicable apprentice prevailing rate. If the development is subject to this subparagraph, then for those portions of the development that are not a public work all of the following shall apply: (I) The development proponent shall ensure that the prevailing wage requirement is included in all contracts for the performance of the work. (II) All contractors and subcontractors shall pay to all construction workers employed in the execution of the work at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages, except that apprentices registered in programs approved by the Chief Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 245 - of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may be paid at least the applicable apprentice prevailing rate.

Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 5; Gov. Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1991, \u00a7 7.

Transfer of governance of Alameda Health System SEC. ___. Section 101850 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 101850. The Legislature finds and declares the following: (a)(1) Due to the challenges facing the Alameda Health System arising from changes in the public and private health industries, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors has determined that a transfer of governance of the Alameda Health System to an independent governing body, a hospital authority, is needed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the community health services provided at the medical center. The board of supervisors has further determined that the creation of an independent hospital authority strictly and exclusively dedicated to the management, administration, and control of the medical center, in a manner consistent with the county's obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is the best way to fulfill its commitment to the medically indigent, special needs, and general populations of Alameda County. To accomplish this, it is necessary that the board of supervisors be given authority to create a hospital authority. Because there is no general law under which this authority could be formed, the adoption of a special act and the formation of a special authority is required. (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this section: (A) \"The county\" means the County of Alameda. (B) \"Governing board\" means the governing body of the hospital authority. (C) \"Hospital authority\" means the separate public agency established by the Board of Supervisors of Alameda County to manage, administer, and control the Alameda Health System. (D) \"Medical center\" means the Alameda Health System, which was formerly known as the Alameda County Medical Center. (b) The board of supervisors of the county may, by ordinance, establish a hospital authority separate and apart from the county for the purpose of effecting a transfer of the management, administration, and control of the medical center in accordance with Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A hospital authority established pursuant to this chapter shall be strictly and exclusively dedicated to the management, administration, and control of the medical center within parameters set forth in this chapter, and in the ordinance, bylaws, and contracts adopted by the board of supervisors that shall not be in conflict with this chapter, Section 1442.5 of this code, or Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.

The enabling ordinance shall specify the membership of the hospital authority governing board, the qualifications for individual members, the manner of appointment, selection, or removal of governing board members, their terms of office, and all other matters that the board of supervisors deems necessary or convenient for the conduct of the hospital authority's activities. (d) The mission of the hospital authority shall be the management, administration, and other control, as determined by the board of supervisors, of the group of public hospitals, clinics, and programs that comprise the medical center, in a manner that ensures appropriate, quality, and cost-effective medical care as required of counties by Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and, to the extent feasible, other populations, including special populations in the County of Alameda. (e) The board of supervisors shall adopt bylaws for the medical center that set forth those matters related to the operation of the medical center by the hospital authority that the board of supervisors deems necessary and appropriate. The bylaws shall become operative upon approval by a majority vote of the board of supervisors. Changes or amendments to the bylaws shall be by majority vote of the board of supervisors. (f) The hospital authority created and appointed pursuant to this section is a duly constituted governing body within the meaning of Section 1250 of this code and Section 70035 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations as currently written or subsequently amended. (g) Unless otherwise provided by the board of supervisors by way of resolution, the hospital authority may, or the board of supervisors may on behalf of the hospital authority, apply as a public agency for one or more licenses for the provision of health care pursuant to statutes and regulations governing licensing as currently written or subsequently amended. (h) In the event of a change of license ownership, the governing body of the hospital authority shall comply with the obligations of governing bodies of general acute care hospitals generally, as set forth in Section 70701 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, as currently written or subsequently amended, as well as the terms and conditions of the license. The hospital authority is the responsible party with respect to compliance with these obligations, terms, and conditions. (i)(1) A transfer by the county to the hospital authority of the administration, management, and control of the medical center, whether or not the transfer includes the surrendering by the county of the existing general acute care hospital license and corresponding application for a change of ownership of the license, does not affect Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 334 - the eligibility of the county, or in the case of a change of license ownership, the hospital authority, to do any of the following: (A) Participate in, and receive allocations pursuant to, the California Healthcare for the Indigents Program (CHIP).

(o) The board of supervisors shall retain control over the use of the medical center physical plant and facilities except as otherwise specifically provided for in lawful agreements entered into by the board of supervisors.

All revenues received through the intellectual property agreements established pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited into the General Fund. (2) These standards shall include, at a minimum, a requirement that CIRM grantees, other than loan recipients and facilities grant recipients, share a fraction of the revenue they receive from licensing or self-commercializing an invention or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM, as set forth below. All revenues received pursuant to this paragraph or regulations adopted to implement this paragraph shall be deposited in the General Fund for use consistent with Section 202(c)(7) of Title 35 of the United States Code, if applicable. (A)(i) A grantee that licenses an invention or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM shall pay 25 percent of the revenues it receives in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), in the aggregate, to the General Fund. The threshold amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be adjusted annually by a multiple of a fraction, the denominator of which is the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, All Items (San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose; 1982-84=100) as prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor and published for the month of October 2009, and the numerator of which is that index published for the month in which the grantee accepts the grant. (ii) If funding sources other than CIRM directly contributed to the development of the invention or technology, then the return to the General Fund shall be calculated as follows: The amount of CIRM funding for the invention or technology shall be divided by the total of funding provided by all sources, and that fraction shall be multiplied by 25. That numeral is the percentage due to the General Fund. (B)(i) A grantee that self-commercializes a product that results from an invention or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM shall pay an amount to the General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the CIRM grant or grants received by the grantee in support of the research that contributed to the creation of Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 371 - the product. The rate of payback of the royalty shall be at a rate of 3 percent of the annual net revenue received by the grantee from the product. (ii) In addition to the payment required by clause (i), the first time that net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make a one-time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the grant or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the research that contributed to the creation of the product. (iii) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i) and (ii), the first time that net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make an additional one-time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the grant or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the research that contributed to the creation of the product. (iv) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the first time that net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product equal or exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall pay the General Fund 1 percent annually of net commercial revenue in excess of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) for the life of any patent covering the invention or technology, if the grantee patented its invention or technology and received a CIRM grant or grants amounting to more than five million dollars ($5,000,000) in support of the research that contributed to the creation of the product. (3) The ICOC shall have the authority to adopt regulations to implement this subdivision. The ICOC shall also have the authority to modify the formulas specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) through regulations if the ICOC determines pursuant to paragraph (1) that a modification is required either in order to ensure that essential medical research, including, but not limited to, therapy development and the broad delivery of therapies to patients, is not unreasonably hindered, or to ensure that the State of California has an opportunity to benefit from the patents, royalties, and licenses that result from basic research, therapy development, and clinical trials. The ICOC shall notify the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature 10 calendar days before exercising its authority to vote on the modification of the formulas specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2).

Section 130060 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 130060. (a)(1) After January 1, 2008, a general acute care hospital building that is determined to be a potential risk of collapse or pose significant loss of life shall only be used for nonacute care hospital purposes, unless an extension of this deadline has been granted and either of the following occurs before the end of the extension: (A) A replacement building has been constructed and a certificate of occupancy has been granted by the office for the replacement building. (B) A retrofit has been performed on the building and a construction final has been obtained by the office. (2) An extension of the deadline may be granted by the office upon a demonstration by the owner that compliance will result in a loss of health care capacity that may not be provided by other general acute care hospitals within a reasonable proximity. In its request for an extension of the deadline, a hospital shall state why the hospital is unable to comply with the January 1, 2008, deadline requirement. (3) Prior to granting an extension of the January 1, 2008, deadline pursuant to this section, the office shall do all of the following: (A) Provide public notice of a hospital's request for an extension of the deadline.

(C) Allow the public to submit written comments on the extension proposal for a period of not less than 45 days from the date of the public notice. (b)(1) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this subdivision, to facilitate the process of having more hospital buildings in substantial compliance with this chapter and to take nonconforming general acute care hospital inpatient buildings out of service more quickly. (2) The functional contiguous grouping of hospital buildings of a general acute care hospital, each of which provides, as the primary source, one or more of the hospital's eight basic services as specified in subdivision (a) of Section 1250, may receive a five-year extension of the January 1, 2008, deadline specified in subdivision (a) of this section pursuant to this subdivision for both structural and nonstructural requirements. A functional contiguous grouping refers to buildings containing one or more basic hospital services that are either attached or connected in a way that is acceptable to the State Department of Health Care Services. These buildings may be either on the existing site or a new site. (3) To receive the five-year extension, a single building containing all of the basic services or at least one building within the contiguous grouping of hospital buildings shall have obtained a building permit prior to 1973 and this building shall be evaluated and classified as a nonconforming, Structural Performance Category-1 (SPC-1) building.

The basic services in the building shall be relocated into an SPC-5 and NPC-4 or NPC-5 building by January 1, 2013. (5) SPC-1 buildings, other than the building identified in paragraph (3) or (4), in the contiguous grouping of hospital buildings shall also be exempt from the requirement in subdivision (a) until January 1, 2013. However, on or before January 1, 2013, at a minimum, each of these buildings shall be retrofitted to an SPC-2 and NPC-3 building, or no longer be used for general acute care hospital inpatient services. (c) On or before March 1, 2001, the office shall establish a schedule of interim work progress deadlines that hospitals shall be required to meet to be eligible for the extension specified in subdivision (b).

(a) Credit shall be allowed a domestic insurer when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the commissioner as a reinsurer in this state and secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this section. Credit shall be allowed at all times for which statutory financial statement credit for reinsurance is claimed under this section. The credit allowed shall be based upon the security held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer in accordance with a rating assigned to the certified reinsurer by the commissioner.

(5) The assuming insurer shall agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the commissioner, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 396 - (6) The certified reinsurer shall comply with any other requirements deemed relevant by the commissioner. (c)(1) If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner may defer to that jurisdiction's certification, and has the discretion to defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction if the assuming insurer submits a properly executed Form CR-1 (as published on the department's Internet Web site), and such additional information as the commissioner requires. The commissioner, however, may perform an independent review and determination of any applicant. The assuming insurer shall then be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state. (2) If the commissioner defers to a certification determination by another state, any change in the certified reinsurer's status or rating in the other jurisdiction shall apply automatically in this state as of the date it takes effect in the other jurisdiction unless the commissioner otherwise determines.

(2) The incorporated members of the association shall not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members. (3) Within 90 days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the commissioner an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if a certification is unavailable, Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 397 - financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association. (e)(1) The commissioner shall post notice on the department's Internet Web site promptly upon receipt of any application for certification, including instructions on how members of the public may respond to the application. The commissioner shall not take final action on the application until at least 30 days after posting the notice required by this subdivision. (2) The commissioner shall issue written notice to an assuming insurer that has made application and has been approved as a certified reinsurer. Included in that notice shall be the rating assigned the certified reinsurer in accordance with subdivision (h). The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.

Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 398 - (7) Any other information that the commissioner may reasonably require. (g) If the commissioner certifies a non-United States domiciled insurer, the commissioner shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions, under which an assuming insurer licensed and domiciled in that jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the commissioner as a certified reinsurer. (1) In order to determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, benefits, and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. The commissioner shall determine the appropriate process for evaluating the qualifications of those jurisdictions. Prior to its listing, a qualified jurisdiction shall agree in writing to share information and cooperate with the commissioner with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction. A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the commissioner has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards.

Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 399 - (3) If the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on either the NAIC list of qualified jurisdictions, or the United States Treasury list, the commissioner shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under this section. (4) United States jurisdictions that meet the requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions. (5) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the commissioner has the discretion to suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation. (h) The commissioner shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the commissioner pursuant to this section. The commissioner shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings. (1) Each certified reinsurer shall be rated on a legal entity basis, with due consideration being given to the group rating where appropriate, except that an association including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters that has been approved to do business as a single certified reinsurer may be evaluated on the basis of its group rating. Factors that may be considered as part of the evaluation process include, but are not limited to, the following: (A) The certified reinsurer's financial strength rating from an acceptable rating agency. The maximum rating that a certified reinsurer may be assigned shall correspond to its financial strength rating as set forth in clauses (i) to (vi), inclusive. The commissioner shall use the lowest financial strength rating received from an approved rating agency in establishing the maximum rating of a certified reinsurer. A failure to obtain or maintain at least two financial strength ratings from acceptable rating agencies shall result in loss of eligibility for certification.

(I) The liquidation priority of obligations to a ceding insurer in the certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction in the context of an insolvency proceeding.

Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 401 - (2) Based on the analysis conducted under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of a certified reinsurer's reputation for prompt payment of claims, the commissioner may make appropriate adjustments in the security the certified reinsurer is required to post to protect its liabilities to United States ceding insurers, provided that the commissioner shall, at a minimum, increase the security the certified reinsurer is required to post by one rating level under regulations promulgated by the commissioner, if the commissioner finds either of the following: (A) More than 15 percent of the certified reinsurer's ceding insurance clients have overdue reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of 90 days or more that are not in dispute and that exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for each ceding insurer. (B) The aggregate amount of reinsurance recoverables on paid losses that are not in dispute and that are overdue by 90 days or more exceeds fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). (3) The assuming insurer shall submit a properly executed Form CR-1 (as published on the department's Internet Web site) as evidence of its submission to the jurisdiction of this state, appointment of the commissioner as an agent for service of process in this state, and agreement to provide security for 100 percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment. The commissioner shall not certify any assuming insurer that is domiciled in a jurisdiction that the commissioner has determined does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments or arbitration awards. (4)(A) In the case of a downgrade by a rating agency or other disqualifying circumstance, the commissioner shall, upon written notice, assign a new rating to the certified reinsurer in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. (B) The commissioner shall have the authority to suspend, revoke, or otherwise modify a certified reinsurer's certification at any time if the certified reinsurer fails to meet its obligations or security requirements under this section, or if other financial or operating results of the certified reinsurer, or documented significant delays in payment by the certified reinsurer, lead the commissioner to reconsider the certified reinsurer's ability or willingness to meet its contractual obligations. (C) If the rating of a certified reinsurer is upgraded by the commissioner, the certified reinsurer may meet the security requirements applicable to its new rating on a prospective basis, but the commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to post security under the previously applicable security requirements as to all contracts in force on or before the effective date of the upgraded rating. If the rating of a certified reinsurer is downgraded by the commissioner, the commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to meet the security requirements applicable to its new rating for all business it has assumed as a certified reinsurer. (D) Upon revocation of the certification of a certified reinsurer by the commissioner, the assuming insurer shall be required to post security in accordance with Section 922.5 in order for the ceding insurer to continue to take credit for Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 402 - reinsurance ceded to the assuming insurer. If funds continue to be held in trust in accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, the commissioner may allow additional credit equal to the ceding insurer's pro rata share of those funds, discounted to reflect the risk of uncollectibility and anticipated expenses of trust administration. Notwithstanding the change of a certified reinsurer's rating or revocation of its certification, a domestic insurer that has ceded reinsurance to that certified reinsurer shall not be denied credit for reinsurance for a period of three months for all reinsurance ceded to that certified reinsurer, unless the reinsurance is found by the commissioner to be at high risk of uncollectibility. (i) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this subdivision at a level consistent with its rating. The amount of security required in order for full credit to be allowed shall correspond with the following requirements: Ratings security required Secure - 1: 0 percent Secure - 2: 10 percent Secure - 3: 20 percent Secure - 4: 50 percent Secure - 5: 75 percent Vulnerable - 6: 100 percent (1) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with Section 922.5, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. In order for a domestic insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit, reinsurance contracts entered into or renewed under this section shall include a proper funding clause that requires the certified reinsurer to provide and maintain security in an amount sufficient to avoid the imposition of any financial statement penalty on the ceding insurer under this section for reinsurance ceded to the certified reinsurer. (2) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this subdivision or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4. It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each of those trust accounts, to fund, upon termination of any of those trust accounts, out of the remaining surplus of those trusts any deficiency of any other of those trust accounts. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 403 - (3) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subdivision (d) of Section 922.4 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subdivision, except that the trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten million dollars ($10,000,000). (4) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subdivision, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and have the discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due. (5) For purposes of this subdivision, a certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100 percent of its obligations. (A) As used in this subdivision, the term \"terminated\" means revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status. (B) If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other provisions of this section, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended. (6) The commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to post 100-percent security in accordance with Section 922.5, for the benefit of the ceding insurer or its estate, upon the entry of an order of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation against the ceding insurer. (7) Affiliated reinsurance transactions shall receive the same opportunity for reduced security requirements as all other reinsurance transactions. (8) In order to facilitate the prompt payment of claims, a certified reinsurer shall not be required to post security for catastrophe recoverables for a period of one year from the date of the first instance of a liability reserve entry by the ceding company as a result of a loss from a catastrophic occurrence that is likely to result in significant insured losses, as recognized by the commissioner. The one-year deferral period is contingent upon the certified reinsurer continuing to pay claims in a timely manner, as determined by the commissioner, in writing. Reinsurance recoverables for only the following lines of business as reported on the NAIC annual financial statement related specifically to the catastrophic occurrence shall be included in the deferral: (A) Line 1: Fire. (B) Line 2: Allied lines. (C) Line 3: Farmowners' multiple peril. (D) Line 4: Homeowners' multiple peril. (E) Line 5: Commercial multiple peril. (F) Line 9: Inland marine. (G) Line 12: Earthquake. (H) Line 21: Auto physical damage. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 404 - (9) Credit for reinsurance under this section shall apply only to reinsurance contracts entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of the certification of the assuming insurer. Any reinsurance contract entered into prior to the effective date of the certification of the assuming insurer that is subsequently amended by mutual agreement of the parties to the reinsurance contract after the effective date of the certification of the assuming insurer, or a new reinsurance contract, covering any risk for which collateral was provided previously, shall only be subject to this section with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported from and after the effective date of the amendment or new contract. (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties to a reinsurance agreement from agreeing to provisions establishing security requirements that exceed the minimum security requirements established for certified reinsurers under this section. (j) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. (k) Notwithstanding this section, credit for reinsurance or deduction from liability by a domestic ceding insurer for cessions to a certified reinsurer may be disallowed upon a finding by the commissioner that the application of the literal provisions of this section does not accomplish its intent, or either the financial condition of the reinsurer or the collateral or other security provided by the reinsurer does not, in substance, satisfy the credit for reinsurance requirements in Section 922.4. (l) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.

Section 13519.4 of the Penal Code is amended to read: 13519.4. (a) The commission shall develop and disseminate guidelines and training for all peace officers in California as described in subdivision (a) of Section 13510 and who adhere to the standards approved by the commission, on the racial and cultural differences among the residents of this state. The course or courses of instruction and the guidelines shall stress understanding and respect for racial, identity, and cultural differences, and development of effective, noncombative methods of carrying out law enforcement duties in a diverse racial, identity, and cultural environment. (b) The course of basic training for peace officers shall include adequate instruction on racial, identity, and cultural diversity in order to foster mutual respect and cooperation between law enforcement and members of all racial, identity, and cultural groups. In developing the training, the commission shall consult with appropriate groups and individuals having an interest and expertise in the field of racial, identity, and cultural awareness and diversity. (c) For the purposes of this section the following shall apply: (1) \"Disability,\" \"gender,\" \"nationality,\" \"religion,\" and \"sexual orientation\" Section 422.55. (2) \"Culturally diverse\" and \"cultural diversity\" include, but are not limited to, disability, gender, nationality, religion, and sexual orientation issues.

(d) The Legislature finds and declares as follows: (1) The working men and women in California law enforcement risk their lives every day. The people of California greatly appreciate the hard work and dedication of peace officers in protecting public safety. The good name of these officers should not be tarnished by the actions of those few who commit discriminatory practices. (2) Racial or identity profiling is a practice that presents a great danger to the fundamental principles of our Constitution and a democratic society. It is abhorrent and cannot be tolerated. (3) Racial or identity profiling alienates people from law enforcement, hinders community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to lose credibility and trust among the people whom law enforcement is sworn to protect and serve. (4) Pedestrians, users of public transportation, and vehicular occupants who have been stopped, searched, interrogated, and subjected to a property seizure by a peace officer for no reason other than the color of their skin, national origin, religion, gender identity or expression, housing status, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability are the victims of discriminatory practices. (5) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting the changes to this section made by the act that added this paragraph that additional training is required to address the pernicious practice of racial or identity profiling and that enactment of this section is in no way dispositive of the issue of how the state should deal with racial or identity profiling. (e) \"Racial or identity profiling,\" for purposes of this section, is the consideration of, or reliance on, to any degree, actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability in deciding which persons to subject to a stop or in deciding upon the scope or substance of law enforcement activities following a stop, except that an officer may consider or rely on characteristics listed in a specific suspect description. The activities include, but are not limited to, traffic or pedestrian stops, or actions during a stop, such as asking questions, frisks, consensual and nonconsensual searches of a person or any property, seizing any property, removing vehicle occupants during a traffic stop, issuing a citation, and making an arrest. (f) A peace officer shall not engage in racial or identity profiling. (g) Every peace officer in this state shall participate in expanded training as prescribed and certified by the Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training. (h) The curriculum shall be evidence-based and shall include and examine evidence-based patterns, practices, and protocols that make up racial or identity profiling, including implicit bias. This training shall prescribe evidence-based patterns, practices, and protocols that prevent racial or identity profiling. In developing the training, the commission shall consult with the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board established pursuant to subdivision (j). The course of Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 513 - instruction shall include, but not be limited to, significant consideration of each of the following subjects: (1) Identification of key indices and perspectives that make up racial, identity, and cultural differences among residents in a local community. (2) Negative impact of intentional and implicit biases, prejudices, and stereotyping on effective law enforcement, including examination of how historical perceptions of discriminatory enforcement practices have harmed police-community relations and contributed to injury, death, disparities in arrest detention and incarceration rights, and wrongful convictions. (3) The history and role of the civil and human rights movement and struggles and their impact on law enforcement. (4) Specific obligations of peace officers in preventing, reporting, and responding to discriminatory or biased practices by fellow peace officers. (5) Perspectives of diverse, local constituency groups and experts on particular racial, identity, and cultural and police-community relations issues in a local area.

Section 13519.4 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). By updating the references to the CPRA, the amendment also corrects an erroneous reference to \"public records within the meaning of subdivision (d) of Section 6252 of the Government Code\" (as opposed to \"subdivision (e) of Section 6252 of the Government Code,\" which defined \"public records\").

(C) If a contractor, bidder, or other entity submits to the public agency or awarding body a plan to achieve substantial compliance with this chapter, the public agency or awarding body shall immediately resume making payments to the contractor, bidder, or other entity, including all previously withheld payments unless, within a reasonable time, the public agency or awarding body rejects the plan as insufficient and explains the reasons for the rejection.

See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). The section is also amended to correct a grammatical mistake. Note. There appears to be a grammatical mistake in Public Resources Code Section 5096.513.

The Commission suspects that the phrase \"all of\" was inadvertently inserted in the wrong place when the section was enacted. Compare 2004 Cal. Stat. ch. 708, \u00a7 1 with AB 1701 (Laird), as amended in Senate, Aug. 23, 2004). The amendment shown above would relocate that phrase where it appears to belong.

(g) The department may provide beneficiaries continuing care for products deleted from the list of enteral nutrition products. The department shall assess the need for continuing care based on the criteria in subdivision (b) and the potential impact on beneficiary access to appropriate therapy. To be eligible for continuing care status under this subdivision, a beneficiary must be taking the enteral nutrition product when the product is deleted. Additionally, the department shall have received a claim for the enteral nutrition product with a date of service that is within 100 days prior to the date the product was deleted. A beneficiary shall remain eligible for continuing care status provided that a claim is submitted for the enteral nutrition product in question at least every 100 days and the date of service of the claim is within 100 days of the date of service of the last claim submitted for the same enteral nutrition product.

Section 14124.24 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). \u00a7 14129.2 (amended). Quality assurance fee for emergency medical transport SEC. ___. Section 14129.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 14129.2. (a)(1) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on July 1, 2018, and continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter for which this article is implemented, there shall be imposed a quality assurance fee for each emergency medical transport provided by each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee in accordance with this section. (2) The director shall ensure that the quality assurance fee per emergency medical transport imposed pursuant to this article is collected. (b)(1) On or before June 15, 2018, and continuing each June 15 thereafter for which this article is implemented, the director shall calculate the annual quality assurance fee rate applicable to the following state fiscal year based on the most recently collected data from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to Section 14129.1. The director may correct any identified material or significant errors in the data collected from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to Section 14129.1 for the purposes of calculating the annual quality assurance fee rate. The director's determination whether to exercise his or her the director's discretion to correct any data pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review, except that an emergency medical transport provider may bring a writ of mandate under Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure to rectify an abuse of discretion by the director in correcting that emergency medical transport provider's data when Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 688 - that correction results in a greater fee amount for that provider pursuant to this section. (A) For the state fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2018, the annual quality assurance fee rate shall be calculated by multiplying the projected total annual gross receipts for all emergency medical transport providers subject to the fee by 5.1 percent, which resulting product shall be divided by the projected total annual emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport providers subject to the fee for the state fiscal year. (B) For state fiscal years beginning July 1, 2019, and continuing each state fiscal year thereafter, the annual quality assurance fee rate shall be calculated by a ratio, the numerator of which shall be the sum of: (i) the product of the projected aggregate fee schedule amount and the effective state medical assistance percentage and (ii) the amount described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) for the state fiscal year, and the denominator of which shall be 90 percent of the projected total annual emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport providers subject to the fee for the state fiscal year.

(4) If, during a state fiscal year for which this article is operative, the actual or projected available fee amount exceeds or is less than the actual or projected aggregate fee schedule amount by more than 1 percent, the director shall adjust the annual quality assurance fee rate so that the available fee amount for the state fiscal year will approximately equal the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year. The available fee amount for a state fiscal year shall be considered to equal the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year if the difference between the available fee amount for the state fiscal year and the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year constitutes less than 1 percent of the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year. (c)(1) Each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall remit to the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for the 2018-19 state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or that should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the quarter beginning on April 1, 2018, based on a schedule established by the director. The schedule established by the director Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 689 - for the fee payment described in this paragraph shall require remittance of the fee payment according to the following guidelines: (A) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that rendered 35,000 or more Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit the fee payment described in this paragraph on or after July 1, 2018. (B) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit 50 percent or less of the fee payment described in this paragraph on or after August 1, 2018. (C) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit any remaining fee payment amount described in this paragraph on or after August 15, 2018. (2) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on October 1, 2018, and continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter, on or before the first day of each state fiscal quarter, each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall remit to the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for the applicable state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or that should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the immediately preceding quarter. (d)(1) Interest shall be assessed on quality assurance fees not paid on the date due at the greater of 10 percent per annum or the rate at which the department assesses interest on Medi-Cal program overpayments pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 14171. Interest shall begin to accrue the day after the date the payment was due and shall be deposited in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund established in subdivision (f). (2) In the event that any fee payment is more than 60 days overdue, the department may deduct the unpaid fee and interest owed from any Medi-Cal reimbursement payments owed to the emergency medical transport provider until the full amount of the fee, interest, and any penalties assessed under this article are recovered.

(b) To the extent that the department is unable to obtain sufficient actual plan data, it may substitute plan model, similar plan, or county-specific fee-for-service data. (c) The department shall develop rates that include administrative costs, and may apply different administrative costs with respect to separate aid code groups. (d) The department shall develop rates that shall include, but are not limited to, assumptions for underwriting, return on investment, risk, contingencies, changes in policy, and a detailed review of health plan financial statements to validate and reconcile costs for use in developing rates. (e) The department may develop rates that pay plans based on performance incentives, including quality indicators, access to care, and data submission. (f) The department may develop and adopt condition-specific payment rates for health conditions, including, but not limited to, childbirth delivery. (g)(1) Prior to finalizing Medi-Cal managed care capitation rates, the department shall provide health plans with information on how the rates were developed, including rate sheets for that specific health plan, and provide the plans with the opportunity to provide additional supplemental information.

(3) The department may develop statewide rates and apply geographic adjustments, using available data sources deemed appropriate by the department. Consistent with actuarial methods, the primary source of data used to develop rates for each PACE organization shall be its Medi-Cal cost and utilization data or other data sources as deemed necessary by the department.

(9) During the first three rate years in which the methodology developed pursuant to this subdivision is used by the department to set rates for entities contracted pursuant to Chapter 8.75 (commencing with Section 14591), the department shall pay the entity at a rate within the certified actuarially sound rate range developed with respect to that entity, to the extent consistent with federal requirements and subject to paragraph (11), as necessary to mitigate the impact to the entity during the transition to the methodology developed pursuant to this subdivision. (10) During the first two years in which a new PACE organization or existing PACE organization enters a previously unserved area, the department shall pay at a rate within the certified actuarially sound rate range developed with respect to that entity, to the extent consistent with federal requirements and subject to paragraph (11). (11) This subdivision shall be implemented only to the extent that any necessary federal approvals are obtained and federal financial participation is available.

(2) Before initiating any proceeding to challenge rates of payment, charges, or fees set by the governing board, to seek reimbursement or release of any funds from the County Medical Services Program, or to challenge any other action by the governing board, any prospective claimant shall first notify the governing board, in writing, of the nature and basis of the challenge and the amount claimed. The governing board shall consider the matter within 60 days after receiving the notice and shall promptly thereafter provide written notice of the governing board's decision. If the governing board contracts with the department for administration of the program in accordance with Section 16809, this paragraph shall have no application to provider audit appeals conducted pursuant to Article 1.5 Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 702 - (commencing with Section 51016) of Chapter 3 of Division 3 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations and shall apply to all claims not reviewed pursuant to Section 51003 or 51015 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations. (3) All regulations adopted by the governing board shall clearly specify by reference the statute, court decision, or other provision of law that the governing board is seeking to implement, interpret, or make specific by adopting, amending, or repealing the regulation. (4) No regulation adopted by the governing board is valid and effective unless the regulation meets the standards of necessity, authority, clarity, consistency, and nonduplication, as defined in paragraph (5). (5) The following definitions govern the interpretation of this subdivision: (A) \"Necessity\" means the record of the regulatory proceeding that demonstrates by substantial evidence the need for the regulation. For purposes of this standard, evidence includes, but is not limited to, facts, studies, and expert opinion. (B) \"Authority\" means the provision of law that permits or obligates the CMSP Governing Board to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation. (C) \"Clarity\" means that the regulation is written or displayed so that the meaning of the regulation can be easily understood by those persons directly affected by it. (D) \"Consistency\" means being in harmony with, and not in conflict with, or contradictory to, existing statutes, court decisions, or other provisions of law. (E) \"Nonduplication\" means that a regulation does not serve the same purpose as a state or federal statute or another regulation. This standard requires that the governing board identify any state or federal statute or regulation that is overlapped or duplicated by the proposed regulation and justify any overlap or duplication. This standard is not intended to prohibit the governing board from printing relevant portions of enabling legislation in regulations when the duplication is necessary to satisfy the clarity standard in subparagraph (C). This standard is intended to prevent the indiscriminate incorporation of statutory language in a regulation. (g) The requirements of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 54950) of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code) shall apply to the meetings of the governing board, including meetings held pursuant to subdivision (i), except the board may meet in closed session to consider and take action on matters pertaining to contracts and contract negotiations with providers of health care services. (h)(1) The governing board shall comply with the following procedures for public meetings held to eliminate or reduce the level of services, restrict eligibility for services, or adopt regulations: (A) Provide prior public notice of those meetings. (B) Provide that notice not less than 30 days prior to those meetings. (C) Publish that notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each participating CMSP county. (D) Include in the notice, at a minimum, the amount and type of each proposed change, the expected savings, and the number of persons affected. Staff Draft Tentative Recommendation July 18, 2019 - 703 - (E) Either hold those meetings in the county seats of at least four regionally distributed CMSP participating counties, or, alternatively, hold two meetings in Sacramento County. (2) For meetings held outside Sacramento County, the requirements for public meetings pursuant to this subdivision to eliminate or reduce the level of services, or to restrict the eligibility for services or hear testimony regarding regulations to implement any of these service charges, are satisfied if at least three voting members of the governing board hold the meetings as required and report the testimony from those meetings to the full governing board at its next regular meeting. No action shall be taken at any meeting held outside Sacramento County pursuant to this paragraph. (i) Records of the County Medical Services Program and of the governing board that relate to rates of payment or to the board's negotiations with providers of health care services or to the governing board's deliberative processes regarding either shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code). (j) The following definitions shall govern the construction of this part, unless the context requires otherwise: (1) \"CMSP\" or \"program\" means the County Medical Services Program, which is the program by which health care services are provided to eligible persons in those counties electing to participate in the CMSP pursuant to Section 16809. (2) \"CMSP county\" means a county that has elected to participate pursuant to Section 16809 in the CMSP. (3) \"Governing Board\" means the County Medical Services Program Governing Board established pursuant to this section. Comment. Section 16809.4 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). By updating the reference to the CPRA, the amendment also eliminates an erroneous reference to \"Chapter 5\" (as opposed to \"Chapter 3.5\"). The section is also amended to make technical changes. \u00a7 17852 (amended). Collection and disclosure of information SEC. ___.
