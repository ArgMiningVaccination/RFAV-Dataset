The goal is to begin to integrate the philosophy and practice of complementary and alternative medicine in an evidence-based way. Integrative Curriculum During the first two years of medical school, all students are exposed to the evidence supporting various complementary modalities and their therapeutic possibilities through specific courses and workshops. Elective courses are available in the Healer's Art, Spirituality in Medicine, and Nutrition. There is also the option for mentored independent projects. Personal Wellness Program First-year students take a personal wellness survey and can take classes in meditation, yoga, tai chi, nutrition, Reiki and shiatsu massage. Student Groups Ongoing student groups including Students for Integrative Medicine and Social Medicine Course develop programming for the student community, often with hands-on, interactive sessions. Annual Keynote Each year, an outside speaker is invited to present on a topic related to complementary medicine. The event is open to the whole community.
