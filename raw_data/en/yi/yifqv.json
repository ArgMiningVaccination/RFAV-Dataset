It is in our hands to make a difference.\" \u2014 Nelson Mandela Powerful ideas have propelled all the major advances that have helped Intermountain Healthcare succeed since its founding. Since 1975, clinical quality has always been a driver behind our ideas. In recent years, and to further our mission, we have made it a priority to look further upstream, working to protect people's health before they ever come into a doctor's office or hospital. Intermountain is a leader in healthcare delivery, disease prevention, affordability, and a myriad of other priorities shared by every health system in America. Intermountain has a history of powerful ideas that help improve people's lives, one life at a time. The power behind an idea is unlimited. Ideas help us improve so we can better help others. Ideas spark change. They propel us forward so we can make a difference and help people live the healthiest lives possible. Each improvement we've made over the last year started with an idea.

Our world and our way of life have been shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic that has gripped our communities. Together, we've had the privilege to offer those we serve a steady and comforting hand during this time of crisis. The safety and well-being of our patients and our caregivers remain our top priorities. This commitment to safety and quality began long ago and results showed a significant leap forward in 2019. Last year, our system's Vizient quality and safety ratings improved notably from 2018. At the same time, our caregivers suffered far fewer injuries than the year prior. Building on this strong foundation, and leveraging the power of ideas, we've accelerated our move to modern care delivery. Our strategy not only offered a better consumer experience, it also put us in a far stronger position to respond to a worldwide pandemic. Our investments in telehealth better prepared us for the need to deliver care from a distance\u2014when distance itself would become a primary means of keeping people healthy. Through our investments in the social determinants of health, we're learning that a healthy person begins with a healthier community. We continue to learn that we cannot do this alone. Public officials, community partners, and religious institutions are invaluable partners as we aspire to lift the health of our communities. Grounded in our fundamentals and committed to modern care delivery, we're pioneering new frontiers in medicine while finding new people to serve. We've expanded our work into genomics by launching HerediGene, which is the largest and most comprehensive DNA mapping effort from a single population to date in the United States. The initiative is helping us understand the human genome and is enhancing our ability to prevent and treat diseases such as breast cancer, colon cancer, and heart disease. At the same time, we acquired HealthCare Partners Nevada, so we can serve more people through our model of population health and value-based care. Our mission-driven approach remains consistent no matter how much the ground shifts beneath our feet. Our country and our organization have weathered wars, recessions, financial panics, and now a pandemic. We find our strength during these times where we always have\u2014 with one another. We remain firmly positioned to serve our communities throughout it all. Undeterred and unleashed, our vision remains crystal clear. We will always work hard to keep people healthy and will always be here to care for them when they're sick. We're grateful for all the caregivers who delivered a successful 2019 to help position us to serve our communities for what's ahead.

In 1991, Gwen was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, which is when the body's immune system turns against the liver cells. Five years later, she was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and told she would need a transplant within three years. As it turns out, she didn't need one until 2019. Through Intermountain's Living Donor Liver Transplant Program, Brandon was able to donate. Dr. Manuel Rodriquez-Davalos worked alongside specialists at Intermountain's Transformation Center to create a 3D-printed model of Brandon's liver. This model allowed surgeons to perform a precision liver surgery. Normally, the surgery takes the right lobe of a healthy liver from donor to recipient. With 3D imaging and the 3D model, they were able to obtain a left lobe graft for a safer, faster recovery. Both Gwen and Brandon are healthy and getting right back to their lives. Rural Hospital Treated Large Tour Bus Crash In September 2019, a tour bus carrying 30 Chinese tourists crashed near the small town of Panguitch, Utah. Intermountain's Garfield Memorial Hospital immediately prepared for its largest influx of seriously injured patients to date. With virtual help from Intermountain's Telehealth Critical Care command center in Murray, Utah, the in-person team was able to efficiently and effectively triage patients, provide care for some, and transport others to other Intermountain hospitals. \"There is no greater joy nor greater reward than to make a fundamental difference in someone's life.\" \u2014 Mary Rose McGeady Intermountain continually works to improve our three cornerstones: the safety of our patients and caregivers, the quality of our outcomes, and the patient experience. SAFETY: Intermountain's rate of serious safety events dropped from 1.16 per 10,000 adjusted patient days in 2018 to 1.07 in 2019. QUALITY: The rank of Intermountain's hospitals in a national study conducted by Vizient improved from the 66th percentile in 2018 to the 79th percentile in 2019.PATIENT EXPERIENCE: Overall patient satisfaction rankings of Intermountain's hospitals, as measured by the federal government's patient satisfaction scores, improved from the 64th percentile in 2018 to the 71st in 2019. Safer, better, HAPPIER \u2014 every day 11 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunitySafety, Quality, & Patient Experience503,489577,024 40,528Developed Best Practices for Vaping-Related Injuries With new e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injuries and deaths, researchers at Intermountain developed best-practice treatment guidelines. The guidelines help caregivers quickly identify and treat patients who develop this potentially fatal respiratory injury. New Process and Technology Finds Breast Tumors Faster With a streamlined process and new technology, patients with abnormal mammograms or breast lumps are able to get answers faster. The combination of offering a same-day biopsy with advanced technology means results that used to take several weeks or months, are now provided in just a week or two. Now, our caregivers use a radar reflecting marker called SAVI Scout to place a reflector at the tumor site before a surgical biopsy. During the biopsy, surgeons use the technology to detect the location of the reflector allowing for better precision. This means a quicker surgery for the patient, saving them time and money. 13 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunityClinical Statistics Intermountain Healthcare operates 24 hospitals (including a virtual hospital) in Utah and Idaho. Intermountain also operates 210 clinics in Utah, Idaho, and Nevada, and urgent care facilities that are run by physicians as part of the Intermountain Medical Group.

That is why in 2019 Intermountain Healthcare launched Castell, a new comprehensive health platform company that makes the move to value-based care simple for providers, payers, health systems, and accountable care organizations across the nation. Castell is built on Intermountain's success in managing health \u2014 specifically, a proven value-based clinical care model called Reimagined Primary Care. We've built on that knowledge to create a best-in-class health platform with a comprehensive suite of offerings. Castell delivers impactful analytic and service solutions designed to accelerate organizations' transition from volume to value, improve outcomes, and keep costs more affordable \u2014 so all can succeed in the future of healthcare.\"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\" \u2014 Abraham Lincoln Of all the powerful ideas Intermountain Healthcare is implementing, one of the most revolutionary may be focusing not just on healthcare, but on health. Sixty percent of your overall health is determined by factors other than the care you get from your doctor or in the hospital. It depends on your lifestyle. That's why a major part of our mission is to help keep people out of our facilities \u2014 to keep them healthy by helping them avoid the medical problems that would otherwise impair their quality of life. Our caregivers continue to innovate and create better ways of moving upstream in the health journey, while still treating those who need care. It's a focus we are committed to extending to more people across an expanded area of the Intermountain West, and we made great progress in 2019. 15 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunityIntermountain Enters Nevada Market with Major Acquisition Intermountain took a big step forward in 2019 on its strategic growth strategy by acquiring HealthCare Partners Nevada, a leading physician group and affiliate network in the greater Las Vegas area. HealthCare Partners Nevada has 1,500 affiliate providers and employs 320 physicians and advanced practice providers at over 50 clinics across southern Nevada that provide primary, specialty, and urgent care services. The addition of HealthCare Partners Nevada aligns well with Intermountain's strategy for smart growth and for delivering more value \u2014 in the form of better quality, accessibility, and affordability \u2014 to more people. These added operations in southern Nevada represent what Intermountain believes is the best way forward for healthcare, focusing on ways to keep communities well. Since our teams came together as one in June 2019, we have been working to integrate operations, learn from one another, and combine their unique strengths to provide extraordinary health services to patients. Going forward, Intermountain will continue to evaluate and consider growth opportunities that make sense strategically and support its mission. Growth & Innovation CONTINUAL GROWTH & innovationGlobal Collaboration to Research Human Genomes Intermountain teamed with de-CODE genetics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, to study new connections between genetics and human disease. Our initiative is called HerediGene: Population Study. It is the most comprehensive DNA mapping effort in the United States from a single population. The study will analyze the genomes of half a million people throughout Utah, Idaho, and Nevada. Its purpose is to better understand the human genome to help uncover insights into some of the most debilitating diseases. The research is expected to have global impacts on medications, treatments, and healthcare innovations. It's our hope that this will advance care for generations to come. Advancing Care with Robotic-Assisted Thoracic Surgery With the new da Vinci Xi surgical system, Intermountain performed robotic-assisted surgery for benign and malignant tumors of the lungs, esophagus, and chest wall. For thoracic surgeons who operate in small areas, this allows for more accuracy. This surgery is performed through three to four small incisions. The surgeon uses a 3D high-definition viewer to see the surgical area and operates the hand and foot controls that move the machine. Overall, patients have smaller scars and faster recoveries so they can get back to their lives as soon as possible. 17 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunityProgress in Stabilizing Generic Drug Supplies In 2019, Civica Rx established headquarters in Lehi, Utah. The not-for-profit generic drug company grew to include approximately 50 health systems as members, representing more than 1,200 U.S. hospitals in 46 states and over 30 percent of all licensed U.S. hospital beds. It announced three pharmaceutical company partnerships for critical medicines used daily by hospitals in emergency care, surgery, pain management, and in treating hypertension. It also delivered its first products to Intermountain Riverton Hospital where patients were the first anywhere to be treated with a Civica-produced medication, Vancomycin. By the end of the year, it had 18 products in production being shipped to hospitals around the country. In addition to reducing chronic shortages and stabilizing the supply of generic drugs within hospitals, Civica Rx is expanding its mission to also focus on the affordability of generic medications outside the hospital setting.

It's never about the role, always about the goal.\" \u2014 Jeremy Bravo The best healthcare in the world can't make a difference if people can't access it \u2014 or afford it. That's why Intermountain has reorganized around two basic premises: First, we're in the business of keeping people well. Second, when people are sick, we want to ensure they have access to the best possible care for the lowest possible cost. Greater ACCESS, greater affordability 19 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunitySelectHealth Integrated Behavioral Health SelectHealth made significant progress in addressing gaps in coverage, our provider network, and access to qualified behavioral health services. We've added qualified, credentialled providers with expertise in substance abuse, suicidal ideation, postpartum depression, and the needs of the LGBTQ community, among many others. Our network has grown to nearly 1,900 mental health providers, with 250 more in process. SelectHealth has one of the largest and most comprehensive provider networks in Utah, for both behavioral health and substance abuse services.

A social needs assessment is administered in the clinical setting to establish a baseline of social needs. This opens a dialogue about barriers participants face outside clinic walls. Participants who report moderate to severe social need are offered the support of a Community Health Worker (CHW). The needs assesment guides the prioritization of next steps as the CHW and participant make a plan and set goals. In September 2019, the Alliance hit a milestone by screening the 100th participant. The top social needs in the Alliance geographies are transportation, food insecurity, housing, and dental care. More than 300 referrals have been given, such as helping a participant in a rural area receive prescription delivery and shepherding a person experiencing homelessness through the paperwork to secure permanent housing. Making Good Progress in Addressing the Opioid Epidemic Long-term pain (chronic) Naloxone kits funded and distributed2,158,100 1,900 21 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunityPromoting Mental Wellbeing to Prevent Suicide Promoting mental wellbeing to prevent suicide, Intermountain's Zero Suicide initiative helps people navigate crises and get access to timely, effective care. Our work in 2019 involved new pilots and protocols in clinical contexts like the emergency department and SelectHealth member services. It also focused on our community of 41,700 caregivers. Cultivating a mentally healthy organization involves responding effectively in the aftermath of traumatic events and creating a coordinated approach to promote mental wellbeing in everyday lives. More than 30,000 caregivers and 14,000 community members completed at least one Intermountain-supported training this year to enhance their confidence and competence in supporting others in times of mental and emotional distress. Free Blood Lead Testing for Community Residents of Sandy, Utah, were potentially exposed to lead in 2019 as a result of the city's water contamination. While the duration of the potential exposure to lead from this incident was brief, Intermountain alongside the Salt Lake County Health Department provided no-cost blood lead testing for the community. Though the exposure is unlikely to have any long-term health impacts, we wanted to help alleviate concerns and rebuild confidence in the community.

It's also when their true strength is revealed. With the help of our specialists, more children are able to win. And each victory is unique. The number of children we serve continues to grow rapidly, and their needs continue to change and become more complex. With Intermountain's unique combination of the free-standing Primary Children's Hospital and our network of clinics and hospitals, we are in a position to extend excellence in pediatric care across the Intermountain West. \"Definition of a good neighbor: Someone to be trusted; a courteous, friendly source of help when help is needed; someone you can count on; someone who cares.\" \u2014 Edward B. Rust, Jr. Our partnerships within the community continue to expand. Many of our community service activities are based on Community Health Needs Assessments we conducted in collaboration with local leaders. We determined three long-term health needs including improve mental wellbeing, prevent avoidable disease and injury, and improve air quality. Our continued commitment to the community showed through support of the vulnerable members of our community. Intermountain is also expanding access to our services to children and their parents across the Intermountain West. 23 Intermountain Healthcare | Report to the CommunityA Community United in Generosity It was a historic year of giving to the Intermountain Foundation, with generous donors stepping up to contribute a record $106.7 million. Leading this charitable outpouring was a transformational gift from Intermountain Board Chair, businesswoman, and civic leader Gail Miller. She and her family committed $50 million to the Intermountain Foundation in support of Intermountain's Primary Promise \u2014 a once-in-a-generation initiative that will distinguish Utah as a national model for the delivery of healthcare to children. The Millers' gift is the largest ever committed by the Miller Family to any project and it's inspiring others to give notable seven- and eight-figure contributions. It's also spurring continued support for the Foundation's ongoing mission to help Intermountain Healthcare provide the highest quality, compassionate patient care, lifesaving research, and leading-edge medical education. There are many types of contributions. Whether endowments, planned gifts, bequests, or support of Foundation events and fundraisers, donations to the Intermountain Foundation bring miracles to life, benefitting countless children and families throughout our communities for generations to come. \"Intermountain Healthcare's plan is impactful and innovative and will improve our collective health through a finite focus on children. Our family is committed to enriching lives and doing good in our communities. We understand from personal experience how important it is to have the highest quality healthcare available to address the needs of children.
