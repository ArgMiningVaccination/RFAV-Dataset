Anthroposophic pharmacy is derived from two sources: \"material\" science on the one hand, and \"spiritual\" science on the other. Neither one may be taken in isolation. Anthroposophy recognizes a relationship between human beings and nature through their common evolution. This relationship is the basis for anthroposophic pharmacy. Man and nature have a common history; gradually man has emancipated himself from nature. In illness man finds himself becoming similar to the processes in nature. In order to regain control over his humanity, transformed natural substances can be given. The International Association of Anthroposophic Pharmacists IAAP is the governing body of the international community of anthroposophic pharmacists within the Medical Section of the Gotheanum.
