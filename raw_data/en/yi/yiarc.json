This article presents an immunologic theory for the development of some cases of autism and circumstantial biologic evidence in support of this theory. A summary of some of the latest related findings obtained in the laboratory of the author is also presented. The intent of this article is to stimulate interest in the concept that abnormalities of the immune system are involved in autistic symptoms and to provide an impetus for additional studies in this area. Such studies may provide a novel approach to the treatment of some autistic individuals. - Type - Feature Articles - Information [CNS Spectrums](/core/journals/cns-spectrums), [Volume pp. 71 - 79 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 1998 "}
