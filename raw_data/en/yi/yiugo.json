ABBREVIATIONS CSF PCR polymerase chain reaction WNV West Nile virus 68 Pediatrics in Review ARTICLE ABSTRACT Encephalitis is de ned as altered mental status for more than 24 hours accompanied by 2 or more ndings concerning for in flammation of the brain parenchyma: fever, seizures or other focal neurologic disorders, cerebrospinal and abnormal neuroimaging and electroencephalographic ndings. Herpes virus causes the most severe form of virus-induced encephalitis; the early administration of acyclovir can improve the prognosis of this disease. The rising interest in autoimmune causes of encephalitis, most notably anti- N-methyl- D-aspartate receptor, should prompt the clinician to consider immunomodulatory treatments, which may improve outcomes. Abroad testing panel may be necessary t o detect the etiologic agent; a few published pediatric cases suggest th at infectious and autoimmune causes may occur concurrently in the same patient with encephalitis. More than 40% of children diagnosed as having encephalitis will not return to their previous level of neurologic function after resolution of their disease, although out- comes are highly variable depending on the etiologic agent.1.

(1)(2) A consensus statement by the International Encephalitis Consortium outlines diagnostic criteria for possible and probable/con rmed encephalitis. (2) A requirement for this disease is altered mental status for>24 hours without an alternative diagnosis. Additional cri- teria to support the diagnosis of encephalitis include 2 or more of the following: fever (>100\u00b0F [>38\u00b0C]) within 72 hours, seizures (new onset or different than preexisting seizure history), new focal neurologic ndings, cerebro- spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (white [>0.01\u00d710 9/L]), readings consistent with encephalitis. (2) Pediatric encephalitides can be categorized as infectious or autoimmune. Historically, infectious agents accounted for most documented etiologies of encephalitis. Before the use of vaccines, measles, mumps, varicella, and polio were among the top causes. With the widespread use of vacci-nations, other viral etiologies, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and enterovirus (EV), rose to the top of the infectious etiologies. (3)(4) The pathophysiology of infectious enceph- alitis is usually by hematogenous spread of the pathogen into the CSF after systemic infection. (5) Autoimmune encephalitides are recently described medical phenomena. Their pathogenesis is attributed to the body 's immune response to a preceding antigenic stimulus. (1) Theprototype of these diseases is anti re- ceptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. against NR1 subunit of theNMDAR. Increased interest in autoimmune encephalitis has driven the discovery of other antibodies that may be attributed as possible causative agents for encephalitis. The incidence of pediatric encephalitis is unclear given the diverse etiologies, inconsistent de nitions of encepha- litis, and denominator populations across studies. Recentreports note that cases of pediatric encephalitis may be in- creasing, (6) due in part to recognition of autoimmune etiologies of these causes (1)(7)(8)(9)(10) and improvementsin describing abnormalities in brain parenchyma through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A large proportion (ie, up to 30%) have an undiagnosed etiology. (8) This review focuses on nocompetent pediatric patient.SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIES Herpes Simplex Virus HSV should be considered in all children suspected of having encephalitis given the severe morbidity associated with delayed or incorrect treatment of this potentially dev- astating viral encephalitis. (1) It is among the most common infectious causes of pediatric encephalitis in the postvaccine era, (3) although exact numbers are unclear given that it is not a nationally reportable infection. Beyond the neonatal period, the serotype is almost exclusively HSV-1. Pediatric HSV encephalitis may be a manifestation of either primary disease (when virus from an actively shedding individual contacts the oral mucosa or abraded skin of the child) or reactivation(when the virus emerges from latency in the trigeminal ganglia). The virus has a predilection for the temporal lobes of the brain, as found on brain imaging or EEG monitoring. Given its sporadic nature, there is no seasonality to HSV encephalitis. Enterovirus EV is among the top causes of encephalitis in children, mostfrequently occurring in the rst year of life. (11) Incidence rates are dif cult to elicit, again (similar to HSV) because EV is not nationally reportable. EV is spread through fecal-oraland respiratory transmission, and subsequent replication and viremia then seed end organs such as the central nervous system. Seasonality does factor into diagnostic suspicion, given that EV incidence peaks in the summer and fall. West Nile Virus West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common arbovirus inNorth America causing neuroinvasive disease (including encephalitis). It is so named due to being rst discovered in the West Nile area of Uganda in 1937. Analysis of all cases of WNV-associated neuroinvasive disease shows that less than 4% involve children younger than 18 years, (12) but sheer overall numbers of WNV in the population-at-large still renders a high case number of pediatric WNV infec-tions annually. Encephalitis composes approximately half of all pediatric WNV neuroinva sive disease. (13) Compared with other arboviruses, WNV does not have a clear geo- graphic speci city, having been reported throughout the United States (except Hawaii and Alaska). WNV is trans- mitted through the bite of infected Culex mosquitos. Seasonality is important in di agnostic suspicion given that summer is the major time for its responsible mosquito vector. Vol. 42 No. 2 FEBRUARY 2021 69 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from La Crosse Virus La Crosse virus is the second most common arbovirus to cause neuroinvasive disease in North America, and it is sonamed due to it being rst discovered and isolated from a child who died from fatal meningoencephalitis in La Crosse,Wisconsin. Although sheer numbers from the general population lag behind WNV, 88% of all encephalitis attrib- uted to La Crosse virus occurs in children younger than 18 years. (13) There is a clear geographic speci city, with most cases originating from the Appalachian and Midwestern region of the United States. (13)(14)(15) La Crosse virus is transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitos. Similar to WNV, there is a seasonality (late spring throughearly fall) to this viral disease given its arboviral vector. Zika Virus Zika virus is so named due to discovery of this virus in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. This pathogen has captured the attention of clinicians due to its causation of infant microcephaly and neurologic de cits after prenatal exposure. However, children (older than 1 month) may also acquireZika virus encephalitis. Transmission occurs from the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes ( Aedes aegypti and less commonly Aedes albopictus ). The major risk factor is residence in or travel to areas in which these mosquitoes are present andthere are identi ed ongoing outbreaks. The seasonality of Zika virus should place it in the differential of a patient withencephalitis presenting in the summer and early fall. AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALITIS Autoimmune encephalitis is a collective term for a variety of diseases that occur when there is an aberrant response of theimmune system against neuronal cells. These diseases maybe organized roughly into 4 groups: those that are neurologic manifestations of systemic autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), those that are paraneoplastic manifestations of primary cancers, those with antibodies against intracellular proteins, and those with antibodies against cell surface proteins (such as anti-NMDAR). (16) The oncologic association with the latter 2 autoimmune groups is not entirely correlated, although anti-NMDAR encephalitis wasrst described in association with ovarian teratomas in young women. (17)(18) Case numbers of autoimmune en- cephalitis may, ultimately, if not already, outnumber those of viral encephalitides. At minimum, the incidence of NMDAR encephalitis seems to exceed the rate for a single viral eti- ology in pediatric patients in the United States. (19) Autoimmune causes of encephal itides have less clear epi- demiologic patterns and identi able risk factors compared withinfectious etiologies. Interestingly, infection itself can be a riskfactor for autoimmune encephalitis because up to 20% of pa- tients with HSV develop anti-NMDAR antibodies. (20) There are 2 published cases of children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis attributed as a complication from active HSV and tuberculosis disease (each with 1 patient). (21) Congenital immune-mediated encephalitis may be of particular interest to pediatricians. Several publications have described cases of infants developing signs from transpla- cental transfer of autoantibodies from both symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers. (22) These signs may include neu- rologic manifestations, poor feeding, poor respiratory effort,and lethargy at birth. Duration of illness is usually transient because the antibodies are eliminated by the infant, although at least 1 fatality has occurred in a symptomatic infant. (22) PRESENTATION There is considerable overlap in symptoms between in-fectious and autoimmune encephalitis. As mentioned earlier, altered mental status for longer than 24 hours is necessary. A variety of accompanying clinical features in-clude fever (67% -80%), seizure or decreased consciousness (47%). (8)(23) Viral encephalitis is more likely to cause fever compared with autoimmune encephalitis. T he presentation for autoim- mune encephalitis tends to be more chronic, with delayeddiagnosis up to several weeks. (5) Although neurologic de cits are part of the classical presentation, physical examination ndings other than those involving the central nervous system should be sought be-cause other ndings potentially provide diagnostic clues for infectious causes. For example, cutaneous lesions involving the hands, feet, and mouth may suggest EV infection, whereas vesicular lesions on an erythematous base may suggest HSV or varicella as an etiology. (7) DIAGNOSTIC TESTING In considering infectious etiologies, a careful history of signs, symptoms, and epidemiologic risk factors is of utmostimportance to narrow the differential diagnosis. Important items to identify include geographic areas of travel or resi- dence, recreational and occupational exposures, insect or animal contact (such as ticks or mosquitoes), and seasonality. Autoimmune encephalitides should be considered in a pa- tient who presents with mood, behavior, or personality changes that resemble acute psychosis. Diagnostic evaluation of a child with suspected encephalitis always includes CSF studies, which may be accompanied by 70 Pediatrics in Review at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from serum serological testing and neuroimaging. The Table guides the clinician to organize testing in a tiered manner, focusing on treatable or common conditions, followed by other tests if the patient does not improve and initial testing is unrevealing for the etiologic agent. These latter tests should be prioritized by risk factors (eg, patient age, seasonality of presentation, arbovirus exposure, geography and travel history, and non- adherence to the childhood vaccine schedule). In encephalitis, CSF studies often re flect a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein levels and normal glucose levels. (5)(6) Autoimmune encephalitis tends to have a lower level of CSF pleocytosis, (24) followed by higher levels in in-fectious encephalitis. HSV encephalitis was historically reported to have elevated levels of red blood cells given the hemorrhagic nature of brain parenchymal lesions; hemorrhagic fluid has become rare, however, given that diagnosis is made earlier and, hence, the intracranial lesions have not evolved to the point of hemorrhaging. (25) If hemorrhagic flu i di sf o u n d ,i ti sg e n e r a l l y attributed to the lumbar puncture technique. Evaluation of any case of pediatric encephalitis should include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the CSF againstHSV, given the availability of treatment to ameliorate the poor prognosis. PCR has become the gold standard to di- agnose HSV and EV. Targeted PCR can be developed at individual institutions rather than using commercially available PCR kits that involve sending samples to outside laboratories, which would prolong the time to results. Al- though \"homegrown\" PCR testing offers the advantages of low cost or rapid turnaround time, providers should un-derstand the sensitivity and speci city of their own labo- ratory 's test, how the test is validated, and how quality control is performed to feel con dent in using the test result to direct clinical management. Multiplex syndromic PCR panels (such as those developed for diarrheal, respiratory, or meningitis/encephalitis pre- sentations) have gained popularity in recent years given their effect on turnaround time (4 -24 hours for PCR compared with days for microbiologic cultures) and broad spectrum ofpathogen detection. These panels may test for bacterial, viral, and/or fungal etiologies. Although these multiplex PCR panels, compared with microbiologic cultures, may providea timely diagnosis, decreased length of hospital stay, and less need for invasive diagnostic procedures and may help direct antimicrobial therapy, they are not without limita- tions. Limitations include decreased sensitivity compared with targeted PCR assays and confusion about whether positive results for latent viruses in an immunocompetent patient (eg, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hu- man herpesvirus-6) represent true disease viral reac- tivation in a time of stress.For arboviral diagnosis, the clinician needs to rely on virus- specic immunoglobulin M antibodies in the CSF because there is usually no PCR method for common arboviruses. (13) A promising addition to diagnostic testing for encepha- litis is metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) ofCSF. A published study of 204 patients (~20% being <18 years of age) showed that in 58 cases of meningitis and encephalitis attributed to infectious etiologies, 22% (n = 13) were detected solely by NGS. (26) Of those detected by NGS alone, 7 of these results guided clinical management. Further renement to address concerns about false-negative results, as well as optimal timing and appropriate patients for testing, are needed before Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and widespread commercial use. (26) When autoimmune encephalitis is suspected, autoanti- bodies in the serum and CSF are sought through indirect immuno fluorescence assay and con rmatory Western blot analysis. These tests are available in reference laboratories,usually as part of a panel for autoimmune testing. Autoim- mune evaluation is usually conducted simultaneously with an infectious evaluation, in the event that any identi ed infec- tions may have a treatment that, when implemented, may speed the recovery of the autoimmune disease. MRI of the brain with and without intravenous contrast is therst-line imaging test for pediatric patients presenting with suspected intracranial infection. This test is designatedas\"usually appropriate \"according to the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria \u00aeimaging guidelines. (27) For pediatric patients presenting with suspected auto- immune encephalitis, a dedicated epilepsy protocol MRI with and without intravenous contrast is recommended because this study is tailored for evaluation of the hippo-campi, which are most commonly affected in the autoim- mune encephalitides. Computed tomography of the head without intravenous contrast is recommended as a rst-line study in pediatric patients presenting with acute mentalstatus change and suspected intracranial infection because this test can rapidly and accurately exclude all acute neu- rosurgical emergencies. (27) However, computed tomogra- phy is not recommended in the evaluation of pediatric encephalitis (without acute mental status change) becauseit has lower diagnostic accuracy than MRI and requires patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Patterns seen on neuroimaging may be helpful to differentiate between in- fectious and autoimmune encephalitis; (5) these patterns are by no means universal, however, and should always be interpreted within the clinical context of the patient 's pre- sentation. MRI patterns include autoimmune etiologies lo-calizing to the limbic system (can be unilateral or bilateral) and HSV encephalitis unilaterally affecting the medial Vol. 42 No. 2 FEBRUARY 2021 71 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on May 14, 2021 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from temporal lobe. (28)(29)(30) Figure 1 depicts a typical case of HSV encephalitis from our institution. Unfortunately for diagnostic purposes, most infectious causes of encephalitis are not associated with a typical imaging pattern. Initial experience with anti-NMDAR encephalitis indicated a strong association of ovarian teratoma in almost 60% of affected young women. (31)(32) Increasing diagnosis of this disorder, in males as well as females, showed that younger female patients (aged <18 years) had a lower incidence (31%) of associated tumors. (18) Despite a likely low yield, abdominal/ pelvic ultrasonography may allow resection of a tumor to al- leviate the encephalitis. (33) Figure 2 depicts a typical case ofanti-NMDAR encephalitis associated with an ovarian tumor. The role of EEG in the evaluation of encephalitis is controversial. The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend obtaining EEGs in all encephalitic patients. (1) In contrast, the consensus guidelines from of the United Kingdom do not routinely recommend EEGs because most patients with encephalitis will have abnormal results. (7)(34) Consultation with experts in pediatric neurology is indicated to evaluate the utility of EEG for a particular pa-tient. If EEG is performed, most patients with autoimmune encephalitis demonstrate interictal and background abnor- malities. (30) EEG abnormalities are often nonspeci c, al- though generalized or focal slowing may be seen, particularlyin anti-NMDAR encephalitis. (20) The provider should recognize that a large proportion of pediatric cases of encephalitis (up to 30%) have no identi able etiology. (8) The decision to aggressively pursue an etiology depends on the clinical status of the child. Incases of static or worsening symptoms, continued diag- nostic testing may provide a tangible answer that would bereassuring to both patients and medical providers. Close attention to new historical details and evolving physical ex- amination ndings may guide additional testing, althoughdiagnostic evaluation should always be in concert with on-going supportive measures. In addition, continued evalua- tion should be weighed against risks of invasive procedures andnancial costs of additional testing. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Encephalitis can be dif cult to distinguish from meningitis because the two often present with the overlapping signs offever, headache, and altered mental status. (1) It is unsur- prising, then, that the term meningoencephalitis may often be used to describe a child' s presentation. (35) It can be helpful, in guiding initial diagnostics and therapeutics, to differen-tiate encephalitic or meningitic symptoms based on whether there is evidence of brain parenchymal dysfunction (eg, seizures, weakness, focal de cits) or meningeal irritation (eg, nuchal rigidity), respectively. (35) Because seizures, headaches, and focal neurologic de cits are common presentations for intracranial processes, space-occupying lesions such as tumors and abscesses should be promptly ruled out given vastly different treatment ventures.Likewise, ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes should be considered in the differential diagnosis given the need for prompt intervention. Care should be taken to distinguish encephalitis from encephalopathy as well. Encephalopathy is a disease state characterized by disruption of brain function in the absence of inflammation of brain parenchyma (1)(2)(7) that lacks the additional criteria outlined by the International EncephalitisConsortium. (2) Encephalopathy can occur in the setting of metabolic disturbances, hypoxia, ischemia, intoxication, medications, organ dysfunction, or even systemic infectionand is treated quite differently from encephalitis. (1) Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis should be in- cluded in the differential dia gnosis. Acute disseminated Figure 1. Magnetic resonance images of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis.

It is often preceded by a prodromal illness, which is postu- lated to lead to the developmen t of autoantibodies, causing a multifocal demyelinating process in the central nervoussystem. (36) TREATMENT Empirical Antimicrobial Coverage Given that HSV is the leading cause of severe encephalitis, is more frequently associated with poor outcomes than other viral causes, and is treatable, acyclovir therapy should be quickly initiated in all encephalitic patients until HSV is ruled out. (1)(7) Antibacterial agents are frequently started given the clinical overlap with acute bacterial meningitis because there are im- proved outcomes after swift empirical treatment for bacterialmeningitis. Vancomycin and a third-generation cephalospo- rin (eg, ceftriaxone) serotype b, and may consider use of ampi- cillin for coverage of Listeria monocytogenes if there is concern for consumption of contaminated food (eg, deli meats or raw dairy products). Antibacterial agents are typically discontinued once bacterial cultures from CSF and blood are negative. A potential role for mycoplasma in pediatric encephalitis has intrigued scientists. Con rming the role of mycoplasma has been hampered by dif culty in interpreting various microbiologic tests (serological tests may indicate active orprevious infection; antigen may be detected in the respiratory tract long after the acute respiratory infection has resolved). It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment affects recovery of encephalitis attributed to mycoplasma. There is no evi- dence suggesting that antimicrobial treatment affects the disease process, even with PCR detection of mycoplasma in the CSF. (37) It is dif cult to recommend empirical therapyof a disease without a de nitive diagnostic test or therapeutic end point. In otherwise healthy, immunocompetent children, CSF tested with a PCR multiplex panel may detect cytomegalo- virus, Epstein-Barr virus, or human herpesvirus-6. This maynot be clinically signi cant, but merely re flect bystander reactivation in the setting of stress. Therefore, these patientswould not require antiviral therapy. Immunomodulators for Infectious and Autoimmune Etiologies Corticosteroids may play a role in the treatment of enceph- alitis. Among the viral encephalitides, corticosteroids are more commonly used in varicella zoster encephalitis given the vasculitic nature of this infection and may be used in HSV encephalitis if there is concern for cerebral edema. (35) In autoimmune encephalitis such as anti-NMDAR, the therapeutic goal is inhibition of the immune therapies include intravenous high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange. of action from corticosteroids is a non- specic damping of the immune system. IVIG seems to act, in part, by decreasing the overall burden of the offendingautoantibody by dilution. (38) Plasma exchange may be used in autoimmune encephalitis for its potential to remove thedisease-causing antibodies. It is dif cult to tease out the individual contributions of these 3 agents in assessing ther-apeutic outcomes because some combination is usually used. (21)(39) A recent systematic review found that plasma ex- change tends to be performed if anti-NMDAR encephalitis is refractory to corticosteroids and IVIG. (40) If there is a poor patient response to rst-line therapies, other aspects of the immune system (eg, B cells and cyto- kines) may be targeted. (38)(40) Rituximab is a commonly used second-line agent in autoimmune encephalitis and Figure 2.

(41) The published literature highlights the variability in timing of administra- tion during the disease process, making causality between treatment and outcomes dif cult. (20)(41) In a multicenter, retrospective study of 144 children with autoimmune and inflammatory central nervous system conditions, initiation of rituximab ranged from 3 weeks to 9.5 years after diagnosis.(41) Rituximab was found to cause infusion reactions, ana- phylaxis, and infectious complications (including need for hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics). (41) Given the potential for morbidity associated with rituximab treatment, consultation with a pediatric neurologist is recommended. REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS Data on the impact of rehabilitatio n after encephalitis are sparse. (42)(43) Cognitive therapy, behav ioral therapy, and/or physical therapy seem to have a positive effect on long-term functionaloutcomes, although it is dif cult to separate the natural course of the encephalitic disease from possible bene tf r o mr e h a - bilitation. Enlisting the expertise of therapists in cases of en- cephalitis may be encouraged, although optimal timing from onset of symptoms to initiation of rehabilitation is not clear. OUTCOMES Outcomes are highly variable among the various encephalit-ides and depend on the etiologic agent. A retrospective study involving 164 children performed in Australia demonstrated that many children, after being diagnosed as having either infectious or autoimmune encephalitis, experience an \"ab- normal \"outcome, including dif culties in learning (28%), behavior (24%), and speech (17%). (8) Seventeen percent ofchildren ultimately were diagnosed as having epilepsy.

(44) Of patients with infectious encephalitis, those with HSV encephalitis tend to be the most severely affected, with up to 64% experiencing late effects; a broad range of de cits, in- cluding neuropsychological dysfunction, developmental delay,and focal motor de cits, have been reported. (25)(45) Children with EV encephalitis, on the other hand, have fared better in the long-term. In a prospective study of a large Taiwanese outbreak of EV-71 (a well-known neuroinvasive EV serotype), 51 of 63 children (81%) had no de cits at mean follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 1.4 -4.9 years). (45) Longitudinal epidemiologic studies of acquired Zika virus infection are needed to betterunderstand neurodevelopmental sequelae, (46) although subtle long-term neurologic defects have been reported years after resolution of primary infection. Of patients with autoimmune encephalitis, approximately one-third demonstrate full recovery, one-third demonstrate partial recovery, and one-third show limited recovery with severe decits. This has been demonstrated in both observational studies in single institutions and systematic reviews of patients diagnosed as having anti-NMDAR encephalitis. (18)(47)(48)Time to recovery may be prolonged, with one observational study citing at least a 6-week interval between presentation and signs of initial improvement. (18) Use of immunotherapy generally correlates with improved outcomes, (48) although optimal timing for initiation of these therapies is unclear. (41) Several studies have suggested predictors of poor out- comes of encephalitis, including status epilepticus, ICU admission, presence of a movement disorder, and (with autoimmune encephalitis) a delay of immunotherapy (al- though what constitutes a delay is unclear). (8)(48) Thepresence of diffusion restriction on MRI, usually repre- senting cytotoxic edema and irreversible cell death, is also a poor prognostic indicator in pediatric patients. (8) Disease relapse may be seen. Of an Australian cohort of 164 pediatric patients with encephalitis (either infectious or autoimmune), 8 (5%) relapsed. (8) Even higher rates have been reported in HSV encephalitis and anti-NMDAR en- cephalitis, with up to 30% and 25% of children, respectively, experiencing relapse. (25)(48) CONCLUSION A diagnosis of encephalitis in children has the potential tonegatively impact their trajectory of health, development, and quality of life, although outcomes are highly variable. Swift recognition, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment is imper- ative to cover potentially treatable causes within the wide sphere of infectious and autoimmune encephalitides. Promptadministration of acyclovir may decrease morbidity andmortality associated with HSV encephalitis.

A pediatric resident in Colorado performs a retrospective study on the epidemiology and etiology of encephalitis in immunocompetent children older than six weeks of age over the past 15 years. Which of the following is the most likely conclusion of the study? A. Approximately 30% had an undiagnosed etiology. B.Borrelia the most common overall etiology. C. Herpes simplex virus 2 was the most common viral etiology. D. Powassen virus was the most common arbovirus causing encephalitis. E. Subjects with enterovirus had the worst prognosis. 2. A previously healthy 17-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents with a 4-day history of worsening headaches and confusion. Over the past day she has become much more agitated and seems to be having visual hallucinations. Her parents think she felt warm yesterday but there is no documented fever. Her vital signs are normal. Other than altered mental statusthe only nding on physical examination is a left lower abdominal/pelvic mass. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is done and is normal. Lumbarpuncture is performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count shows 11 red blood cells (RBC) and 52 white blood cells (WBC) (81% lymphocytes, 11%monocytes, 8% neutrophils). and protein 42 mg/dl. Gramstain of the CSF shows no organisms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows increased FLAIR signal in the left amygdala and hippocampus. Pelvic sonography shows a 10 cm cystic ovarian mass on the left. Which of thefollowing is the most likely etiology for her current symptoms? A. Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). B. Human Parechovirus. D. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody. E.Rickettsia rickettsii. 3. A previously healthy and fully immunized 11-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department (ED) by his parents with a 3-day history of worsening headache and intermittent fever. Over the past day he is much sleepier and seems confused and agitated at times. While in the ED he had a brief generalizedtonic-clonic seizure. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C; other vital signs are normal. He isdifcult to arouse and does not respond to questions. The remainder of his examination including fundoscopic examination is normal. Which of thefollowing is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis? A. Chest radiography. B. CT scan of his head and neck. C. Electroencephalogram. D. Lumbar puncture. E.

One hour prior she had a 2-3 minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is sleeping but does wakeup with stimulation and recognizes her parents. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C. Shehas no focal ndings on physical examination. Lumbar puncture is performed. CSF cell count shows 0 RBC, 3 WBC, glucose 62 mg/dl, and protein 23 mg/dl. CSFgram stain shows no organisms. A CSF multiplex PCR panel is only positive for human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Which of the following is the most appropriate antiviral therapy? A. Acyclovir. B. Cidofovir. C. Foscarnet. D. Ganciclovir. E. No antiviral therapy.
