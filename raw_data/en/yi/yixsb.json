TSP Mailing Address: Thrift Savings Plan P.O. describes the choices that are available to all separated participants and beneficiary participants. In this booklet, a \"separated participant\" means someone who established a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account while serving as a civilian federal employee or member of the uniformed services and has now separated from that employment. A \"beneficiary participant\" is a spouse beneficiary of a deceased civilian or uniformed services TSP participant who has a TSP account established in his or her name. In this booklet, you will find information about the withdrawal process, the rules that govern withdrawals, and the tax implications of each withdrawal option. Before you decide to withdraw money from your TSP account, we recommend that you consider how your decision may impact your future needs. For example, if you are not ready to retire and are considering using the money in your TSP account for purposes other than your future retirement needs, you should consider the tax implications and whether you will have enough retirement savings when you are ready to retire. Alternatively, if you are retiring or retired, you should think about when you will actually need the money in your TSP account and whether the withdrawal choices you make will provide enough income throughout your retirement years. Questions to Ask Before Withdrawing from Your Account Given that you may need your retirement savings into your 90s, here are some questions you should ask yourself before deciding to withdraw your TSP account. When should I begin withdrawing my money?How much do I think things will really cost duringmy retirement? Will I have enough income to cover my expensesafter I retire? Will my retirement savings last for my whole life?Do I need to provide income for my dependents/heirs? Because of inflation, the goods and services you buy today will probably cost you more in the future. Once you are living on a fixed income, increases in the cost of living can make meeting even the most basic expenses challenging. Even a relatively low rate of inflation can have a significantly diminishing effect on the purchasing power of your retirement savings. The following chart shows how your account may be affected by seemingly modest inflation. Suppose that the value of your account thirty years from now is $150,000. An inflation rate of 2% per year would reduce that $150,000 to the purchasing power of only $82,811 today. Notice that the higher the average rate of inflation, the less purchasing power you'll have. $60,000$90,000$120,000$150,000 30 25 20 15 10 5 1 YearsDecline in Purchasing Power over 30 Years $82,811 $71,511 $61,7983.0% 2.5% 2.0% It's important to estimate the amount of money you need to put aside for retirement to maintain your preretirement standard of living. Financial advisors typically refer to this calculation as a retirement income replacement ratio, or the percentage of your preretirement income that you need in retirement. Experts will often recommend a range of numbers, but each person's situation is unique. You also want to be careful that you do not withdraw too much money from your retirement account each year. Many retirees do, and they risk spending their savings too quickly. To avoid running out of money in retirement, planners often recommend withdrawing no more than 4% of your retirement savings during your first year of retirement and adjusting that amount annually for inflation. Tailoring Your Withdrawal Decisions to Your Personal Needs There are other factors besides life expectancy that you should take into consideration when making your withdrawal decisions. For example: What additional sources of income will you haveoutside of your TSP account? Will you be paying off a mortgage during yourretirement? Will you be moving to an area where your expenseswill be significantly higher or lower than where youlived before you retired?2 TSP Installment Payments You can choose to receive payments from your account monthly, quarterly (every three months), or annually. Your payments will continue, unless you stop them, until your total account balance equals zero. This is true even if you choose to have the payments come from your traditional balance first or from your Roth balance first. When you run out of money in your chosen source (traditional or Roth), payments will continue from the source you didn't choose. See \"Traditional, Roth, or Both\" on page 4. There are two ways of setting the payment amount: payments of a fixed dollar amount and payments based on life expectancy. Fixed Dollar Amount You can choose the amount you want to receive in each payment as long as it's at least $25. Life Expectancy You can have us compute your installment payments based on IRS life expectancy tables. Your initial payment amount will be based on your age and your account balance at the time of the first payment. Life expectancy payments are calculated using your entire account balance even if you choose to withdraw from your Roth balance first or your traditional balance first. (See \"Traditional, Roth, or Both\" on page 4.) If you choose life-expectancy-based installment payments in combination with a single withdrawal, an annuity purchase, or both, your payment calculation will be made after the other funds are removed from your account. Each January, we will recalculate the amount of your installment payment. The recalculation will be based on your age and your account balance at the end of the preceding year. Use the \"TSP Installment Payment Calculator\" at tsp.gov to estimate the amount of your life expectancy payments or to see how long payments of a fixed dollar amount would last. Remember that investment gains or losses and other account activity could cause your account balance to increase or decrease, which could increase or decrease either the amount of your life-expectancy payments or the duration of your fixed-dollar-amount payments. Everyone's withdrawal choices will be based on different circumstances. The important thing is to make sure your decisions are well informed and carefully thought through. The TSP has online calculators available at tsp.gov to help you. Leaving Your Money in the TSP Unless you're subject to required minimum distributions1 or you have a balance of less than $200,2 there's no requirement for you to make withdrawals from your account. So you can leave your entire account balance in the TSP and continue to enjoy tax-deferred earnings and our low administrative expenses. You won't be able to make employee contributions, but your account will continue to accrue earnings, and you can continue to change the way your money is invested in the TSP investment funds by making interfund transfers. If you're a separated participant, you can also transfer money into your TSP account from traditional and Roth eligible employer plans and from traditional IRAs. (Transfers from Roth IRAs are not allowed. Beneficiary participants are not allowed to transfer money in.) Your Withdrawal Options Withdrawal Methods There are three basic methods of withdrawing money from your TSP account as a separated or beneficiary participant: installment payments, single withdrawals, and annuity purchases. Choosing one or more of these methods is not the only decision you'll need to make when making a withdrawal, so be sure to read on after this section. 1 S ee page 8 for information about required minimum distributions. 2 S eparated participants, if your vested account balance is less than $200 after your agency or service reports that you have left service, your balance will be automatically paid directly to you in a single payment (i.e., cashout). You will not be allowed to remain in the TSP. We will not withhold any amount for federal income tax on your cashout if all your withdrawals from the TSP throughout the year of your cashout add up to less than $200. If your balance is less than $5.00 when you leave service, we will automatically forfeit the balance to the Thrift Savings Plan. Your quarterly participant statement will indicate that the balance has been forfeited. You can reclaim the forfeited amount by sending us a written request, but we will not credit earnings to the account after the forfeiture date.3Making Changes to Your Installment Payments After your installment payments are set up, you can make changes to them at any time. See page 7 for information on how to make changes. You can make the following changes whether you're receiving payments of a fixed dollar amount or based on life expectancy: stop payments change the source of payments (traditional, Roth, or both) start, stop, or change direct deposit of your payments change your federal tax withholding The following changes can only be made if your payments are of a fixed dollar amount: change the dollar amount of your payments change the frequency of your payments start transferring your payments to an IRA or eligible employer plan (only if payments are expected to last less than 10 years) change or stop transfers (if currently transferring) Important: Note that changing the amount or frequency of your payments is not valid for payments based on life expectancy. So we will change your payments to fixed-dollar-amount payments if you request such a change. You cannot change from payments of a fixed dollar amount to payments based on life expectancy, so this change will be permanent. Installment Payments Lasting Less Than 10 Years vs. Payments Lasting 10 Years or More The rules for federal tax withholding and eligibility to transfer to an IRA or eligible employer plan are different depending on how long your payments are expected to last. If the expected duration of your payments is less than 10 years, the following IRS rules apply: We must withhold 20% of any amount that you do not transfer for federal income tax. You can instruct us to withhold an amount in addition to the 20% default withholding. We cannot waive withholding or withhold any less than 20%. You are permitted to transfer all or part of your payments to an IRA or eligible employer plan. If the expected duration of your payments is 10 years or more or they are based on life expectancy,3 the following IRS rules apply: We must withhold for federal income tax as if you are married with three dependents. You can instruct us to waive withholding, withhold based on your marital status and allowances, or withhold an additional amount. You are not permitted to transfer any part of your payments to an IRA or eligible employer plan. See the TSP tax notice Important Information About Payments From Your TSP Account for more information. To determine the expected duration of your fixed-dollar- amount payments, we divide your account balance by the amount of your payment: For annual payments: Balance \u00f7 Payment Amount For quarterly payments: (Balance \u00f7 Payment Amount) \u00f7 4 For monthly payments: (Balance \u00f7 Payment Amount) \u00f7 12 We do not consider potential earnings or losses when calculating the expected duration of your payments. The following events will trigger a recalculation of your expected payment duration: You change the dollar amount or frequency of your payments. You transfer money into your TSP account. You take a withdrawal or purchase an annuity in addition to your installment payments. If the recalculation changes the expected payment duration from less than 10 years to 10 years or more, or vice versa, the rules that apply to your payments will change. 3 Payments based on life expectancy are treated the same as fixed-dollar-amount payments lasting 10 years or more, regardless of your age. 4Single Withdrawal You can withdraw any amount of $1,000 or more from your account in a single payment. There is no limit on the number of single withdrawals you can make, but we will not process more than one in any 30-day period. You are allowed to take a single withdrawal of part of your account even if you're currently receiving installment payments. Purchase an Annuity You can use all or part of your TSP account to purchase a life annuity through our outside vendor. Purchasing an annuity means that you pay now to receive monthly payments that last for the rest of your life (or, if you choose a joint life annuity, the life of your joint annuitant). The money you use to purchase a life annuity is no longer managed by you; it's not like your TSP account, an IRA, a CD, or a bank account. You give up your money and the control of it in exchange for guaranteed lifetime monthly payments. If you choose this option, we will purchase an annuity for you from our annuity provider. Your annuity is not part of your TSP account. The minimum for an annuity purchase is $3,500. The minimum applies to your traditional and your Roth balances separately. See the TSP fact sheet Annuities , available at tsp.gov, for more information. Traditional, Roth, or Both If you have both traditional and Roth money in your account, you can specify that your withdrawal should come only from your traditional money or only from your Roth money. This is optional. If you don't specify, then your withdrawal will be made from both types \"pro rata,\" meaning it will have the same percentages of Roth and traditional as are in your account. Example of a pro rata withdrawal: Your total account balance is $150,000, of which $120,000 (80%) is traditional and $30,000 (20%) is Roth. You request a withdrawal of $10,000, and you don't specify traditional or Roth. Your withdrawal will consist of $8,000 (80%) of traditional money and $2,000 (20%) of Roth money. Taxes on TSP Withdrawals Your TSP withdrawal may be subject to federal income taxes. The tax treatment of your withdrawal depends on the type of balance (traditional, Roth, or both) from which your withdrawal is taken as well as the withdrawal method that you choose. For detailed information about the tax rules, read the TSP tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account, available at tsp.gov or by calling the ThriftLine. Special Note for Uniformed Services Members If you have a uniformed services TSP account, or a beneficiary participant account created from your spouse's uniformed services account, your account may include tax-exempt contributions as a result of deployment to a combat zone. These contributions are always exempt from federal income taxes. The tax treatment of earnings on tax-exempt money depends on whether they're in a traditional balance or a Roth balance. Earnings on tax-exempt money in your traditional balance will be subject to tax at the time that you make a withdrawal. The earnings on tax-exempt money in your Roth balance will not be taxed if they are qualified. 4 See the TSP tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account for a detailed explanation. Note: Withdrawals from a uniformed services account traditional balance will be paid pro rata (i.e., proportionally) from taxable and nontaxable amounts. Transferring Your Withdrawal You can transfer part or all of your single withdrawal or eligible installment payments to an IRA or an eligible employer plan (for example, the 401(k) plan of a new employer). Check with the IRA provider or the other plan's administrator to see if it can accept your transfer. Any tax-deferred amounts that are transferred will retain their tax-deferred status until you withdraw your money. Note: You can transfer traditional money to a Roth IRA, but you will have to pay taxes on the amount transferred at the time you transfer it. You cannot transfer Roth money to a traditional IRA since that would result in your paying taxes on the same money twice, once before it went into your Roth TSP and once when you withdraw it from the traditional IRA. 4 Roth earnings become qualified (i.e., paid tax-free) when the following two conditions have been met: (1) 5 years have passed since January 1 of the calendar year in which you made your first Roth contribution and (2) You have reached age 59\u00bd or have a permanent disability or in the case of your death. Note: We cannot certify to the IRS that you meet the Internal Revenue Code's definition of a disability when your taxes are reported. Therefore, you must provide the justification to the IRS when you file your taxes. 5 Transferring tax-exempt TSP balances. Tax-exempt balances resulting from contributions from pay earned in a combat zone may also be transferred or rolled over into an IRA or transferred to an eligible employer plan. Traditional IRAs must certify that they accept tax-exempt money in order for us to make the transfer. We are allowed to transfer tax-exempt money from your account only if you have no taxable money left. If you have some taxable money but not enough to satisfy the percentage that you elected to transfer, we will transfer the taxable money first and then transfer enough tax-exempt money to make up the difference. The tax rules surrounding transfers and rollovers of traditional and Roth balances are complex. For more information, read the TSP tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account. You should also consider speaking with a qualified tax advisor before making your decision. Depositing Your Payment(s) Electronically Any single payment or installment payment that is not transferred directly to an IRA or an eligible employer plan can be sent to your checking or savings account electronically by direct deposit. You can have your payment(s) sent electronically to only one checking or savings account at one financial institution. This is true even if you have traditional and Roth money in your withdrawal. Withdrawal Rules for Rehired Participants If you separate from federal civilian employment or the uniformed services and then are reemployed by the federal government with a break in service of less than 31 full calendar days, you are not eligible to make post-separation withdrawals from your TSP account. If your break in service is 31 or more full calendar days, you are eligible, but not required, to make a post-separation withdrawal, but the withdrawal request must be received and paid while you are still separated from service. Note: If you began receiving TSP installment payments after you separated, those payments will stop if you are subsequently rehired. However, if you are receiving annuity payments, they will continue even though you've been rehired.Single withdrawal. If you have only one type of balance (traditional or Roth) in your single withdrawal, you can direct all or part of it to only one IRA account or eligible employer plan. If you have both traditional and Roth balances in your withdrawal, you can direct all or part of the traditional portion to one IRA or plan, and all or part of the Roth portion of the payment to another IRA or plan (assuming you meet the eligibility requirements of the receiving plan(s)). We will pay any amounts not transferred directly to you either by check or direct deposit. When requesting a transfer, be sure to use the transfer pages provided by the TSP . Do not use forms provided by the new plan or financial institution. TSP installment payments. If your TSP installment payments are eligible, you can choose to have us transfer them to an IRA or eligible employer plan. Your installment payments are eligible if they're expected to last less than 10 years and are not based on life expectancy. See page 3. As with single withdrawals, if you have only one type of balance (traditional or Roth) in your payment, you can direct all or part of your eligible installment payments to only one IRA account or eligible employer plan. If you have both traditional and Roth balances in your payment, you can direct all or part of the traditional portion to one IRA or plan and all or part of the Roth portion of your eligible installment payment to another IRA account or plan (assuming you meet the eligibility requirements of the receiving plan(s)). We will pay any amounts not transferred directly to you either by check or direct deposit. If your plan or financial institution needs us to certify that the money you are transferring is eligible for transfer, you can provide it with a copy of the fact sheet Transfers From the Thrift Savings Plan to Eligible Retirement Plans. It is available at tsp.gov or by calling the ThriftLine. Rolling over your withdrawal. We will pay any amounts not transferred directly to you either by check or direct deposit, and you will be subject to federal tax withholding on any taxable amounts. Within 60 days of receiving payment, you can still send it to an IRA or eligible employer plan. When you make the transaction this way, it's called a rollover. 5 5 T he IRS may waive the 60-day rollover requirement in certain situations if you missed the deadline because of circumstances beyond your control. 6Requesting Your Withdrawal Once you've read this booklet and the TSP tax notice Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account and are ready to request a withdrawal, log into My Account at tsp.gov and click on the \"Withdrawals and Changes to Installment Payments\" link on the menu. From there you'll have access to an online tool with which to start your withdrawal. If you're trying to make a withdrawal as a separated participant, your former agency or service must have given us your separation date before you'll be allowed to proceed with your request. Also, if you have an outstanding TSP loan, the online tool will ask if you want to keep the unpaid balance and have it declared a taxable distribution before allowing you to proceed. If you want to pay off the loan instead, you'll have to do that before requesting a post-separation withdrawal. See the TSP booklet Loans for more information. When you begin your request, you'll be asked whether you intend to withdraw just part of your account or your total account balance. Withdrawing Part of Your Account If you decide to withdraw part of your account and leave the rest in the TSP, you'll be given all of the options described under \"Withdrawal Methods\" beginning on page 2: TSP installment payments, single withdrawal, and annuity purchase. Remember that you can choose any of these three methods or any combination of them. For each method you choose, you'll be asked if you want to withdraw from your traditional balance or your Roth balance. If you choose neither but have both types of balances, the withdrawal will be made pro rata from both. (See page 4.) You'll only be asked this if you have both traditional and Roth money in your account. If you choose installment payments or a single withdrawal, you'll also be asked if you intend to transfer any part of your withdrawal. The online tool will stop you from transferring any ineligible payments. Withdrawing All of Your Account If you choose to withdraw your total account balance, you'll be asked if you want to receive it as a single payment, an annuity purchase, or a combination of the two. (TSP installment payments are not an option since they continue to leave money in your account.)If you elect to receive your total account balance as a single payment or as an annuity purchase, the question of traditional, Roth, or both becomes irrelevant. We'll use all the money you have. But if you ask for a combination of the two methods and have both types of money in your account, you'll be asked if you'd like the annuity to be purchased with only traditional money or only Roth money. The online tool will only ask this if you have both types. If a single payment is part of your withdrawal, you'll be asked if you intend to transfer all or part of it. Additional Information for Transfers and Annuities If you indicate you want to transfer all or part of your withdrawal or purchase an annuity, you'll need to provide additional information. See pages 4 and 5 for more information. Additional Options for Your Withdrawal Request At the time you request your withdrawal, you'll be able to request direct deposit and change the default federal tax withholding rate for any payment made directly to you. Finalizing Your Request When you've completed your online request, you'll be asked to submit it online if possible. If your signature or your spouse's signature is required, you're purchasing an annuity, or you're transferring any part of your withdrawal, you won't be able to complete the process entirely online. You'll be given a summary of your request, which you\u2014and your spouse or financial institution if necessary\u2014will need to sign, have notarized, and then mail or fax to us. When we receive these properly completed pages, we'll be able to complete the transaction you began online. The Timing of Your Withdrawal It generally takes between 7 to 10 business days to process your request once you've properly completed and submitted it. We disburse withdrawals each business day. You can check My Account at tsp.gov or call the ThriftLine to find out the status of your withdrawal request, including whether the payment has been made. We will also notify you after your payment has been disbursed.7Changing Your Withdrawal Election Before payments begin. We process withdrawals each business day. Completed withdrawal requests that are entered into our system by 12:00 noon eastern time are processed that night. This means that there is a very small window of time during which you would be able to cancel your request and submit a new election. Therefore, we recommend that you carefully consider your options before submitting a withdrawal request. After payments begin. You cannot reverse a payment that has already been processed. Also, if you have chosen an annuity, you cannot change either the annuity option or\u2014if you've chosen a joint annuity\u2014your choice of joint annuitant after we have processed your annuity purchase. If you are receiving TSP installment payments. Remember, you can make changes to those payments at any time. See page 3 for details on what changes are allowed. As with your initial withdrawal request, use the online tool that you will find in My Account at tsp.gov by clicking \"Withdrawals and Changes to Installment Payments.\" When you've completed your online request, you'll be asked to submit it online if possible. If your signature or your spouse's signature is required or you're starting or making changes to transfers, you won't be able to complete the process entirely online. You'll be given a summary of your request, which you\u2014and your spouse or financial institution if necessary\u2014will need to sign, have notarized, and then mail or fax to us. When we receive these properly completed pages, we'll be able to complete the transaction you began online. Special Considerations Vesting Requirements Vesting requirements apply only to FERS participants and members of the uniformed services covered by the Blended Retirement System (BRS). They do not apply to CSRS participants, non-BRS uniformed services members, or beneficiary participants. If you are a FERS or BRS participant, you must have served for a certain number of years to be entitled to (or \"vested in\") the Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions in your account and the earnings on those contributions. All years of service in a position eligible for the TSP count toward vesting, even if you don't contribute to the TSP during that time. Most FERS employees become vested in the AgencyAutomatic (1%) Contributions after three years offederal civilian service. FERS employees in congressional and certainnoncareer positions become vested in the AgencyAutomatic (1%) Contributions after completingtwo years of federal civilian service. BRS participants become vested in ServiceAutomatic (1%) Contributions after completing twoyears in the uniformed services. Important: Civilian service does not count toward vesting in a uniformed services (BRS) account, and military service does not count toward vesting in a FERS account. If you leave federal civilian or uniformed service before meeting the vesting requirement for your Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, those contributions and the earnings on them will be removed from your account and forfeited to the TSP before any withdrawals are disbursed. However, if you die before leaving federal service, your entire TSP account will automatically become vested. FERS and BRS participants are always vested in their own contributions (and the earnings on them) and the matching contributions their agencies or services make (and the earnings on those contributions). CSRS participants and non-BRS uniformed services participants are always vested in all the money in their accounts since they do not include Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions. Spouses' Rights The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, which created the TSP, provides certain rights to spouses of participants. These rules do not apply to beneficiary participants. If you are a married FERS, CSRS, or uniformed services participant (even if you are separated from your spouse), you are subject to certain spouses' rights requirements, as explained below. If you are a married FERS or uniformed servicesparticipant with a total TSP account balanceof more than $3,500, your spouse is entitledby law to a prescribed survivor annuity. This isa joint life annuity with a 50% survivor benefit,level payments, and no cash refund feature. If youchoose any other annuity, any other withdrawal8option, or any combination of options, your spouse must provide signed, notarized consent for the withdrawal to be processed. This is also true if you request a change in the amount or frequency of installment payments since this could affect the amount available for an annuity. If you are a married CSRS participant with a total TSP account balance of more than $3,500, we must notify your spouse of your withdrawal. This is also true if you request a change in the amount or frequency of installment payments since this could affect the amount available for an annuity. Exceptions. Under certain circumstances, exceptions may be made to the TSP's spouses' rights requirements. The conditions under which these exceptions are granted are very strict. To obtain more information on the requirements for an exception\u2014or apply for an exception\u2014use Form TSP-16, Exception to Spousal Requirements (TSP-U-16 for members of the uniformed services). Account Holds Some situations may cause a hold to be placed on your account. Examples include the following: A court order that awards all or part of a TSP account to a current or former spouse (including a separated spouse). A legal process that enforces obligations to pay child support or alimony, or to satisfy judgments for child abuse. A federal tax levy. A criminal restitution order pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA). A hold we place on your account because of suspected fraud. A hold you request to protect your account. A hold we place on your account for administrative reasons such as account corrections or adjustments. Your withdrawal request will not be accepted until the matter that caused the hold is settled and the hold is removed from your account. However, any required minimum distributions will be disbursed by the appropriate deadline. For more information about court orders, obtain the booklet Court Orders and Powers of Attorney and the TSP tax notice Tax Treatment of Thrift Savings Plan Payments Made Under Qualifying Orders. Both are available at tsp.gov. Death Benefits If you die with a balance in your TSP account and you did not designate beneficiaries for that account, the account will be distributed according to a statutory order of precedence. If you want your account to be distributed in some other way, you may use Form TSP-3, Designation of Beneficiary. For us to honor it, a valid Form TSP-3 must be on file with us at the time of your death. We cannot honor a will or any other document. See the booklet Death Benefits Information for Participants and Beneficiaries for more information, including the statutory order of precedence. Required Minimum Distributions If you are a separated participant, the Internal Revenue Code requires that you receive a portion of your TSP account (your \"required minimum distribution\" or \"RMD\") beginning in the calendar year when you become age 70\u00bd and are separated from service. If you are a beneficiary participant, your deadline for beginning to receive required minimum distributions depends on whether your spouse died before or after his or her required beginning date. Any withdrawals you make while subject to RMDs will be used to satisfy the requirement. If the total amount of your withdrawals does not satisfy the requirement, we will issue a supplemental payment for the remaining amount before the deadline each year. If we automatically send you an RMD because you did not withdraw a sufficient amount and you have both traditional and Roth balances in your TSP account, the automatic RMD will be taken proportionally from each balance. Required minimum distributions cannot be transferred or rolled over. This means that if you make a withdrawal of any kind in a year that you are subject to an RMD and you request a transfer of all or any portion of that withdrawal, we will first calculate and distribute any RMD amount due directly to you before making a transfer. For detailed rules regarding required minimum distributions, see the TSP tax notice Important Tax Information About Your TSP Withdrawal and Required Minimum Distributions . Or, for beneficiary participants, see Tax Information About TSP Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions for Beneficiary Participants .9Participants with Two TSP Accounts Some TSP participants (e.g., members of the Ready Reserve) may have two separate TSP accounts\u2014a federal civilian account and a uniformed services account. If you are one of these participants and you separate from either federal civilian employment or the uniformed services, you may make post-separation withdrawals only from the TSP account related to the type of employment from which you have separated. Once you have separated, you will also have the option of combining your two accounts into one. However, you can only combine the account related to your separation into your other TSP account. For example, if you are separated from the uniformed services, you can transfer your uniformed services account into your civilian account. If you have separated from both federal civilian employment and the uniformed services, you can choose which account you want to keep and combine the other one with it. To combine civilian and uniformed services TSP accounts, use Form TSP-65, Request to Combine Civilian and Uniformed Services TSP Accounts. This is only allowed up to the end of the calendar year before the year you turn 70\u00bd. Note: If the traditional portion of your uniformed services TSP account includes a tax-exempt balance, you cannot transfer it into your civilian TSP account. Therefore, you will need to retain your uniformed services account to hold your tax-exempt money until you wish to withdraw it. It will continue to accrue tax-deferred earnings until you withdraw it. Any tax-exempt money that was contributed to your Roth balance can be transferred into your civilian TSP account. TSP beneficiary participant accounts may not be combined with other TSP beneficiary participant accounts. However, if you have your own TSP account because you are or were a federal civilian employee or a member of the uniformed services, you may transfer your beneficiary participant account into that account. You cannot move your civilian or uniformed services account into your beneficiary participant account. Reporting Changes in Personal Information Be sure to keep us informed of any changes in your mailing address or other personal information that we maintain. Otherwise, you may not receive your participant statements and other important mailings, including installment and RMD checks. If you close your account, you should also inform us of any address change through the January of the following year, so that you will receive tax reporting information about your withdrawal. Before you separate, your agency or service is responsible for updating your personal information for your TSP account. After separating, you must make any changes to your personal information in the My Account section of tsp.gov.This page is intentionally left blank.11 Glossary of Terms Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions \u2014 Contributions equal to 1% of basic pay each pay period, contributed to a FERS or BRS participant's TSP account by his or her agency/service.
