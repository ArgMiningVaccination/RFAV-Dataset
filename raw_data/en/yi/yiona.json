Acute hearing loss and tinnitus Carpal tunnel and related neuropathy 1 1 Asthma, bronchitis or respiratory hypersensitivity reactions Raynaud' s phenomenon 1 1 Severe skin disorder d. Agriculturally r elated injuries (work- or non-work-r elated). e. Heavy metal poisonings. (1) Lead poisoning. All analytical values for blood lead analysis shall be reported to the department. Analytical values less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (mg/dL) may be reported as less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (mg/dL) rather than as the actual value. In addition to the analytical value, the following information shall be reported to the department: the date of sample collection, whether the sample is a capillary or venous blood sample, the date of birth and the address of the patient, the name and address of the patient' s physician, analytical method used for the analysis, lower quantitation limit of the analytical method, and the quality assurance/quality control values associated with the analysis. (2) Mercury poisonings. 1. Blood mercury values equal to or greater than 2.8 mcg/dL. 2. Urine mercury values equal to or greater than 20 mcg/L. (3) Arsenic poisonings. 1.

Pesticide poisonings. (1) Or ganophosphate and carbamate cholinesterase inhibiting pesticides. In using a given analytic method to measure cholinesterase inhibition, measurement techniques often vary among laboratories. For this reason, when a depressed cholinesterase value is found, in addition to reporting the items specified in rule 641\u20141.3(139A), each laboratory shall provide to the Iowa department of public health evidence of the rational bases upon which the laboratory identified the reported value as depressed. For example, for nonautomated analytic methods, a laboratory may judge that a cholinesterase value is depressed on the basis of the value falling below two standard deviations from the mean value for tests IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 1, p. 5 completed by that laboratory on the general unexposed population. For automated methods, such as automated spectrophotometry , for which there are built-in quality control procedures and appropriate literature for determining normality , the laboratory should judge a value as depressed on the basis of such appropriate literature. In all instances, clinical laboratories shall report any test finding which shows a 25 percent depression in red blood cell, plasma or whole blood cholinesterase from preexposure levels. (2) Other pesticide poisonings. Any herbicide, or ganochlorine insecticide or metabolite thereof in a clinical specimen taken from a person with a history of overexposure to such pesticides within the 48 hours previous to collection of the specimen.

Nitrate poisonings. Blood analyses showing greater than 5 percent of total hemoglobin present as methemoglobin. h. T oxic hepatitis. In cases where a laboratory has been made aware of a prolonged or possible overexposure to and any abnormal liver tissue biopsy findings which would be attributable to such exposure. If a laboratory has no information on the exposure history of a person, but that person' s liver biopsy findings are consistent with exposure to these chemicals, then a laboratory is encouraged, but not required, to report such findings. i. Noncommunicable r espiratory illnesses. Any biopsy of lung tissue indicating prolonged exposure or overexposure to asbestos, silica, silicates, aluminum, graphite, bauxite, beryllium, cotton dust or other textile material, or coal dust. j.

[Filed emer Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 Appendix A P e d i a t r i c A u d i o l o g i c D i a g n o s t i c P r o t o c o l The following protocol should be used to facilitate the diagnosis of hearing loss by three months of age and entry into early intervention for infants with hearing loss by six months of age. This diagnostic protocol should be implemented by an audiologist licensed by the Iowa board of speech pathology and audiology examiners or certified by the Iowa board of educational examiners. Infants should be referred for a diagnostic evaluation after receiving a \"refer\" result from one or both ears on a newborn hearing screening and a hearing rescreen performed at two to six weeks of age. T imely referral for diagnostic auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing may negate the need for sedation for this test in very young infants. Infants who are identified at risk for late-onset hearing loss (JCIH, 2000) should receive audiologic monitoring and follow-up by age-appropriate test procedures at six-month intervals until the age of five years. Audiologic diagnostic centers should be pr epar ed to pr ovide the following services: I. Measures of auditory sensitivity A. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) Infants who do not pass the newborn hearing screening or rescreen should be evaluated with a click-evoked air -conduction ABR and at least one low-frequency tone burst ABR, preferably at 500 Hz. Response waveforms should be measured at several levels to allow threshold determination and latency-intensity functions. When thresholds are determined to be elevated, the audiologist may measure the ABR with frequency-specific stimuli at other frequencies as well. Infants suspected of having significant conductive hearing loss should be considered for bone-conduction ABR testing. Clinicians should be aware that technological advances will continually improve recommended protocols. B. Evoked otoacoustic emissions T ransient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) or distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) should be used to confirm the magnitude and configuration of the hearing loss as determined by the ABR. C. Behavioral measures At a developmental age of six months or older , it is possible to obtain reliable behavioral audiometric information using visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). While this test has traditionally been performed in the sound field, ear -specific threshold information can be obtained using insert earphones. VRA is an important technique for use in monitoring auditory thresholds, especially during the first few years of hearing aid use. II. Measures of middle ear function A. T ympanometry Although pass/fail criteria for tympanograms from infants younger than six months of age are currently being developed, an infant audiologic evaluation should include an admittance tympanogram at 1000 Hz to help determine middle ear function. B. Acoustic reflexes Ipsilateral or contralateral acoustic reflexes should be measured at a minimum of two activator frequencies (1000 and 2000 Hz) at a probe tone of 800 or 1000 Hz.

Ch 28, p. 2 Public Health[641] Health[641] Ch 28, p. 3 OBJECTION At its February 6, 2009 meeting the Administrative Rules Review Committee voted two separate objections to certain provisions of ARC 7516B relating to plumbing and mechanical systems licensure. This filing appears in IAB V ol. XXXI, No. 15 (01-14-09). The committee takes this action pursuant to the authority of \u00a717A.4(5). The committee objects to paragraphs 28.1(2)\"d\" and (3)\"d\" relating to the total fee for combined licenses. Committee members believe that it is unreasonable, and imposes an unnecessary hardship, to char ge the face value of each license for individuals who need combined licenses. The committee also objects to paragraph 28.1(10) which imposes a twenty-five dollar surchar ge for applicants who file paper applications instead of electronic. Committee members believe that it is unreasonable to impose a penalty on individuals who may not have access to, or have the expertise to use internet-based application and payment procedures.

Introduction. An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable assurance of the availability of funds for decommissioning based on obtaining a parent company guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs and on a demonstration that the parent company passes a financial test. This appendix establishes criteria for passing the financial test and for obtaining the parent company guarantee. II. Financial T est. A. T o pass the financial test, the parent company must meet the criteria of either paragraph A.1 or A.2 of this section: 1. The parent company must have: (1) T wo of the following three ratios: A ratio of total liabilities to net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and (2) Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six times the current decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if a certification is used); and (3) T angible net worth of at least $10 million; and (4) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the current decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if a certification is used). 2. The parent company must have: (1) A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor ' s or Aaa, Aa, or Baa as issued by Moody' s; and (2) T angible net worth at least six times the current decommissioning cost estimate (or prescribed amount if a certification is used); and (3) T angible net worth of at least $10 million; and (4) Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90 percent of total assets or at least six times the current decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if a certification is used). B. The parent company' s independent certified public accountant must have compared the data used by the parent company in the financial test, which is derived from the independently audited, year -end financial statements for the latest fiscal year , with the amounts in such financial statement. In connection with that procedure the licensee shall inform BRH within 90 days or any matters coming to the auditor ' s attention which cause the auditor to believe that the data specified in the financial test should be adjusted and that the company no longer passes the test. C.1. After the initial financial test, the parent company must repeat the passage of the test within 90 days after the close of each succeeding fiscal year . 2. If the parent company no longer meets the requirements of paragraph A of this section, the licensee must send notice to the BRH of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in BRH rules. The notice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which the year -end financial data show that the parent company no longer meets the financial test requirements. The licensee must provide alternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year . III. Parent Company Guarantee. The terms of a parent company guarantee which an applicant or licensee obtains must provide that: A. The parent company guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the licensee and the BRH. Cancellation may not occur , however , during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the licensee and BRH, as evidenced by the return receipts. IAC 7/29/09 Public Health[641] Ch 39, p. 59 B. If the licensee fails to provide alternate financial assurance as specified in BRH rules within 90 days after receipt by the licensee and BRH notice of cancellation of the parent company guarantee from the guarantor , the guarantor will provide such alternative financial assurance in the name of the licensee. C. The parent company guarantee and financial test provisions must remain in ef fect until the BRH has terminated the license. D.

IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 1 CHAPTER 40 ST ANDARDS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST RADIA TION GENERAL PROVISIONS 641\u201440.1 (136C) Purpose and scope. 40.1(1) This chapter establishes standards for protection against ionizing radiation resulting from activities conducted pursuant to licenses or registrations issued by the agency . These rules are issued pursuant to the authority in Iowa Code section 136C.3 and 136C.4. 40.1(2) The requirements of this chapter are designed to control the receipt, possession, use, transfer , and disposal of sources of radiation by any licensee or registrant so the total dose to an individual, including doses resulting from all sources of radiation other than background radiation, does not exceed the standards for protection against radiation prescribed in this chapter . However , nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting actions that may be necessary to protect health and safety . 40.1(3) In addition to complying with the requirements set forth in this chapter , every reasonable ef fort should be made to maintain radiation exposures and releases of radioactive material in ef fluents to unrestricted areas as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). The term \"as low as is reasonably achievable\" means as low as is reasonably achievable taking into account the state of technology and the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and safety , other societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in relation to the utilization of ionizing radiation in the public interest. 40.1(4) Except as specifically provided in other parts of these rules, this chapter applies to persons licensed or registered by the agency to receive, possess, use, transfer , or dispose of sources of radiation. The limits in this chapter do not apply to doses due to background radiation, to exposure of patients to radiation for the purpose of medical diagnosis or therapy , or to voluntary participation in medical research programs. 40.1(5) All references to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in this chapter are those in ef fect on or before July 9, 2008. 40.1(6) The provisions of Chapter 40 are in addition to, and not in substitution for , any other applicable portions of 641\u2014Chapters 38 to 45. 641\u201440.2 (136C) Definitions. 40.2(1) For the purposes of this chapter , the definitions of 641\u2014Chapter 38 may also apply . 40.2(2) As used in this chapter , these terms have the definitions set forth below . \"Annual limit on intake (ALI)\" means the derived limit for the amount of radioactive material taken into the body of an adult worker by inhalation or ingestion in a year . ALI is the smaller value of intake of a given radionuclide in a year by the reference person that would result in a committed ef fective dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv) or a committed dose equivalent of 50 rem (0.5 Sv) to any individual or gan or tissue. ALI values for intake by ingestion and by inhalation of selected radionuclides are given in T able I, Columns 1 and 2, of Appendix B. \"Class (or lung class or inhalation class)\" means a classification scheme for inhaled material according to its rate of clearance from the pulmonary region of the lung. Materials are classified as D, W , or Y , which applies to a range of clearance half-times: for Class D, Days, of less than 10 days, for Class W , W eeks, from 10 to 100 days, and for Class Y , Y ears, of greater than 100 days. \"Declar ed pr egnant woman\" means a woman who has voluntarily informed her licensee or registrant, in writing, of her pregnancy and the estimated date of conception. The declaration remains in ef fect until the declared pregnant woman withdraws the declaration in writing or is no longer pregnant. \"Derived air concentration (DAC)\" means the concentration of a given radionuclide in air which, if breathed by the reference person for a working year of 2,000 hours under conditions of light work (inhalation rate 1.2 cubic meters of air per hour) results in an intake of one ALI. DAC values are given in T able I, Column 3, of Appendix B. \"Derived air concentration-hour (DAC-hour)\" means the product of the concentration of radioactive material in air , expressed as a fraction or multiple of the derived air concentration for each Ch 40, p. 2 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 radionuclide, and the time of exposure to that radionuclide, in hours. A licensee or registrant may take 2,000 DAC-hours to represent one ALI, equivalent to a committed dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv). \"Dosimetry pr ocessor\" means an individual or an or ganization that processes and evaluates individual monitoring devices in order to determine the radiation dose delivered to the monitoring devices. \"Inhalation class\" (see \"Class.\") \"Lung class\" (see \"Class.\") \"National tracked sour ce\" means a sealed source containing a quantity equal to or greater than Category 1 or Category 2 levels of any radioactive material listed in Appendix H of this chapter . In this context a \"sealed source\" is defined as radioactive material that is sealed in a capsule or closely bonded in a solid form and that is not exempt from regulatory control. It does not mean material encapsulated solely for disposal, or nuclear material contained in any fuel assembly , subassembly , fuel rod, or fuel pellet. Category 1 nationally tracked sources are those containing radioactive material at a quantity equal to or greater than the Category 1 threshold. Category 2 nationally tracked sources are those containing radioactive material at a quantity equal to or greater than the Category 2 threshold but less than the Category 1 threshold. \"Nonstochastic effect\" means a health ef fect, the severity of which varies with the dose and for which a threshold is believed to exist. Radiation-induced cataract formation is an example of a nonstochastic ef fect. For purposes of these rules, \"deterministic is an equivalent term. \"Planned special exposur e\" means an infrequent exposure to radiation, separate from and in addition to the annual occupational dose limits. \"Quarter\" means a period of time equal to one-fourth of the year observed by the licensee, approximately 13 consecutive weeks, providing that the beginning of the first quarter in a year coincides with the starting date of the year and that no day is omitted or duplicated in consecutive quarters. \"Refer ence person\" means a hypothetical aggregation of human physical and physiological characteristics determined by international consensus. These characteristics may be used by researchers and public health workers to standardize results of experiments and to relate biological insult to a common base. A description of the reference person is contained in the International Commission on Radiological Protection report, ICRP Publication 23, \"Report of the T ask Group on Reference Man.\" \"Respiratory pr otective equipment\" means an apparatus, such as a respirator , used to reduce an individual' s intake of airborne radioactive materials. \"Sanitary sewerage\" means a system of public sewers for carrying of f wastewater and refuse, but excluding sewage treatment facilities, septic tanks, and leach fields owned or operated by the licensee or registrant. \"Stochastic effect\" means a health ef fect that occurs randomly and for which the probability of the ef fect occurring, rather than its severity , is assumed to be a linear function of dose without threshold. Hereditary ef fects and cancer incidence are examples of stochastic ef fects. For purposes of these rules, is an equivalent term. \"W eighting factor\" w T for an or gan or tissue (T) means the proportion of the risk of stochastic ef fects resulting from irradiation of that or gan or tissue to the total risk of stochastic ef fects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly . For calculating the ef fective dose equivalent, the values of w T are: ORGAN DOSE WEIGHTING F ACT ORS Or gan or T issue w T Gonads 0.25 Breast 0.15 Red bone marrow 0.12 Lung 0.12 Thyroid 0.03 Bone surfaces 0.03 IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 3 ORGAN DOSE WEIGHTING F ACT ORS Or gan or T issue w T Remainder 0.30 a Whole Body 1.00 b a 0.30 results from 0.06 for each of 5 \"remainder\" or gans, excluding the skin and the lens of the eye, that receive the highest doses. b For the purpose of weighting the external whole body dose, for adding it to the internal dose, a single weighting factor , w T = 1.0, has been specified. The use of other weighting factors for external exposure will be approved on a case-by-case basis until such time as specific guidance is issued. 641\u201440.3 (136C) Implementation. 40.3(1) Any existing license or registration condition that is more restrictive than this chapter remains in force until there is an amendment or renewal of the license or registration. 40.3(2) If a license or registration condition exempts a licensee or registrant from a provision of this chapter in ef fect on or before January 1, 1994, it also exempts the licensee or registrant from the corresponding provision of this chapter . 40.3(3) If a license or registration condition cites provisions of this chapter in ef fect prior to January 1, 1994, which do not correspond to any provisions of this chapter , the license or registration condition remains in force until there is an amendment or renewal of the license or registration that modifies or removes this condition. 641\u201440.4 to 40.9 Reserved. RADIA TION PROTECTION PROGRAMS 641\u201440.10 (136C) pr otection pr ograms. 40.10(1) Each licensee or registrant shall develop, document, and implement a radiation protection program suf ficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter . See 40.81(136C) for record-keeping requirements relating to these programs. 40.10(2) The licensee or registrant shall use, to the extent practical, procedures and engineering controls based upon sound radiation protection principles to achieve occupational doses and public doses that are as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). 40.10(3) The licensee or registrant shall, at intervals not to exceed 12 months, review the radiation protection program content and implementation. 40.10(4) T o implement the ALARA requirements of 40.10(2), and notwithstanding the requirements in 641\u201440.26(136C), a constraint on air emissions of radioactive material to the environment, excluding radon-222 and its daughters, shall be established by licensees such that the individual member of the public likely to receive the highest dose will not be expected to receive a total ef fective dose equivalent in excess of 10 mrem (0.1 mSv) per year from these emissions. If a licensee subject to this requirement exceeds this dose constraint, the licensee shall report the exceedance as provided in 641\u201440.97(136C) and promptly take appropriate corrective action to ensure against recurrence. 641\u201440.1 1 to 40.14 Reserved. OCCUP A TIONAL DOSE LIMITS 641\u201440.15 (136C) Occupational dose limits for adults. 40.15(1) The licensee or registrant shall control the occupational dose to individual adults, except for planned special exposures pursuant to 40.20(136C), to the following dose limits: a. An annual limit, which is the more limiting of: (1) The total ef fective dose equivalent being equal to 5 rem (0.05 Sv); or Ch 40, p. 4 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 (2) The sum of the deep dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual or gan or tissue other than the lens of the eye being equal to 50 rem (0.5 Sv). b. The annual limits to the lens of the eye, to the skin of the whole body , and to the skin of the extremities which are: (1) A lens dose equivalent of 15 rem (0.15 Sv), and (2) A shallow dose equivalent of 50 rem (0.5 Sv) to the skin of the whole body or to the skin of any extremity . 40.15(2) Doses received in excess of the annual limits, including doses received during accidents, emer gencies, and planned special exposures, shall be subtracted from the limits for planned special exposures that the individual may receive during the current year and during the individual' s lifetime. See 40.20(5) \"a\" and \"b.\" 40.15(3) The assigned deep dose equivalent must be for the portion of the body receiving the highest exposure. The assigned shallow-dose equivalent must be the dose averaged over the contiguous 10 square centimeters of skin receiving the highest exposure. The deep dose equivalent, lens dose equivalent and shallow dose equivalent may be assessed from surveys or other radiation measurements for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the occupational dose limits, if the individual monitoring device was not in the region of highest potential exposure, or the results of individual monitoring are unavailable. 40.15(4) Derived air concentration (DAC) and annual limit on intake (ALI) values are presented in T able I of Appendix B and may be used to determine the individual' s dose and to demonstrate compliance with the occupational dose limits. See 40.86(136C). 40.15(5) Notwithstanding the annual dose limits, the licensee shall limit the soluble uranium intake by an individual to 10 milligrams in a week in consideration of chemical toxicity . See footnote 3 of Appendix B. 40.15(6) The licensee or registrant shall reduce the dose that an individual may be allowed to receive in the current year by the amount of occupational dose received while employed by any other person. See 40.19(5). 641\u201440.16 (136C) Compliance with r equir ements for summation of external and internal doses. 40.16(1) If the licensee or registrant is required to monitor pursuant to both 40.19(1) and 40.19(2), the licensee or registrant shall demonstrate compliance with the dose limits by summing external and internal doses. If the licensee or registrant is required to monitor only pursuant to 40.19(1), or only pursuant to 40.19(2), then summation is not required to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits. The licensee or registrant may demonstrate compliance with the requirements for summation of external and internal doses pursuant to 40.16(2), 40.16(3) and 40.16(4). The dose equivalents for the lens of the eye, the skin, and the extremities are not included in the summation, but are subject to separate limits. 40.16(2) Intake by inhalation. If the only intake of radionuclides is by inhalation, the total ef fective dose equivalent limit is not exceeded if the sum of the deep dose equivalent divided by the total ef fective dose equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed unity: a. The sum of the fractions of the inhalation ALI for each radionuclide, or b. The total number of derived air concentration-hours (DAC-hours) for all radionuclides divided by 2,000, or c. The sum of the calculated committed ef fective dose equivalents to all significantly irradiated or gans or tissues (T) calculated from bioassay data using appropriate biological models and expressed as a fraction of the annual limit. For purposes of this requirement, an or gan or tissue is deemed to be significantly irradiated if, for that or gan or tissue, the product of the weighting factors, w T , and the committed dose equivalent, H T , 5 0 , per unit intake is greater than 10 percent of the maximum weighted value of H 5 0 , that is, w T H T , 5 0 , per unit intake for any or gan or tissue. 40.16(3) Intake by oral ingestion. If the occupationally exposed individual also receives an intake of radionuclides by oral ingestion greater than 10 percent of the applicable oral ALI, the licensee shall account for this intake and include it in demonstrating compliance with the limits. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 5 40.16(4) Intake through wounds or absorption through skin. The licensee shall evaluate and, to the extent practical, account for intakes through wounds or skin absorption. The intake through intact skin has been included in the calculation of DAC for hydrogen-3 and does not need to be evaluated or accounted for pursuant to this subrule. 641\u201440.17 (136C) Determination of external dose fr om airborne radioactive material. 40.17(1) Licensees shall, when determining the dose from airborne radioactive material, include the contribution to the deep dose equivalent, lens dose equivalent, and shallow dose equivalent from external exposure to the radioactive cloud. See Appendix B, footnotes 1 and 2. 40.17(2) Airborne radioactivity measurements and DAC values shall not be used as the primary means to assess the deep dose equivalent when the airborne radioactive material includes radionuclides other than noble gases or if the cloud of airborne radioactive material is not relatively uniform. The determination of the deep dose equivalent to an individual shall be based upon measurements using instruments or individual monitoring devices. 641\u201440.18 (136C) Determination of internal exposur e. 40.18(1) For purposes of assessing dose used to determine compliance with occupational dose equivalent limits, the licensee shall, when required pursuant to 40.37(136C), take suitable and timely measurements of: a. Concentrations of radioactive materials in air in work areas; or b. Quantities of radionuclides in the body; or c. Quantities of radionuclides excreted from the body; or d. Combinations of these measurements. 40.18(2) Unless respiratory protective equipment is used, as provided in 40.50(136C), or the assessment of intake is based on bioassays, the licensee shall assume that an individual inhales radioactive material at the airborne concentration in which the individual is present. 40.18(3) When specific information on the physical and biochemical properties of the radionuclides taken into the body or the behavior of the material in an individual is known, the licensee may: a. Use that information to calculate the committed ef fective dose equivalent, and, if used, the licensee shall document that information in the individual' s record; and b. Upon prior approval of the agency , adjust the DAC or ALI values to reflect the actual physical and chemical characteristics of airborne radioactive material, for example, aerosol size distribution or density; and c. Separately assess the contribution of fractional intakes of Class D, W , or Y compounds of a given radionuclide to the committed ef fective dose equivalent. See Appendix B. 40.18(4) If the licensee chooses to assess intakes of Class Y material using the measurements given in 40.8(1) \"b\" or 40.8(1) \"c,\" the licensee may delay the recording and reporting of the assessments for periods up to seven months, unless otherwise required by 40.96(136C) or 40.97(136C). This delay permits the licensee to make additional measurements basic to the assessments. 40.18(5) If the identity and concentration of each radionuclide in a mixture are known, the fraction of the DAC applicable to the mixture for use in calculating DAC-hours shall be either: a. The sum of the ratios of the concentration to the appropriate DAC value, that is, D, W , or Y , from Appendix B for each radionuclide in the mixture; or b. The ratio of the total concentration for all radionuclides in the mixture to the most restrictive DAC value for any radionuclide in the mixture. 40.18(6) If the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture is known, but the concentration of one or more of the radionuclides in the mixture is not known, the DAC for the mixture shall be the most restrictive DAC of any radionuclide in the mixture. 40.18(7) When a mixture of radionuclides in air exists, a licensee may disregard certain radionuclides in the mixture if: a. The licensee uses the total activity of the mixture in demonstrating compliance with the dose limits in 40.15(136C) and in complying with the monitoring requirements in 40.37(136C), and Ch 40, p. 6 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 b. The concentration of any radionuclide disregarded is less than 10 percent of its DAC, and c. The sum of these percentages for all of the radionuclides disregarded in the mixture does not exceed 30 percent. 40.18(8) When determining the committed ef fective dose equivalent, the following information may be considered: a. In order to calculate the committed ef fective dose equivalent, the licensee or registrant may assume that the inhalation of one ALI, or an exposure of 2,000 DAC-hours, results in a committed ef fective dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv) for radionuclides that have their ALIs or DACs based on the committed ef fective dose equivalent. b. For an ALI and the associated DAC determined by the nonstochastic or gan dose limit of 50 rem (0.5 Sv), the intake of radionuclides that would result in a committed ef fective dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv), that is, the stochastic ALI, is listed in parentheses in T able I of Appendix B. The licensee or registrant may , as a simplifying assumption, use the stochastic ALI to determine committed ef fective dose equivalent. However , if the licensee or registrant uses the stochastic ALI, the licensee or registrant shall also demonstrate that the limit in 40.15(1) \"a\" (2) is met. 641\u201440.19 (136C) Determination of prior occupational dose. 40.19(1) For each individual who is likely to receive, in a year , an occupational dose requiring monitoring pursuant to this rule, the licensee or registrant shall: a. Determine the occupational radiation dose received during the current year; and b. Attempt to obtain the records of lifetime cumulative occupational radiation dose. 40.19(2) Prior to permitting an individual to participate in a planned special exposure, the licensee or registrant shall determine: a. The internal and external doses from all previous planned special exposures; and b. All doses in excess of the limits, including doses received during accidents and emer gencies, received during the lifetime of the individual; and c. All lifetime cumulative occupational radiation dose. 40.19(3) In complying with the requirements of 40.19(1), a licensee or registrant may: a. Accept, as a record of the occupational dose that the individual received during the current year , a written signed statement from the individual, or from the individual' s most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, that discloses the nature and the amount of any occupational dose that the individual received during the current year; and b. Accept, as the record of lifetime cumulative radiation dose, a form signed by the individual and countersigned by an appropriate of ficial of the most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, or the individual' s current employer , if the individual is not employed by the licensee or registrant; and c. Obtain reports of the individual' s dose equivalent from the most recent employer for work involving radiation exposure, or the individual' s current employer , if the individual is not employed by the licensee or registrant, by telephone, telegram, facsimile, or letter . The licensee or registrant shall request a written verification of the dose data if the authenticity of the transmitted report cannot be established. 40.19(4) a. The licensee or registrant shall record the exposure history , as required by 40.37(136C). The form or record shall show each period in which the individual received occupational exposure to radiation or radioactive material and shall be signed by the individual who received the exposure. For each period for which the licensee or registrant obtains reports, the licensee or registrant shall use the dose shown in the report in preparing the exposure history . For any period in which the licensee or registrant does not obtain a report, the licensee or registrant shall place a notation on the report indicating the periods of time for which data are not available. b. Licensees or registrants are not required to reevaluate the separate external dose equivalents and internal committed dose equivalents or intakes of radionuclides assessed pursuant to the rules in this chapter in ef fect on or before January 1, 1994. Further , occupational exposure histories obtained and IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 7 recorded on or before January 1, 1994, would not have included ef fective dose equivalent, but may be used in the absence of specific information on the intake of radionuclides by the individual. 40.19(5) If the licensee or registrant is unable to obtain a complete record of an individual' s current and previously accumulated occupational dose, the licensee or registrant shall assume: a. In establishing administrative controls pursuant to 40.15(6) for the current year , that the allowable dose limit for the individual is reduced by 1.25 rem (12.5 mSv) for each quarter for which records were unavailable and the individual was engaged in activities that could have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and b. That the individual is not available for planned special exposures. 40.19(6) The licensee or registrant shall retain the records in 641\u201440.19(136C) until the agency terminates each pertinent license or registration requiring this record. The licensee or registrant shall retain records used in preparing any record for this subrule for three years after the record is made. 641\u201440.20 (136C) Planned special exposur es. A licensee or registrant may authorize an adult worker to receive doses in addition to and accounted for separately from the doses received under the limits specified in 40.15(136C) provided that each of the following conditions is satisfied: 40.20(1) The licensee or registrant authorizes a planned special exposure only in an exceptional situation when alternatives that might avoid the dose estimated to result from the planned special exposure are unavailable or impractical. 40.20(2) The licensee or registrant, and employer if the employer is not the licensee or registrant, specifically authorizes the planned special exposure, in writing, before the exposure occurs. 40.20(3) Before a planned special exposure, the licensee or registrant ensures that each individual involved is: a. Informed of the purpose of the planned operation; and b. Informed of the estimated doses and associated potential risks and specific radiation levels or other conditions that might be involved in performing the task; and c. Instructed in the measures to be taken to keep the dose ALARA considering other risks that may be present. 40.20(4) Prior to permitting an individual to participate in a planned special exposure, the licensee or registrant ascertains prior doses as required by 40.19(2) during the lifetime of the individual for each individual involved. 40.20(5) Subject to 40.15(2), the licensee or registrant shall not authorize a planned special exposure that would cause an individual to receive a dose from all planned special exposures and all doses in excess of the limits to exceed: a. The numerical values of any of the dose limits in 40.15(1) in any year; and b. Five times the annual dose limits in 40.15(1) during the individual' s lifetime. 40.20(6) The licensee or registrant maintains records of the conduct of a planned special exposure in accordance with 40.85(136C) and submits a written report in accordance with 40.98(136C). 40.20(7) The licensee or registrant records the best estimate of the dose resulting from the planned special exposure in the individual' s record and informs the individual, in writing, of the dose within 30 days from the date of the planned special exposure. The dose from planned special exposures shall not be considered in controlling future occupational dose of the individual pursuant to 40.15(1) but shall be included in evaluations required by 40.20(1) and 40.20(2). 641\u201440.21 (136C) Occupational dose limits for minors. The annual occupational dose limits for minors are 10 percent of the annual dose limits specified for adult workers in 40.15(136C). 641\u201440.22 (136C) Dose equivalent to an embryo/fetus. 40.22(1) The licensee or registrant shall ensure that the dose equivalent to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy , due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 0.5 rem (5 mSv). See 40.86(136C) for record-keeping requirements. Ch 40, p. 8 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 40.22(2) The licensee or registrant shall make ef forts to avoid substantial variation 1 above a uniform monthly exposure rate to a declared pregnant woman so as to satisfy the limit in 40.22(1). 40.22(3) The dose equivalent to an embryo/fetus shall be taken as the sum of: a. The deep dose equivalent to the declared pregnant woman; and b. The dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus from radionuclides in the embryo/fetus and radionuclides in the declared pregnant woman. 40.22(4) If by the time the woman declares pregnancy to the licensee or registrant, the dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus has exceeded 0.5 rem (5 mSv), or is within 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) of this dose, the licensee or registrant shall be deemed to be in compliance with 40.22(1) if the additional dose equivalent to the embryo/fetus does not exceed 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) during the remainder of the pregnancy . 1 The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements recommended in NCRP Report No. 91 \"Recommendations on Limits for Exposure to Ionizing Radiation\" (June 1, 1987) that no more than 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) to the embryo/fetus be received in any one month. 641\u201440.23 to 40.25 Reserved. RADIA TION DOSE LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 641\u201440.26 (136C) Dose limits for individual members of the public. 40.26(1) Each licensee or registrant shall conduct operations so that: a. The total ef fective dose equivalent to individual members of the public from the licensed or registered operation does not exceed 0.1 rem (1 millisievert) in a year , exclusive of the dose contributions from background radiation, from any medical administration the individual has received, from exposure to individuals administered radioactive material and released in accordance with 641\u2014subrule 41.2(27), from voluntary participation in medical research programs, and from the licensee' s or registrant' s disposal of radioactive material into sanitary sewerage under 641\u201440.72(136C); and b. The dose in any unrestricted area from external sources, exclusive of the dose contributions from patients administered radioactive material and released under 641\u2014subrule 41.2(27), does not exceed 0.002 rem (0.02 millisievert) in any one hour . 40.26(2) If the licensee or registrant permits members of the public to have access to controlled areas, the limits for members of the public continue to apply to those individuals. 40.26(3) A licensee, registrant, or an applicant for a license or registration may apply for prior agency authorization to operate up to an annual dose limit for an individual member of the public of 0.5 rem (5 mSv). This application shall include the following information: a. Demonstration of the need for and the expected duration of operations in excess of the limit in 40.26(1); and b. The licensee' s or registrant' s program to assess and control dose within the 0.5 rem (5 mSv) annual limit; and c. The procedures to be followed to maintain the dose ALARA. 40.26(4) In addition to the requirements of this chapter , a licensee or registrant subject to the provisions of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency' s generally applicable environmental radiation standards in 40 CFR 190 shall comply with those standards. 40.26(5) The agency may impose additional restrictions on radiation levels in unrestricted areas and on the total quantity of radionuclides that a licensee or registrant may release in ef fluents in order to restrict the collective dose. 40.26(6) Notwithstanding the requirements of 40.26(1) \"a,\" a licensee may permit visitors to an individual who cannot be released under 641\u2014subrule 41.2(27) to receive a radiation dose greater than 0.1 rem (1 mSv) if: a. The radiation dose received does not exceed 0.5 rem (5 mSv); and b. The authorized user , as defined in 641\u2014subrule 41.2(2), has determined before the visit that it is appropriate. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 9 641\u201440.27 (136C) Compliance with dose limits for individual members of the public. 40.27(1) The licensee or registrant shall make or cause to be made, as appropriate, surveys of radiation levels in unrestricted and controlled areas and radioactive materials in ef fluents released to unrestricted and controlled areas to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits for individual members of the public in 40.26(136C). 40.27(2) A licensee or registrant shall show compliance with the annual dose limit in 40.26(136C) by: a. Demonstrating by measurement or calculation that the total ef fective dose equivalent to the individual likely to receive the highest dose from the licensed or registered operation does not exceed the annual dose limit; or b. Demonstrating that: (1) The annual average concentrations of radioactive material released in gaseous and liquid ef fluents at the boundary of the unrestricted area do not exceed the values specified in T able II of Appendix B; and (2) If an individual were continually present in an unrestricted area, the dose from external sources would not exceed 0.002 rem (0.02 mSv) in an hour and 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) in a year . 40.27(3) Upon approval from the agency , the licensee or registrant may adjust the ef fluent concentration values in Appendix B, T able II, for members of the public, to take into account the actual physical and chemical characteristics of the ef fluents, such as aerosol size distribution, solubility , density , radioactive decay equilibrium, and chemical form. RADIOLOGICAL CRITERIA FOR LICENSE TERMINA TION 641\u201440.28 (136C) Radiological criteria for license termination. 40.28(1) The criteria in this rule apply to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under 641\u2014Chapter 39, and to the release of part of a facility or site for unrestricted use, as well as other facilities subject to the agency' s jurisdiction under Iowa Code chapter 136C. 40.28(2) The criteria in this rule do not apply to sites which: a. Have been decommissioned prior to July 1, 1999, in accordance with criteria identified in 641\u2014subrule 39.4(33). b. Have previously submitted and received agency approval on a license termination plan (L TP) or decommissioning plan that is compatible with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP) Action Plan criteria; or c. Submit a suf ficient L TP or decommissioning plan prior to July 1, 1999, and such L TP or decommissioning plan is approved by the agency prior to July 1, 1999, except that if an environmental impact statement is required in the submittal, there will be a provision for day-to-day extension. 40.28(3) After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this chapter , or after part of a facility or site has been released for unrestricted use in accordance with this chapter , the agency will require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines that the criteria of this chapter were not met and residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant threat to public health and safety . 40.28(4) When calculating TEDE to the average member of the critical group the licensee shall determine the peak annual TEDE dose expected within the first 1000 years after decommissioning. 40.28(5) Public notification and public participation. Upon the receipt of an L TP or decommissioning plan from the licensee or a proposal by the licensee for release of a site pursuant to 40.30(136C) or 40.31(136C) or whenever the agency deems such notice to be in the public interest, the agency shall: a. Notify and solicit comments from: (1) Local and state governments in the vicinity of the site and any Indian nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be af fected by the decommissioning; and Ch 40, p. 10 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 (2) The Environmental Protection Agency for cases where the licensee proposes to release a site pursuant to 40.31(136C). b. Publish a notice in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin and in a forum, such as local newspapers, letters to state or local or ganizations, or other appropriate forum, that is readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of the site, and solicit comments from af fected parties. 40.28(6) Minimization of contamination. Applicants for licenses, other than renewals, after July 1, 1999, shall describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize, to the extent practicable, contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize, to the extent practicable, the generation of radioactive waste. 641\u201440.29 (136C) Radiological criteria for unr estricted use. A site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to an average member of the critical group that does not exceed 25 mrem (0.25 mSv) per year , including that from groundwater sources of drinking water , and the residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are ALARA. Determination of the levels which are ALARA must take into account consideration of any detriments, such as deaths from transportation accidents, expected to potentially result from decontamination and waste disposal. 641\u201440.30 (136C) Criteria for license termination under r estricted conditions. A site will be considered acceptable for license termination under restricted conditions if: 40.30(1) The licensee can demonstrate that reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the provisions of 40.29(136C) would result in net public or environmental harm or were not being made because the residual levels associated with restricted conditions are ALARA. Determination of the levels which are ALARA must take into account consideration of any detriments, such as traf fic accidents, expected to potentially result from decontamination and waste disposal; 40.30(2) The licensee has made provisions for legally enforceable institutional controls that provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 25 mrem (0.25 mSv) per year; 40.30(3) The licensee has provided suf ficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party , including a governmental custodian of a site, to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms are: a. Funds placed into an account segregated from the licensee' s assets and outside the licensee' s administrative control as described in 641\u2014subparagraph 39.4(26) \"f\" (1); b. Surety method, insurance or other guarantee method as described in 641\u2014subparagraph 39.4(26) \"f\" (2); c. A statement of intent in the case of federal, state, or local government licensees, as described in 641\u2014subparagraph 39.4(26) \"f\" (4); or d. When a governmental entity is assuming custody and ownership of a site, an arrangement that is deemed acceptable by such governmental entity . 40.30(4) The licensee has submitted a decommissioning plan or license termination plan (L TP) to the agency indicating the licensee' s intent to decommission in accordance with 641\u2014paragraph 39.4(33) \"d\" and specifying that the licensee intends to decommission by restricting use of the site. The licensee shall document in the L TP or decommissioning plan how the advice of individuals and institutions in the community , who may be af fected by the decommissioning, has been sought and incorporated, as appropriate, following analysis of that advice. Licensees proposing to decommission by restricting use of the site shall seek advice from such af fected parties regarding the following matters concerning the proposed decommissioning: a. Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee: (1) W ill provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 25 mrem (0.25 mSv) per year; (2) W ill be enforceable; and IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 1 1 (3) W ill not impose undue burdens on the local community or other af fected parties. b. Whether the licensee has provided suf ficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party , including a governmental custodian of a site, to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; c. In seeking advice on the issues identified in 40.30(4) \"a,\" the licensee shall provide for: (1) Participation by representatives of a broad cross section of community interests who may be af fected by the decommissioning; (2) An opportunity for a comprehensive, collective discussion of the issues by the participants represented; and (3) A publicly available summary of the results of all such discussions, including a description of the individual viewpoints of the participants on the issues and the extent of agreement and disagreement among the participants on the issues; and 40.30(5) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the institutional controls were no longer in ef fect, there is reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group is as low as reasonably achievable and would not exceed either: a. 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year; or b. 500 mrem (5 mSv) per year provided the licensee: (1) Demonstrates that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 100 mrem/yr (1 mSv/yr) value of 40.30(5) \"a\" are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public or environmental harm; (2) Makes provisions for durable institutional controls; and (3) Provides suf ficient financial assurance to enable a responsible government entity or independent third party , including a governmental custodian of a site, both to carry out periodic rechecks of the site no less frequently than every five years to ensure that the institutional controls remain in place as necessary to meet the criteria of 40.30(2) and to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary controls and maintenance of those controls. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms are those in subrule 40.30(3). 641\u201440.31 (136C) Alternate criteria for license termination. 40.31(1) The agency may terminate a license using alternate criteria greater than the dose criterion of 641\u201440.29(136C), 40.30(2) and 40.30(4) \"a\" (1) if the licensee: a. Provides assurance that public health and safety would continue to be protected and that it is unlikely that the dose from all man-made sources combined, other than medical, would be more than the 100 mrem/yr (1 mSv/yr) by submitting an analysis of possible sources of exposure; b. Has employed, to the extent practical, restrictions on site use according to the provisions of 641\u201440.30(136C) in minimizing exposures at the site; c. Reduces doses to ALARA levels taking into consideration any detriments such as traf fic accidents expected to potentially result from decontamination and waste disposal; and d. Has submitted a decommissioning plan or license termination plan (L TP) to the agency indicating the licensee' s intent to decommission in accordance with 641\u2014paragraph 39.4(33) \"d,\" and specifying that the licensee proposes to decommission by use of alternate criteria. The licensee shall document in the decommissioning plan or L TP how the advice of individuals and institutions in the community , who may be af fected by the decommissioning, has been sought and addressed, as appropriate, following analysis of that advice. In seeking such advice, the licensee shall provide for: (1) Participation by representatives of a broad cross section of community interests who may be af fected by the decommissioning; (2) An opportunity for a comprehensive, collective discussion on the issues by the participants represented; and (3) A publicly available summary of the results of all such discussions, including a description of the individual viewpoints of the participants on the issues and the extent of agreement and disagreement among the participants on the issues. Ch 40, p. 12 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 40.31(2) The use of alternate criteria to terminate a license requires the approval of the agency after consideration of the staf f ' s recommendations that will address any comments provided by the Environmental Protection Agency and any public comments submitted pursuant to 40.32(136C). TESTING FOR LEAKAGE OR CONT AMINA TION OF SEALED SOURCES 641\u201440.32 (136C) T esting for leakage or contamination of sealed sour ces. 40.32(1) The licensee in possession of any sealed source shall ensure that: a.

If the licensee wishes to use equipment that has not been tested or certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health or for which there is no schedule for testing or certification, the licensee shall submit an application for authorized use of that equipment, including a demonstration by testing, or a demonstration on the basis of reliable test information, that the material and performance characteristics of the equipment are capable of providing the proposed degree of protection under anticipated conditions of use. c. The licensee or registrant shall implement and maintain a respiratory protection program that includes: (1) Air sampling suf ficient to identify the potential hazard, permit proper equipment selection, and estimate doses; (2) Surveys and bioassays, as appropriate, to evaluate actual intakes; (3) T esting of respirators for operability (user seal check for face sealing devices and functional check for others) immediately prior to each use; (4) W ritten procedures regarding monitoring, including air sampling and bioassays; supervision and training of respirator user; fit testing; respirator selection; breathing air quality; inventory and control; storage, issuance, maintenance, repair , testing, and quality assurance of respiratory protection equipment; record keeping; and limitations on periods of respirator use and relief from respirator use; Ch 40, p. 18 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 (5) Determination by a physician that the individual user is medically fit to use respiratory protection equipment: before the initial fitting of a face-sealing respirator; before the first field use of non-face-sealing respirators; and either every 12 months thereafter , or periodically at a frequency determined by a physician; and (6) Fit testing, with a fit factor equal to or greater than 10 times the APF for negative pressure devices, and a fit factor equal to or greater than 500 for any positive pressure, continuous flow , and pressure-demand devices, before the first field use of tight-fitting, face-sealing respirators and periodically thereafter at a frequency not to exceed one year . Fit testing must be performed with the facepiece operating in the negative pressure mode. d. The licensee shall advise each respirator user that the user may leave the area at any time for relief from respirator use in the event of equipment malfunction, physical or psychological distress, procedural or communication failure, significant deterioration of operating conditions, or any other conditions that might require such relief. e. The licensee shall also consider limitations appropriate to the type and mode of use. When selecting respiratory devices, the licensee shall provide for vision correction, adequate communication, low temperature work environments, and the concurrent use of other safety or radiological protection equipment. The licensee shall use equipment in such a way as not to interfere with the proper operation of the respirator . f. Standby rescue persons are required whenever one-piece atmosphere-supplying suits or any combination of supplied air respiratory protection devices and personnel protection equipment is used from which an unaided individual would have dif ficulty extricating himself or herself. The standby rescue persons must be equipped with respiratory protection devices or other apparatus appropriate for the potential hazards. The standby rescue persons shall observe or otherwise maintain continuous communication (visual, voice, signal line, telephone, radio, or other suitable means) with the workers, and be immediately available to assist the workers in case of a failure of the air supply or for any other reason that requires relief from distress. A suf ficient number of standby rescue persons must be immediately available to assist all users of this type of equipment and to provide ef fective emer gency rescue if needed. g. Atmosphere-supplying respirators must be supplied with respirable air of grade D quality or better as defined by the Compressed Gas Association in publication G-7.1, \"Commodity Specification for Air ,\" 1997, and included in the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.134(i)(1)(ii)(A) through (E)). Grade D quality air criteria include: (1) Oxygen content (v/v) of 19.5 to 23.5 percent; (2) Hydrocarbon (condensed) content of 5 milligrams per cubic meter of air or less; (3) Carbon monoxide (CO) content of 10 ppm or less; (4) Carbon dioxide content of 1000 ppm or less; and (5) Lack of noticeable odor . h.

In the estimation of the dose to individuals from intake of airborne radioactive materials, the concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when respirators are worn is initially assumed to be the ambient concentration in air without respiratory protection, divided by the assigned protection factor . If the dose is later found to be greater than the estimated dose, the corrected value must be used. If the dose is later found to be less than the estimated dose, the corrected value may be used. 40.50(2) When estimating exposure of individuals to airborne radioactive materials, the licensee may make allowance for respiratory protection equipment used to limit intakes pursuant to 40.49(136C), provided that the following conditions, in addition to those in 40.50(1), are satisfied: a. The licensee selects respiratory protection equipment that provides a protection factor , specified in Appendix A, greater than the multiple by which peak concentrations of airborne radioactive materials in the working area are expected to exceed the values specified in Appendix B, T able I, Column 3. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 19 However , if the selection of respiratory protection equipment with a protection factor greater than the multiple defined in the preceding sentence is inconsistent with the goal specified in 40.49(136C) of keeping the total ef fective dose equivalent ALARA, the licensee or registrant may select respiratory protection equipment with a lower protection factor provided that such a selection would result in a total ef fective dose equivalent that is ALARA. The concentration of radioactive material in the air that is inhaled when respirators are worn may be initially estimated by dividing the average concentration in air , during each period of uninterrupted use, by the protection factor . If the exposure is later found to be greater than initially estimated, the corrected value shall be used; if the exposure is later found to be less than initially estimated, the corrected value may be used. b. The licensee shall obtain authorization from the agency before assigning respiratory protection factors in excess of those specified in Appendix A. The agency may authorize a licensee to use higher protection factors on receipt of an application that: (1) Describes the situation for which a need exists for higher protection factors, and (2) Demonstrates that the respiratory protection equipment provides these higher protection factors under the proposed conditions of use. 40.50(3) In an emer gency , the licensee shall use as emer gency equipment only respiratory protection equipment that has been specifically certified or had certification extended for emer gency use by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. 40.50(4) Further restrictions. a. The licensee shall notify the agency in writing at least 30 days before the date that respiratory protection equipment is first used pursuant to either 40.50(1) or 40.50(2). b. The agency may impose restrictions in addition to those listed in these rules in order to: (1) Ensure that the respiratory protection program of the licensee is adequate to limit doses to individuals from intakes of airborne radioactive materials consistent with maintaining total ef fective dose equivalent ALARA; and (2) Limit the extent to which a licensee may use respiratory protection equipment instead of process or other engineering controls. 641\u201440.51 to 40.53 Reserved.

W ith regard to any area containing proprietary information, the workers' representative for that area shall be an individual previously authorized by the licensee or registrant to enter that area. 641\u201440.1 14 (136C) Consultation with workers during inspections. 40.1 14(1) Agency inspectors may consult privately with workers concerning matters of occupational radiation protection and other matters related to applicable provisions of these rules and licenses to the extent the inspectors deem necessary for the conduct of an ef fective and thorough inspection. 40.1 14(2) During the course of an inspection, any worker may bring privately to the attention of the inspectors, either orally or in writing, any past or present condition which the worker has reason to believe may have contributed to or caused any violation of the Act, these rules, or license condition, or any unnecessary exposure of an individual to sources of radiation under the licensee' s or registrant' s control. Any such notice in writing shall comply with the requirements of 40.1 15(1). 40.1 14(3) The provisions of 40.1 14(2) shall not be interpreted as authorization to disregard instructions pursuant to 40.1 1 1(136C). 641\u201440.1 15 (136C) Requests by workers for inspections. 40.1 15(1) Any worker or representative of workers believing that a violation of the Act, these rules, or license conditions exists or has occurred in work under a license or registration with regard to radiological working conditions in which the worker is engaged may request an inspection by giving notice of the alleged violation to the Bureau of Radiological Health, Iowa Department of Public Health, Lucas State Of fice Building, Des Moines, Iowa 50319-0075. Any such notice shall be in writing, shall set forth the specific grounds for the notice, and shall be signed by the worker or representative of the workers. A copy shall be provided to the licensee or registrant by the Bureau of Radiological Health, no later than at the time of inspection except that, upon the request of the worker giving such notice, such worker ' s name and the name of individuals referred to therein shall not appear in such copy or on any record published, released, or made available by the Agency , except for good cause shown. 40.1 15(2) If, upon receipt of such notice, the Bureau of Radiological Health determines that the complaint meets the requirements set forth in 40.1 16(1), and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged violation exists or has occurred, an inspection shall be made as soon as practicable to determine if such alleged violation exists or has occurred. Inspections pursuant to 40.1 16(136C) need not be limited to matters referred to in the complaint. 40.1 15(3) No licensee, registrant, or contractor or subcontractor of a licensee or registrant shall dischar ge or in any manner discriminate against any worker because such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under these rules or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such worker on behalf of such worker or others of any option af forded by this chapter . 641\u201440.1 warranted\u2014informal r eview . 40.1 16(1) a. If the Bureau of Radiological Health determines, with respect to a complaint under this rule, that an inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable grounds to believe that IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 39 a violation exists or has occurred, the Bureau of Radiological Health shall notify the complainant in writing of such determination. The complainant may obtain review of such determination by submitting a written statement of position with the Attorney General' s Of fice. Such Agency will provide the licensee or registrant with a copy of such statement by certified mail, excluding, at the request of the complainant, the name of the complainant. The licensee or registrant may submit an opposing written statement of position with the Attorney General' s Of fice. Such Agency will provide the complainant with a copy of such statement by certified mail. b. Upon the request of the complainant, the Attorney General' s Of fice may hold an informal conference in which the complainant and the licensee or registrant may orally present their views. An informal conference may also be held at the request of the licensee or registrant, but disclosure of the identity of the complainant will be made only following receipt of written authorization from the complainant. After considering all written and oral views presented, the Attorney General' s Of fice shall af firm, modify , or reverse the determination of the Radiation Control Program and furnish the complainant and the licensee or registrant a written notification of the decision and the reason therefor . 40.1 16(2) If the Bureau of Radiological Health determines that an inspection is not warranted because the requirements of 40.1 16(1) have not been met, the complainant shall be notified in writing of such determination. Such determination shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new complaint meeting the requirements of 40.1 16(1). 641\u201440.1 17 (136C) Employee pr otection. 40.1 17(1) Discrimination by a licensee or registrant, an applicant for a license or registration, or a contractor or subcontractor of a licensee or applicant against an employee for engaging in certain protected activities is prohibited. Discrimination includes dischar ge and other actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The protected activities are established in 641\u2014Chapters 38 to 45 and in general are related to the administration or enforcement of requirements imposed under 641\u2014Chapters 38 to 45. a. The protected activities include but are not limited to: (1) Providing the agency or the individual' s employer information about alleged violations of either of the statutes named in this rule or possible violations of requirements imposed under either of those statutes; (2) Refusing to engage in any practice made unlawful under either of the statutes named in this rule or under these requirements if the employee has identified the alleged illegality to the employer; (3) Requesting that the agency institute action against the individual' s employer for the administration or enforcement of these requirements; (4) T estifying in any agency proceeding, or before Congress, or at any federal or state proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of federal statutes or these rules; (5) Assisting or participating in, or about to assist or participate in, these activities. b. These activities are protected even if no formal proceeding is actually initiated as a result of the employee' s assistance or participation. c. This rule has no application to any employee alleging discrimination prohibited by this rule who, acting without direction from the individual' s employer (or the employer ' s agent), deliberately causes a violation of any requirement of 641\u2014Chapters 38 to 45. 40.1 17(2) Any employee who believes that the employee has been dischar ged or otherwise discriminated against by any person for engaging in protected activities specified in 40.1 17(1)\"a\" may seek a remedy for the dischar ge or discrimination through an administrative proceeding in the U.S. Department of Labor . The administration proceeding must be initiated within 180 days after an alleged violation occurs. The employee may file for the administrative proceeding by filing a complaint alleging the violation with the Department of Labor , Employment Standards Administration, W age and Hour Division. The Department of Labor may order reinstatement, back pay , and compensatory damages. 40.1 17(3) A violation of 40.1 17(1) \"a\" (1) or 40.1 17(1) \"a\" (4) by a licensee or registrant, an applicant for a license or registration, or a contractor or subcontractor of a licensee or applicant may be grounds for: Ch 40, p. 40 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 a. Denial, revocation, or suspension of the license or registration. b. Imposition of a civil penalty on the licensee, registrant, or applicant. c. Other enforcement action. 40.1 17(4) Actions taken by an employer or others which adversely af fect an employee may be predicated upon nondiscriminatory grounds. The prohibition applies when the adverse action occurs because the employee has engaged in protected activities. An employee' s engagement in protected activities does not automatically render the employee immune from dischar ge or discipline for legitimate reasons or from adverse action dictated by nonprohibited considerations. 40.1 17(5) No agreement af fecting the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including an agreement to settle a complaint filed by an employee with the Department of Labor pursuant to 641\u2014Chapters 38 to 45, may contain any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an employee from participating in protected activity as defined in 40.1 17(1) \"a\" including, but not limited to, providing information to the agency or to the individual' s employer on potential violations or other matters within the agency' s regulatory responsibilities.

They are applicable only to airborne radiological hazards and may not be appropriate to circumstances when chemical or other respiratory hazards exist instead of, or in addition to, radioactive hazards. Selection and use of respirators for such circumstances must also comply with Department of Labor regulations. Radioactive contaminants for which the concentration values in T able I, Column 3, of Appendix B to 641\u2014Chapter 40 are based on internal dose due to inhalation may , in addition, present external exposure Ch 40, p. 42 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 hazards at higher concentrations. Under these circumstances, limitations on occupancy may have to be governed by external dose limits. b Air -purifying respirators with APF<100 must be equipped with particulate filters that are at least 95 percent ef ficient. Air -purifying respirators with APF=100 must be equipped with particulate filters that are at least 99 percent ef ficient. Air -purifying respirators with APF>100 must be equipped with particulate filters that are at least 99.97 percent ef ficient. c The licensee may apply to the agency for the use of an APF greater than 1 for sorbent cartridges as protection against airborne radioactive gases and vapors (e.g., radioiodine). d Licensees may permit individuals to use this type of respirator who have not been medically screened or fit tested on the device provided that no credit be taken for the use in estimating intake or dose. It is also recognized that it is dif ficult to perform an ef fective positive or negative pressure pre-use user seal check on this type of device. All other respiratory protection program requirements listed in 641\u201440.50(136C) apply . An assigned protection factor has not been assigned for these devices. However , an APF equal to 10 may be used if the licensee can demonstrate a fit factor of at least 100 by use of a validated or evaluated, qualitative or quantitative fit test. e Under -chin type only . No distinction is made in this Appendix between elastomeric half-masks with replaceable cartridges and those designed with the filter medium as an integral part of the facepiece (e.g., disposable or reusable disposable). Both types are acceptable so long as the seal area of the latter contains some substantial type of seal-enhancing material such as rubber or plastic, the two or more suspension straps are adjustable, the filter medium is at least 95 percent ef ficient, and all other requirements of 641\u2014Chapter 40 are met. f The assigned protection factors for gases and vapors are not applicable to radioactive contaminants that present an absorption or submersion hazard. For tritium oxide vapor , approximately one-third of the intake occurs by absorption through the skin so that an overall protection factor of 3 is appropriate when atmosphere-supplying respirators are used to protect against tritium oxide. Exposure to radioactive noble gases is not considered a significant respiratory hazard, and protective actions for these contaminants should be based on external (submersion) dose considerations. g No NIOSH approval schedule is currently available for atmosphere-supplying suits. This equipment may be used in an acceptable respiratory protection program as long as all the other minimum program requirements, with the exception of fit testing, are met. h The licensee should implement institutional controls to ensure that these devices are not used in areas immediately dangerous to life or health. i This type of respirator may be used as an emer gency device in unknown concentrations for protection against inhalation hazards. External radiation hazards and other limitations to permitted exposure such as skin absorption shall be taken into account in these circumstances. This device may not be used by any individual who experiences perceptible outward leakage of breathing gas while wearing the device. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 43 CHAPTER 40 APPENDIX B ANNUAL LIMITS ON INT AKE (ALI) AND DERIVED AIR CONCENTRA TIONS (DAC) SANIT AR Y SEWERAGE Introduction For each radionuclide, T able I indicates the chemical form which is to be used for selecting the appropriate ALI or DAC value. The ALIs and DACs for inhalation are given for an aerosol with an activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 m, micron, and for three classes (D,W ,Y) of radioactive material, which refer to their retention (approximately days, weeks or years) in the pulmonary region of the lung. This classification applies to a range of clearance half-times for D if less than 10 days, for W from 10 to 100 days, and for Y greater than 100 days. T able II provides concentration limits for airborne and liquid ef fluents released to the general environment. T able III provides concentration limits for dischar ges to sanitary sewerage. N OTE : The values in T ables I, II, and III are presented in the computer \"E\" notation. In this notation a value of 6E-02 represents a value of 6 \u00d7 10 - 2 or 0.06, 6E+2 represents 6 \u00d7 10 2 or 600, and 6E+0 represents 6 \u00d7 10 0 or 6. T ABLE I \"OCCUP A TIONAL V ALUES\" Note that the columns in T able I of this appendix captioned \"Oral Ingestion ALI,\" \"Inhalation ALI,\" and \"DAC,\" are applicable to occupational exposure to radioactive material. The ALIs in this appendix are the annual intakes of given radionuclide by \"Reference Person\" which would result in either (1) a committed ef fective dose equivalent of 5 rem (0.05 Sv), stochastic ALI, or (2) a committed dose equivalent of 50 rem (0.5 Sv) to an or gan or tissue, nonstochastic ALI. The stochastic ALIs were derived to result in a risk, due to irradiation of or gans and tissues, comparable to the risk associated with deep dose equivalent to the whole body of 5 rem (0.05 Sv). The derivation includes multiplying the committed dose equivalent to an or gan or tissue by a weighting factor , w T . This weighting factor is the proportion of the risk of stochastic ef fects resulting from irradiation of the or gan or tissue, T , to the total risk of stochastic ef fects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly . The values of w T are listed under the definition of weighting factor in 40.2. The nonstochastic ALIs were derived to avoid nonstochastic ef fects, such as prompt damage to tissue or reduction in or gan function. A value of w T = 0.06 is applicable to each of the five or gans or tissues in the \"remainder\" category receiving the highest dose equivalents, and the dose equivalents of all other remaining tissues may be disregarded. The following portions of the GI tract\u2014stomach, small intestine, upper lar ge intestine, and lower lar ge intestine\u2014are to be treated as four separate or gans. The air concentration values listed in T able II, Column 1 were derived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides for which the stochastic limit is governing, the occupational stochastic inhalation ALI was divided by 2.4 \u00d7 10 9 (ml), relating the inhalation ALI to the DAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor of 300. The factor of 300 includes the following components: a factor of 50 to relate the 5 rem (0.05 Sv) annual occupational dose limit to the 0.1 rem limit for members of the public, a factor of 3 to adjust for the dif ference in exposure time and the inhalation rate for a worker and that for members of the public; and a factor of 2 to adjust the occupational values, derived for adults, so that they are applicable to other age groups. When an ALI is defined by the stochastic dose limit, this value alone is given. When an ALI is determined by the nonstochastic dose limit to an or gan, the or gan or tissue to which the limit applies is shown, and the ALI for the stochastic limit is shown in parentheses. Abbreviated or gan or tissue designations are used: Ch 40, p. 44 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 LLI wall = lower lar ge intestine wall; St. wall = stomach wall; Blad wall = bladder wall; and Bone surf = bone surface. The use of the ALIs listed first, the more limiting of the stochastic and nonstochastic ALIs, will ensure that nonstochastic ef fects avoided and that the risk of stochastic ef fects is limited to an acceptably low value. If, in a particular situation involving a radionuclide for which the nonstochastic ALI is limiting, use of that nonstochastic ALI is considered unduly conservative, the licensee may use the stochastic ALI to determine the committed ef fective dose equivalent. However , the licensee shall also ensure that the 50 rem (0.5 Sv) dose equivalent limit for any or gan or tissue is not exceeded by the sum of the external deep dose equivalent plus the internal committed dose equivalent to that or gan, not the ef fective dose. For the case where there is no external dose contribution, this would be demonstrated if the sum of the fractions of the nonstochastic ALIs (ALI n s ) that contribute to the committed dose equivalent to the or gan receiving the highest dose does not exceed unity , that is, (intake (in Ci) of each radionuclide/ALI n s ) 1.0. If there is an external deep dose equivalent contribution of H d , then this sum must be less than 1 - (H d /50), instead of 1.0. Note that the dose equivalents for an extremity , skin, and lens of the eye are not considered in computing the committed ef fective dose equivalent, but are subject to limits that must be met separately . The derived air concentration (DAC) values are derived limits intended to control chronic occupational exposures. The relationship between the DAC and the ALI is given by: DAC = ALI(in Ci)/(2000 hours per working year \u00d7 60 minutes/hour \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10 4 ml per minute) = [ALI/2.4 \u00d7 10 9 ] Ci/ml, where 2 \u00d7 10 4 ml is the volume of air breathed per minute at work by Reference Person under working conditions of light work. The DAC values relate to one of two modes of exposure: either external submersion or the internal committed dose equivalents resulting from inhalation of radioactive materials. DACs based upon submersion are for immersion in a semi-infinite cloud of uniform concentration and apply to each radionuclide separately . The ALI and DAC values include contributions to exposure by the single radionuclide named and any in-growth of daughter radionuclides produced in the body by decay of the parent. However , intakes that include both the parent and daughter radionuclides should be treated by the general method appropriate for mixtures. The values of ALI and DAC do not apply directly when the individual both ingests and inhales a radionuclide, when the individual is exposed to a mixture of radionuclides by either inhalation or ingestion or both, or when the individual is exposed to both internal and external irradiation. See 641\u201440.16(136C). When an individual is exposed to radioactive materials which fall under several of the translocation classifications of the same radionuclide, such as, Class D, Class W , or Class Y , the exposure may be evaluated as if it were a mixture of dif ferent radionuclides. It should be noted that the classification of a compound as Class D, W , or Y is based on the chemical form of the compound and does not take into account the radiological half-life of dif ferent radionuclides. For this reason, values are given for Class D, W , and Y compounds, even for very short-lived radionuclides. T ABLE II \"EFFLUENT CONCENTRA TIONS\" The columns able captioned \"Ef fluents,\" \"Air\" and \"W ater\" are applicable to the assessment and control of dose to the public, particularly in the implementation of the provisions of 641\u201440.27(136C). The concentration values given in Columns 1 and 2 of T able II are equivalent to the radionuclide concentrations which, if inhaled or ingested continuously over the course of a year , would produce a total ef fective dose equivalent of 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv). Consideration of nonstochastic limits has not been included in deriving the air and water ef fluent concentration limits because nonstochastic ef fects are presumed not to occur at or below the dose levels IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 45 established for individual members of the public. For radionuclides, where the nonstochastic limit was governing in deriving the occupational DAC, the stochastic ALI was used in deriving the corresponding airborne ef fluent limit in T able II. For this reason, the DAC and airborne ef fluent limits are not always proportional as they were in Appendix A of this chapter of the eighth edition of V olume I of the Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation. The air concentration values listed in T able II, Column 1 were derived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides for which the stochastic limit is governing, the occupational stochastic inhalation ALI was divided by 2.4 \u00d7 10 9 (ml), relating the inhalation ALI to the DAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor of 300. The factor of 300 includes the following components: a factor of 50 to relate the 5 rem (0.05 Sv) annual occupational dose limit to the 0.1 rem limit for members of the public, a factor of 3 to adjust for the dif ference in exposure time and the inhalation rate for a worker and that for members of the public; and a factor of 2 to adjust the occupational values, derived for adults, so that they are applicable to other age groups. For those radionuclides for which submersion, that is external dose, is limiting, the occupational DAC in T able I, Column 3 was divided by 219. The factor of 219 is composed of a factor of 50, as described above, and a factor of 4.38 relating occupational exposure for 2,000 hours per year to full-time exposure (8,760 hours per year). Note that an additional factor of 2 for age considerations is not warranted in the submersion case. The water concentrations were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 \u00d7 10 7 . The factor of 7.3 \u00d7 10 7 (ml) includes the following components: the factors of 50 and 2 described above and a factor of 7.3 \u00d7 10 5 (ml) which is the annual water intake of Reference Person. Note 2 of this appendix provides groupings of radionuclides which are applicable to unknown mixtures of radionuclides. These groupings, including occupational inhalation ALIs and DACs, air and water ef fluent concentrations and releases to sewer , require demonstrating that the most limiting radionuclides in successive classes are absent. The limit for the unknown mixture is defined when the presence of one of the listed radionuclides cannot be definitely excluded as being present either from knowledge of the radionuclide composition of the source or from actual measurements. T ABLE III \"RELEASES T O SEWERS\" The monthly average concentrations for release to sanitary sewerage are applicable to the provisions in 40.72. The concentration values were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 \u00d7 10 6 (ml). The factor of 7.3 \u00d7 10 6 (ml) is composed of a factor of 7.3 \u00d7 10 5 (ml), the annual water intake by Reference Person, and a factor of 10, such that the concentrations, if the sewage released by the licensee were the only source of water ingested by a Reference Person during a year , would result in a committed ef fective dose equivalent of 0.5 rem.

4E-4 2E-13 1E-15 2E-9 2E-8 FOOTNOTES: 1 \"Submersion\" means given are for submersion in a hemispherical semi-infinite cloud of airborne material. 2 These radionuclides have radiological half-lives of less than 2 hours. The total ef fective dose equivalent received during operations with these radionuclides might include a significant contribution from external exposure. The DAC values for all radionuclides, other than those designated Class \"Submersion,\" are based upon the committed ef fective dose equivalent due to the intake of the radionuclide into the body and do N O T include potentially significant contributions to dose equivalent from external exposures. The licensee may substitute 1E-7 Ci/ml for the listed DAC to account for the submersion dose prospectively , but should use individual monitoring devices or other radiation measuring instruments that measure external exposure to demonstrate compliance with the limits. (see 40.17) 3 For soluble mixtures of U-238, U-234, and U-235 in air , chemical toxicity may be the limiting factor (see 40.15(5)). If the percent by weight (enrichment) of U-235 is not greater than 5, the concentration value for a 40-hour workweek is 0.2 milligrams uranium per cubic meter of air average. For any enrichment, the product of the average concentration and time of exposure during a 40-hour workweek shall not exceed 8E-3 (SA) Ci-hr/ml, where SA is the specific activity of the uranium inhaled. The specific activity for natural uranium is 6.77E-7 curies per gram U. The specific activity for other mixtures of U-238, U-235, and U-234, if not known, shall be: SA 3.6E-7 curies/gram U U-depleted SA = [0.4 + 0.38 (enrichment) + 0.0034 (enrichment) 2 ] E-6, enrichment 0.72 where enrichment is the percentage by weight of U-235, expressed as percent. N OTE : 1. If the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture is known but the concentration of one or more of the radionuclides in the mixture is not known, the DAC for the mixture shall be the most restrictive DAC of any radionuclide in the mixture. 2. If the identity of each radionuclide in the mixture is not known, but it is known that certain radionuclides specified in this appendix are not present in the mixture, the inhalation ALI, DAC, and ef fluent and sewage concentrations for the mixture are the lowest values specified in this appendix for any radionuclide that is not known to be absent from the mixture; or If it is known that Ac-227-D and Cm-250-W are not present - 7E-4 3E-13 - - - If, in addition, it is known that Ac-227-W ,Y - 7E-3 3E-12 - - - If, in addition, it are present - 7E-2 3E-1 1 - - - Ch 40, p. 102 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 T able I T able II T able III Occupational V alues Ef fluent Concentrations Releases to Sewers Col. 1 Col. 2 Col. 3 Col. 1 Col. 2 Oral Ingestion INHALA TION Monthly A verage Atomic Radio- nuclide No. Class ALI (Ci/ml) Air (Ci/ml) W ater (Ci/ml) Concentration (Ci/ml) - 7E-1 3E-10 - - - If, in addition, it is known that Si-32-Y present - 7E+0 3E-9 - - - If it is known that , are not present - - - - 1E-14 - If, in addition, it is known , Cf-254-W ,Y are not present - - - 1E-13 - - If, in addition, it is not present - - - - 1E-12 - If, in addition it is known that Fe-60, - - - - 1E-6 1E-5 3. If a mixture of radionuclides consists of uranium and its daughters in ore dust (10 m AMAD particle distribution assumed) prior to chemical separation of the uranium from the ore, the following values may be used for the DAC of the mixture: 6E-1 1 Ci of gross alpha activity from thorium-230, and radium-226 per milliliter of air; Ci of natural uranium per milliliter of air; or 45 micrograms of natural uranium per cubic meter of air . 4.

IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 1 19 CHAPTER 40 APPENDIX E CLASSIFICA TION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF LOW -LEVEL RADIOACTIVE W ASTE I. Classification of Radioactive W aste for Land Disposal a) Considerations. Determination of the classification of radioactive waste involves two considerations. First, consideration must be given to the concentration of long-lived radionuclides (and their shorter -lived precursors) whose potential hazard will persist long after such precautions as institutional controls, improved waste form, and deeper disposal have ceased to be ef fective. These precautions delay the time when long-lived radionuclides could cause exposures. In addition, the magnitude of the potential dose is limited by the concentration and availability of the radionuclide at the time of exposure. Second, consideration must be given to the concentration of shorter -lived radionuclides for which requirements on institutional controls, waste form, and disposal methods are ef fective. b) Classes of waste. 1) Class A waste is waste that is usually segregated from other waste classes at the disposal site. The physical form and characteristics of Class A waste must meet the minimum requirements set forth in Section II. (a). If Class A waste also meets the stability requirements set forth in Section II. (b), it is not necessary to segregate the waste for disposal. 2) Class B waste is waste that must meet more rigorous requirements on waste form to ensure stability after disposal. The physical form and characteristics of Class B waste must meet both the minimum and stability requirements set forth in Section II. 3) Class C waste is waste that not only must meet more rigorous requirements on waste form to ensure stability but also requires additional measures at the disposal facility to protect against inadvertent intrusion. The physical form and characteristics of Class C waste must meet both the minimum and stability requirements set forth in Section II. c) Classification determined by long-lived radionuclides. If the radioactive waste contains only radionuclides listed in T able I, classification shall be determined as follows: 1) If the concentration does not exceed 0.1 times the value in T able I, the waste is Class A. 2) If the concentration exceeds 0.1 times the value in T able I, but does not exceed the value in T able I, the waste is Class C. 3) If the concentration exceeds the value in T able I, the waste is not generally acceptable for land disposal. 4) For wastes containing mixtures of radionuclides listed in T able I, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions rule described in Section I.(g).

If the waste does not contain any of the radionuclides listed in T able I, classification shall be determined based on the concentrations shown in T able II. However , as specified in Section I.(f), if radioactive waste does not contain any nuclides listed in either T able I or II, it is Class A. 1) If the concentration does not exceed the value in Column 1, the waste is Class A. 2) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 1 but does not exceed the value in Column 2, the waste is Class B. 3) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 2 but does not exceed the value in Column 3, the waste is Class C. 4) If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 3, the waste is not generally acceptable for near -surface disposal. 5) For wastes containing mixtures of the radionuclides listed in T able II, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions rule described in Section I.(g).

There are no limits established for these radionuclides in Class B or C wastes. Practical considerations such as the ef fects of external radiation and internal heat generation on transportation, handling, and disposal will limit the concentrations for these wastes. These wastes shall be Class B unless the concentrations of other radionuclides in T able II determine the waste to be Class C independent of these radionuclides. e) Classification determined by both long- and short-lived radionuclides. If the radioactive waste contains a mixture of radionuclides, some of which are listed in T able I and some of which are listed in T able II, classification shall be determined as follows: 1) If the concentration of a radionuclide listed in T able I is less than 0.1 times the value listed in T able I, the class shall be that determined by the concentration of radionuclides listed in T able II. 2) If the concentration of a radionuclide listed in T able I exceeds 0.1 times the value listed in T able I, but does not exceed the value in T able I, the waste shall be Class C, provided the concentration of radionuclides listed in T able II does not exceed the value shown in Column 3 of T able II. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 121 f) Classification of wastes with radionuclides other than those listed in T ables I and II. If the waste does not contain any radionuclides listed in either T able I or II, it is Class A. g) Determination of concentrations in wastes. The concentration of a radionuclide may be determined by indirect methods such as use of scaling factors which relate the inferred concentration of one radionuclide to another that is measured, or radionuclide material accountability , if there is reasonable assurance that the indirect methods can be correlated with actual measurements. The concentration of a radionuclide may be averaged over the volume of the waste, or weight of the waste if the units are expressed as becquerel (nanocurie) per gram. h) The sum of the fractions rule for mixtures of radionuclides. For determining classification for waste that contains a mixture of radionuclides, it is necessary to determine the sum of fractions by dividing each radionuclide' s concentration by the appropriate limit and adding the resulting values. The appropriate limits must all be taken from the same column of the same table. The sum of the fractions for the column must be less than 1.0 if the waste class is to be determined by that column. Example: A waste contains Sr -90 in a concentration of 1.85 TBq/m 3 (50 Ci/m 3 ) and Cs-137 in a concentration of 814 GBq/m 3 (22 Ci/m 3 ). Since the concentrations both exceed the values in Column 1, T able II, they must be compared to Column 2 values. For Sr -90 fraction, 50/150 = 0.33; for Cs-137 fraction, 22/44 = 0.5; the sum of the fractions = 0.83. Since the sum is less than 1.0, the waste is Class B. II. Radioactive W aste Characteristics a) The following are minimum requirements for all classes of waste and are intended to facilitate handling and provide protection of health and safety of personnel at the disposal site. 1) W astes shall be packaged in conformance with the conditions of the license issued to the site operator to which the waste will be shipped. Where the conditions of the site license are more restrictive than the provisions of this chapter , the site license conditions shall govern. 2) W astes shall not be packaged for disposal in cardboard or fiberboard boxes. 3) Liquid waste shall be packaged in suf ficient absorbent material to absorb twice the volume of the liquid. 4) Solid waste containing liquid shall contain as little freestanding and noncorrosive liquid as is reasonably achievable, but in no case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the volume. 5) W aste shall not be readily capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition or reaction at normal pressures and temperatures, or of explosive reaction with water . 6) W aste shall not contain, or be capable of generating, quantities of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes harmful to persons transporting, handling, or disposing of the waste. This does not apply to radioactive gaseous waste packaged in accordance with Section II.(a)(8). 7) W aste must not be pyrophoric. Pyrophoric materials contained in wastes shall be treated, prepared, and packaged to be nonflammable. 4 8) W astes in a gaseous form shall be packaged at an absolute pressure that does not exceed 1.5 atmospheres at 20\u00b0C. T otal activity shall not exceed 100 Ci (3.7 TBq) per container . 4 See 641\u201438.2 of these rules for the definition of pyrophoric. 9) W astes containing hazardous, biological, pathogenic, or infectious material shall be treated to reduce to the maximum extent practicable the potential hazard from the nonradiological materials. b) The following requirements are intended to provide stability of the waste. Stability is intended to ensure that the waste does not degrade and af fect overall stability of the site through slumping, collapse, or other failure of the disposal unit and thereby lead to water infiltration. Stability is also a factor in limiting exposure to an inadvertent intruder , since it provides a recognizable and nondispersible waste. 1) W aste shall have structural stability . A structurally stable waste form will generally maintain its physical dimensions and its form, under the expected disposal conditions such as weight of overburden and compaction equipment, the presence of moisture, and microbial activity , and internal factors such as radiation ef fects and chemical changes. Structural stability can be provided by the waste form itself, processing the waste to a stable form, or placing the waste in a disposal container or structure that provides stability after disposal. Ch 40, p. 122 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 2) Notwithstanding the provisions in Section II.(a)(3) and (4), liquid wastes, or wastes containing liquid, shall be converted into a form that contains as little freestanding and noncorrosive liquid as is reasonably achievable, but in no case shall the liquid exceed 1% of the volume of the waste when the waste is in a disposal container designed to ensure stability , or 0.5% of the volume of the waste for waste processed to a stable form. 3) V oid spaces within the waste and between the waste and its package shall be reduced to the extent practicable. III. Labeling Each package of waste shall be clearly labeled to identify whether it is Class A, Class B, or Class C waste, in accordance with Section I.

The curie (Ci) values are rounded to two significant figures for informational purposes only . 3 Radioactive materials are to be considered aggregated or collocated if breaching a common physical security barrier (e.g., a locked door at the entrance to a storage room) would allow access to the radioactive material or devices containing the radioactive material. 4 If several radionuclides are aggregated, the sum of the ratios of the activity of each source, i of radionuclide, n , A ( i , n ) , to the quantity of for radionuclide n , Q ( n ) , listed for that radionuclide equals or exceeds one. [(aggregated source activity for radionuclide A) \u00f7 (quantity of concern for radionuclide A)] + [(aggregated source activity for radionuclide B) \u00f7 (quantity of concern for radionuclide B)] + etc. ....... 1 Use the following method to determine which sources of radioactive material require increased controls (ICs): Include any single source equal to or greater than the quantity of concern in Appendix G. Include multiple collocated sources of the same radionuclide when the combined quantity equals or exceeds the quantity of concern. For combinations of radionuclides, include multiple collocated sources of dif ferent radionuclides when the aggregate quantities satisfy the following unity rule: [(amount of radionuclide A) \u00f7 (quantity of A)] + [(amount of radionuclide B) \u00f7 (quantity of concern of radionuclide B)] + etc. ...... 1 Guidance for Aggregation of Sources NRC supports the use of the IAEA ' s source categorization methodology as defined in TECDOC-1344, \"Categorization of Radioactive Sources,\" (July 2003) (see h t t p : / / w w w - p u b . i a e a . o r g / M T C D / p u b l i c a t i o n s / P D F / t e _ 1 3 4 4 _ w e b . p d f ) and as endorsed by the agency' s Code of Conduct for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, January 2004 (see h t t p : / / w w w - p u b . i a e a . o r g / M T C D / p u b l i c a t i o n s / P D F / C o d e - 2 0 0 4 . p d f ). The Code defines a three-tiered IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 40, p. 129 source categorization scheme. Category 1 corresponds to the lar gest source strength (equal to or greater than 100 times the quantity of concern values listed in the table in Appendix G) and Category 3 corresponds to the smallest (equal to or exceeding one-tenth the quantity of concern values listed in the table in Appendix G). Increased controls apply to sources that are equal to or greater than the quantity of concern values listed in the table in Appendix G, plus aggregations of smaller sources that are equal to or greater than the quantities in the table in Appendix G. Aggregation only applies to sources that are collocated. Licensees that possess sources in total quantities that equal or exceed the table in Appendix G quantities are required to implement increased controls. Where there are many small (less than the quantity of concern values) collocated sources whose total aggregate activity equals or exceeds the table in Appendix G values, licensees are to implement increased controls. Some source handling or storage activities may cover several buildings or several locations within specific buildings. The question then becomes: When are sources considered collocated for purposes of aggregation? For purposes of the additional controls, sources are considered collocated if breaching a single barrier (e.g., a locked door at the entrance to a storage room) would allow access to the sources. Sources behind an outer barrier should be aggregated separately from those behind an inner barrier (e.g., a locked source safe inside the locked storage room). However , if both barriers are simultaneously open, then all sources within these two barriers are considered to be collocated. This logic should be continued for other barriers within or behind the inner barrier . The following example illustrates the point: A lockable room has sources stored in it. Inside the lockable room, there are two shielded safes with additional sources in them. Inventories are as follows: The room has the following sources outside the safes: 0.12 Pu-238, TBq Ci). Application of the unity rule yields: (0.12 \u00f7 0.2) + (0.18 \u00f7 0.3) + (0.3 \u00f7 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.5. Therefore, the sources would require increased controls. Shielded safe #1 has a 1.9 TBq (51 Ci) Cs-137 source and a 0.8 TBq (22 Ci) Am-241 source. In this case, the sources would require increased controls, regardless of location, because they each exceed the quantities in the table in Appendix G. Shielded safe #2 has two Ir -192 sources, each having an activity of 0.3 TBq (8.1 Ci). In this case, the sources would not require increased controls while locked in the safe. The combined activity does not exceed the threshold quantity 0.8 TBq (22 Ci). Because certain barriers may cease to exist during source handling operations (e.g., a storage location may be unlocked during periods of active source usage), licensees should, to the extent practicable, consider two modes of source usage\u2014\"operations\" (active source usage) and \"shutdown\" (source storage mode). Whichever mode results in the greatest inventory (considering barrier status) would require increased controls for each location.

Not all individuals who use or take these agents will experience a photosensitive reaction or the same degree of photosensitive reaction. An individual who experiences a reaction on one occasion will not necessarily experience it again or every time. 2. Names of agents should be considered only as examples. They do not represent all the names under which a product may be sold. A more complete list is available from the facility operator . 3. If you are using an agent in any of these classes, you should reduce UV exposure even if your particular medication is not listed. Acne treatment (Retinoic acid, Retin-A) Psoralens (5-Methoxypsoralen, Coal tar and derivatives (Denorex, T egrin, petroleum products used for psoriasis and chronic eczema and in shampoos) Contraceptives, oral and estrogens (birth control pills, estrogens, progesterones) erythrosine, fluorescein, methyl violet, methylene blue, rose bengal) Perfumes and toilet articles (musk ambrette, oil of ber gamot, oil of cedar , oil of citron, oil of lavender , oil of lemon, oil of lime, oil of rosemary , oil of sandalwood) Thiazide diuretics (\"water 7/2/08 Appendix 2 SUN-REACTIVE SKIN TYPES USED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE SKIN TYPE SKIN REACTIONS T O SOLAR RADIA TION ( a ) EXAMPLES EXAMPLES I Always burns easily and severely (painful burn).

IAC 7/2/08 Public Appendix 3 POTENTIAL NEGA TIVE HEAL TH EFFECTS RELA TED T O UL TRA VIOLET EXPOSURE 1. Increased risk of skin cancer later in life. 2. Increased risk of skin thickening, age spots, irregular pigmentation, and premature aging. 3. Possibility of burning or rash, especially if using any of the potential photosensitizing drugs and agents. The consumer should consult a physician before using a tanning device if using medications, if there is a history of skin problems or if the consumer is especially sensitive to sunlight. 4. Increased risk of eye damage unless proper eyewear is worn. Iowa law requires the use of proper eyewear during tanning sessions. T ANNING SYSTEMS 1. Low-pressure tanning systems use a higher percentage of UVB rays which penetrate only the upper layer of skin and can cause burning more easily than high-pressure tanning systems. Low-pressure systems require more frequent sessions to maintain a tan. High-intensity tanning systems use more lamps and shorter tanning sessions than low-intensity tanning systems. These are still classified as low-pressure systems. 2. High-pressure tanning systems use a higher percentage of UV A rays which penetrate more deeply and can permanently damage the lower layers of skin and increase the incidences of skin cancers. High-pressure systems require fewer and less frequent sessions to maintain a tan. 3. The exposure schedule for each specific unit is shown on the labeling on the tanning unit. Iowa law requires the operator to limit the exposure of each consumer to the exposure schedule shown on the unit in which the consumer is tanning.

Prior to March 1, 2000, when performing any lead-based paint activity described as a lead-free inspection, lead inspection, elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection, lead hazard screen, risk assessment, visual risk assessment, or lead abatement, a certified individual was required to perform that activity in compliance with the appropriate requirements below . Beginning March 1, 2000, any lead-based paint activity described as a lead-free inspection, lead inspection, elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection, lead hazard screen, risk assessment, visual risk assessment, or lead abatement shall be performed according to the work practice standards in 641\u201470.6(135), and a certified individual must perform that activity in compliance with the appropriate requirements below . Ch 70, p. 20 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 70.6(1) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a lead-free inspection according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, a lead-free inspection shall be conducted only by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. A certified lead inspector/risk a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall notify the department in writing no later than 30 days after conducting a lead-free inspection in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility . The notification shall include the following information: (1) The address where the lead-free inspection was conducted. (2) The dates when the lead-free inspection was conducted. (3) The name, address, telephone number , Iowa certification number , and signature of the contact for the certified firm that conducted the lead-free inspection. (4) The name, address, telephone number , Iowa certification number , and signature of each certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor who conducted the lead-free inspection. b. When conducting a lead-free inspection in a residential dwelling, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following procedures: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test paint in each room, including each exterior side. (2) Except for components known to have been replaced after December 31, 1977, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test each testing combination in each room. On windows, the window frame, interior windowsill, window sash, and window trough shall each be considered a separate testing combination. Except for walls, one sample shall be taken for each testing combination in a room. Each wall in a room shall be tested. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall require one of the following two types of evidence to determine that components were replaced after 1977: 1. Detailed specifications showing which components were to be replaced, restored, enclosed, or encapsulated and evidence that the work was actually completed such as receipts for building materials, city building records showing a date of remodeling, or a final inspection by the city or another inspector showing that the work was actually completed. 2. A certification under penalty of perjury per Iowa Code section 622.1 from the contractor who did the work or from the person(s) who owned the property at the time outlining all of the components that were removed and replaced. If one of these two types of evidence is not available, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test the component. (3) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall note any components where lead-based paint has been enclosed or encapsulated. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not make a determination that the residential dwelling is lead-free where components that are painted with lead-based paint have been enclosed or encapsulated. (4) Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: 1. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 21 2. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use standards provided by the manufacturer and the NIST 1.02 standard film for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . 3. The certified inspector/risk assessor blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection, every four hours, and at the end of the inspection. 4. Prior to taking the final set of calibration readings and if required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. 5. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. 6. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If instructed by the property owner or the person requesting the report, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that inconclusive readings are positive, but shall not assume that inconclusive readings are negative. 7. As described by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct retesting of 10 surfaces, calculate the retest tolerance limit, and determine whether the inspection meets the retest tolerance limit. If the retest tolerance limit is not met, then this procedure shall be repeated with 10 additional surfaces. If the retest tolerance limit is not met with the 20 retested surfaces, then all results of the inspection shall be considered invalid. Ch 70, p. 22 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 (5) If each testing combination in the residential dwelling is found to be free of lead-based paint, then the residential dwelling is free of lead-based paint. If any surface in the residential dwelling is found to be painted with lead-based paint, then the residential dwelling is not free of lead-based paint. (6) If lead-based paint is identified through a lead-free inspection, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a visual inspection to determine the presence of lead-based paint hazards and any other potential lead hazards including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated. (7) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where a lead-free inspection is completed. No later than three weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall send a copy of the report to the property owner and to the person requesting the lead-free inspection, if dif ferent. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a copy of each written report for no less than three years. The report shall include, at least: 1. A statement that the inspection was conducted to determine whether the residential dwelling is free of lead-based paint; 2. Date of inspection; 3. Address of building; 4. Date of construction; 5. Apartment numbers (if applicable); 6. The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or owners of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility; 7. Name, signature, and certification number of each certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor conducting the investigation; 8. Name, address, and telephone number of each laboratory conducting an analysis of collected samples; 9. Each testing method and sampling procedure employed for paint analysis, including quality control data and, if used, the manufacturer , serial number , software, and operating mode of any X-ray fluorescence (XRF) device; 10. XRF readings taken for calibration and calculations to demonstrate that the XRF is properly calibrated at each required calibration; 1 1. Specific locations by room of each painted component tested for the presence of lead-based paint and the results for each component expressed in terms appropriate to the sampling method used; 12. The results of retesting of 10 surfaces, calculations to determine the retest tolerance limit, and the determination of whether the inspection meets the retest tolerance limit; 13. If the inspector determines that the residential dwelling is free of lead-based paint, the report shall contain the following statement: \"The results of this inspection indicate that no lead in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/cm 2 in paint was found on any building components, using the inspection protocol in Chapter 7 of the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing (1997). Therefore, this residential dwelling qualifies for the exemption in 24 CFR Part 35 and 40 CFR Part 745 for tar get housing being leased that is free of lead-based paint, as defined in the rule. However , some painted surfaces may contain levels of lead below 1.0 mg/cm 2 , which could create lead dust or lead-contaminated soil hazards if the paint is turned into dust by abrasion, scraping, or sanding. This report should be kept by the owner and all future owners for the life of the residential dwelling. Per the disclosure requirements of 24 CFR Part 35 and 40 CFR Part 745, prospective buyers are entitled to all available inspection reports should the property be resold.\"; 14. If any lead-based paint is identified, a description of the location, type, and severity of identified lead-based paint hazards, including the classification of each tested surface as to whether it is a lead-based paint hazard, and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 23 lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated; 15. A description of interim controls and abatement options for each identified lead-based paint hazard and a suggested prioritization for addressing each hazard. If the use of an encapsulant or enclosure is recommended, the report shall recommend a maintenance and monitoring schedule for the encapsulant or enclosure; 16. Information regarding the owner ' s obligations to disclose known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards upon sale or lease of residential property as required by Subpart H of 24 CFR Part 35 and Subpart I of 40 CFR Part 745; and 17. Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. c. When conducting a lead-free inspection in multifamily housing, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following procedures: (1) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may randomly select residential dwellings for testing when conducting a lead-free inspection in multifamily housing. If built before 1960 or if the date of construction is unknown, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 20 similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings in order to use random selection. If built from 1960 to 1977, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 10 similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings in order to use random selection. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not randomly select the residential dwellings for testing or if there are not enough residential dwellings to randomly select them for sampling, all residential dwellings shall be tested. If random selection is used, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor conducting the lead-free inspection shall randomly select the residential dwellings to be tested. The property owner , manager , or another interested party shall not specify which residential dwellings are to be tested.

Each type of common area shall be counted separately . If built before 1960, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 20 of a type of common area in order to use random selection. If built from 1960 to 1977, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 10 of a type of common area in order to use random selection. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not randomly select the common areas for testing or if there are not enough common areas to randomly select them for testing, all common areas shall be tested. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 1 to determine the number of each type of common area to randomly select for testing. (3) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test paint in each room of each residential dwelling selected for testing and in each common area selected for testing. (4) Except for components known to have been replaced after December 31, 1977, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test each testing combination in each room of a residential dwelling chosen for testing and in each common area chosen for testing. On windows, the window frame, interior windowsill, window sash, and window trough shall each be considered a separate testing combination. Each wall in a room or a common area shall be tested. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall require one of the following two types of evidence to determine that components were replaced after 1977: 1. Detailed specifications showing which components were to be replaced, restored, enclosed, or encapsulated and evidence that the work was actually completed such as receipts for building materials, city building records showing a date of remodeling, or evidence of a final inspection by the city or another inspector showing that the work was actually completed. 2. A certification under penalty of perjury per Iowa Code section 622.1 from the contractor who did the work or from the person(s) who owned the property at the time outlining all of the components that were removed and replaced. If one of these two types of evidence is not available, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test the component. (5) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall note any components where lead-based paint has been enclosed or encapsulated. The certified Ch 70, p. 26 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not make a determination that a component or the multifamily housing is lead-free where components that are painted with lead-based paint have been enclosed or encapsulated. (6) Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: 1. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer which has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. 2. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer using a software version or a mode of operation that could result in inconclusive readings or would require substrate correction. 3. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use standards provided by the manufacturer and the NIST 1.02 standard film for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . 4. The certified inspector/risk assessor blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection, every four hours, and at the end of the inspection. 5. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading as positive or negative according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. 6. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall count the number of XRF readings taken for each component type. If fewer than 40 of any component type were tested, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall randomly choose additional testing combinations for the component type to reach a total of 40 XRF readings. If fewer than 40 testing combinations are available for testing, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test each testing combination. (7) For each component type where at least 40 testing combinations have been tested, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall determine the number and percentage of each component type that is classified as positive or negative. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each component type as follows: 1. Lead-based paint is not present on a component type if all readings are classified as negative. 2. Lead-based paint is present on a component type if at least 15 percent of the readings are classified as positive. 3. Lead-based paint is present on a component type if greater than or equal to 5 percent but less than 15 percent of the XRF readings are classified as positive, unless the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor collects paint samples and obtains laboratory analyses for all positive XRF readings. If the laboratory analyses show that lead-based paint IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 27 is not present on any components, then the component type is negative. If the laboratory analyses show that lead-based paint is present on any component, then the component type is positive. 4. Lead-based paint is present on a component type if greater than 0 but less than 5 percent of the XRF readings are classified as positive, unless the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor collects paint samples and obtains laboratory analyses for all positive XRF readings or randomly selects a second set of residential dwellings for testing. If the laboratory analyses show that lead-based paint is not present on any components, then the component type is negative. If the laboratory analyses show that lead-based paint is present on any component, then the component type is positive. If a second set of randomly selected residential dwellings is sampled and greater than 0 but less than 2.5 percent of the combined set of results is positive, the component type may be considered as not having lead-based paint developmentwide but rather , having lead-based paint in isolated locations, with a reasonable degree of confidence. Individual components that are classified as positive should be considered lead-based painted and managed or abated appropriately . 5. If a particular component type in the sampled residential dwellings is classified as positive, that same component type in the unsampled residential dwellings is also classified as positive. (8) If fewer than 40 of a component type are available for testing, each testing combination must be classified individually as positive or negative. (9) If any component type or individual component is classified as positive, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not state that the multifamily housing is free of lead-based paint. (10) As specified by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct retesting of 10 surfaces selected from two residential dwellings, calculate the retest tolerance limit, and determine whether the inspection meets the retest tolerance limit. If the retest tolerance limit is not met, then this procedure shall be repeated with 10 additional surfaces selected from the two residential dwellings. If the retest tolerance limit is not met with the 20 retested surfaces, then all results of the inspection shall be considered invalid. (1 1) If lead-based paint is identified on any component or component type, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a visual inspection to determine the presence of lead-based paint hazards and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated. (12) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility inspected. No later than three weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall send a copy of the report to the property owner and to the person requesting the inspection, if dif ferent. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a copy of each written report for no less than three years. The inspection report shall include, at least: 1. Date of each inspection; 2. Address of each building in the multifamily housing; 3. Date of construction for each building in the multifamily housing; 4. A list of the apartments and common areas in each building in the multifamily housing; 5. The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or owners of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility; 6. A statement that the inspection was conducted to determine that lead-based paint is not present; 7.

XRF readings taken for calibration and calculations to demonstrate that the XRF is properly calibrated at each required calibration; 13. Specific locations by room of each painted component tested for the presence of lead-based paint and by residential dwelling or common area and the results for each component expressed in terms appropriate to the sampling method used; 14. Component aggregations and the determination of whether lead-based paint is present by component type; 15. The results of retesting of 10 surfaces, calculations to determine the retest tolerance limit, and the determination of whether the inspection meets the retest tolerance limit; 16. If the inspector determines that the multifamily housing is free of lead-based paint, the report shall contain the following statement: \"The results of this inspection indicate that no lead in amounts greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/cm 2 in paint was found on any building components, using the inspection protocol in Chapter 7 of the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing (1997). Therefore, this multifamily housing qualifies for the exemption in 24 CFR Part 35 and 40 CFR Part 745 for tar get housing being leased that is free of lead-based paint, as defined in the rule. However , some painted surfaces may contain levels of lead below 1.0 mg/cm 2 , which could create lead dust or lead-contaminated soil hazards if the paint is turned into dust by abrasion, scraping, or sanding. This report should be kept by the owner and all future owners for the life of the multifamily housing. Per the disclosure requirements of 24 CFR Part 35 and 40 CFR Part 745, prospective buyers are entitled to all available inspection reports should the property be resold.\"; 17. If any lead-based paint is identified, a description of the location, type, and severity of identified lead-based paint hazards, including the classification of each tested surface as to whether it is a lead-based paint hazard, and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated; 18. A description of interim controls and lead abatement options for each identified lead-based paint hazard and a suggested prioritization for addressing each hazard. If the use of an encapsulant or enclosure is recommended, the report shall recommend a maintenance and monitoring schedule for the encapsulant or enclosure; 19. Information regarding the owner ' s obligations to disclose known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards upon sale or lease of residential property as required by Subpart H of 24 CFR Part 35 and Subpart I of 40 CFR Part 745; and 20. Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. 70.6(2) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct lead inspections according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, lead inspections shall be conducted only by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. When conducting a lead inspection in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following procedures: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test paint in each room, including each exterior side. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 29 (2) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test each testing combination in each room. On windows, the window frame, interior windowsill, window sash, and window trough shall each be considered a separate testing combination. One sample shall be taken for each testing combination in a room. If a testing combination is not tested, it shall be assumed to be painted with lead-based paint. b. Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. (2) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the NIST 1.02 standard film or standards provided by the manufacturer for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . The certified assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not state that any surface is free of lead-based paint unless the NIST 1.02 standard film is used for calibration. (3) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection. (4) If required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface, and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not conduct substrate correction where required by the performance characteristics sheet, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that all of the readings are positive and shall not state that a surface is free of lead-based paint. (5) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the Ch 70, p. 30 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that all inconclusive readings are positive and classify them as such. (6) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not resolve inconclusive readings by laboratory analysis, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the inconclusive readings are positive. c. If lead-based paint is identified through an inspection, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a visual inspection to determine the presence of lead-based paint hazards and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated. d. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility inspected. No later than three weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall send a copy of the report to the property owner and to the person requesting the inspection, if dif ferent. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a copy of each written report for no less than three years. The inspection report shall include, at least: (1) A statement that the inspection was conducted to identify lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the residential dwelling; (2) Date of each inspection; (3) Address of building; (4) Date of construction; (5) Apartment numbers (if applicable); (6) The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or owners of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility; (7) Name, signature, and certification number of each certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor conducting the investigation; (8) Name, address, and telephone number of each laboratory conducting an analysis of collected samples; (9) Each testing method and sampling procedure employed for paint analysis, including quality control data and, if used, the manufacturer , serial number , software, and operating mode of any X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer; (10) XRF readings taken for calibration and calculations to demonstrate that the XRF is properly calibrated; (1 1) Specific locations by room of each painted component tested for the presence of lead-based paint and the results for each component expressed in terms appropriate to the sampling method used; (12) A statement that all painted or finished components that were not tested must be assumed to contain lead-based paint; (13) A description of the location, type, and severity of identified lead-based paint hazards, including the classification of each tested surface as to whether it is a lead-based paint hazard, and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated; IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 31 (14) A description of interim controls and lead abatement options for each identified lead-based paint hazard and a suggested prioritization for addressing each hazard. If the use of an encapsulant or enclosure is recommended, the report shall recommend a maintenance and monitoring schedule for the encapsulant or enclosure; (15) Information regarding the owner ' s obligations to disclose known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards upon sale or lease of residential property as required by Subpart H of 24 CRF Part 35 and Subpart I of 40 CFR Part 745; and (16) Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. 70.6(3) A certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct elevated blood lead (EBL) inspections according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, elevated blood lead (EBL) inspections shall be conducted only by a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. When conducting an elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following procedures: (1) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test paint in each room, including each exterior side. (2) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test each testing combination in each room. One sample shall be taken for each testing combination in a room. On windows, the window frame, interior windowsill, window sash, and window trough shall each be considered a separate testing combination. If a testing combination is not tested, it shall be assumed to be painted with lead-based paint. b. Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: (1) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. (2) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the NIST 1.02 standard film or standards provided by the manufacturer for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not state that any surface is free of lead-based paint unless the NIST 1.02 standard film is used for calibration. (3) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection. (4) If required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface, and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the Ch 70, p. 32 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. If the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not conduct substrate correction where required by the performance characteristics sheet, then the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that all of the readings are positive and shall not state that a surface is free of lead-based paint. (5) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that all inconclusive readings are positive and classify them as such. (6) The certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not resolve inconclusive readings, then the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the inconclusive readings are positive. c. If lead-based paint is identified through an elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection, the certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a visual inspection to determine the presence of lead-based paint hazards and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the play area or in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated. d. No later than two weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where an elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection has been conducted and shall provide a copy of this report to the property owner and the occupant of the dwelling. The report shall include, at least: (1) A statement that the elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection was conducted to identify lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the residential dwelling; (2) Date of each elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection; (3) Address of building; (4) Date of construction; (5) Apartment numbers (if applicable); (6) The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or owners of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility; (7) Name, signature, and certification number of each certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor conducting the investigation; (8) Name, address, and telephone number of each laboratory conducting an analysis of collected samples; (9) Each testing method and sampling procedure employed for paint analysis, including quality control data and, if used, the manufacturer , serial number , software, and operating mode of any X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer; (10) XRF readings taken for calibration and calculations to demonstrate that the XRF is properly calibrated; (1 1) Specific locations by room of each painted component tested for the presence of lead-based paint and the results for each component expressed in terms appropriate to the sampling method used; (12) A statement that all painted or finished components that were not tested must be assumed to contain lead-based paint; (13) A description of the location, type, and severity of identified lead-based paint hazards, including the classification of each tested surface as to whether it is a lead-based paint hazard, and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the play area or in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated; IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 33 (14) A description of interim controls and lead abatement options for each identified lead-based paint hazard and a suggested prioritization for addressing each hazard. If the use of an encapsulant or enclosure is recommended, the report shall recommend a maintenance and monitoring schedule for the encapsulant or enclosure; (15) Information regarding the owner ' s obligations to disclose known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards upon sale or lease of residential property as required by Subpart H of 24 CFR Part 35 and Subpart I of 40 CFR Part 745; and (16) Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. e. A certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a written record for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where an elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection has been conducted for no fewer than ten years. The record shall include, at least: (1) A copy of the written report required by paragraph 70.6(3) \"d.\" (2) Blood lead test results for the elevated blood lead (EBL) child. (3) A record of conversations held with the owners and occupants of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility prior to, during, and after the EBL inspection. (4) Records of follow-up visits made to each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where lead-based paint hazards are identified to ensure that lead-based paint hazards are safely repaired. 70.6(4) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct lead hazard screens according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, lead hazard screens shall be conducted only by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. Background information regarding the physical characteristics of the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility and occupant use patterns that may cause lead-based paint exposure to at least one child under the age of six years shall be collected. b. A visual inspection of the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility shall be conducted to determine if any deteriorated paint is present and to locate at least two dust sampling locations. c. If deteriorated paint is present, each surface with deteriorated paint which is determined to have a distinct painting history must be tested for the presence of lead. In addition, friction surfaces where there is evidence of abrasion and impact surfaces that are damaged or otherwise deteriorated from impact and that have a distinct painting history shall be tested for the presence of lead. d. In residential dwellings, a minimum of two composite or single-surface dust samples shall be collected. One sample shall be collected from the floors and the other from the interior windowsills in rooms, hallways, or stairwells where at least one child under the age of six years is most likely to come in contact with dust. e. In multifamily dwellings and child-occupied facilities, single-surface or composite dust samples shall also be collected from common areas where at least one child under the age of six years is likely to come in contact with dust. f. Dust samples shall be collected by wipe samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. The minimum area for a floor wipe sample shall be 0.50 square feet or 72 square inches. The minimum area for a windowsill wipe sample and for a window trough wipe sample shall be 0.25 square feet or 36 square inches. Dust samples shall be analyzed by a recognized laboratory to determine the level of lead. g. Soil samples shall be collected and analyzed for lead content in exterior play areas and dripline areas where bare soil is present. In addition, soil samples shall be collected and analyzed for lead content from any other areas of the yard where bare soil is present. Soil and paint samples shall be collected using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department and shall be analyzed by a recognized laboratory to determine the level of lead. h. Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in Ch 70, p. 34 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. (2) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the National Institute of Standards and T echnology 1.02 milligrams of lead per square centimeter standard reference material or standards provided by the manufacturer for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . (3) The certified inspector/risk assessor blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection. (4) If required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface, and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not conduct substrate correction where required by the performance characteristics sheet, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that all the readings are positive and shall not state that a surface is free of lead-based paint. (5) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that all inconclusive readings are positive and classify them as such. (6) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 35 blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not resolve inconclusive readings by laboratory analysis, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the inconclusive readings are positive. i. The following standards shall be used to determine whether a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility fails a lead hazard screen: (1) A residential dwelling or child-occupied facility shall fail a lead hazard screen if any deteriorated paint or paint on friction or impact surfaces is found to be lead-based paint. (2) A residential dwelling shall fail a lead hazard screen if any floor dust lead level in a single-surface or composite-surface dust sample is greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per square foot. (3) A residential dwelling shall fail a lead hazard screen if any interior windowsill dust level in a single-surface or composite-surface dust sample is greater than or equal to 125 micrograms per square foot. (4) A residential dwelling or child-occupied facility shall fail a lead hazard screen if any bare soil is found to be a soil-lead hazard. j. When conducting a lead hazard screen in multifamily housing, a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may sample each residential dwelling or choose residential dwellings for sampling by random selection, tar geted selection, or worst case selection. (1) If built before 1960 or if the date of construction is unknown, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 20 similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings in order to use random selection. If built from 1960 to 1977, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 10 similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings in order to use random selection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 1 to determine the number of residential dwellings to randomly select for testing. (2) If the multifamily housing contains five or more similar residential dwellings, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may use tar geted selection. If using tar geted selection, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 2 to determine the number of residential dwellings to test. If the multifamily housing has fewer than five similar dwellings, all residential dwellings shall be tested. Residential dwellings chosen by tar geted selection shall meet as many of the following criteria as possible: 1. The residential dwelling has been cited with a housing or building code violation within the past year . 2. The property owner believes that the residential dwelling is in poor condition. 3. The residential dwelling contains two or more children between the ages of six months and six years. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall give preference to residential dwellings that house the lar gest number of children. 4. The residential dwelling serves as a day care facility . 5. The residential dwelling has been prepared for reoccupancy within the past three months. If additional residential dwellings are needed to meet the minimum number specified in T able 2, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall select them randomly . If too many residential dwellings meet the criteria, residential dwellings shall be eliminated randomly . Ch 70, p. 36 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 T able 2 Minimum Number of Residential Dwellings in Multifamily Housing for Risk Assessment or Lead Hazard Screen Through T ar geted Selection Number of Similar Residential Dwellings Number of Residential Dwellings to Sample* 1-4 All 5-20 4 residential dwellings or 50% (whichever is greater)** 21-75 10 residential dwellings or 20% (whichever is 126-175 21 301-400 22 401-500 23 501+ 24 + 1 residential dwelling for each additional increment of 100 residential dwellings or less *Does not include residential dwellings housing children with elevated blood lead levels. **For percentages, round up to determine number of residential dwellings to be sampled. k. If the multifamily housing contains five or more similar residential dwellings, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may use worst case selection. If using worst case selection, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 2 to determine the number of residential dwellings to test. If the multifamily housing has fewer than five similar dwellings, all residential dwellings shall be tested. l. The following standards shall be used to determine whether multifamily housing fails a lead hazard screen: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean of the dust lead levels for carpeted floors, uncarpeted floors, and interior windowsills. If the arithmetic mean for carpeted floors or uncarpeted floors is greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per square foot, the multifamily housing shall fail the lead hazard screen. If the arithmetic mean for interior windowsills is greater than or equal to 125 micrograms per square foot, the multifamily housing shall fail the lead hazard screen. If the arithmetic mean for carpeted floors or uncarpeted floors is less than 25 micrograms per square foot, but some of the samples have dust lead levels that are greater than or equal to 25 micrograms per square foot, then the residential dwellings where these samples were taken and all other similar residential dwellings in the multifamily housing shall fail the lead hazard screen. If the arithmetic mean for interior windowsills is less than 125 micrograms per square foot, but some of the samples have dust lead levels that are greater than or equal to 125 micrograms per square foot, then the residential dwellings where these samples were taken and all other similar residential dwellings in the multifamily housing shall fail the lead hazard screen. (2) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall evaluate the results of paint sampling by component and location. If all components at a given location are determined to be painted with lead-based paint or are determined to not be painted with lead-based paint, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume this condition is true for all similar residential dwellings. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not assume that the multifamily housing is free of lead-based paint. If a component at a given location is found to be painted with lead-based paint in some residential dwellings and not painted with lead-based paint in other residential dwellings, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the component is a lead-based paint hazard in all similar residential dwellings. If a component in a residential dwelling is determined or assumed to be IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 37 lead-based paint, then the entire group of similar residential dwellings in the multifamily housing shall fail the lead hazard screen. (3) Multifamily housing shall fail a lead hazard screen if any bare soil is found to be a soil-lead hazard. m. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where a lead hazard screen is conducted. No later than three weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall send a copy of the report to the property owner and to the person requesting the lead hazard screen, if dif ferent. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a copy of each written report for no less than three years.

(18) Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. 70.6(5) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct risk assessments according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, Ch 70, p. 38 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 risk assessments shall be conducted only by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. Background information regarding the physical characteristics of the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility and occupant use patterns that may cause lead-based paint exposure to at least one child under the age of six years shall be collected. b. A visual inspection for risk assessment shall be undertaken to locate the existence of deteriorated paint and other potential lead hazards and to assess the extent and causes of the paint deterioration. c. If deteriorated paint is present, each surface with deteriorated paint which is determined to have a distinct painting history must be tested for the presence of lead. d. Friction surfaces where there is evidence of abrasion and impact surfaces that are damaged or otherwise deteriorated from impact and that have a distinct painting history shall be tested for the presence of lead. e. In residential dwellings, dust samples shall be collected from the interior windowsill, window trough, and floor in all living areas where at least one child is most likely to come in contact with dust. Dust samples shall be analyzed for lead concentration and may be either composite or single-surface samples. f. In multifamily dwellings, dust samples shall also be collected from interior windowsills, window troughs, and floors in common areas adjacent to the sampled residential dwellings or child-occupied facility and in other common areas where the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor determines that at least one child under the age of six years is likely to come in contact with dust. Dust samples shall be analyzed for lead concentration and may be either composite or single-surface samples. g. In child-occupied facilities, dust samples shall be collected from the interior windowsill, window trough, and floor in each room, hallway , or stairwell utilized by one or more children under the age of six years and in other common areas where the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor determines that at least one child under the age of six years is likely to come in contact with dust. Dust samples shall be analyzed for lead concentration and may be either composite or single-surface samples. h. Soil samples shall be collected and analyzed for lead content in exterior play areas and dripline areas where bare soil is present. In addition, soil samples shall be collected and analyzed for lead content from any other areas of the yard where bare soil is present. i.

The minimum area for a floor wipe sample shall be 0.50 square feet. The minimum area for a windowsill wipe sample and for a window trough wipe sample shall be 0.25 square feet. Soil and paint samples shall be collected using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. Dust and soil samples shall be analyzed by a recognized laboratory to determine the level of lead. The results of dust sampling shall be reported in micrograms of lead per square foot, and the results of soil sampling shall be reported in parts per million of lead. The results shall not be reported as \"not detectable.\" j. Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. (2) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the NIST 1.02 standard film material or standards provided by the manufacturer for calibration IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 39 of X-ray fluorescence analyzer . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not state that any surface is free of lead-based paint unless the NIST 1.02 standard film is used for calibration. (3) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection. (4) If required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface, and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not conduct substrate correction where required by the performance characteristics sheet, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that all of the readings are positive and shall not state that a surface is free of lead-based paint. (5) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that all inconclusive readings are positive and classify them as such. (6) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not resolve inconclusive readings by laboratory analysis, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the inconclusive readings are positive. k. When conducting a risk assessment in multifamily housing, a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may sample each residential dwelling or choose residential dwellings for sampling by random selection, tar geted selection, or worst case selection.

If built from 1960 to 1977, the multifamily housing shall contain at least 10 similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings in order to use random selection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 1 to determine the number of residential dwellings to randomly select for testing. (2) If the multifamily housing contains five or more similar residential dwellings, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may use tar geted selection. If using tar geted selection, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use T able 2 to determine the number of residential dwellings to test. If the multifamily housing has fewer than five similar dwellings, all residential dwellings shall be tested. Residential dwellings chosen by tar geted selection shall meet as many of the following criteria as possible. If additional residential dwellings are needed to meet the minimum number specified in T able 2, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall select them randomly .

The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean of the dust lead levels for carpeted floors, uncarpeted floors, interior windowsills, and window troughs. If the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the level defined as a dust lead hazard for the component, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall determine that a dust lead hazard has been identified on the component throughout the multifamily housing. If the arithmetic mean is less than the level defined as a dust lead hazard for the component, but some of the individual components have dust lead levels that are greater than or equal to the level defined as a dust lead hazard, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall determine that a dust lead hazard has been identified on the individual components and on all other similar components throughout the multifamily housing. 2. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall evaluate the results of paint sampling by component and location. If all components at a given location are determined to be painted with lead-based paint or are determined to not be painted with lead-based paint, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume this condition is true for all similar residential dwellings. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not assume that the multifamily housing is free of lead-based paint. If a component at a given location is found to be painted with lead-based paint in some residential dwellings and not painted with lead-based paint in other residential dwellings, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 41 inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the component is a lead-based paint hazard in all similar residential dwellings. l.

A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall visually verify that lead-based paint was removed from a surface prior to repainting or refinishing. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 43 i. If components painted with lead-based paint are removed, the replacement components shall be installed prior to postabatement clearance testing. j. Postabatement clearance procedures shall be conducted by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . Postabatement clearance testing shall be performed by persons or entities independent of those performing lead abatement, unless the designated party uses qualified in-house employees to conduct postabatement clearance testing. An in-house employee shall not conduct both lead abatement and the postabatement clearance testing for this work. Postabatement clearance testing shall be conducted using the following procedures: (1) Following a lead abatement, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall review the report of the lead inspection, risk assessment, or visual assessment done prior to the lead abatement project and the lead abatement specifications to determine the lead-based paint hazards that were to be abated by the lead abatement project. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall perform a visual inspection to determine if all lead-based paint hazards that were to be abated have been abated and to determine if deteriorated paint surfaces or visible amounts of dust, debris, or residue are still present in the rooms where lead abatement was conducted. If lead-based paint hazards that were to be abated by the project or deteriorated paint surfaces or visible amounts of dust, debris, or residue are present in the rooms where lead abatement was conducted, these conditions must be eliminated prior to the continuation of the clearance procedures. However , elimination of deteriorated paint is not required if it has been determined through paint testing or a lead-based paint inspection that the deteriorated paint is not lead-based paint. Following an exterior lead abatement, a visual inspection shall be conducted to determine if all lead-based paint hazards that were to be abated have been abated and to determine if any visible dust or debris remains on any horizontal surfaces in the outdoor living areas close to the abated surface. In addition, a visual inspection shall be conducted to determine the presence of paint chips on the dripline or next to the foundation below any exterior surface that was abated. If lead-based paint hazards that were to be abated by the project are still present, these conditions must be eliminated prior to the continuation of the clearance procedures. If visible dust, debris, or paint chips are present, they must be removed from the site and properly disposed of according to all applicable federal, state, and local standards. (2) Following the visual inspection and any required postabatement cleanup, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct clearance sampling for lead in dust. Clearance sampling may be conducted by employing single-surface sampling or composite dust sampling. (3) Dust samples shall be collected a minimum of one hour after the completion of final postabatement cleanup activities. (4) Dust samples shall be collected by wipe samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. The minimum area for a floor wipe sample shall be 0.50 square feet or 72 square inches. The minimum area for a windowsill wipe sample and for a window trough wipe sample shall be 0.25 square feet or 36 square inches. Dust samples shall be analyzed by a recognized laboratory to determine the level of lead. (5) The following postabatement clearance activities shall be conducted as appropriate based upon the extent or manner of lead abatement activities conducted in the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility: 1. After conducting a lead abatement with containment between abated and unabated areas, three dust samples shall be taken from each of no fewer than four rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the containment area. Dust samples shall be taken from one interior windowsill and from one window trough (if available), and one dust sample shall be taken from the floor of each of no fewer than four rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the containment area. In addition, one dust sample shall be taken from the floor outside of each individual containment area. If there are fewer than four rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the containment area, then all rooms, hallways, and stairwells shall be sampled. 2. After conducting a lead abatement with no containment between abated and unabated areas, three dust samples shall be taken from each of no fewer than four rooms, hallways, or stairwells in the Ch 70, p. 44 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 residential dwelling or child-occupied facility . Dust samples shall be taken from one interior windowsill and from one window trough (if available), and one dust sample shall be taken from the floor of each room, hallway , or stairwell selected. If there are fewer than four rooms, hallways, or stairwells in the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility , then all rooms, hallways, and stairwells shall be sampled. 3. The certified lead abatement contractors and certified lead abatement workers who abate or clean the dwellings shall not have any knowledge of which rooms or surfaces will be selected for the dust samples. (6) Reserved. (7) ( 7) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall compare the residual lead level as determined by the laboratory analysis from each single-surface dust sample with applicable single-surface clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, interior windowsills, and window troughs. If the residual lead level in a single-surface dust sample is greater than or equal to the applicable clearance level for a floor , interior windowsill, or window trough, then the failed component in each room with a failed single-surface dust sample and that type of component in each room that was not tested shall be recleaned. Additional clearance samples shall be taken from the failed component in each room where it failed and from enough additional rooms that were not previously tested so that four rooms are sampled. If four rooms are not available, then each available room shall be retested. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall evaluate the results of this testing to determine if the recleaned components meet the clearance level. The components must be recleaned and retested until the clearance level is met. (8) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall compare the residual lead level as determined by the laboratory analysis from each composite dust sample with applicable single-surface clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, interior windowsills, and window troughs divided by half the number of subsamples in the composite sample. If the residual lead level in a composite dust sample is greater than or equal to the applicable clearance level divided by half the number of subsamples in the composite sample, then all the components represented by the failed composite dust sample shall be recleaned and retested until clearance levels are met. k.

An in-house employee shall not conduct both lead abatement, interim controls, paint stabilization, standard treatments, ongoing lead-based paint maintenance, or rehabilitation and the clearance examination for this work. 70.6(9) A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct paint testing pursuant to 24 CFR Part 35 according to the following standards. Beginning March 1, 2000, paint testing pursuant to 24 CFR Part 35 shall be conducted only by a certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor . a. When conducting paint testing in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following procedures: (1) The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall test paint on each deteriorated paint surface and on each painted surface that will be disturbed or replaced. On windows, the window frame, interior windowsill, window sash, and window trough shall each be tested. (2) Paint shall be tested using adequate quality control by X-ray fluorescence or by laboratory analysis using a recognized laboratory to determine the presence of lead-based paint on a surface. If testing by laboratory analysis, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect paint samples using the documented methodologies specified in guidance documents issued by the department. If testing by X-ray fluorescence, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the following methodologies: 1. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use an X-ray fluorescence analyzer that has a performance characteristics sheet and shall use the X-ray fluorescence analyzer according to the performance characteristics sheet. 2. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall use the NIST 1.02 standard film or standards provided by the manufacturer for calibration of the X-ray fluorescence analyzer . The certified assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not state that any surface is free of lead-based paint unless the NIST 1.02 standard film is used for calibration. 3. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall take calibration readings consisting of an average of three readings at the beginning of the inspection. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 70, p. 51 4. If required by the performance characteristics sheet, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall conduct substrate correction for all XRF readings less than 4.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each substrate that requires substrate correction, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall completely remove all paint from an area of two dif ferent testing combinations for that substrate. If possible, the areas chosen for substrate correction should have initial XRF readings of less than 2.5 milligrams of lead per square centimeter . For each testing combination, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall remove paint from an area that is at least as lar ge as the XRF probe faceplate. On each of the two areas, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall place the NIST 1.02 standard film over the surface, and take three XRF readings with the XRF used to conduct the inspection. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall calculate the arithmetic mean for these six readings and shall subtract 1.02 from this arithmetic mean to obtain the substrate correction value. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall then subtract the substrate correction value from each XRF reading for the substrate requiring substrate correction to obtain the corrected XRF reading. For example, if the six readings taken on the NIST 1.02 standard film were 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.1, the arithmetic mean is calculated by the equation (1.1 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 1.1)/6 and is equal to 1.18. The substrate correction value is equal to 1.18 minus 1.02, or 0.16. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not conduct substrate correction where required by the performance characteristics sheet, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that all of the readings are positive and shall not state that a surface is free of lead-based paint. 5. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall classify each XRF reading that did not require substrate correction and each corrected XRF reading for XRF readings that required substrate correction as positive, negative, or inconclusive, according to the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF . The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall not discard XRF readings unless instructed to do so by the performance characteristics sheet or the operating instructions from the manufacturer . If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor believes that a reading classified as positive is in error , the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall collect a paint sample for laboratory analysis. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall change the positive classification to negative only if the results of the laboratory analysis indicate that the surface is not painted with lead-based paint. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor may assume that all inconclusive readings are positive and classify them as such. 6. The certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall resolve inconclusive readings as defined by the performance characteristics sheet for the XRF by collecting paint samples for laboratory analysis. If the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor does not resolve inconclusive readings by laboratory analysis, then the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall assume that the inconclusive readings are positive. b. If lead-based paint is identified through paint testing, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor must conduct a visual inspection to determine the presence of lead-based paint hazards and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated. c. A certified lead inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall prepare a written report for each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility where paint testing is conducted. No later than three weeks after the receipt of laboratory results, the certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall send a copy of the report to the property owner and to the person requesting the inspection, if dif ferent. A certified lead Ch 70, p. 52 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 inspector/risk assessor or a certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor shall maintain a copy of each written report for no less than three years. The report shall include, at least: (1) A statement that the inspection was conducted to determine whether lead-based paint is present on deteriorated paint surfaces and on painted surfaces that will be disturbed or replaced; (2) Date of the testing; (3) Address of building; (4) Date of construction; (5) Apartment numbers (if applicable); (6) The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or owners of each residential dwelling or child-occupied facility; (7) Name, signature, and certification number of each certified lead inspector/risk assessor or certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor conducting the paint testing; (8) Name, address, and telephone number of each laboratory conducting an analysis of collected samples; (9) Each testing method and sampling procedure employed for paint analysis, including quality control data and, if used, the manufacturer , serial number , software, and operating mode of any X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer; (10) XRF readings taken for calibration and calculations to demonstrate that the XRF is properly calibrated; (1 1) Specific locations by room of each painted component tested for the presence of lead-based paint and the results for each component expressed in terms appropriate to the sampling method used; (12) A statement that all painted or finished components that were not tested must be assumed to contain lead-based paint; (13) A description of the location, type, and severity of identified lead-based paint hazards, including the classification of each tested surface as to whether it is a lead-based paint hazard, and any other potential lead hazards, including bare soil in the dripline of a home where lead-based paint is identified on exterior components or lead-based paint previously existed on exterior components, but has been removed, enclosed, or encapsulated; (14) A description of interim controls and lead abatement options for each identified lead-based paint hazard and a suggested prioritization for addressing each hazard. If the use of an encapsulant or enclosure is recommended, the report shall recommend a maintenance and monitoring schedule for the encapsulant or enclosure; (15) Information regarding the owner ' s obligations to disclose known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards upon sale or lease of residential property as required by Subpart H of 24 CFR Part 35 and Subpart I of 40 CFR Part 745; and (16) Information about the notification regarding lead-based paint prior to renovation, remodeling, or repainting as required by 641\u2014Chapter 69. 70.6(10) A certified elevated blood lead (EBL) inspection agency shall maintain for a period of at least 10 years the written records for all elevated blood lead (EBL) inspections conducted by persons that the agency employs or contracts with to provide elevated blood lead (EBL) inspections in the agency' s service area. 70.6(1 1) A person may be certified as a lead inspector/risk assessor , sampling technician, or elevated blood lead (EBL) inspector/risk assessor and as a lead abatement contractor or lead abatement worker .

The vendor ' s average price for any category of WIC items, as reported on the application, at the time of the on-site review , and throughout the agreement period, shall not exceed 1 15 percent of the average price char ged for the same category by all other WIC vendors in the same peer group. Categories refer to the broad groupings of items rather than specific brands. For purposes of making the price comparisons, the average price for all other WIC vendors in the peer group shall be computed from the most recent Price Assessment Reports on file from those vendors. If a vendor intends to comply with this provision by char ging WIC participants a lower price than the price char ged to other customers, the WIC price for each approved item must be identified on the package or shelf front.

T o maintain program integrity and accountability for federal or state program funds, the department and contract agencies shall conduct ongoing monitoring of authorized vendors, both through on-site visits and through indirect means. A sample of 10 percent of currently authorized vendors receives on-site monitoring every year . V endors that change ownership during the year , or apply during the contract period, receive an on-site visit prior to signing an agreement. The types of on-site monitoring are defined as follows: a. Routine or representative monitoring is used for vendors for which there is no record of violations or complaints or other indication of problems. It may include any or all of the following: use of a food instrument or observation of a participant, educational buys, review of inventory levels, examination of redeemed WIC food instruments on hand, review of store policies on return items, and review of employee training procedures. The results of the monitoring are reviewed with the owner or manager on duty , and a follow-up letter confirming the findings is sent from the department. Routine monitoring may be performed by the department or by contract agency staf f under the direction of the department. Depending on the nature and severity of violations noted, the department may schedule additional visits, initiate a compliance investigation, or apply sanctions. Educational buy monitoring is a specialized type of routine monitoring. Department or contract agency staf f attempt to use a WIC food instrument to purchase unauthorized types or brands of foods to test the level of training of store employees. At the conclusion of the transaction, the results of the buy are discussed with the store owner or manager on duty . The transaction is then voided, and the merchandise returned to the shelves. Educational buys are used on authorized vendors selected by the department. If unauthorized items are allowed to be purchased, the vendor shall agree to a corrective action training plan. A follow-up educational buy is scheduled within 30 to 90 days. A letter is sent from the department documenting the violation. By signing a WIC agreement, a vendor gives consent for educational buys by the department or contract agency . V endors are not notified in advance that an educational buy is scheduled. The protocol for educational buys, including procedures, appropriate items to purchase, and forms to be used, is specified in the Iowa WIC Policy and Procedure Manual. b.

It allows the analysis of data collected via computer from the contract agencies and the state' s bank, from which patterns indicating compliance with or deviation from established patterns for Iowa WIC vendors emer ge. Data is collected daily and reviewed on an ongoing basis. T rends identified can necessitate another type of monitoring, depending on the nature of each exception. c. Compliance investigations may be used for any vendors. Compliance investigations will be conducted annually in a minimum percentage of vendors as mandated in federal regulations. A compliance investigation includes a suf ficient number of compliance buys to provide evidence of program noncompliance, two compliance buys in which no program violations are found, or when an inventory audit has been completed. A compliance buy means a covert, on-site investigation in which a representative of the program poses as a participant, parent or caretaker , or proxy , transacts one or more food instruments and does not reveal during the visit that he or she is a WIC representative. Compliance buys may be performed by the department or another state agency or private company under contract IAC 7/29/09 Public Health[641] Ch 73, p. 9 with the department. The department is responsible for identifying the vendors to be investigated and for approving the protocol to be used during the investigation. Upon completion of a compliance buy documenting program violations, the department shall issue the vendor a notice of violation points assessed unless such notification would hinder an investigation. The department also monitors vendor performance through in-of fice review of information. Such information, specifically the total amount of WIC redemptions, is confidential as provided for in Iowa Code section 22.7(6). This business information could provide an advantage to competitors and would serve no public purpose if made available. 641\u201473.9 (135) Food package.

Criteria for considering foods for inclusion in the approved food list are found in 73.9(3). b. Nutrition tailoring includes changes or substitutions to food types, forms, and quantities in order to prescribe food packages that better meet the nutritional needs of participants. T ailoring is done to reduce quantities of foods based on nutritional needs, to accommodate participant preferences, to accommodate household conditions such as lack of refrigeration or other special needs and problems of homeless or transient participants, and to recommend or prescribe specific forms of the allowable WIC foods based upon a participant' s nutritional needs or goals. c. Rescinded IAB 8/4/04, ef fective 9/8/04. 73.9(2) T ailoring to meet individual nutrition needs.

One or more transactions prior to notification of the vendor constitute only one violation if they contain the same error . The assignment of violation points does not limit the department' s right to ef fect stronger penalties and sanctions in cases in which there is evidence of an intentional or systematic practice of abusing or defrauding the Iowa WIC program.

The department may impose a civil money penalty (CMP) in lieu of a disqualification when it determines, in its sole discretion, that: (1) Disqualification of the vendor would result in inadequate participant access; or (2) The vendor had, at the time of the violation, an ef fective policy and program in ef fect to prevent traf ficking; and the ownership of the vendor was not aware of, did not approve of, and was not involved in the conduct of the violation. g. The following items do not have a point value, but shall result in or extend a disqualification period: (1) Failure to return WIC vendor stamp(s) to the WIC program within 10 days of ef fective date of disqualification, or expiration of agreement following denial of subsequent application, shall result in a 30-day extension of a disqualification period. (2) For each month in which a vendor accepts WIC food instruments during a disqualification period, the disqualification period shall be extended by 30 days. Ch 73, p. 20 Public Health[641] IAC 7/29/09 h.

The department is responsible for issuing all warning and disqualification letters. Contract agencies are informed of all vendor correspondence regarding violations. In situations where participant violations are also involved, the contract agency is responsible for follow-up, as detailed in subrule 73.19(1). l. Federal food stamp regulations require automatic disqualification from the food stamp program for vendors disqualified by the WIC program for certain types of violations. When a vendor is disqualified from the WIC program, the disqualification letter to the vendor will include the following statement: \"This disqualification from WIC may result in disqualification as a retailer in the food stamp program. Such disqualification may not be subject to administrative or judicial review under the food stamp program.\" For all vendor disqualifications from the WIC program, notice will be sent to the United States Department of Agriculture for appropriate action. m. The department shall disqualify a vendor who has been disqualified from the food stamp program. The disqualification shall be for the same length of time as the food stamp program disqualification, may begin at a later date than the food stamp program disqualification, and shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review under the WIC program. If the department determines that disqualification of a vendor would result in inadequate participant access, it will impose a civil money penalty (CMP) in lieu of disqualification. n.

Hospitals within the state shall determine whether to participate in Iowa' s regionalized system of perinatal health care and shall select the hospital' s level of participation in the regionalized system. A hospital having determined to participate in the regionalized system shall comply with the rules appropriate to the level of participation selected by the hospital. Iowa' s regionalized system of perinatal health care helps practitioners in rural Iowa to rapidly access specialty services for their patients even though such services may not exist in the local community . This is predicated on several factors, including the willingness of certain hospitals in moderate-to-lar ge Iowa cities to provide specialty services and the presence of a functional system of patient transportation. These rules address how participating Iowa hospitals relate to the regionalized system and suggest a level of functioning which should identify the role each participating hospital plays in the system. The following rules present a description of the levels of care among Iowa perinatal hospitals. The levels are as follows: Level I hospital, Level II hospital, Level II regional center , Level II regional neonatology center , and Level III center . The department is very much aware of the need for or ganization of limited resources in a rural state. Accordingly , the rules are designed to encourage and support the presence of a Level II regional center in areas not populous enough to support a Level III center . These rules are not meant to hold Iowa hospitals and Iowa perinatal professionals to an impractical ideal. Although the rules are clearly not intended to serve as standards, they do specify particulars when feasible. For example, specification of a designated level of care for a hospital should be clearly evident from the descriptions. Levels of care are designated by the functional capacity of the hospital. Thus, it may be possible to have a number of Level II hospitals or Level III centers in one city . The primary purpose of designation is to ensure Iowa perinatal patients appropriate care as close to their homes as possible. In an ideal situation, no community hospital would be more than 50 miles from a perinatal center . Unfortunately , Iowa' s low population density precludes this. Accordingly , Iowa developed a network of regional centers. The further intent of these rules is to ensure that when a hospital markets itself at a particular level of perinatal care, it is capable of providing that care. The public is entitled to know the level of functioning. The rules provide the framework to be used in defining and evaluating the level of perinatal services being of fered. 641\u2014150.2 (135,77GA,ch1221) Definitions. For the purpose of these rules, the following definitions shall apply: \"Categorization\" means a preliminary determination by the department that a hospital is capable of providing perinatal care at Level I, Level II, Level II regional, Level II regional neonatology center , or Level III care capabilities. \"Certificate of verification\" means a document awarded by the department that identifies a hospital' s level of perinatal care and term of verification at that level. \"Department\" means the Iowa department of public health. \"Dir ector\" means the director of the Iowa department of public health. \"Hospital\" means a facility licensed under Iowa Code chapter 135B or a comparable facility located and licensed in another state. \"On-site verification survey\" means an on-site survey conducted by the department' s statewide perinatal care program based at the University of Iowa hospitals and clinics to assess a hospital' s ability to meet the level of designation selected by the hospital. \"Perinatal advisory committee\" means the committee that provides review and counsel to the statewide perinatal care program based at the University of Iowa hospitals and clinics. \"Perinatal guidelines advisory committee\" means the committee that provides consultation to the department regarding these rules for the regionalized system of perinatal health care. \"Regionalized system of perinatal health car e\" means the department' s program for the provision of appropriate perinatal care as close to patients' homes as possible. Ch 150, p. 2 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 \"Respiratory distr ess\" means tachypnea (respiratory per minute), grunting, tugging, retracting, nasal flaring, or cyanosis. Any or all of these may constitute respiratory distress. \"Statewide perinatal health car e pr ogram\" means the educational team based at the University of Iowa hospitals and clinics and retained by the department of public health. \"V erification\" means a process by which the department certifies a hospital' s capacity to provide perinatal care in accordance with criteria established for Level I hospitals, Level II hospitals, Level II regional centers, Level II regional neonatology centers, and Level III centers under these rules. 641\u2014150.3 (135,77GA,ch1221) Perinatal guidelines advisory committee. 150.3(1) Purpose.

Level I hospitals provide basic inpatient care for pregnant women and newborns without complications; manage perinatal emer gencies, including neonatal resuscitation; provide leadership in early risk identification before and after birth; seek consultation or referral for high-risk patients; and provide public and professional education. 150.6(2) Functions. Level I hospitals have a family-centered philosophy . Parents have reasonable access to their newborns 24 hours a day within all functional units and are encouraged to participate in the care of their newborns. Generally , parents can be with their newborns in the mother ' s room. Noninfectious siblings may visit in the mother ' s room or in a designated space. Level I hospitals have the capability to: a. Provide surveillance and care of all patients admitted to the obstetric service with an established triage system for identifying high-risk patients who should be transferred to a facility that provides Level II or higher care, prior to delivery; b. Provide proper detection and supportive care of unanticipated maternal-fetal problems that occur during labor and delivery; Ch 150, p. 4 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 c. Perform emer gency Cesarean sections as soon as possible after the decision to do the operation has been made; d. Provide transfusions of blood and fresh frozen plasma on a 24-hour basis; e. Provide anesthesia, pharmacy , radiology , respiratory support, electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring, and laboratory services on a 24-hour basis; f. Provide care of postpartum conditions; g. Evaluate the condition of healthy neonates and their continuing care until dischar ge; h. Resuscitate all neonates using the neonatal resuscitation program guidelines as published by the American Heart Association/American Academy of Pediatrics; i. Stabilize all neonates including unexpectedly small or sick neonates before transfer; j. Consult and arrange transfers in conjunction with the obstetrician, pediatrician or neonatologist at the referral center; k. Maintain a nursery for normal-term or near -term newborns. 150.6(3) Physical facilities. Physical facilities for perinatal care in hospitals should be conducive to care that meets the normal physiologic and psychosocial needs of mothers, neonates, fathers, and families. Special facilities should be available when deviations from the norm require uninterrupted physiologic, biochemical, and clinical observations of patients throughout the perinatal period. Labor , delivery , and newborn care facilities should be located contiguously . The following recommendations are intended as general guidelines and are meant to be flexible enough to meet local needs. It is recognized that individual limitations of physical facilities for perinatal care may impede strict adherence to the recommendations. Furthermore, not all hospitals will have all the functional units described. Provisions for individual units should be consistent within the framework of a regionalized perinatal care system and the state and local public health regulations. a. Obstetric functional units. (1) Labor . Areas used for women in labor are equipped with the following components: 1. Adequate space for support persons, personnel, and equipment; 2. Adequate ventilation and temperature control; 3. A labor or birthing bed; 4. A storage area for the patient' s clothing and personal belongings; 5. Adjustable lighting that is pleasant for the patient and adequate for examinations; 6. An emer gency signal and an intercommunication system; 7. A sphygmomanometer and stethoscope; 8. Mechanical infusion equipment; 9. Fetal monitoring equipment; 10. Oxygen and suction outlets; 1 1. Access to at least one shower for use by labor patients; and 12. Storage facilities for supplies and equipment. (2) Delivery . 1. Delivery rooms should be close to the labor rooms in order to af ford easy access and to provide privacy to women in labor . A waiting area for families should be adjacent to the delivery suite, and restrooms should be located nearby . 2. T raditional delivery rooms and Cesarean birth rooms are similar in design to operating rooms. V aginal deliveries can be performed in either room, whereas Cesarean birth rooms are designed especially for that purpose and are thus lar ger . Each type of birthing room is well lighted and environmentally controlled to prevent chilling of the mother and neonate. 3. It is desirable that Cesarean deliveries be performed in the obstetric unit; however , if this is not possible due to cost and space, equipment for neonatal stabilization and resuscitation, as described herein under 150.6(3) \"b\" (1), is available during delivery . 4. Each delivery room is maintained as a separate unit with the following equipment and supplies necessary for normal delivery and for the management of complications: Delivery/operating table that allows variation in position for delivery; Instrument table and solution basin stand; IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 150, p. 5 Instruments and equipment for vaginal delivery , repair of laceration, Cesarean delivery , and the management of obstetric emer gencies; Solutions and equipment for the intravenous administration of fluids; Equipment for administration of all types of anesthesia, including equipment for emer gency resuscitation of the mother; Individual oxygen, air , and suction outlets for mother and neonate; An emer gency call system; Mirrors for patients to observe the birth; W all clock with a second hand; Equipment for fetal heart rate monitoring; and Scrub sinks with controls strategically placed to allow observation of the patient. 5. 5. T rays containing drugs and equipment necessary for emer gency treatment of both mother and neonate are kept in the delivery room area. Equipment necessary for the treatment of cardiac arrest is easily accessible. (3) Postpartum care. The postpartum unit is flexible enough to permit comfortable accommodation of patients when the patient census is at its peak and use of beds for alternate functions when the patient census is low . Ideally , single-occupancy rooms should be provided; however , not more than two patients should share one room. If possible, each room in the postpartum unit should have its own toilet and hand-washing facilities. When this is not possible and it is necessary for patients to use common facilities, patients should be able to reach them without entering a general corridor . When the newborn rooms-in with the mother , the room should have hand-washing facilities, a mobile bassinet unit, and supplies necessary for the care of the newborn. (4) Combined units (labor/delivery/recovery or labor/delivery/recovery/postpartum room). 1. Comprehensive obstetric and neonatal care can be provided to the low-risk and the high-risk parturient and infant and the family in a single room. A homelike, family-centered environment with the capability for providing high-risk care is a key design criterion for both the labor/delivery/recovery (LDR) and labor/delivery/recovery/postpartum (LDRP) rooms. Each room is equipped for all types of delivery except Cesarean deliveries or those that may require general anesthesia. 2. During the labor , delivery , and recovery phases, care can be provided in an LDR room or can be extended to include the postpartum period in an LDRP room. 3. Nurses providing care in combined units are knowledgeable in antepartum care, labor and delivery , postpartum care, and neonatal care, making the use of staf f cost-ef fective and increasing the continuity and quality of care. b. Neonatal functional units. (1) Resuscitation/stabilization. 1. A resuscitation and stabilization bed should be available in the immediate area of delivery for those neonates who require it. Contingent upon their condition, neonates are moved from this area to the nursery for admission and stabilization and possible transfer to a Level II regional center or Level III center . 2. The resuscitation area contains the following items: Overhead source of radiant heat that can be regulated based on the infant' s temperature; radiant warmers with accommodations for X-ray capabilities are recommended; Thin resuscitation/examination mattress that allows access on three sides; W all clock; Equipment and medications as recommended by the neonatal resuscitation program. This includes a laryngoscope with infant-sized blades, endotracheal tubes, and resuscitation (breathing) bags with masks for full-term and preterm neonates; Oxygen, compressed air and suction sources that are separate from those for the mother; Equipment for examination, immediate care, and identification of the neonate. 3. The resuscitation area is usually within the delivery room, although it may be in a designated, contiguous, separate room. If resuscitation takes place in the delivery room, the area is lar ge enough to ensure that the resuscitation of the neonate can be achieved without interference with or from the ongoing Ch 150, p. 6 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 care of the mother . Following stabilization of the neonate, the newborn' s vital signs must be maintained (e.g., by using prewarmed blankets). The room temperature is kept at a level higher than that customary for patient rooms or operating suites. Qualified nursing staf f is available to assess the newborn during this period. (2) Admission/observation (transitional care stabilization). 1. The admission/observation area is for careful assessment of the neonate' s condition during the first 24 hours after birth (i.e., during the period of physiologic adjustment to extrauterine life). This assessment may take place within one or more functional areas (e.g., the room in which the mother is recovering, the LDRP room, the newborn nursery , or a separate admission/observation area). In some hospitals, the newborn nursery is the primary area for transitional care, both for neonates born within the hospital and for those born outside the hospital. 2. The admission/observation area should be near the delivery/Cesarean birth room. If it is part of the maternal recovery area, which is preferable, physical separation of the mother and newborn during this period can be avoided. 3. The capacity of the admission/observation area depends on the size of the delivery service and the duration of close observation. The admission/observation area is well lighted, has a wall clock, and contains emer gency resuscitation equipment similar to that in the designated resuscitation area. 4. The physicians' and registered nurses' assessments of the neonate' s condition determine the subsequent level of care. Most neonates are transferred from the admission/observation area to the newborn nursery or to the postpartum area for rooming-in. Some neonates may require transfer to another facility . Consultation with a pediatrician or neonatologist and possible referral to a hospital of fering a higher level of care should be initiated for infants with respiratory distress or those infants requiring oxygen therapy for more than two hours. (3) Newborn nursery . Routine care of apparently normal full-term neonates who have demonstrated successful adaptation to extrauterine life may be provided either in the newborn nursery or in the area where the mother is receiving postpartum care. The nursery should be relatively close to the postpartum area. The newborn nursery is well lighted, has a lar ge wall clock, and is equipped for emer gency resuscitation. 150.6(4) Medical personnel. a. The obstetric/newborn care area is under the supervision of a board-eligible or board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, pediatrician or a physician with special interest and experience in obstetrics or pediatrics. b. Adequate anesthesia coverage by a qualified anesthesia provider is available in a timely fashion for emer gency situations on a 24-hour -a-day , 7-day-a-week basis. c. For Cesarean sections or if neonatal problems are anticipated during vaginal delivery , a second physician or attendant who is skilled in resuscitation and care of the neonate should be in attendance. 150.6(5) Nursing personnel. Nurses assigned to the obstetrical/neonatal service demonstrate competency in the care of the mother and infant. a. Staffing. Registered nurses assigned to the obstetrical/neonatal service must be licensed to practice in Iowa, complete an obstetrical or neonatal orientation and demonstrate obstetrical or neonatal competencies as defined by each hospital. At least one of these registered nurses must be available at all times. The primary responsibility of the registered nurse is the delivery of nursing care and departmental or ganization. b. Labor/delivery/immediate postpartum/newborn. (1) A registered nurse is responsible for the admission assessment of the gravida in labor , as well as continuing assessment and support of the mother and fetus during labor , delivery and the early postpartum period. (2) A registered nurse is responsible for the admission assessment of the newborn, as well as continuing assessment during the stabilization period. (3) Licensed practical nurses, nursing assistants and other appropriate technical personnel may assist in the care of the gravida in labor , but should be under the direct supervision of the registered nurse. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 150, p. 7 c. Later postpartum period/newborn car e. (1) Nursing care of the mother and newborn is directed and supervised by a registered nurse. A licensed practical nurse may provide care for patients without complications. (2) Nurses have a supporting and teaching role in assisting mothers to care for their infants. This should be recognized and fostered. 150.6(6) Outr each education. Level I hospitals should assume an active role in the development and coordination of wellness and preventive programs concerning maternal/child health at the community level (e.g., programs on family planning, family-life education, parenting, breast feeding, cessation of smoking). 150.6(7) Allied health personnel and services. Level I hospitals have available, but are not limited to, the following allied health personnel and services: a. Registered dietitian with knowledge of maternal and neonatal nutrition management; b. Social worker; c. Bioengineer g. Pathology . 150.6(8) Infection contr ol. a. Each hospital establishes written policies and procedures for assessing the health of personnel assigned to the perinatal care services and those who have significant contact with the newborn. This includes restricting their contact with patients when necessary . These policies and procedures include screening for tuberculosis and rubella. Routine culturing of specimens obtained from personnel is not useful, although selective culturing may be of value when a pattern of infection is suspected. b. No special or separate isolation facilities are required for neonates born at home or in transit to the hospital. Detailed descriptions of the isolation categories and requirements should be available in each hospital' s infection control manual. 150.6(9) Newborn safety . The protection of infants is the responsibility of all personnel in a facility . Infants are to be transported in a bassinet or stroller and should never be carried. Infants are transported one at a time and are never grouped in a hallway without direct supervision. Infants should always be within the sight and supervision of staf f, the mother , or other family members or friends designated by the mother . Each hospital has a policy established that addresses strategies to promote infant safety . 150.6(10) Maternal-fetal transport. Maternal-fetal transport is an essential component of modern perinatal care. All facilities in the state providing obstetrics need to be familiar with their own resources and capabilities in dealing with obstetrical and neonatal complications. In most instances, maternal-fetal transport is preferable to neonatal transport. Each hospital, when transporting or accepting a transport, needs a system in place to facilitate a smooth transition of care in the most expeditious manner possible. The majority of maternal-fetal transports can be carried out by ground transportation. It is important for ambulance services to be equipped for maternal-fetal transport and have appropriately trained staf f. 641\u2014150.7 (135,77GA,ch1221) Level II hospitals. 150.7(1) Definition. Level II hospitals provide the same care and services as Level I hospitals plus they provide management of certain high-risk pregnancies and services for newborns with selected complications. These hospitals deliver approximately 500 or more babies annually and have an obstetrician and pediatrician on staf f. The perinatal unit is under the co-direction of a pediatrician and an obstetrician. 150.7(2) Functions. In addition to the functions of Level I hospitals, Level II hospitals have the capability to: a. Manage selected high-risk pregnancies. b. At a minimum, manage neonates of 34 weeks and greater gestation. c. Manage recovering neonates who can be appropriately transferred from the referral center . d. Maintain a special area designated for the care of sick neonates. Ch 150, p. 8 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 e. Maintain nursing personnel with demonstrated competency in the care of sick neonates. f. Maintain nursing personnel with demonstrated competency in the care of high-risk mothers. Consultation with a pediatrician or neonatologist and possible referral to a higher -level perinatal center should be initiated for infants requiring oxygen therapy for more than six hours or ventilatory care for more than two hours. 150.7(3) Physical facilities. Level II hospitals have the same physical facilities as Level I hospitals. 150.7(4) Medical personnel. Level II hospitals have the same medical personnel as Level I hospitals. In addition, the perinatal units in Level II hospitals are under the co-direction/supervision of either a board-eligible or board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist or a board-eligible or board-certified pediatrician for their respective areas. Allied medical specialists in various disciplines are on staf f, including specialists in internal medicine, radiology , and pathology . Psychiatric services are available. 150.7(5) Nursing personnel. Level II hospitals have the same minimal requirements for nursing personnel as Level I hospitals. Nursing orientation and competencies in a Level II hospital are specific to the patient population they serve. 150.7(6) Outr each education. Level II hospitals have the same responsibility for outreach education as Level I hospitals. 150.7(7) Allied health personnel and services. Level II hospitals have the same allied health personnel and services available as Level I hospitals, with the addition of the following: a. Respiratory therapy . b. Ultrasound. 150.7(8) Infection contr ol. Infection control guidelines are the same as for Level I hospitals. 150.7(9) Newborn safety . Level II hospitals have at least the same requirements for newborn safety as Level I hospitals. 150.7(10) Maternal-fetal transport. Level II hospitals have the same requirements for maternal-fetal transport as Level I hospitals. In addition, Level II hospitals are expected to accept patient referrals when appropriate. A critical function of providers at Level II hospitals is to communicate with the providers at Level I hospitals in deciding whether a particular patient should be transported to the Level II hospital. Careful assessment of the hospital' s capabilities for perinatal management will be critical in these decisions. This information will need to be disseminated among the hospital staf f. Providers of obstetric care need to know the critical gestational age limitations for their particular nursery . Below this gestational age, maternal-fetal transport should be utilized if delivery is anticipated and the circumstances permit. 150.7(1 1) Perinatal car e committee. a. All Level II hospitals maintain a perinatal care committee. Members of this committee should represent, but not be limited to, the fields of obstetrics, pediatrics, family practice, nursing, administration, laboratory , respiratory therapy , anesthesia and social services. b. Responsibilities of the perinatal care committee include the following: (1) Develop policies for the unit including provisions to ensure adequate patient care by qualified providers. (2) Conduct a meeting at least semiannually to resolve problems related to the unit. (3) Review educational activities conducted by the unit. (4) Serve as a general liaison between the various groups represented on the committee. 641\u2014150.8 (135,77GA,ch1221) Level II r egional centers. 150.8(1) Definition. a. Level II regional centers have a developed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The sizes of the units vary because of the dif fering demands in the various regions in Iowa. Accordingly , a Level II regional center may have as few as four neonatal intensive care beds. b. The obstetric service in a Level II regional center provides services for maternity patients at higher risk than those in Level II hospitals because of the presence of an NICU. However , reasonable ef forts should be expended to transfer those patients whose newborns are likely to require a higher intensity of care not available in the Level II regional center but of fered in a Level III center . IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 150, p. 9 c. Level II regional centers provide the same care and services as Level II hospitals. In addition, Level II regional centers have the following dif ferentiating characteristics: (1) A defined referral area; (2) A defined relationship with a Level III center either in Iowa or a contiguous state; (3) A minimum of three pediatricians and three obstetricians on staf f; and (4) The ability to manage patients at higher risk than Level I or Level II hospitals. Complexity of care is determined by the training and experience of physicians and nursing staf f and extent of support services available. 150.8(2) Functions. Level II regional centers have the same functions as Level II hospitals. In addition, Level II regional centers have the capability to: a. Accept selected maternal transports based on criteria developed in conjunction with the Level III center; b. Maintain nursing personnel demonstrating competency in the care of high-risk mothers; c. Maintain a defined neonatal intensive care unit; d. Maintain nursing personnel that demonstrate competency in the care of infants in neonatal intensive care; e. Provide care for infants requiring ventilatory support; f. Maintain a functioning neonatal transport team for the regional area served; and g. Provide for follow-up care of high-risk newborns in accordance with the Iowa high-risk infant follow-up program. 150.8(3) Physical facilities. Level II regional centers have the same physical facilities as Level II hospitals with the addition of the following. a. Obstetric functional units. (1) Labor/delivery . Patients who have significant medical or obstetric complications are cared for in a room especially equipped with cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and other monitoring equipment necessary for observation and special care. It is preferable that this room be located in the labor and delivery area and meet the physical requirements of any other intensive care room in the hospital. When patients with significant medical or obstetric complications are cared for in the labor and delivery area, the unit has the same capabilities as an intensive care unit. (2) Postpartum. Lar ger services may have a specific recovery room for postpartum patients with a separate area for high-risk patients. Required equipment is similar to that needed in any sur gical recovery room and includes equipment for monitoring vital signs, suctioning, administering oxygen, and infusing fluids intravenously . Cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment must be immediately available. b. Neonatal functional units. (1) Continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring and constant nursing care and other support for severely ill infants are provided in the intensive care area. Because emer gency care is provided in this area, laboratory and radiological services are readily available 24 hours a day . The results of blood gas analysis are available soon after blood sample collection. (2) The neonatal intensive care area should be near the delivery/Cesarean birth room and should be easily accessible from the hospital' s ambulance entrance. It should be away from routine hospital traf fic. (3) The amount and complexity of equipment are considerably greater than required in Level I and Level II nurseries. Equipment and supplies in the intensive care area include the same items as needed in the resuscitation and intermediate care areas. Immediate availability of emer gency oxygen is essential. Continuous monitoring of delivered oxygen concentrations, patient oxygenation, body temperature, ECG, respirations and blood pressure should be available. Supplies should be kept close to the patient station so that nurses are not away from the neonate unnecessarily and may use their time and skills ef ficiently . 150.8(4) Medical personnel. a. Level II regional centers have the same medical personnel as Level II hospitals with the addition of a board-eligible or board-certified pediatrician serving as director of the NICU. This physician maintains a consultative relationship with Level III physicians. Additionally , Level II regional centers have a minimum of three pediatricians and three obstetricians on staf f. Ch 150, p. 10 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 b. If an infant is placed on mechanical ventilation, a physician, nurse practitioner , physician assistant, or appropriate person capable of airway management and experienced in diagnosis is available in-house on a 24-hour basis. 150.8(5) Nursing personnel. Level II regional centers have the same minimal requirements for nursing personnel as Level II hospitals. Additionally , Level II regional center registered nurses have demonstrated competency in high-risk obstetrics or neonatal care. 150.8(6) Outr each education. Outreach education is provided to each hospital in the referral area at least once per year . This can be achieved by one or more of the following: a. Sponsoring an annual conference; b. V isiting Level I and Level II hospitals; c. Providing educational programs at the regional center for the staf f members of the Level I and Level II hospitals; d. Sending written educational materials to the Level I and II hospitals. 150.8(7) Allied health personnel and services. Level II regional centers have the same allied health personnel and services available as Level II hospitals, with the addition of the following: a. A respiratory therapist, certified lab technician/blood gas technician and an X-ray technologist should be in-house on a 24-hour basis when a neonate is being managed on mechanical ventilation. b. Allied personnel should have special training and an interest in high-risk mothers and infants. 150.8(8) Infection contr ol. Infection control guidelines are the same as for Level II hospitals. 150.8(9) Newborn safety . Level II regional centers have at least the same requirements for newborn safety as Level II hospitals. 150.8(10) Maternal-fetal transport. Level II regional centers have the same requirements for maternal-fetal transport as Level II hospitals. In addition, Level II regional centers are expected to provide transportation services. 150.8(1 1) Perinatal car e committee. Level II regional centers have at least the same requirements for a perinatal care committee as Level II hospitals. 641\u2014150.9 (135,77GA,ch1221) Level II r egional neonatology centers. 150.9(1) Definition. a. Level II regional neonatology centers provide the same care and services as Level II regional centers with the addition of a demonstrated commitment to providing a higher level of neonatology care. The Level II regional neonatology center will manage high-risk pregnancies and infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation or weighing less than 1500 grams. Exceptions will be cases for which sur gical intervention or pediatric subspecialty care is anticipated or needed. b. The obstetric service in a Level II regional neonatology center provides services for maternity patients at higher risk than those in Level II hospitals because of the presence of an NICU. However , reasonable ef forts should be expended to transfer those patients whose newborns are likely to require a higher intensity of care not available in the Level II regional neonatology center but of fered in a Level III center . Ef forts should also be made to transfer those patients to a Level III center when the pregnancy has risk factors that require the care of a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. c. Level II regional neonatology centers provide the same care and services as Level II regional centers. In addition, Level II regional neonatology centers have the following dif ferentiating characteristics: (1) A defined referral area; (2) A defined relationship with a Level III center either in Iowa or a contiguous state; (3) A minimum of two board-eligible or board-certified neonatal/perinatal medicine subspecialists on staf f; (4) Neonatology care available on a continuous 24-hour basis, with at least three obstetricians on staf f; and (5) A medical director in the neonatal intensive care unit who is a full-time, board-eligible or board-certified pediatrician with board eligibility or certification in neonatal/perinatal medicine. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 150, p. 1 1 150.9(2) Functions. Level II regional neonatology centers have the same functions as Level II regional centers. a. Accept selected maternal transports based on criteria developed in conjunction with the Level III center; b. Maintain nursing personnel demonstrating competency in the care of high-risk mothers; c. Maintain a defined neonatal intensive care unit; d. Maintain nursing personnel that demonstrate competency in the care of infants in neonatal intensive care; e. Provide care for infants requiring ventilatory support; f. Maintain a functioning neonatal transport team for the regional area served; and g. Provide for follow-up care of high-risk newborns in accordance with the Iowa high-risk infant follow-up program. 150.9(3) Physical facilities. Level II regional neonatology centers have the same physical facilities as Level II regional centers; however , they have special equipment for infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation or weighing less than 1500 grams, and they serve a more complicated patient population. 150.9(4) Medical personnel. a. Level II regional neonatology centers have the same medical personnel as Level II regional centers. b. The medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit is a full-time, board-eligible or board-certified pediatrician with certification in neonatal/perinatal medicine. This physician maintains a consultative relationship with Level III physicians. c. Anesthesia providers on staf f have special training or experience in obstetric and pediatric anesthesia. d. A pediatric cardiologist is active on staf f. e.

Use of information limited to pr evention of multiple enr ollments. Any information disclosed to the central registry to prevent multiple enrollments may not be redisclosed by the registry or such information used for any other purpose than the prevention of multiple enrollments unless so authorized by court order in accordance with 42 CFR, Part 2, ef fective June 9, 1987. d. Permitted disclosur e by the central r egistry to pr event a multiple enr ollment. If a program petitions the central registry , and an identified client/patient is enrolled in another program, the registry may disclose: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the program in which the client/patient is currently enrolled to the inquiring program; and (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the inquiring program to the program in which the client/patient is currently enrolled. The programs may communicate as necessary to verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple enrollment. 155.35(4) Admission r equir ements. a. Prior to or at the time of a client/patient' s admission to an opioid treatment program, the program shall conduct a comprehensive assessment so as to determine appropriateness for admission. b. The program shall verify , to the extent possible, the client/patient' s name, address, and date of birth. c. The program physician shall determine and document in the client/patient' s record that the client/patient is physiologically dependent on narcotic substances and has been so dependent for at least one year prior to admission. A one-year history of addiction means that the client/patient was physiologically dependent on a narcotic at a time one year before admission to a program and was addicted for most of the year preceding admission. (1) When physiological addiction cannot be clearly documented, the program physician or an appropriately trained staf f member designated and supervised by the physician shall record in the client/patient' s record the criteria used to determine the client/patient' s current physiologic dependence and history of addiction. In the latter circumstance, the program physician shall review , date, and countersign the supervised staf f member ' s evaluation to demonstrate the physician' s agreement with the evaluation. The program physician shall make the final determination concerning a client/patient' s physiologic dependence and history of addiction. The program physician also shall sign, date, and record a statement that the physician has reviewed all the documented evidence to support a one-year history of addiction and the current physiologic dependence and that in the physician' s reasonable clinical judgment the client/patient fulfills the requirements for admission to maintenance treatment. Before the program administers any medication to the client/patient, the program physician shall complete and record the statement documenting addiction and current physiologic dependence. (2) When a client/patient has voluntarily left an opioid treatment program in good standing and seeks readmission within two years of dischar ge, the program shall document the following information: 1. Prior opioid treatment of six months or more; and 2. The program physician shall enter in the client/patient' s record that in the physician' s medical judgment treatment is warranted. d. The program shall collect a drug screening sample for analysis. Where dependence is substantially verified through other indicators, a negative drug screen will not necessarily preclude admission to the program. e. Prior to admission, the program shall confirm with the central registry that the client/patient is not currently enrolled in another opioid treatment program. f. If a potential client/patient has previously been enrolled in another program, the admitting program shall request from the previous program a copy of the client/patient' s assessment data, treatment IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 155, p. 41 plan, and dischar ge summary including the type of or reason for dischar ge. All programs subject to these rules shall promptly respond to such a request upon receipt of a valid release of information. g. A person under the age of 18 is required to have had two documented attempts at short-term detoxification or drug-free treatment to be eligible for maintenance treatment. A one-week waiting period is required after such a detoxification attempt, however , before an attempt is repeated. The program physician shall document in the client/patient' s record that the client/patient continues to be, or is again, physiologically dependent on narcotic drugs. h. Program staf f shall ensure that a client/patient is voluntarily participating in the program, and the client/patient shall sign a Consent to T reatment Form. i. Pregnant client/patients may be admitted to opioid treatment with the following provisions: (1) Evidence of current physiological dependency is not needed if the program physician certifies the pregnancy and, in the physician' s reasonable judgment, finds treatment to be justified. Documentation of all findings and justifications for admission shall be documented in the client/patient' s record by the program physician prior to the initial dose of methadone. (2) Pregnant client/patients shall be of fered comprehensive prenatal care. If the program cannot provide prenatal services, the program shall assist the client/patient in obtaining such services and shall coordinate ongoing care with the collateral provider . (3) The program physician shall document that the client/patient has been informed of the possible risks to the unborn child from the use of medication and the risks of continued use of illicit substances. (4) Should a program have a waiting list for admission to the program, pregnant client/patients shall be given priority . 155.35(5) Placement, admission and assessment. The program shall have written criteria for considering an individual for placement and admission. In addition, the program shall maintain current procedures to ensure that patients are admitted to maintenance treatment by qualified staf f who have determined by using accepted medical criteria such as those outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM IV) that the person is currently addicted to an opioid drug. a. The program shall have written policies and procedures governing a uniform process that defines: (1) The types of information to be gathered on all individuals upon admission; (2) Procedures to be followed when accepting referrals from outside agencies or or ganizations; (3) The types of records to be kept on all individuals applying for services. b. The client/patient assessment (psychosocial history) shall be an analysis and synthesis of the client/patient' s status, and shall address the client/patient' s strengths, problems, and areas of clinical concern. It shall be developed within the period of time between admission and the first review date specified for that particular level of care within the continued stay review process. This initial assessment upon admission to treatment services is an expansion of information on the six categories contained within the placement screening document. c. When an individual refuses to divulge information or to follow the recommended course of treatment, this refusal shall be noted in the case record. d. At the time of admission, documentation shall be made that the individual has been informed of: (1) General nature and goals of the program; (2) Rules governing client/patient conduct and infractions that can lead to disciplinary action or dischar ge from the program; (3) The hours during which the services are available; (4) T reatment costs, if any , to be borne by the client/patient; (5) Client/patient rights and responsibilities; (6) Confidentiality laws, rules and regulations; and (7) Information on preventing exposure to and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. Ch 155, p. 42 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 e. Suf ficient information shall be collected during the admission process so that the assessment process allows for the development of a complete assessment of the client/patient' s status and a comprehensive plan of treatment can be developed. f. The results of the screening and admission process shall be clearly explained to the client/patient, and to the client/patient' s family when appropriate. This shall be documented in the client/patient record. g. The program physician or designee, who is a qualified medical professional, shall complete a medical evaluation and a current psychological/mental status evaluation of the client/patient prior to the administration of the initial dose of medication. If the history and current psychological/mental status evaluation is completed by an individual other than the program physician, the program shall document in the client/patient' s case record that this information was reviewed by the program physician prior to the initial dosage of medication. The medical evaluation shall include but not be limited to: (1) A complete medical history; (2) An assessment of the client/patient' s current psychological and mental status; (3) A physical examination including examination for: 1. Pulmonary , liver , or cardiac abnormalities; 2. Infectious disease; and 3. Dermatologic sequela of addiction. (4) Laboratory tests including: 1. Serological test for syphilis; and 2. Urine screening for drugs. (5) Intradermal PPD (tuberculosis skin test) and review of tetanus immunization status; and (6) When indicated, an EKG, chest X-ray , pap smear , pregnancy test, sickle cell screening, complete blood count and white cell dif ferential, multiphasic chemistry profile, routine and microscopic urinalysis, or other tests indicated by the client/patient' s condition. 155.35(6) T r eatment plans. Based upon the initial assessment, an individualized written treatment plan shall be developed and recorded in the client/patient' s case record. a. A treatment plan shall be developed and shall delineate the client/patient' s immediate needs and actions required to meet these needs. b. The treatment plan shall be developed as soon after the client/patient' s admission as is clinically feasible, but no later than 30 days following admission to an outpatient opioid maintenance treatment program. c. The individualized treatment plan shall minimally contain: (1) A clear and concise statement of client/patient' s current strengths and needs; (2) Clear and concise statements of the short- and long-term goals the client/patient will be attempting to achieve; (3) T ype and frequency of therapeutic activities in which the client/patient will be participating; (4) The staf f person(s) to be responsible for the client/patient' s treatment; and (5) The specific criteria to be met for successful completion of treatment. d. T reatment plans shall be developed in partnership with the client/patient. Comprehensive treatment plans shall be reviewed by the primary counselor and the client/patient as often as necessary , but no less than every 90 days during the first year and semiannually each subsequent year for opioid treatment modalities. T reatment plans shall be reviewed by the program physician on an annual basis. e. The reviews shall consist of a reassessment of the client/patient' s current status to include accomplishments and needs and a redefining of treatment goals when appropriate. The date of the review and any change, as well as the individuals involved in the review , shall also be recorded. f. The use of abstract terms, jar gon, or slang should be avoided in the treatment plan, and the plan should be written in a manner readily understandable to the average client/patient. The program shall provide the client/patient with copies of all treatment plans upon request. g. T reatment plans shall be culturally and environmentally specific so as to meet the needs of the client/patient. T reatment plans shall be written in a manner readily understandable to the average person or with assistance available to illiterate, handicapped, or mentally impaired client/patients. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 155, p. 43 155.35(7) Pr ogr ess notes. A client/patient' s progress and current status in meeting the goals set in the treatment plan, as well as ef forts by staf f members to help the client/patient achieve these stated goals, shall be recorded in the client/patient' s case record. Such information will be noted following each individual counseling session. Group therapy progress notes shall be recorded following each session or summarized at least weekly . a. Entries shall be filed in chronological order and shall include the date services were provided or observations made, the date the entry was made, the signature or initials and staf f title of the individual rendering the services. All progress notes shall be entered into the client/patient case record in permanent pen, typewriter , or by computer . b. All entries that involve subjective interpretations of a client/patient' s progress should be supplemented with a description of the actual behavioral observations which were the basis for the interpretation. c. The use of abstract terms, jar gon, or slang should be avoided in progress notes. d. If a client/patient is receiving services from an outside resource, the program shall attempt to secure a written copy of status reports and other client/patient records from that resource. e. The program shall develop a uniform progress notes format to be used by all clinical staf f. 155.35(8) Rehabilitative services. The program shall have policies and procedures on the minimum attendance for rehabilitative services relative to the client/patient' s progress and length of involvement in treatment. The minimum frequency of rehabilitative services shall occur at the same frequency of on-site dosing for client/patients receiving more than two take-home dosages a week in the first year . The minimum frequency for rehabilitative services for client/patients receiving two or fewer take-home dosages shall be weekly . The program shall provide rehabilitative services that are appropriate for the client/patient based on needs identified during the assessment process. The program may provide rehabilitative services through collateral agreements with other service providers. A client/patient who does not comply with the program' s rehabilitative service requirements shall be placed on a period of probation as defined by the program, or be required to immediately increase the frequency of clinic attendance for medication and rehabilitative services. If, during a period of probation, the client/patient continues to be in noncompliance with rehabilitation services, the program shall continue to increase the attendance requirement until daily attendance is obtained or the client/patient complies with rehabilitative services. This requirement shall not preclude the program' s ability to determine that dischar ge of a client/patient is warranted for therapeutic reasons or program needs. 155.35(9) Medication dispensing. a. The program physician shall determine the client/patient' s initial and subsequent dose of medication and clinic dosing schedule and shall assume responsibility for the amount of the narcotic drug administered or dispensed and shall record, date, and sign in each client/patient' s case record each change in the dosage schedule. The physician shall directly communicate orders to the pharmacy or registered or licensed personnel supervising medication dispensing. The program physician may communicate such orders verbally; however , orders shall be reduced in writing and countersigned within 72 hours by the program physician. b. The initial dose of medication shall not exceed 30 milligrams, and the total dose for the first day shall not exceed 40 milligrams, unless the program physician documents in the client/patient' s case record that 40 milligrams did not suppress opiate abstinence symptoms. A client/patient transferring into the program or on a guest-dosing status may receive an initial dosage of no more than the last daily dosage authorized by the former or primary program. (1) Medication shall be administered by a professional authorized by law . (2) No medication shall be administered unless the client/patient has completed admission procedures, unless the client/patient enters the program on a weekend and the central registry cannot be contacted. If, in the clinical judgment of the program physician, a client/patient is experiencing an emer gency situation, the admission procedures may be completed on the following workday . c. Administration. (1) T ake-home medication shall be labeled in accordance with state and federal law and have childproof caps. Ch 155, p. 44 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 (2) A dispensing log shall be kept in the dispensing area and in the client/patient case records which shall document the amount of medication dispensed and include the signature of the staf f member authorized to dispense the medication.

T ake-home medication may be given to client/patients who demonstrate a need for a more flexible schedule in order to enhance and continue rehabilitative progress. For client/patients receiving take-home medication, the program shall document the following requirements: (1) Absence of recent abuse of drugs (narcotic or nonnarcotic), including alcohol; (2) Regular attendance at the clinic; (3) Attendance at a licensed or approved treatment program for rehabilitative services (e.g., programs are considered approved when licensed or approved in accordance with Iowa Code chapter 125); (4) Absence of recent criminal activity; (5) Stable home environment and social relationships; (6) Active employment or participation in school, or similar responsible activities related to employment, education or vocation; and (7) Assurance that medication can be safely transported and stored by the client/patient for the client/patient' s own use. b. Prior to granting take-home privileges, the program physician shall document in the client/patient' s case record that all the above criteria have been considered and that, in the physician' s professional judgment, the risk of diversion or abuse is outweighed by the rehabilitative benefits to be derived. c. If the client/patient meets the above criteria, the client/patient may receive take-home medication according to the following guidelines: (1) During the first 90 days of treatment, the take-home supply is limited to a single dose each week; (2) During the second 90 days of treatment, the take-home supply is limited to two doses per week; (3) In the remaining months of the first year , a patient may be given a maximum six-day supply of take-home medication; (4) After one year of continuous treatment, a patient may be given a maximum two-week supply of take-home medication; (5) After two years of continuous treatment, a patient may be given a maximum one-month supply of take-home medication; and (6) T ake-home medication shall not be dispensed to patients in interim maintenance treatment or detoxification. d. If a client/patient is unable to conform to the applicable mandatory schedule, a revised schedule may be permitted provided the program receives an exception to these rules from the division and SAMHSA, when applicable. A copy of the written exception shall be placed in the client/patient' s case record. The division will consider exceptions only in unusual circumstances. When a program is applying for less frequent pickups for client/patients, approval will be based on considerations in addition to distance when another program exists within 25 miles of the client/patient' s residence. e. Should a patient receiving take-home medication provide a drug screen that is confirmed either positive for substances or negative for the prescribed medication, the program shall ensure that when test results are used, presumptive laboratory results are distinguished from results that are definitive. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 155, p. 45 (1) The program physician shall place the client/patient on three months' probation, as defined by the program, or increase the client/patient' s frequency of clinic dosing after considering the client/patient' s overall progress and length of involvement in the program. (2) Should the client/patient provide a drug screen that is positive for substances or negative for medication during a period of probation, the program physician shall increase the client/patient' s frequency of clinic attendance for dosage pickup for at least three months. If after the three-month period the client/patient meets the eligibility criteria, the client/patient may return to the previous take-home schedule. f. T ake-home or unsupervised dosages of medication in excess of 100 milligrams may be dispensed by the program physician when the need for those dosages is carefully reviewed and considered and justified in the client/patient' s case record based on the physician' s clinical judgment. 155.35(1 1) Drug testing. Each program shall establish policies and procedures for the collection of drug-screening specimens and utilization of results. a. The program shall ensure that an initial drug-screening test or analysis is completed for each prospective client/patient and that at least eight additional random tests or analyses are performed on each client/patient during the first year in maintenance treatment and that at least quarterly random tests or analyses are performed on each client/patient in maintenance treatment for each subsequent year . When a sample is collected from each client/patient for such a test or analysis, it shall be done in a manner that minimizes opportunity for falsification. Each test or analysis shall be analyzed for opiates, methadone, amphetamines, cocaine, and barbiturates. In addition, if any other drug or drugs have been determined by a program to be abused in that program' s locality , or as otherwise indicated, each test or analysis must be analyzed for any of those drugs as well. Any laboratory that performs the testing required under this rule shall be in compliance with all applicable federal proficiency testing and licensing standards and all applicable state standards. b. The program shall ensure that test results are not used as the sole criterion to force a client/patient out of treatment but are used as a guide to change treatment approaches. The program shall also ensure that when test results are used, presumptive laboratory results are distinguished from results that are definitive. 155.35(12) Client/patient case r ecor ds.

For purposes of this chapter , the following definitions apply: \"Agency\" or \"department\" means the Iowa department of public health. \"Confidential r ecor d\" means a record which is not available as a matter of right for examination and copying by members of the public under applicable provisions of law . Confidential records include records or information contained in records that the department is prohibited by law from making available for examination by members of the public, and records or information contained in records that are specified as confidential by Iowa Code section 22.7, or other provision of law , but that may be disclosed upon order of a court, the lawful custodian of the record, or by another person duly authorized to release the record. Mere inclusion in a record of information declared confidential by an applicable provision of law does not necessarily make that entire record a confidential record. \"Custodian\" means the department or a person lawfully delegated authority by the department to act for the department in implementing Iowa Code chapter 22. \"Open r ecor d\" means a record other than a confidential record. \"Personally identifiable information\" means information about or pertaining to an individual in a record which identifies the individual and which is contained in a record system. \"Recor d\" means the whole or a part of a \"public record\" as defined in Iowa Code section 22.1 that is owned by or in the physical possession of the department. \"Recor d system\" means any group of records under the control of the department from which a record may be retrieved by a personal identifier such as the name of an individual, number , symbol, or other unique retriever assigned to an individual. 641\u2014175.2 (17A,22) Statement of policy .

A person requesting a record by mail, telephone, or by electronic means shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting the information in order to facilitate delivery of the record. A person shall not be required to give a reason for requesting an open record. 175.3(4) Response to r equests. The custodian shall provide prompt access to an open record upon request unless the size or nature of the request makes prompt access infeasible. If the size or nature of the request for access to an open record requires time for compliance, the custodian shall comply with the request as soon as feasible. The custodian may delay access to an open record for one of the purposes authorized by Iowa Code section 22.8(4) or 22.10(4). The custodian shall promptly give notice to the requester of the reason for any delay in access to an open record and an estimate of the length of that delay and, upon request, shall promptly provide that notice to the requester in writing. Ch 175, p. 2 Public Health[641] IAC 7/30/08 The custodian of a record may deny access to the record by members of the public only on the grounds that such a denial is warranted under Iowa Code sections 22.8(4) and 22.10(4), or that it is a confidential record, or that its disclosure is prohibited by a court order . 175.3(5) Security of r ecor d.

Except as provided in Iowa Code section 144.46, no fee shall be char ged if the records are not made available for inspection, or if the time required does not exceed one hour in duration, or if the time required for the search was the result of department error or record-keeping problems. Iowa Code section 144.46 specifically allows for fees for vital record searches when the record is not copied or is not found, and this Iowa Code section is implemented by 641\u201496.4(144). d. Advance deposits. (1) Fulfillment of a request for a copy of a public record may be contingent upon receipt of payment of expenses to be incurred in fulfilling the request, and such estimated expenses shall be communicated to the requester prior to fulfillment of the request.

After the custodian receives a request for access to a confidential record, and before the custodian releases such a record, IAC 7/30/08 Public Health[641] Ch 175, p. 3 the custodian may make reasonable ef forts to notify promptly any person who is a subject of that record, is identified in that record, and whose address or telephone number is contained in that record. T o the extent such a delay is practicable and in the public interest, the custodian may give the subject of such confidential record to whom notification is transmitted a reasonable opportunity to seek an injunction under Iowa Code section 22.8, and indicate to the subject of the record the specific period of time during which disclosure will be delayed for that purpose. The department is not required to provide notification or an opportunity to seek an injunction under this subrule and retains sole discretion as to whether to pursue such action. 175.4(4) Requests denied. When the custodian denies a request for access to a confidential record, the custodian shall promptly notify the requester . If the requester indicates to the custodian that a written notification of the denial is desired, the custodian shall promptly provide such a notification that is signed by the custodian and that includes: a. The name and title or position of the custodian responsible for the denial; and b.

When the custodian grants a request for access to a confidential record to a particular person, the custodian shall notify that person and indicate any lawful restrictions imposed by the custodian on that person' s examination and copying of the record. 641\u2014175.5 (17A,22) Requests for tr eatment of a r ecord as a confidential r ecord and its withholding fr om examination. The custodian may treat a record as a confidential record and withhold it from examination only to the extent that the custodian is authorized by Iowa Code section 22.7, another applicable provision of law , or a court order to refuse to disclose that record to members of the public. 175.5(1) Persons who may r equest. Any person who would be aggrieved or adversely af fected by disclosure of a record and who asserts that Iowa Code section 22.7, another applicable provision of law , or a court order authorizes the custodian to treat the record as a confidential record may request the custodian to treat that record as a confidential record and to withhold it from public inspection. 175.5(2) Request. A request that a record be treated as a confidential record and be withheld from public inspection shall be in writing and shall be filed with the custodian. The request must set forth the legal and factual basis justifying such confidential treatment for that record, and the name, address, and telephone number of the person authorized to respond to any inquiry or action of the custodian concerning the request. A person requesting treatment of a record as a confidential record may also be required to sign a certified statement or af fidavit enumerating the specific reasons justifying the treatment of that record as a confidential record and to provide any proof necessary to establish relevant facts. Requests for treatment of a record as a confidential record for a limited time period shall also specify the precise period of time for which that treatment is requested.

If the original record is being submitted to the department by the person requesting such confidential treatment at the time the request is filed, the person shall indicate conspicuously on the original record that all or portions of it are confidential. 175.5(3) Failur e to r equest. Failure of a person to request confidential record treatment for a record does not preclude the custodian from treating it as a confidential record. However , if a person who has submitted business information to the department does not request that it be withheld from public inspection under Iowa Code sections 22.7(3) and 22.7(6), the custodian of records containing that information may proceed as if that person has no objection to its disclosure to members of the public. 175.5(4) T iming of decision. A decision by the custodian with respect to the disclosure of a record to members of the public may be made when a request for its treatment as a confidential record is filed or when the custodian receives a request for access to the record by a member of the public. 175.5(5) Request granted or deferr ed. If a request for such confidential record treatment is granted, or if action on such a request is deferred, a copy of the record from which the matter in question has been deleted and a copy of the decision to grant the request or to defer action upon the request will be made Ch 175, p. 4 Public Health[641] IAC 7/30/08 available for public inspection in lieu of the original record. If the custodian subsequently receives a request for access to the original record, the custodian will make reasonable and timely ef forts to notify any person who has filed a request for its treatment as a confidential record that is not available for public inspection of the pendency of that subsequent request. 175.5(6) Request denied and opportunity to seek injunction. If a request that a record be treated as a confidential record and be withheld from public inspection is denied, the custodian shall notify the requester in writing of that determination and the reasons therefor . On application by a requester , the custodian may engage in a good faith, reasonable delay in allowing examination of the record so that the requester may seek injunctive relief under the provisions of Iowa Code section 22.8 or other applicable provision of law . However , such a record shall not be withheld from public inspection for any period of time if the custodian determines that the requester had no reasonable ground to justify the treatment of that record as a confidential record. The custodian shall notify requester in writing of the time period allowed to seek injunctive relief or the reasons for the determination that no reasonable grounds exist to justify the treatment of that record as a confidential record. The custodian may extend the period of good faith, reasonable delay in allowing examination of the record so that the requester may seek injunctive relief only if no request for examination of that record has been received, or if a court directs the custodian to treat it as a confidential record, or to the extent permitted by another applicable provision of law , or with the consent of the person requesting access. 641\u2014175.6 (17A,22) Pr ocedur e by which additions, dissents, or objections may be enter ed into certain r ecords. Except as otherwise provided by law , a person may file a request with the custodian to review , and to have a written statement of additions, dissents, or objections entered into a record containing personally identifiable information pertaining to that person.

The Iowa legislature has determined that the goals of controlling health care costs and improving the quality of and access to health care services will be significantly enhanced by cooperative arrangements involving providers wishing to become an ODS that might be prohibited by state and federal antitrust law if undertaken without governmental involvement. The purpose of the following rules is to institute new public policy by creating an opportunity for the state to review proposed arrangements and to substitute regulation for competition when an arrangement is likely to result in lower costs, or greater access or quality , than would otherwise occur in the marketplace. It is the intent that approval of arrangements be accompanied by appropriate conditions, supervision, and regulation to protect against private abuses of economic power , and that an arrangement approved by the department and accompanied by such appropriate conditions, supervision, and regulation shall not be subject to state and federal antitrust liability . It is the further intent that any immunity from scrutiny under federal or state antitrust statutes of fered under these exceptions shall be limited to such specific agreements as are approved by the department, and shall not be extended or applied to unforeseen circumstances, parties, acts, or other agreements which were not part of or contemplated by the approved agreement. 641\u2014201.21 (135,75GA,ch158) Definitions. \"Access\" means the financial, temporal, and geographic availability of health care to individuals who need it. \"Applicant\" means the party or parties to an agreement or business arrangement for which the department' s approval is sought under this provision. \"Certificate of public advantage\" means the sanction by and protection of the department of public health of an operating arrangement which otherwise might be excepted under certain antitrust regulations. \"Cost\" or \"cost of health car e\" means the amount paid by consumers or third-party payers for health care services or products. \"Criteria\" means the cost, access, and quality of health care. \"Department\" means the department of public health. \"Person\" means an individual or legal entity .

Providers or purchasers wishing to engage in contracts, business or financial arrangement, or other activities, practices, or arrangements that might be construed to be violations of state or federal antitrust laws but which are in the best interests of the state and further the policies and goals of this provision may apply to the department for a certificate of public advantage. 201.22(2) Immunity r egar ding negotiation. Directors, trustees, or other representatives of a health care provider or third-party payer who participate in discussion or negotiation culminating in any arrangement as described in subrule 201.22(1) are immune from civil actions or criminal prosecution for a violation of state or federal antitrust laws, unless the discussion or negotiation exceeds the scope authorized in this subrule. 201.22(3) Disputes among the parties.

IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 201, p. 13 641\u2014201.25 (135,75GA,ch158) Pr ocedur e for r eview of applications. 201.25(1) Choice of pr ocedur es. After the conclusion of the period provided in subrule 201.24(2) for the applicant to respond to comments, the department shall select one of the two procedures provided in subrule 201.25(2). In determining which procedure to use, the department shall consider the following criteria: a. The size of the proposed arrangement, in terms of number of parties and amount of money involved; b. The complexity of the proposed arrangement; c. The novelty of the proposed arrangement; d. The substance and quantity of the comments received; and e. The presence or absence of any significant gaps in the factual record. If the applicant demands a contested case hearing no later than the conclusion of the period provided in subrule 201.24(2) for the applicant to respond to comments, the department shall not select a procedure. Instead, the applicant shall be given a contested case proceeding as a matter of right. 201.25(2) Pr ocedur es available. a. Decision on the written r ecor d. The department may issue a decision based on the application, the comments and the applicant' s responses to the comments, to the extent each is relevant. In making the decision, the department may consult with the attorney general or the staf f of the department and may rely on department data. b. Contested case hearing. The department may order a contested case hearing. A contested case hearing shall be heard before an administrative law judge who shall issue a written recommendation to the department and shall follow the procedures in 641\u2014Chapter 173. All factual issues relevant to a decision must be presented in the contested case. The attorney general may appear as a party . The record in the contested case shall include the application, the comments, the applicant' s response to the comments, and any other evidence that is part of the record under 641\u2014Chapter 173. 641\u2014201.26 (135,75GA,ch158) Criteria for decision. 201.26(1) The department shall not approve an application unless the department determines that the arrangement is more likely to result in lower costs, increased access, or increased quality of health care, than would otherwise occur under existing market condition or conditions likely to develop without an exemption from state and federal antitrust law . In the event that a proposed arrangement appears likely to improve one or two of the criteria at the expense of another one or two of the criteria, the department shall not approve the application unless the department determines that the proposed arrangement, taken as a whole, is likely to substantially further the purpose of this chapter . In making such a determination, the department may employ a cost/benefit analysis. 201.26(2) Factors. a. Generally applicable factors. In making a determination about cost, access, and quality , the department may consider the following factors, to the extent relevant: (1) Market structure: actual and potential sellers and buyers, or providers and purchasers; actual and potential consumers; geographic market area; and entry conditions; (2) Current market condition; (3) The historical behavior of the market; (4) Performance of other similar arrangements; (5) Whether the proposal unnecessarily restrains competition, or restrains competition in ways not reasonably related to the purposes of this chapter; and (6) The financial condition of the applicant. b. Cost. The department' s analysis of cost must focus on the individual consumer of health care. Cost savings to be realized by providers, health carriers, group purchasers, or other participants in the health care system are relevant only to the extent that the savings are likely to be passed on to the consumer . However , where an application is submitted by providers or purchasers who are paid primarily by third-party payers unaf filiated with the applicant, it is suf ficient for the applicant to show that cost savings are likely to be passed on to the unaf filiated third-party payers; the applicants do not have the Ch 201, p. 14 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 burden of proving that third-party payers with whom the applicants are not af filiated will pass on cost savings to individuals receiving coverage through the third-party payers. In making determinations as to costs, the department may consider: (1) The cost savings likely to result to the applicant; (2) The extent to which the cost savings are likely to be passed on to the consumer and in what form; (3) The extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to result in cost-shifting by the applicant onto other payers or purchasers of other products or services; (4) The extent to which the cost-shifting by the applicant is likely to be followed by other persons in the market; (5) The current and anticipated supply and demand for any products or services at issue; (6) The representations and guarantees of the applicant, and their enforceability; (7) Likely ef fectiveness of regulation by the department; (8) Inferences to be drawn from market structure; (9) The cost of regulation, both for the state and for the applicant; and (10) Any other factors tending to show that the proposed arrangement is or is not likely to reduce cost. c. Access. In making determinations as to access, the department may consider: (1) The extent to which the utilization of needed health care services or products by the intended tar geted population is likely to increase or decrease. When a proposed arrangement is likely to increase access in one geographic area, by lowering prices or otherwise expanding supply , but limits access in another geographic area by removing service capabilities from that second area, the department shall articulate the criteria employed to balance these ef fects; (2) The extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to make available a new and needed service or product to a certain geographic area; and (3) The extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to otherwise make health care services or products more financially or geographically available to persons who need them. If the department determines that the proposed arrangement is likely to increase access and bases that determination on a projected increase in utilization, the department shall also determine and make a specific finding that the increased utilization does not reflect overutilization. d. Quality . In making determinations as to quality , the department may consider the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to: (1) Decrease morbidity and mortality; (2) Result in faster convalescence; (3) Result in fewer hospital days; (4) Permit providers to attain needed experience or frequency of treatment likely to lead to better outcomes; (5) Increase patient satisfaction; and (6) Have any other features likely to improve or reduce the quality of health care. 641\u2014201.27 (135,75GA,ch158) Decision. 201.27(1) Appr oval or disappr oval. The department shall issue a written decision approving or disapproving the application within 45 days after receipt of the application or , in the case of a contested hearing, within 10 days of receipt of the administrative law judge' s recommendation. The department may condition approval on a modification of all or part of the proposed arrangement to eliminate any restriction on competition that is not reasonably related to the goals of reducing cost or improving access or quality . The department may also establish conditions for approval that are reasonably necessary to protect against abuses of private economic power and to ensure that the arrangement is appropriately supervised and regulated by the state. 201.27(2) Findings of fact. The department' s decision shall make specific findings of fact concerning the cost, access, and quality criteria, and identify one or more of those criteria as the basis for the decision. IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 201, p. 15 201.27(3) Data for supervision. A decision approving an application shall require the periodic submission of specific data relating to cost, access, and quality , and to the extent feasible, identify objective standards of cost, access, and quality by which the success of the arrangement will be measured. However , if the department determines that the scope of a particular proposed arrangement is such that the arrangement is certain to have neither a positive nor negative impact on one or two of the criteria, the department' s decision need not require the submission of data or establish an objective standard relating to those criteria. 641\u2014201.28 (135,75GA,ch158) Appeal. After the department has rendered a decision, the applicant or any other person aggrieved may appeal the decision to the district court within 30 days after receipt of the department' s decision. The appeal is governed by Iowa Code chapter 17A. The department' s determination, under subrule 201.25(1), of which procedure to use may not be raised as an issue on appeal. 641\u2014201.29 (135,75GA,ch158) Supervision after appr oval. 201.29(1) Active supervision. The department shall actively supervise, monitor , and regulate approved arrangements, as described below . 201.29(2) Pr ocedur es.

The methodology described in this section provides the basis for estimating the anticipated number of patient-days of acute care hospital service that Iowa citizens will need in the future. The methodology embodies predictive indicators of acute care usage, population and demographic adjustments, and \"tar get\" usage rates. The \"tar get\" rates express the intent to reduce the levels of acute care usage in areas of the state where that usage is excessive, and not otherwise attributable to the presence of high-usage population groups. b. The number of acute care beds which will be needed by each of the state' s hospitals in the future is a function of the number of patient-days of acute care that will be needed by Iowa citizens, with allowance for the needs of specific population groups and for the travel distance to and location of the state' s hospitals. c. Certificate of need project applications are to be evaluated against the projected bed need determination for those hospitals seeking permission to: 1. Construct new acute care beds; 2. Modernize or renovate acute care beds/patient nursing units; 3. Convert acute care beds from one service use to another; 4. Add to the square footage space of the hospital, where it might be architecturally feasible and cost-ef fective to convert excess bed space. d. The methodology responds to the following criteria for evaluation of certificate of need applications: 1. The need of the population for the health services; 2. A vailability of alternative, less costly or more ef fective methods of providing the proposed services; 3. Relationships of the proposed service to the existing health care system of the area; 4. Consideration of the capacity to provide services and consideration of alternatives such as sharing or cooperating arrangements; 5. Other existing facilities providing similar services to those proposed are being used in an appropriate and ef ficient manner . 203.1(2) Definitions. a. \"Estimated patient-day use rate\" means the number of days of hospital care provided per year , per thousand residents of a county (or the state). The rate is calculated by adding together all of the patient-days per year for residents of a county (or state), obtained from the records of hospitals where those residents received services. The total patient-days is then divided by the number of residents in the county (or the state), and the answer is expressed as \"X patient-days per 1,000 persons.\" A patient-day use rate can be calculated for any specific age group by identifying the number of patient-days of use by residents in that age group and dividing by the number of residents in that age group. b. \"T ar get use rate\" for a county means the patient-day use rate that establishes a projected need level for the county at a future point in time. A tar get use rate can be determined for a specific age group, using the method described above. In this methodology , tar get use rates will be determined for four age groups: 0-14, 15-44, 45-64, and 65 and older . Therefore, each county will have four tar get use rates. For each county , the tar get use rate for each age group shall be the lowest of (1) the estimated patient-day use rate for the county during the survey period or (2) the state average estimated patient-day use rate during the survey period. The rates in ef fect at the time that an application is declared complete by the state are the rates employed in reviewing that application. c. \"Patient destination patterns\" means the distribution, by hospital, of the total patient-days of each county . The patterns show where patients were referred for hospital service. Ch 203, p. 2 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 d. \"Patient destination pr oportion\" means the percentage of a given county' s patient-days that occurred in any given hospital. e. \"T ar get occupancy rate\" means the desired average annual percent of a given hospital' s usable beds that will be occupied. An occupancy rate is determined by dividing a hospital' s average daily census (ADC) of patients by the facility' s number of usable beds. A \"tar get\" occupancy establishes desired levels of ef ficiency . f. \"Acute car e beds\" beds including general medical/sur gical, pediatric, obstetric, psychiatric and other short-stay specialized beds. 203.1(3) Data r equir ements. a. Patient destination patterns, patient destination proportions, and the patient-use of acute care services shall be determined from the most recent statewide patient origin and destination study . Such a study shall be conducted at intervals not to exceed three years and shall be the responsibility of the department of public health. The initial study conducted in 1977 produced tar get utilization rates. Those tar get rates produced by subsequent studies shall be reviewed as to their continued appropriateness at the time each three-year study is analyzed. If better data is submitted in the interim between studies such shall be considered in readjusting the tar get use rates. As revised tar get use rates are determined by study , the Statewide Health Coordinating Council (SHCC) shall review the new tar get use rates to determine their appropriateness. All Iowa hospitals shall participate in the survey and shall cooperate with the department in providing the most accurate information available. Out-of-state hospitals will also be surveyed in order to obtain information on Iowa residents receiving hospital care out of the state. b. Population estimates and projections shall be obtained from the most recent Of ficial Iowa Population Projections, published by the department of economic development. The projecting horizon used in this methodology shall be ten years in the future. Using the year of the most recent patient origin and destination study as \"year one,\" projected patient-day use rates will be applied to the projected populations in \"year ten\" (example: from the information in the 1977 patient origin and destination study , projections will be made for 1987). c. Data pertaining to bed capacity and annual patient-days shall be obtained from the most recent Annual Report for Hospital and Related Health Facilities submitted by hospitals to the department of public health. 203.1(4) Methodology . a. Annual \"estimated patient-day use rate\" by county: (1) Annually adjust the patient-day information obtained from the one month patient origin and destination study by multiplying the patient-days of each hospital by the ratio of annual patient-days (obtained from the Annual Report) to sample month patient-days (obtained from the patient origin and destination study). (2) T o determine estimated annual county patient-days for each of the age groups (0-14, 15-44, 45-64 and 65 and older) for any given county do the following: first, annually adjust all patient-days identified in the one month survey as described in (1) above; second, for each hospital identify the residence of origin of their annually adjusted patient-days by each specific county; third, for each county identify the annually adjusted patient-days for that county' s residents from all of those hospitals which served the residents of the county during the patient origin study period. Follow the same procedure for each age group. (3) T o determine the county patient-day use rate for each age group divide the number of patient-days for that age group (identified in (2) above) by the population of the county in that age group. Express the results as \"X number of patient-days per 1,000 residents in Y age group.\" b. Annual \"estimated patient-day use rate\" by state. For each age group add together the estimated annual county patient-day for that age group in all counties and divide by the state population in that age group. c. T o determine tar get use rates\u2014each county will have four tar get use rates; one for each of the age groups 0-14, 15-44, 45-64, and 65 and older . The tar get use rate for any age group for a county will be the lowest of: (1) Estimated annual patient-day use rate for the age group in that county; IAC 7/2/08 Public Health[641] Ch 203, p. 3 (2) Estimated annual patient-day use rate for the age group in the state. d. T o determine projected patient-days for a county\u2014multiply the tar get rate for each age group by the projected county population in that age group for the year ten years after the most recent patient origin survey (counting the survey year as \"year one\"). e. T o determine facility projected patient-days\u2014for each of the four age groups divide up the projected patient-days for each county among the hospitals that served the county during the patient origin study period. The distribution of any county' s projected patient-days (in each age group) will be made in accordance with the percentage distribution of patient-days (in each age group) among the various hospitals in the study period. The percentage distribution number for any given hospital of the patient-days of any given county is called the \"patient destination proportion.\" Add together all of the projected patient-days in each of the four age groups going to each hospital from all of the counties served by that hospital. f. T o determine a facility' s projected patient-days for out-of-state residents\u2014first, determine the in-state and out-of-state percentage of patient-days identified for each facility during the patient origin survey period; next divide a given facility' s in-state percentage into its number of projected patient-days in the patient origin survey . The projected patient-days for facility A from Iowa counties is 2,000. T o expand the patient-days to allow for the anticipated out-of-state patients divide 2,000 by .90 to get 2,222. (Ninety percent of 2,222 would be 2,000 and 222 would allow for the 10 percent out-of-state patients expected to use the hospital in the future projection.) g. T o determine facility projected bed need\u2014divide the projected patient-days for the facility by 365 days to estimate the projected average daily census of patients. The average daily census for the facility will determine the facility' s projected bed need when allowance is made for a mar gin of unoccupied beds. The mar gin of unoccupied beds provides for the fluctuations in average-to-peak service periods. The smaller hospitals have a greater mar gin allowed in order to accommodate the necessary emer gency and primary care functions that account for the majority of their patients. The following scale incorporates the mar gin and provides the link between the projected average daily census for a facility and the projected bed need. If A verage Daily Census (ADC) is: Presumed - 30) 61-70% 71-160 BN = 100 + 1.1 1 1 \u00d7 (ADC - 70) 71-80% 161-249 BN = 200 + 1.124 \u00d7 (ADC 250 or more BN = 1.205 \u00d7 ADC 83% Specific exception\u2014University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics serve a unique role as a nearly exclusively tertiary facility with many specialized units. Its occupancy rate should allow for greater peak load fluctuation and therefore will have an occupancy rate of 80%. 203.1(5) Contingencies. a. Patient-days for hospitals that close in the interim between revisions of the patient origin and destination study will be divided among other hospitals serving the same counties as the hospital that closed. The projected patient-days will be divided according to the percentage of the county' s patient-days going to each of the other hospitals serving that county . (Example: County A has a projected 1,000 patient-days divided among three hospitals\u2014 Facility X = 60% of the patient-days = 600 patient-days Facility Y = 20% of the patient-days = 200 patient-days Facility Z = 20% of the patient-days = 200 patient-days If Facility Z closes, the 200 patient-days would be distributed to Facilities X and Y according to the following ratios: Ch 203, p. 4 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 Facility X = 600/800 600/800 \u00d7 150 patient-days Facility Y = 200/800 200/800 \u00d7 200 = 50 patient-days Facilities X and Y will then have projected patient-days of 750 and 250 respectively .) b. Joint planning in multiple-hospital communities is encouraged and any alternative distribution plan for the aggregate community bed need in those communities may be presented by the hospitals af fected. So long as the total community bed need does not exceed the sum of the individual facility needs for the community and so long as all of the hospitals in the community agree to the alternative distribution plan, the plan will replace the distribution pattern determined by this methodology . 641\u2014203.2 (135) Cardiac catheterization and cardiovascular surgery standards. 203.2(1) Purpose and scope. a.

Through this procedure one can measure pressure within the heart and in adjacent veins and arteries, collect blood samples for blood gas analysis and inject radiopaque material, visualize cardiac and vessel anatomy . The procedure permits detection of congenital and acquired heart abnormalities, the study of ventricular function, the estimation of the orifice size, the placement of pacemakers, etc. Cardiac catheterization is incomplete without cineangiography , intracardiac pressure measurements, blood gas analysis and the ability to diagnose intracardiac shunts. (2) Coronary artery catheterization\u2014a diagnostic study of the coronary arteries, in which a small catheter passes through an artery in the leg, neck or arm into a coronary artery orifice. Intravascular pressure measurements are taken, and angiography of the coronary arteries is performed.

Megavoltage machines are classified as follows: Ch 203, p. 8 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 1. Particle accelerators. These machines use a supply of electrons, which are accelerated into high ener gy beams. These beams are either caused to strike a tar get resulting in high ener gy X-ray production, or are used themselves as the treatment beam. Particle accelerators generate from 4 million up to as many as 45 million electron volts. Most common particle accelerators are the linear accelerator and the betatron. 2.

Computerized tomographic (CT) scanner\u2014a diagnostic tool which rotates about and which sends X-ray beams through cross-sectional layers of the body or brain. The X-ray beams which emer ge from the body or brain are absorbed by a detector . Dif ferences in the amount of X-rays absorbed by the detector indicate dif ferences in tissue density . As the scanner rotates it takes many images of a cross-section. The images on the detector are transmitted to a computer which displays on a TV a reconstructed cross-sectional picture or slice. Contrast media is then usually injected to alter absorption of the detector , and the scan repeated; this is called enhancement. (1) Whole body scanner\u2014one capable of imaging the entire body .

(2) Expand bed capacity in designated inpatient substance abuse treatment units. 203.1 1(2) Definition. Designated inpatient substance abuse treatment unit is a designated set of hospital facilities with patient beds, equipment and personnel designed for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients for whom the primary diagnosis is alcohol abuse or dependence or other drug abuse or dependence. Units designated strictly for detoxification are not considered a treatment unit as defined in this standard. 203.1 1(3) A vailability and \"e,\" \"g,\" \"h\" ) a.

Population by Thousand Patient Days per Thousand Population Bed Need = 80% Occupancy \u00d7 365 The formula shall be calculated separately for community hospitals and state mental health institutes. The methodology for applying the formula shall be as follows. (1) Bed need shall be calculated annually for a period five years into the future. (a) \"Population by thousand\" refers to department of economic development population projection for five years into the future. (b) For calculating community hospital bed need, \"patient days per thousand population\" is calculated by dividing the total patient days in all community hospital-based substance abuse treatment units during the past year (as reported on the annual hospital survey by the department of health) by the state population for that year as projected by the department of economic development. (c) Applying the figures from (1)(a) and (1)(b) in the formula will project a statewide total of likely bed need for community hospital substance abuse treatment units, based on current utilization. (d) For calculating mental health institute bed need, \"patient days per thousand population\" is calculated by dividing the total patient days in the four mental health institute substance abuse treatment units (as reported to the department of human services) by the state population for that year as projected by the department of economic development. (e) Applying the figures from (1)(a) and (1)(d) in the formula will project a statewide total of likely bed need for mental health institute substance abuse treatment units based on current utilization. (2) For purposes of comparing \"need\" to \"existing\" beds in community hospitals, the state shall be divided into eight planning districts, as used by the department of human services. (a) The total number of beds derived in (1)(c) above for likely bed need for community hospital units shall be divided by the projected state population in thousands to derive beds needed per thousand population. (b) For each district, the factor in (2)(a) above shall be multiplied by the projected population by thousand in that district for a district bed need. (c) T o determine number of existing beds in a given district, the number of substance abuse treatment beds at all community hospitals in that district shall be added together . The number of beds at each facility shall be the number of licensed or registered beds in the substance abuse treatment unit, as reported on the annual hospital survey to the Iowa department of public health. (3) For purposes of comparing \"need\" to \"existing\" beds in mental health institutes, the total number of beds derived in (1)(e) above for likely bed need for MHI units will be compared to the total of the existing substance abuse treatment beds at the four MHIs in the state as reported on the Iowa department of public health annual survey .

Certificate of need applications which are to be evaluated against these standards include: (1) Proposals to commence or expand the capacity of positron emission tomography services. (2) Proposals to replace a positron emission tomography unit. (3) Any other applications which relate to positron emission tomography . 203.13(2) Definitions. \"Ar ea\" means the community or a metropolitan statistical area (as defined by the U.S. Of fice of Management and Budget and used by the U.S. Census Bureau). \"CT (computed tomography)\" means an imaging method in which a cross-sectional image of the structures in a body plane is reconstructed by a computer program from the X-ray absorption of beams projected through the body in the image plane. \"Cyclotr on\" means an apparatus for accelerating protons or neutrons to high ener gies by means of a constant magnet and an oscillating electric field. \"MRI (magnetic r esonance imaging)\" means a diagnostic modality which employs a combination of magnetic and radio frequency fields and computers to produce images of body or gans and tissues. \"Radiopharmaceutical\" means a radioactive pharmaceutical used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. \"PET pr ocedur e\" means an image-scanning sequence derived from a single administration of PET , equated with a single injection of the tracer . Ch 203, p. 30 Public Health[641] IAC 7/2/08 \"Positr on emission tomography (PET)\" means an imaging method in which positron-emitting radionuclides, which are produced either by a cyclotron or generator , and a nuclear camera are used to create pictures of or gan function rather than structure. PET installations generally take one of two forms: a PET scanner using only generator -produced tracers (basic PET unit), or a PET scanner with a cyclotron (enhanced PET unit). \"SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography)\" means a camera-based imaging system using the radionuclides in the routine practice of nuclear medicine. 203.13(3) A vailability and need. \"e,\" \"g,\" \"h\" ) a.
