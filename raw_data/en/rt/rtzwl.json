Hello and welcome to Naturopathic Physician - where the people of Orland Park, Frankfort and Lemont come for their natural/ homeopathic alternative medicine needs. For those in Orland Park, Frankfort and Lemont unfamiliar with the field here is a brief description of some of the key principles behind our practice. Vitalism: More than just the physical A vitalism belief is that nature is structured with order, intelligence and balance that directly affect the human body. You may have heard that naturopathic medicine is connected to vitalism (the principle that we contain non-physical elements that affect our health). For example, stress is mental and thus can be understood as non-physical but it also can make you clench your jaw, tighten muscles all over your body, and create anxiety and depression. According to the International World Health Organization, \"87 to 92 percent of all mental and physical illnesses are caused by stress.\" Naturopathic medicine takes these non-physical considerations into account when assessing overall health. Using homeopathic remedies and natural treatments, Naturopathic Physician helps bring the patient's body back into balance; empowering the body's ability to heal. Holism: Taking it all into account The body and mind are heavily interconnected and only together do they form a complete system to correctly assess a person's health. For example, it is imperative to look beyond the symptoms and find the root cause of the illness to promote healing. Your body has a lot to tell a naturopathic physician about what ails it; we make sure that every aspect is analyzed. Naturopathic Physician uses comprehensive scientific testing to evaluate your body and develop a customized treatment plan that addresses all of your health concerns to assist the healing process. "}
