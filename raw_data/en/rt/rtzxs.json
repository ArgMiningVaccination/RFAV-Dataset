In a two-part paper entitled \" [Curing the pandemic of misinformation on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine](https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/71),\" real-world data reveals that in the non-elderly population the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one death from Covid-19 runs into thousands and that re-analysis of randomized controlled trial data suggests a greater risk of suffering a serious adverse event from the vaccine than to be hospitalized with Covid-19. \"We must use this as an opportunity to transform the system to produce better doctors, better decision making, healthier patients and restore trust in medicine and public health. Until all the raw data on the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have been independently analysed, any claims purporting that they confer a net benefit to humankind cannot be considered to be evidence based,\" Dr. Malhotra concludes.
