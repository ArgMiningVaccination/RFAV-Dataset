Incidence and Mortality Estimated new cases and deaths from CLL in the United States in 2023:[ Anatomy CLL is a disorder of morphologically mature, but immunologically less mature lymphocytes. It is manifested by progressive accumulation of these cells in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic tissues.[ Blood cell development. A blood stem cell goes through several steps to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell. Clinical Presentation The clinical course of this disease progresses from an indolent lymphocytosis without other evident disease to one of generalized lymphatic enlargement with concomitant pancytopenia. Complications of pancytopenia, including hemorrhage and infection, represent a major cause of death in these patients.[ Diagnostic Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis Tests and procedures used to diagnose CLL include the following:[ In this disorder, lymphocyte counts in the blood are usually greater than or equal to 5,000/mm3 with a characteristic immunophenotype (CD5- and CD23-positive B cells).[ Confusion with other diseases may be avoided by determination of cell surface markers. CLL lymphocytes coexpress the B-cell CLL and have clonal rearrangements of their T-cell receptor genes. These patients have a higher frequency of skin lesions, more variable lymphocyte shape, and shorter median survival (13 months) with minimal responses to chemotherapy and B-cell receptor inhibitors.[ The differential diagnosis must exclude the following: Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) appears to be an active agent (60% complete remission rate) for patients with de novo B-cell PLL.[ Prognostic Factors Prognostic markers help stratify patients in clinical trials, assess the need for therapy, and select the type of therapy.[ Prognostic markers include the following: These findings emphasize the need for prospective studies of combinations of these prognostic markers.[ Other prognostic factors include the following: An index (IPI) for CLL (CLL-IPI) identified four prognostic subgroups on the basis of IgVH mutational status, clinical stage, age (65 years vs. >65 years), and TP53 status (no abnormalities vs. del(17p) or TP53 mutation or both).[ Follow-up After Treatment CT scans have a very limited role in monitoring patients after completion of treatment. CT scan or ultrasonography results determined the decision to treat for relapse in only 2 of 176 patients in three prospective trials for the German CLL Study Group.[ References: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) does not have a standard staging system. The Rai staging system (Table 1) and the Binet classification (Table 2) are presented below.[ Rai III||Absolute stage Aa||No anemia or thrombocytopenia and fewer than three areas of lymphoid involvement (Rai stages 0, I, and II).| |Clinical stage Ba||No anemia or thrombocytopenia with three or more areas of lymphoid involvement (Rai stages I and II).| |Clinical stage C||Anemia and/or thrombocytopenia regardless of the number of areas of lymphoid enlargement (Rai stages III and The Binet classification integrates the number of disease-involved nodal groups with bone marrow failure. Its major benefit derives from the recognition of a predominantly splenic form of the disease, which may have a better prognosis than was recognized in the Rai staging, and from the recognition that the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia has a similar prognosis and does not merit a separate stage. Neither system separates immune from nonimmune causes of cytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia, anemia, or both, which is caused by extensive marrow infiltration and impaired production (Rai III/IV, Binet C), have a poorer prognosis than patients with immune cytopenias.[ The International Workshop on CLL has recommended integrating the Rai and Binet with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) must be individualized on the basis of the clinical behavior of the disease.[ In older trials with data collected from the 1970s through the 1990s, the median survival for all patients ranged from 8 to 12 years.[ Treatment of patients with CLL ranges from observation with treatment of infectious, hemorrhagic, or immunological complications to a variety of therapeutic options administered as single agents or combination therapy. In asymptomatic patients, treatment may be deferred until the disease progresses and symptoms occur.[ The following clinical factors may be helpful in predicting progression of disease:[ Symptomatic or progressive CLL is defined as the following by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia:[ Considerations for the Selection of Therapy The following general principles may provide a sequencing for available therapeutic options: Adverse Sequelae of the Disease and Therapy Infectious complications in advanced disease are in part a consequence of the hypogammaglobulinemia and the inability to mount a humoral defense against bacterial or viral agents. Herpes zoster represents a frequent viral infection in these patients, but infections with Pneumocystis carinii and Candida albicans may also occur. The early recognition of infections and the institution of appropriate therapy are critical to the long-term survival of these patients. A randomized study of intravenous immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 1 year) in patients with CLL and hypogammaglobulinemia produced significantly fewer bacterial infections and a significant delay in onset of first infection during the study period.[ Patients with CLL who required hospitalization for COVID-19 prior to the induction of vaccines fared poorly regardless of stage in two retrospective reports.[ Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and/or thrombocytopenia can occur in patients with any stage of CLL.[ Second malignancies and treatment-induced acute leukemias may also occur in a small percentage of patients.[ The BTK inhibitors increased the risk of bleeding requiring hospitalization (3-year risk for patients who received ibrutinib, 8.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.5%-11.7%]) and atrial patients who received 22.7% CI, References: Treatment Options for Asymptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Observation Because of its indolent nature, chemotherapy is not indicated for asymptomatic or minimally affected patients with CLL, and observation is the generally accepted approach.[ Evidence (observation): Despite many therapeutic options, observation should be considered for asymptomatic or minimally affected patients, even in the context of adverse prognostic findings. Therapy begins when patients develop profound cytopenias or when symptoms adversely impact quality of life. There are no clinical trial results that confirm that immediate treatment of asymptomatic or minimally affected patients with the B-cell receptor inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors is superior to observation. Clinical trials will need to establish improved outcomes using the newer biological therapies in asymptomatic patients before observation or watchful waiting is discontinued. Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Symptomatic or Progressive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) The following regimens are considered first-line approaches for patients with CLL who are experiencing symptomatic progression: Several large prospective clinical trials have compared these approaches. A chemotherapy-free approach for first-line therapy is usually preferred for most patients, but it is mandatory for patients with del(17p) or TP53-positive disease.[ Ibrutinib tyrosine a signaling receptor-signaling cascade. Evidence (ibrutinib vs. FCR): Ibrutinib acalabrutinib inhibitor, to minimize the gastrointestinal toxicities risk of atrial fibrillation seen with ibrutinib. plus obinutuzumab vs. vs. BR Evidence (zanubrutinib versus FCR Evidence (BR vs. FCR): FCR FCR is used for with (FCR): Ibrutinib plus venetoclax Evidence (ibrutinib plus venetoclax): In summary, these trials establish the use of venetoclax with obinutuzumab or rituximab, or the use of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib as first-line therapy in previously untreated patients with CLL. A lower rate of atrial fibrillation may favor the use of acalabrutinib over ibrutinib. Unlike ibrutinib or acalabrutinib, which are given continuously until relapse, venetoclax may be stopped after 12 months, with durable maintenance of remission. Venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib can be readministered with success, if needed. The combination of venetoclax and ibrutinib or acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib with or without obinutuzumab needs to be evaluated in prospective randomized trials versus the use of these agents alone with or without obinutuzumab. Several provocative phase II trials with these combinations have resulted in unprecedented rates of MRD-negative disease which appear more durable;[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Recurrent or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) The same regimens considered for first-line therapy for patients with CLL can be readministered in a sequential fashion. These regimens are described in more detail under first-line therapy. For more information, see the Treatment of Symptomatic or Progressive CLL section. In the relapsed setting, venetoclax showed similar efficacy and safety even after previous therapy with ibrutinib or idelalisib (the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K] delta inhibitor).[ Similarly, in a trial reported in abstract form, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib showed similar efficacy and safety after previous therapy with venetoclax.[ Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy Autologous T cells can be modified by viral vectors to incorporate antigen receptor specificity for the B-cell antigen CD19 and then infused into previously treated patients.[ PI3K inhibitors Idelalisib is an oral inhibitor of the delta isoform of PI3K, which is in the B-cell receptor-signaling cascade. This drug has been withdrawn from its U.S. Food and Drug Administration indication due to toxicity and is no longer available. Duvelisib is an oral dual inhibitor of the delta and gamma isoforms of PI3K.[ Lenalidomide Lenalidomide is an oral immunomodulatory agent with response rates of more than 50%, with or without rituximab, for patients with previously treated and untreated disease.[ Bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation In a prospective randomized trial, 241 previously untreated patients younger than 66 years with advanced-stage disease received induction therapy with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)-based regimen followed by fludarabine.[ Patients with adverse prognostic factors are very likely to die from CLL. These patients are candidates for clinical trials that employ high-dose chemotherapy and immunotherapy with myeloablative or alone and in combination with chlorambucil): Involved-field radiation therapy Relatively low doses of radiation therapy can be administered for lymphadenopathy that causes problems due to size or encroachment on adjacent organs. Sometimes radiation therapy to one nodal area or the spleen will result in an abscopal effect (i.e., the shrinkage of lymph nodes in untreated sites). Alemtuzumab Alemtuzumab is no longer available commercially in the United States for neoplastic indications but can be obtained from the pharmaceutical company on a compassionate-use basis (Lemtrada REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] Program). Alemtuzumab, the monoclonal antibody directed at CD52, shows activity in the setting of chemotherapy-resistant disease or high-risk untreated patients with del(17p) or TP53 mutations.[ In a combination regimen, subcutaneous or without cyclophosphamide) or intravenous alemtuzumab plus alkylating agents have resulted in excess infectious toxicities and death, with no compensatory improvement in efficacy in three phase II trials and one randomized trial.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD) (1 \u00d7 10-4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates) can be confirmed by flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing. The attainment of undetectable MRD represents an even more stringent complete remission that was prognostic for improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in multiple studies.[ Testing for undetectable MRD has become a standard parameter for defining responses in all modern clinical trials for CLL. Undetectable MRD has prognostic value but its status as a predictive marker is uncertain. The potential value of MRD testing in routine clinical practice depends on whether it can be used for clinical decision making such as stopping, changing, or continuing treatment. High-level evidence for this intervention would require a prospective randomized clinical trial in which MRD was used as a predictive biomarker for a group attaining an OS advantage compared with a control group disregarding MRD status. Such evidence has not been attained. Similar to outcomes in follicular lymphoma and other indolent lymphoid neoplasms, improved PFS in patients with CLL does not directly predict OS. The use of time-limited therapy is not as valuable in routine clinical practice. The use of time-limited therapy with venetoclax or the investigational combination of venetoclax and a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor has produced complete responses, and even undetectable MRD, in most patients.[ A phase II trial used a combination of venetoclax and ibrutinib in patients with undetectable MRD after 1 year of therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ibrutinib maintenance therapy or treatment cessation.[ References: These references have been identified by members of the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board as significant in the field of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment.
