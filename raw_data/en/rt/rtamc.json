Today, after surgery to remove a cancerous mole and eight lymph nodes from under each arm, she is cancer-free. Meghan was lucky. While melanoma represents only three percent of skin cancer cases, it accounts for more than three-quarters of skin cancer deaths. An estimated 30 million people tan indoors in the United States each year, the majority of them women between the ages of 16 and 29. \"A recent interna-tional study demonstrates that tanning bed users increase their risk of develop- ing melanoma,\" says David P. Eisenberg, M.D., of Hartford Surgical Oncology Specialists. \"The risk increases nearly 75 percent for those who first use tanning beds before age 35.\" Worldwide melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer. Sunlamps and ultraviolet-emitting tanning beds used for cosmetic reasons are now in the same class of carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) as cigarettes, arse-nic and asbestos, says the cancer-fighting arm of the World Health Organization. There are no federal regulations governing the use of tanning salons by young people. \"Tanning salons often advocate the safety of a 'base tan' and promote using a tanning bed before taking a tropical vacation,\" says Dr. Eisenberg. \"We now know there is no such thing as a 'safe' tan.\" Frigid weather poses risks to climbers, hikers and winter sports enthusiasts in wilderness areas. Less severe than frostbite, \"frostnip\" causes the skin, especially the ears, nose, fingers and toes, to appear white or waxy yellow and feel cold to the touch. With progression to more serious stages of frostbite, ice crystals cut off the blood supply, causing lasting tissue damage or gangrene necessitating amputation. \"Numbness, tingling or burning sensations that don't resolve with rewarming signal the need for emergency transport to the hospital for rapid treatment,\" says A. Jon Smally, M.D., medical director of Emergency Medicine at Hartford Hospital. \"Occasionally we treat an elderly individual with hypothermia and frostbite who has been lying in a snow - bank after falling and breaking a hip.\" Although gradual rewarming in lukewarm water used to be recommended, new medical guidelines call for immersion, when possible, in gently circulating water 104-108\u00b0 F (hot tub temperature). Follow these tips to avoid frost-related injuries: Be aware of the wind-chill factor and limit exposure Avoid alcohol on the trail Wear multiple layers of lightweight clothing and waterproof boots Remove wet gloves and tuck hands in armpits Never take off boots before walking out of woods Never vigorously rub cold, white skin Dying for a Tan Testicular cancer is on the rise in relatively young men. While the odds of survival are less grim than for many other cancers, aggressive treatment begins with surgery to remove the diseased testicle. The five-year survival rate exceeds 95 percent when the cancer is caught early. \"Testicular cancer is a highly treatable disease that can be cured with very good success rates, even when it has spread to the brain or other areas,\" says urologic oncologist Anoop Meraney, M.D., of Connecticut Surgical Group, noting that only about 8,000 cases occur each year in the United States, compared to nearly 220,000 cases of prostate cancer. Unlike prostate cancer, which affects twice as many African Americans, testicular cancer is most common in whites, particularly men of Scandinavian descent. The most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35, testicular cancer falls into two pathologic sub - types: seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. Testicular cancer is classified as stage I (limited to the testicles); stage II (spread to abdominal lymph nodes); and stage III (spread beyond lymph nodes to distant organs). The malignancy is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and/ or radiation, depending on disease stage and pathologic subtype. \"Chemotherapy and radiation are effective because tes - ticular cancer is highly sensitive to treatment, but because so many patients are young, they are at risk of developing a second cancer 30 to 40 years later,\" says Dr. Meraney, who recently joined Hartford Hospital from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The sports world was stunned in 1996 when world-class cyclist Lance Armstrong was diagnosed at age 25 with a highly malignant form of testicular cancer that had already spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. After undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he went on to win the gruel - ing Tour de France seven times. The cycling champion also fathered four children, three of them through in vitro fer - tilization using frozen sperm he banked before treatment and his youngest in the usual way. Fatherhood has also been a challenge for patients with testicular cancer who undergo retroperitoneal node dissection (RPLND), a surgical procedure utilized to treat many patients with early testicular cancer. RPLND is also used in select patients following chemotherapy and radia - tion treatment. Since only about five percent of testicular cancers affect both testes (necessitating testosterone supplementation), sexual function usually isn't affected. Dr. Meraney uses nerve-sparing surgical techniques to retain fertility whenever possible. Like most young, healthy men, Lance Armstrong ig- nored the early warning signs of testicular cancer. Because the malignancy is highly treatable when caught be - fore it spreads, men should see a physician immediately if they experience pain, heaviness, swelling or even a painless lump in a testicle. Regular self-examination is vital because most men discover themselves.

Zweibel, M.D., rotates three-dimensional images of a patient's heart on a computer screen as he manipulates robotic instruments with a joystick.With every beat, electricity ripples through cardiac muscle fibers, relaying impulses to the chambers of the heart and pumping oxygen- rich arterial blood throughout the body. Cardiac cells fire an \"excitation wave\" that rhythmically squeezes the heart's upper chambers (atria), trig - gering the filling of the lower chambers (ventri - cles) and circulating blood in a continuous cycle. The heart is an exquisite network of electric pulses and throbbing blood vessels that pumps about five thousand quarts of blood out through the arteries and back through the veins every day. Every second, waves of electricity signal chemi - cal messengers to relax and contract the heart muscle as it beats an estimated 2.5 billion times over a lifetime. Arrhythmias arise when sporadic electrical impulses accelerate or weaken the vital pulse of the beating heart, disrupting the regular pattern of circulation. Now, thanks to advanced robotics, wireless technology and minimally invasive techniques, electrophysiologists at Hartford Hospital routine - ly restore a normal heartbeat without wielding a scalpel. Each year in the United States, about 325,000 people collapse and die from sudden cardiac arrest. An irregular heart rhythm prompts the ventricles to fibrillate, or quiver uselessly as they stop pumping blood. We've all seen it on TV\u2014 defibrillator paddles on the chest, people yelling \"clear!\"\u2014but in real life sudden cardiac arrest, which is far more deadly than a \"heart attack,\" is usually fatal. Missing A Beat Many victims of sudden cardiac death are unaware of the fatty deposits clogging their coronary arteries. Arrhythmias serve as warnings from the body that the heart's electrical system is malfunctioning. Silent or severe, they create a bewildering array of symptoms ranging from harmless flutters and palpitations to heart pound - ing, weakness, dizzy spells, shortness of breath, sweating and chest pain. Abnormal heart rhythms can result from coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart muscle damage, valve disease, electrolyte imbal - ance, an overactive thyroid gland, heart attack or cardiomyopathy (a weak and enlarged heart). Arrhythmias are diagnosed with an electrocardio - gram (EKG), Holter monitors, loop recorders and specialized electrophysiology tests. While ventricu - lar fibrillation strikes suddenly, and often fatally, atrial fibrillation, or \"A-fib,\" is a common condi - tion that afflicts an estimated 2.2 million people in the United States. A-fib, which can increase the risk of blood clots or stroke, occurs when random electrical waves cause the upper chambers of the heart to beat chaotically. \"A-fib accounts for a third of all hospital admissions for cardiac rhythm disturbances,\" says Hartford Hospital Director of Electro physiology Steven L. Zweibel, M.D. \"Hospitalizations for A-fib have increased by two- thirds over the past 20 years. Assuming the trend continues, an estimated 15.9 million Americans will have A-fib by 2050.\" A complex disease with genetic links and multiple mechanisms, A-fib may spontaneously go away or intensify and become permanent. Highly symptomatic patients with rapid or irregular heartbeats are treated first with antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs. When A-fib persists despite treatment with multiple medications, a minimally invasive procedure called ablation can often drastically reduce symptoms and potentially restore the normal rhythm of the heart. Remote Control: Robotics Now a new \"robotic\" ablation system from Hansen Medical is bringing innovative technolo - gies to the treatment of A-fib, improving elec - trophysiology techniques and reducing radia - tion exposure for both patients and physicians. Studies show that medical centers that perform the most ablations have the best outcomes. Hartford Hospital, which pioneered A-fib abla - tion in Connecticut, is the first medical center in the region to employ the power and versatility of robotics for A-fib ablation. \"I used to stand over the patient draped in heavy protective garments made of lead, holding instruments in both hands, ablating with one foot pedal and operating the fluoroscope (X-ray) with the other foot pedal,\" says Dr. Zweibel, the first Hartford Hospital electrophysiologist to use the new Sensei X robot. \"Now I do everything seated at a console across the room, rotating images I sing the body electric...There swells and jets a heart \u2014 Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass Electrophysiology: The Body Electric 5of the heart on a video screen and controlling robotic instru - ments with a joystick.\" Highly sophisticated visualization and navigation tech - niques allow Dr. Zweibel to target and ablate complex arrhythmias, guided by high-resolution mapping and tactile- response software. \"The robotic system reduces the need for X-ray fluoroscopy because it intuitively 'knows' the direction I want to go,\" he says. \"There's less fatigue and better accu - racy because I'm no longer waiting for a technician to try to anticipate my movements. The system merges real-time data with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT (cat) scans to create a 3D view of the heart.\" Ablation eliminates the stray electrical waves that trig - ger erratic heart rhythms. Dr. Zweibel manipulates robotic controls to insert a catheter (a long, flexible tube with elec - trodes at the tip) into the heart. Patients are hospitalized for two or three days after the procedure and usually experience only slight discomfort in the leg where catheters are intro - duced. So far, studies show that about 70-80 percent of A-fib patients are in normal rhythm two years after ablation. By comparison, drugs only work about half the time. Most people treated with drugs alone will eventually have recurrent A-fib. Most faulty electrical signals that cause A-fib arise in the four pulmonary veins that feed the heart. Dr. Zweibel ablates, or \"burns\" tiny areas in a circular pattern around each of the pulmonary veins to isolate and \"fence off\" the area where the random electrical pulses originate. He can also perform cryoablation (using cold instead of heat) to ablate abnor - mal electrical pathways close to the normal conduction system of the heart. In addition to A-fib ablation, Hartford Hospital electrophysiologists also use the technique to treat a wide variety of other heart rhythm disorders, including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. Since many of these rhythms are not as electri - cally complex as A-fib, ablation usually offers a complete cure for most patients. Keeping the Pace Small, pager-sized devices nestled beneath the skin of the chest can monitor the heart's rhythm and keep the heart beating normally. Patients with a prior cardiac arrest or at high risk for cardiac arrest receive an \"implantable cardioverter defibrillator\" (ICD) containing a pacemaker and a defibrillator, which rapidly \"paces\" the heart to stop an arrhythmia or administers an electric shock if a heartbeat becomes dangerously erratic.PHYSICIAN PROFILE Eric M. Crespo, M.D., M.P.H., an electrophysiologist who specializes in heart rhythm management, recently joined Hartford Hospital's Division of Electrophysiology. After graduating from Providence College in Rhode Island, Dr. Crespo attended the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. He also earned a master's de - gree in Public Health at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Dr. Crespo completed his intern - ship and residency at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and his Cardiovascular Medicine fellowship at the University of North Carolina. He joined Hartford Hospital following completion of a Cardiac Electrophysiology fellowship at the University of Vermont, where he trained in complex ablations and device implantation techniques. In addition to clinical care of patients with heart rhythm disorders, Dr. Crespo is actively involved in research in the area of physiologic pacing. A native of Burlington, Connecticut, Dr. Crespo recently returned to the area, settling in Simsbury with his wife, who is also a physician, and their two daughters. Eric M. Crespo, M.D., M.P.H. The flexible catheter used for A-fib ablation literally \"turns on a dime\" for precision control. 6When the heart beats too slowly , a pacemaker can be surgically implanted to provide specially timed electrical impulses that stimulate the heart to contract, taking over the function of the heart's \"spark plug.\" A tiny internal computer chip figures out the timing and type of electrical pulses to send to the heart. Wires, or leads, that conduct electrical impulses are threaded from the device through a vein in the chest to one or both sides of the heart. Hartford Hospital was the first medical facility in the region to implant a state-of-the-art wireless pacemaker that allows physicians to monitor patients remotely. Although hospital electrophysiologists have implanted wireless ICDs for years, the FDA only recently approved the technology for pacemakers. The new pacemaker developed by St. Jude Medical automatically alerts physicians to critical changes in the patient's heart rhythm or device performance between regularly scheduled office appointments\u2014often before patients are aware of a problem. An extremely slow heartbeat leaves sufferers fatigued and unable to walk even short distances without becoming short of breath. Symptoms of a faltering heart rate include weakness, dizziness or fainting spells. The strong, steady pulse of the self-adjusting device \"paces\" the heart to keep the rhythm normal, while automatically alerting the physician to worsening symptoms. It can even sense when a patient is active and increase the heartbeat accordingly. The wireless pacemaker uploads test results and com - plete diagnostics to a secure patient care network site on the Internet, where physicians can easily transfer cardiac data to the patient's electronic health record. The device is programmed to record the signals that precede and follow a triggering event. \"Until now, pacemaker patients had to come in to the doctor's office to have the device 'interrogated' by plac - ing a telemetry wand on the skin,\" says Eric Crespo, M.D., M.P.H., an electrophysiologist at Hartford Hospital. \"Now they simply put the base station on a nightstand next to the bed and the pacemaker wirelessly transmits data while the patient is sleeping.\" The wireless pacemaker operates within a dedicated range of radio frequencies designated for medical devices, which reduces potential interference. Although U.S. cell phones do not interfere with pacemakers, Dr. Crespo sug - gests holding the phone to the opposite ear and not stor - ing it in a shirt pocket next to the pacemaker. Hartford Hospital has long been a leader not only in the mapping and ablation of arrhythmias, but also in cardiac care. \"Implanting a pacemaker is often just the first step in caring for patients with heart rhythm disorders,\" adds Dr. Crespo. \"The ability to remotely monitor the patient's heart increases the chances of a life-saving intervention.\" In addition to Drs. Zweibel and Crespo, Hartford Hospital's Division of Electrophysiology also includes Director of Interventional Electrophysiology Christopher A. Clyne, M.D., and Director of Heart Rhythm Management Jeffery Kluger, M.D., along with a staff of 28. Dr. Clyne is leading the hos - pital's participation in the nationwide CABANA clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of ablation with antiarrhythmic drug therapy for atrial fibrillation.

Light passes through the eye's cornea, lens and clear \"vitreous\" gel and focuses on a thin layer of tissue called the retina that covers the back inside wall of the eye. A \"detached\" retina may occur if the vitreous pulls away from the retina. While most people experience no lasting effects, weakened areas can tear and leak fluid under the retina, separating it from the wall of the eye. The detached retina loses its ability to relay images through the optic nerve to the brain, causing shadowy or blurred vision. \"People sometimes think they need new glasses or they're developing a cataract,\" says Jerry Neuwirth, M.D., director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hartford Hospital. \"If there is any loss of vision at all, don't wait. Call your ophthalmologist's office for a prompt appointment.\" If the retina tears across a blood vessel, the resulting hemorrhage causes bleeding into the vitreous. The sensation of seeing through a spider web or a swirling vortex of black or red lines calls for im- mediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Unless treated promptly, a detached retina can lead to permanent vision loss. Risk factors for a detached retina include aging, nearsightedness, family history, severe trauma, prior cataract surgery or congenital \"lattice degeneration\" that can progress to retinal detachment. A sudden shower of spots and flashes of light may be signs that the vitreous is pulling away from the retina. Some people describe a gray curtain or veil moving across their field of vision. Shadowy Vision: The retina's central \"bull's eye\" region, the macula, creates focus and fine visual detail, ringed by less-focused peripheral vision. \"People usually regain their sight if we treat the eye before the macula detaches,\" says Dr. Neuwirth. Performed promptly, a simple in-office laser treatment can prevent retinal detachment. If the retina has already detached, Dr. Neuwirth may use cryotherapy (freezing) or laser treatment to seal the retinal tear with a technique called \"pneumatic retinopexy,\" injecting a gas bubble inside the vitreous cavity to push the retina against the back wall of the eye. Dr. Neuwirth sometimes uses a \"scleral buckle,\" a synthetic band attached to the outside of the eyeball to gently push the wall of the eye against the detached retina. Often, in a surgery called a \"vitrectomy,\" he removes the gel-like vitreous and injects a gas bubble to close and flatten the retina. Both procedures are usually performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis at the hospital. Success rates exceed 90 percent with good visual recovery if treated promptly.Detached Retina? Bone Up on Soy The American Journal of Epidemiology says isofla - vones found in soy may play a role in the bone health of postmenopausal women, although soy is not recom - mended for breast cancer survivors. Women who eat more soy-based foods are up to 36 percent less likely to fracture a hip, report University of Singapore researchers, confirming the findings of an earlier study in China, where soy con - sumption is higher than in the West.Parkinson's Progression In Parkinson's disease pa - tients, the higher the levels of urate\u2014 a metabolite found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid\u2014the slower the disease progression, reports a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. A clinical trial is now underway to investigate the safety and potential benefits of supplemental urate eleva - tion for recently diagnosed Parkinson's patients with low levels of the biomarker.Fish Frequency Eating fatty fish may not reduce the risk of heart failure, although a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids does cut the chances of dying from a heart at - tack or stroke, say Dutch researchers. Previous U.S. clinical trials have shown that weekly consumption of fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and mackerel may help prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering triglyc - erides.Baby Boon An experimental genetic- screening test developed at England's Oxford University weeds out embryos with chromosomal abnormalities before implantation in the uterus. Comparative genom - ic hybridization (CGH) raises the chances of pregnancy for women undergoing IVF fertility treatment by two- thirds, according to results presented at the American Society American Society for Reproductive Medicine's annual conference. 8Emotional instability, stormy relationships and self- destructive behaviors often lead adults with \"borderline personality disorder\" (BPD) to seek help to achieve a \"life worth living.\" Evidence suggests that BPD\u2014a pervasive dysfunction of the individual's ability to regulate emo - tions\u2014results from a complex interplay of a biological vulnerability and environmental influences. Many people with BPD also struggle with substance abuse, depression, anxiety, suicidal thinking, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or eating disorders. In 1993, Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., pioneered Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a type of cognitive behavioral therapy especially helpful for the emotional dysregulation seen in individuals with BPD. The therapeutic approach encourages the \"dialectic\" between helping clients to ac - cept the reality of their lives on one side, and learning to change dysfunctional behaviors on the other. The Institute of Living (IOL) offers two DBT programs: intensive outpatient treatment and weekly outpatient therapy. Adults of all ages who meet at least two diagnos - tic criteria for BPD are eligible for the intensive program that meets three mornings a week for a minimum of three hours. Psychiatrist Angela Cappiello, M.D., provides on-site medication management. During the six- to eight-week rotation, participants learn to both regulate and tolerate their emotions. \"In addition to individual and group therapy, partici - pants in the intensive outpatient program do homework, watch movies and engage in role-playing,\" says Program Manager Cheryl Crowe, LCSW. \"DBT allows the patient to talk about both present difficulties and past experiences in the presence of an empathetic, accepting and non-judg - mental therapist.\" Using techniques of mindfulness, validation and accep - tance, the intensive outpatient program teaches concrete skills and strategies. \"The goal is to help individuals find a 'middle path' for coping with painful experiences, improv - ing relationships, and managing emotional ups and downs more effectively,\" adds Ms. Crowe. \"Individuals meet in groups and one-on-one with a treatment manager who also provides extra coaching to help overcome problems like impulsivity, self-harming behaviors, emotional instability or interpersonal conflicts.\" As a \"step-down\" from intensive treatment\u2014or through referral from the community\u2014patients may attend a weekly outpatient skills group that provides ongoing sup - port or as an adjunct to individual therapy. Weekly sessions help people improve their lives as they learn how to change their behavior patterns and develop long-lasting relation - ships. Penny Barnum Young, APRN, offers DBT through the IOL's outpatient psychiatric services for adults. Since loss of supports or structure is often a precipitat - ing factor in BPD, an individual may not be diagnosed until a romantic relationship ends, a parent dies or some other event occurs. \"One older woman wasn't diagnosed with BPD until she retired from her job,\" says Ms. Young. \"Individuals with BPD may appear to cope in a protected environment or with lots of social support. When they lose the structure and validation of a job, for example, issues of abandonment or dependency may surface.\" DBT is especially beneficial when emotional instability contributes to behaviors like gambling, substance abuse or eating disorders. DBT has been established as an effec - tive treatment for people who binge\u2014consuming unusu - ally large amounts of food while experiencing a clear loss of control over the eating\u2014or purge (bulimia) because of depression or emotional difficulties. Hartford Hospital patients who undergo bariatric (weight loss) surgery are expected to learn new eating behaviors. Ms. Young is cur - rently developing an adaptation of DBT treatment for binge eating and bulimia for patients who may be struggling to cope after bariatric surgery. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder 9In the doctor's office of today, paper charts are vanishing. Welcome to the digital age: Bluetooth, WiFi, Internet portals and \"cloud\" computing. Beyond convenience, infor - mation technology (IT) ensures accuracy and prevents medica - tion errors when pharmacy orders are transmitted electronically (e-prescribing). Hartford Hospital is at the forefront of innovation in the evolving world of wireless telemetry. Implanted cardiac devices automatically notify physicians via the Internet if a patient's heart rhythm changes drastically. In the physician's office set - ting, cardiologists record patient visits on a lightweight, portable computer with a folding screen that swivels from a notebook into a flat tablet that can be written on with a stylus. Information is uploaded to a patient health network on the Internet that stores electronic medical records (EMR) with secure encryption and easy access from anywhere. Using wireless technology, doctors record vital signs, place orders or dictate notes without ever touching a keyboard. Cardiologist Brett Duncan, M.D., uses a portable computer to update a patient's chart during an examination. Wireless Technology and Electronic Medical Records 10\"Our practice has adopted voice-recognition software special - ized for medical professionals,\" says cardiologist Brett Duncan, M.D., of Cardiology, PC. \"I simply speak into a microphone instead of dictating into a recording device, eliminating the need for typing and transcription.\" The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act\u2014part of President Obama's Stimulus package\u2014offers $44,000 incentives over a period of five years to clinicians who adopt an EMR system. Just last year, a New England Journal of Medicine survey showed that only four percent of clinicians have fully functional order- entry and clinical-decision support capabilities. Web-based software, called \"cloud\" computing, allows Hartford Hospital cardiologists to use any web browser to ac - cess electronic records through secure Internet portals. \"Each patient's confidential file is centrally hosted on a private network accessible from any Internet connection,\" says Dr. Duncan. \"The patient's complete file also contains records from linked provider networks, electro cardiograms (EKGs), laboratory results, diagnostic imaging and all other relevant medical reports.\" Hartford Hospital is participating in a groundbreaking ef - fort to develop the physician's \"office of the future\" that will share vital patient information electronically across multiple health care organizations, employer groups and insurers. \"Hospitals that share a patient's medical history electronically with other providers can avoid having to guess about medica - tions or allergies,\" says Vice President of Information Services Stephan D. O'Neill. Unplugged: of the Future \"At Hartford Hospital, we are well on our way to a 'paper - less' system of e-prescribing and records management,\" adds Mr. O'Neill. \"Thanks to the passage of the stimulus law and incentives for physicians to adopt electronic health records, federal funding will help us create a statewide health information exchange linking health records from the largest hospitals and medical practices in Connecticut. The current health care delivery system in Connecticut and across the country is often decentralized and fragmented.\" The transition to an electronic medical records system could save an estimated $371 billion per year nationwide. Hartford Hospital's Eclipsys system automates and stream - lines physician order entry and electronic medication administration records (eMAR) to assure quality and enhance patient safety, while also improving patient care outcomes and clinical performance. Only an estimated eight percent of the 5,000 hospitals in the United States use the kind of computerized record-keeping systems that President Obama envisions for the whole nation. For the third consecutive year, Hartford Hospital was named one of the nation's \"100 Most Wired\" hospitals by Hospitals & Health Networks magazine, the journal of the American Hospital Association. Most Wired hospitals show better outcomes in patient satisfaction and other quality measures. The hospital also earned the distinction of being one of the top 25 \"Most Wireless\" hospitals in the country. 11 Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at 860-545-1888 or 800-545-7664 for information about any program.
