Gist Director About the Bureau of Justice Assistance The Bureau of Justice Assistance administers the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program to supportdrug control and system improvemenrefforts focused on state and local criminal justice systems. The Bureau's mission, directed by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, is to provide funding and technical assistance to state and local units of government to combat crime and drug abuse. Through funding and technical support, the Bureau assists the states in managing the growing numbers of anti-drug programs and the rapidly increasing volume of drug cases entering the criminal justice system. It also identifies, develops, and shares programs, techniques, and information with the states to increase the efficiency of the criminal justice system, as well as provides training and technical assistance to enhance the expertise of criminal justice personnel. The Bureau accomplishes these mandates by funding innovative demonstration programs, some of which are national or multi-jurisdictional in scope; by evaluating programs to determine what works in drug control and system improvement; and by encouraging the replication of successful models through linkages with the Formula Grant Program and other resources. The Director of the Bureau is appointed by the President and, upon confirmation by the Senate, serves at the President's pleasure. The Director establishes the priorities and objectives of the Bureau and has final authority to approve grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. In establishing its annual program, the Bureau is guided by the priorities of the Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Office Of Justice Programs, and the needs of the criminal jusiice community.

The first volume of State and Local Programs: Focus on What Works was published in September 1994 and documented programs on rural drug abuse and crime; treatment, rehabilitation, and education; understanding and combatting violence; and drug abuse and violent crime prevention. The programs documented in both volumes are primarily the result of program development and implementation activities supported by BJA's Formula Grant Program to State and local governments and organizations. Additionally, some of the programs were developed as a result of BJA funding through its Discretionary Grant Program. Finally, a few programs were established and sustained with little or no Federal funding, but are of interest to State and local planners for potential replication. Under the State Evaluation Development (SED) program, coordinated by the Justice Research and Statistics Association (JRSA), BJA has been working for the past three years to determine which of these drug abuse and violent crime programs work most effectively, and how lessons learned at the State and local levels can be shared nationally to ensure that the most promising approaches can have a broad impact. In addition to wanting to know about successful initiatives, justice system planners and managers need to understand the scope and level of effort required for innovative approaches. This document facilitates access to a richbody of information, in a systematic format, that should be a valuable reference tool for transferring ideas and making contacts -- or networking -- between criminal justice practitioners. The Stale and Local Working Meetings were held in: Memphis, Tennessee; Mesa, Arizona; and Portland , Oregon. The results of those meetings have been combined and presented here in three sections: A. Successful Collaborative Programs B. Youth, Drugs and Violence C. Innovative Courts Programs Each meeting used an approach which combined the presentation of perspectives and programs focused on the above themes. Perspectives were important to set the stage ix and build common definitions and assumptions around which the working meetings were organized. A \"team\" approach was used to document programs, with the program managers as leads. The managers were assisted by BJA and JRSA staff, participants from the State Planning Agencies, and other practitioners and evaluation experts. Each meeting also benefitted from information gathered by extensive literature searches, secondary data analyses, as well as recognized experts in each field which became a focus of the meeting. Special reports produced for the meetings included Respondh2g to Juvenile Drag Abuse and Violent Crime and Focus on the Role of Courts in the Crimhlal Justice System. Readers of this report will observe that State and local agencies are actively funding, implementing, and evaluating a broad range of drug abuse and violent crime programs. Because participants came from various parts of the country to each meeting, all participants learned of the many diverse problems faced by their counterparts across the Nation, and of many innovative responses developed to combat drug abuse and violent crime. Participants were asked to develop their presentations and programs under established guidelines. Each program documentation is organized by goals and objectives; program components; results and impact (performance measures, implementation problems, successes and accomplishments); and prospects for replication. Volume II contains both perspectives and program descriptions from over 300 State and local Planners and practitioners, as well as researchers and analysts, who have previously or are currently involved in implementing and/or evaluating programs. Many hours were spent documenting, discussing, and sharing ideas and information with each other. Individuals who played key roles in producing this document are listed in the acknowledgements. The report permits the user to identify and locate valuable information on specific programs and other topics of interest. A \"Topic Index\" can be found following the introduction. Programs are listed under all applicable areas, along with the State that provided documentation for the program, a Section (A, B, or C), and a page number. Section A addresses successful collaborative programs; Section B addresses youth, drugs and violence programs; and Section C addresses innovative courts programs. This second volume of a continuing series helps to meet BJA's goal to provide access to the criminal justice community and others involved in implementing programs with clear explanations on how to adopt promising programs. Innovative State and Local Programs, X Volume 1I is published primarily to make program information available which should be useful to communicate effectively with a diverse audience. The overall effectiveness of Federal funding is best reached through a program development model that tests innovative State and local ideas in action, and then shares the information gained with the broadest audience. Promising steps have been taken, and much has been learned at the State and local levels regarding what works. xi 0 0 0 Innovative State and Local Programs Topic Index PERSPECTIVES JOIN TOGETHER, Janice Ford Griffin, A.5 The \"Three C's\" of Crime Prevention Programs, Charles W..

This meeting brought together over 50 State planners and local practitioners as well as researchers, analysts, and law effforcement officers from 16 states who have previously been or currently are involved in implementing and/or evaluating programs designed to improve the criminal justice system through successful collaborations. This publication identifies and documents programs that focus on the successful collaboration between agencies to improve the criminal justice system at the State and local levels. The first section of the publication presents perspectives from two national experts. The second section of the publication presents two process-oriented program presentations, and the final section documents the State and local programs that were presented at the workshop. 0 0 0 Perspectives on Collaboration and Improving the Criminal Justice System 0 0 0 JOIN TOGETHER Janice Ford Griffin is the Deputy Director of JOIN TOGETHER, a non-profit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts that serves as a national resource for communities fighting substance abuse. JOIN TOGETHER is committed to assisting communities in the development and implementation of comprehensive, inclusive strategies to address substance abuse and its related problems. Comprehensive long-range strategies include prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and economic development. Substance abuse is a complex problem that has resulted in community elements blaming each other. Community segments must develop new alliances and seek creative ways to address the substance abuse-related problems of the 90's. Community-wide strategies must include neighborhood groups, clergy, schools, parents, law enforcement, health and social service providers, businesses, media, government, and others. People support what they help create. Strategies created by a few will not be supported by many. Successful strategies embrace the concept of \"doing with, not doing for.\" Comprehensive, collective strategies will address community priorities, as opposed to sophisticated theoretical models. All communities have macro issues that are easily determined by consensus. Micro issues are neighborhood specific and must be addressed simultaneously to ensure that everyone can take ownership of the effort. \"We have to come to some mixture of addressing the macro and micro issues. There are four areas that can help to do that. (1) Does the program, neighborhood, and city have knowledge and activity that can help to prevent drug use? (2) Is quality, appropriate, treatment accessible in the neighborhood and also for the city at-large? (3) Does the program help to eliminate drug trafficking and provide safety for families? (4) Is the program known to the business community? Does the business community support it? Are they willing to create jobs to make the area one that is 'jobs friendly'?\" A flexible, dynamic interplay of leadership is necessary to implement and maintain the variety of strategies that are required by the complexity of substance abuse-related issues. \"When you involve people who are part of city government, they can help point the way for new relationships that can come out of these activities and relationships that will yield a benefit for everyone.\" Some important collaborators in local government include: health departments for trealment components; parks and recreation for youth activities; personnel/human relations for the dissemination of information to adults; public works for code violations incident to trafficking; and the police for public safety. Some problems associated with evaluation include: objectives inconsistent with the community's priorities; community residents untrained for employment in evaluation processes; culturally insensitive and inappropriate evaluation methods; and evaluation methods designed with funders' objectives, which tend to reflect their perspectives. \"Train community people to be involved in evaluation. If you can in some way train some of the people in the community to help do evaluation...they develop a skill, and you are using people who can get information that (would)...not be given to you.\" The \"ultimate evaluation is in job growth, job-friendly environment(s), and (during)...elections.\" Communications and media \"include information sharing among community partners, as well as the transmission of newsworthy information through news and popular media. Newsletters, community bulletin boards, and radio talk shows are vehicles to help inform the community of opportunities to participate in community strategies. Editorial board meetings, op-ed articles, and letters to the editor should be integral pieces of an overall strategy to inform and to advocate various issues. \"Hold the media accountable for your programs.\" The journalistic credo, \"if it bleeds, it leads,\" is as much an impediment to success in changing some neighborhoods as are more direct and obvious problems. Elected officials are most accountable when there are continuing relationships and responsibilities around the community's issues. Testimony before local government councils, State legislative panels, and Congressional panels should be objectives for participants in community initiatives. Community groups should request elected officials to assign staff members to follow specific issues and to provide breaking information and funding opportunities quickly and regularly. It assures that the officials' staffs are knowledgeable about those issues, improves the ability of the staff to represent the issues, and dramatically increases the promptness with which information reaches constituents. \"Collaboration is what is absolutely necessary in order to make a change.\" Community groups should be aware of groups with which to collaborate: YMCA/YWCA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Chambers of Commerce, Private Industry Councils, Community Colleges, Cable TV Access Stations, Fighting Back Projects, CSAP Community Partnerships, National Family Partnerships, Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities, HUD Drug Elimination in Public Housing, Job Training Partnership Act Programs, Americorps, and many others. Finally, there is a continuing challenge to be creative and developmental. \"You have to be developmental in what you do. The wheel has to be modernized. If you don't want something to wear out, you have to do something developmental so that it doesn't wear out. There has to be constant change, updating, and development.\" Strategies must be continuously reexamined and refined. The world is constantly changing, and successful programs will often be one step ahead of the change. \"As the name (of my organization) implies...we are going to have to join together in order to make strides against the difficult problems that confront us. We have to all come around the table.\" The \"Three C's\" of Crime Prevention Programs Charles W. Burson is the Attorney General for the State of Tennessee. Attorney General Burson emphasizes that the focus of the workshop is on local programs tailored to the specific problems of their communities, not on established national models. The programs have three themes or the \"Three C's.\" The first of these is community where the problems and the opportunities to solve them exist. The second is the connection between the people in the community and the support and enforcement resources. The final theme is the collaboration among cities, counties, State enforcement agencies, and Federal government enforcement agencies. The Bureau of Justice Assistance's Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Formula Grant Program gives financial assistance to the states and local communities, and they are ready to accept these grants to initiate productive and successful efforts to combat drug abuse and violence in their communities. The Tennessee Office of Program Assessment and Support and corresponding offices in each state are important to these crime-fighting efforts. A collaborative effort is necessary to fight drug abuse and violence, and this is made possible through local, State, community, and financial leadership. Fighting violent crime and drug abuse is the number one agenda of States' Attorney Genevils. The problems of drug abuse and violent crime are so large, where is the national solution or model to solve them? This workshop looks at what is working in local communities, and assessments show that there is local success. Crime must be fought on the level at which it occurs. There is no national or State crime. Crime is present in the streets, households, and neighborhoods of all local communities. 7 0 a 0 State and Local Programs: Focus on Process 0 0 0 Maine The Partnership Between the University of Maine and Law Enforcement Agencies Statement of the Problem Community policing is receiving increased attention and visibility on the national, State, and local levels. However, it is a topic and process subject to misinterpretation and uncertainty. While many people equate community policing with simply \"putting police back on the beat,\" it is actually a complex reorganization of policing priorities, relationships with citizens and elected officials, and formal and informal relationships with other public and nonprofit agencies serving the human and social needs of citizens. While numerous Maine jurisdictions have become interested in implementing community policing, there is a dearth of information and assistance available to them. Similarly, some opportunities for training in implementing community policing exist in Maine, but they are not widely known and are frequently unavailable to smaller jurisdictions without significant resources. This is particularly true of the needs assessment phase of implementing community policing. Conducting a survey of citizen perceptions and priorities is a crucial component of community policing. However, successfully fielding a survey of citizens which will produce a valid, reliable response is a complex task requiring knowledge and experience in social science survey methodology, including instrument preparation, sampling, and analysis. These skills are frequently unavailable to law enforcement officials in jurisdictions interested in instituting community policing. Goals and Objectives The primary goals of the State of Maine collaboration are (1) to provide technical assistance to local law enforcement agencies for implementing community policing and (2) to facilitate communication between citizens and law enforcement agencies. This is one of the goals because according to David Giampetruzzi, coordinator of the overall project, \"the alliance between community residents and police (is) essential to making neighborhoods safe and drug free.\" To achieve those goals, the University of Maine - Law Enforcement partnership has established the following objectives: provide citizen input for community policing needs assessments; provide graduate public administration students a setting for applied research; 11 foster closer partnerships between local government officials and law enforcement agencies; and develop a statewide survey tool for planning community policing initiatives. Process Components The principle investigator and project director is Dr. Jean Lavigne, Assistant Professor and Director of Graduate Programs in Public Administration at the University of Maine, Orono. Dr. Lavigne is responsible for coordinating and overseeing each phase of the project. The co- principle investigator is Dr. Anthony Cahill, Associate Professor of Public Administration. Dr. Cahill provides assistance in survey and interview protocol design and administration and will work on the other phases of the project as necessary. Dr. Carolyn Ball is a consultant on the statistical analyses and also meets with local law enforcement officials in the planning stages. The principle investigators will be assisted by graduate students assigned to the project. The local government contact is generally the Chief of Police or the Sheriff. Often town/city managers and members of the town/city council are involved in the planning stages. During the first phase of this partnership, from January 1993 through June 1994, two major tasks were undertaken. First, a valid, reliable instrument was constructed which would measure citizens' attitudes and priorities towards law enforcement and crime and which could be used in multiple communities. The second task was to administer and analyze the survey in five Maine communities and prepare reports for law enforcement and municipal officials in each of the communities. The specific, elements involved were: to design a survey instrument and interview protocol for use in conducting community policing needs assessment; to identify the sampling frame to be used; to prepare analytic routines and code, enter, verify, and analyze the data from completed surveys; to publicize the project in the community; and to prepare and present oral and written reports for the community. The graduate students in the Department of Public Administration provide data entry of surveys, analyze data which is overseen by faculty members, and provide a complete report of the findings. 12 Results and Impact Performance Measures The expected results and performance measures were divided into three categories: community, law enforcement, and public administration students. For the community, program administrators hoped to publicize local law enforcement community policing initiatives, provide three news releases, survey the community, target a response rate between 20 to 40 percent, and facilitate communication between local government management and law enforcement planning. For law enforcement, the goal was to discover citizens' perceptions of law enforcement officials. For public administration students, the goals were to modify the survey for each community within two weeks of the initial community meeting, develop research and presentation skills, develop an understanding of local government and law enforcement relationships, and process the survey within six weeks, including data entry, data analyses, and preparation of the report. Implementation Problems and Successes Local law enforcement officials have been very satisfied with the survey reports. Implementation has been smooth. The problem area has been coordination between informing the news media and the timing of the mailing of the surveys. This has been resolved in a speedy manner. Successes and Accomplishments The project has successfully completed surveys for approximately 10% of the total population of the State of Maine. By June 30, 1995 it will have completed community policing surveys for 15 local governments and one county. One of the clear advantages of this partnership has been the ability to collect common perceptions of citizens across the State. Prior to this endeavor, local communities prepared their own surveys. However, many had no ability to compare across communities. The survey has provided for the State of Maine to use its scarce resources most efficiently in targeting community policing initiatives. Prospects for Replication The prospects for replication are very good especially for States with a close association between universities and communities. The Department of Public Administration of the University of Maine has been able to offer its students \"real\" research opportunities in a local government setting. The law enforcement agencies can benefit from the university faculty expertise in research design. The support of the Maine Justice Assistance Council was instrumental in nurturing the program, and the State has benefited from the collaborative agreement. 13 Contact Information Jean Lavigne, Ph.D. Director, Graduate Programs University of Maine, Orono 5754 North Stevens Orono, ME 04469 (207) 581-1877 (207) 581-3039 fax David Giampetruzzi Grant Program Administrator Maine Criminal Justice Agency 93 Silver Street Waterville, ME 04901 (207) 877-8016 (207) 877-8027 fax 14 North Dakota State's Attorney Management System (SAMS) Statement of the Problem North Dakota is one of the few states where county prosecutors have been assigned the responsibility of reporting dispositions to maintain the Criminal History Records System (CHRS) managed by the State Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). There is an elected State's Attorney in each of North Dakota's 53 counties; 12 State's Attorneys work full-time with offices located in the courthouse, and the remaining 41 are private attorneys who perform the prosecutor duties on a part-time basis. Prior to this project, few State's Attorneys used prosecution management software or computer technology. The lack of automation has made completion of vital criminal history records time consuming, inefficient, and difficult to track for completion. The BCI and the North Dakota Association of Counties' computer arm, the North Dakota Cooperative for Automation and Technology (NDCAT), came together to bring a State's Attorney Management System (SAMS) to counties. Using multiple sources, much of the SAMS project was funded by Federal grants. The standardized format of the data will allow completion of the final phase of the SAMS project, electronic transfer of the data to the CHRS. Goals and Objectives The goal of the SAMS project is to implement a uniform case management system to reduce the overall cost of maintenance and support to counties and, through automation of the county State's Attorneys' offices, to develop a consistent, timely, and efficient manner of reporting disposition information to maintain the CHRS in North Dakota. Phase One identified the data elements and the information to be shared with other criminal justice agencies and chose the technology it will use. The second phase involves development and implementation of the software and training for SAMS users. The final phase will see the electronic transfer of disposition data from all 53 county State's Attorneys' offices to the CHRS residing on the State's mainframe at the Information Services Division (ISD). 15 The project objectives include: gaining a thorough understanding of the data needs of the various justice agencies and how they can share data elements; choosing a software package for prosecution case management and identifying the hardware platform; identifying the automation needs in the State's Attorneys' offices and coordinating their needs with the existing technology in the courthouse; facilitating the acquisition and installation of the equipment; identifying all training needs; connecting to North Dakota's Wide Area Network to access the CHRS and driving records abstracts at the State Department of Transportation; and making it possible for the State's Attorneys to share information with other agencies and electronically transfer data to the CHRS. Program Components The first phase of the SAMS project began in 1992 and was funded by a grant administered by NDCAT from the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program. A Justice and Public Safety user group was formed including representatives from the State's Attorneys' offices, Sheriff's Departments, courts, State justice agencies, BCI, and the Supreme Court. They began identifying the data elements and information, areas that can be shared among criminal justice agencies to improve the efficiency of the flow of information from arrest through disposition. The Supreme Court had already developed and distributed a courts package for IBM's mid- range platform, the AS/400. BCI had developed the Jail Administration and Booking System (JABS), a PC-based jail management program used by Sheriff's Departments. Until then, the link between them had been untouched by automation. Representatives from the user group, along with other State's Attorneys, began to look at commercial software for prosecution case management. They also discovered the AS/400 was the platform of choice because the courts were using it and over half the counties already had access to an AS/400. Funding sources were investigated, but it appeared the commercial software was cost prohibitive for many counties. BCI recognized the need to automate the link between the Sheriff's Department and the courts and the importance of linking the State's Attorneys' offices to the CHRS. They offered to use a portion of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) grant received for criminal history record improvement to write the prosecution case management software. The second phase of the SAMS project began by forming a State's Attorney Information System Work Group to develo p the SAMS software application. This group was made up of State's Attorneys and staff from State's Attorneys' offices, courts, BCI, and NDCAT. It was funded by the BJS criminal history record improvement grant. 16 Initial implementation of the SAMS software included automation of the full-time State's Attorneys' offices, which were chosen because they handle about 80% of the cases in North Dakota. Also, their physical location in the courthouse meant they had access to the AS/400. These counties also house the district judge chambers, so the group considered the potential for sharing information with the courts. A part-time State's Attorney site was also chosen to test remote access. Results and Impact Performance Measures Eleven full-time offices and one part-time office were automated in 1994-95, with much of the funding for hardware and training coming from the Edward Byme Grant Program. Two sites were funded by a Federal Criminal History Grant through BCI. The Byrne grant will fund the continuation of phase two in 1995 by automating five additional remote part-time State's Attorneys' offices. The remote sites needing to use communications to access the AS/400 will have access to the State's Wide Area Network (WAN). While each courthouse has a direct connection to the North Dakota Information Network (NDIN), ISD is currently upgrading NDIN to include dial-up access to the network. Scheduled for completion by June 1995, access to NDIN will give all State's Attorneys' offices the capability to receive data from the CHRS and the driving records abstracts at the State Department of Transportation. The 1993 legislature adopted two resolutions important to the SAMS project. The first directed the Legislative Council to \"...study means of gathering data on the sentencing of all persons convicted of a felony offense and allpersons convicted of a misdemeanor in violation of North Dakota Century Code Chapters 12.1-17. 12.1-20, and 14-07.1.\" This section deals with assault, sex offenses, and domestic violence. The second resolution asked the Council to \"...study the present methods of collecting data within the criminal justice and quasi-criminal civil systems in this and other states, and the desirability of implementing a system-wide data collection process in North Dakota.\" The findings and recommendations were to be reported to the 1995 legislature. These resolutions led to the creation of a Criminal Justice Data Forum, which included representatives of law enforcement agencies, prosecution, courts, corrections, human services agencies, news media, computer services, local governmental entities, and others. For more than a year this forum examined criminal justice data issues and identified gaps in available data. The significance of this project is demonstrated by the importance the legislature is placing on statewide information systems. 17 Implementation Problems and Successes Two stumbling blocks were choosing the software application and the hardware platform. Constant changes in technology remain a challenge as this project continues. Also, the lack of technical expertise and support staff in the counties remains a concern to the project's overall success. One solution to this problem is extensive training of the existing staff. Another solution is to hire a person or group of people to serve as travelling trainers and problem solvers. One problem with the system was in its implementation. The decision makers for the program were States' Attorneys and other elected officials. Their support staffs were not involved in any decision making. This approach was inappropriate because the support staff, who work with the system, are finding it difficult to work with because they were not part of the planning process, and the decision makers who were part of the planning process are not overly enthusiastic about using the new system. The decision makers need to impart to the support staff the need to work with the system. Even though disposition data is reported to the BCI by State's Attorneys' offices, the interfacing of SAMS and the courts' computer system is a logical and efficient exchange of data between prosecutors and courts. By assigning responsibility for disposition reporting to State's Attorneys rather than to the courts, the State has relieved the courts of that burden but has also reduced the long-term benefits to the courts. There is residual information accompanying disposition data that would be helpful to the courts if it were readily available, but it is not presently a function of the CHRS. The courts, however, should not have to rely on the criminal history record system for information on their own activities. Successes and Accomplishments At this time, 11 of the 12 full-time State's Attorneys' offices are automated. The pilot site for a remote location has also been successful. The State's Attorney is remotely accessing the SAMS software on the AS/400 in the courthouse. All of the sites have received training on the SAMS application and Office Vision/400, the AS/400 word processing package used as the editor for SAMS. The lack of Management Information Systems staff in the counties prompted the inclusion of AS/400 system operations training in the project. NDCAT continues to support the project through project administration and technical support. A help desk has been established to answer technical questions (e.g., backing up the system, communication problems, and printing problems). BCI continues to support the project by providing the application training and maintenance of the SAMS software. BCI submitted a grant application to the National Criminal History Improvemen t Program, ~ which focuses primarily on integrating or interfacing information systems already in place or being developed/proposed with the CHRS. Funding for the continuation of the SAMS installations is included in the grant request. 18 Prospects for Replication According to Leana Jacobsen, Technical Coordinator of NDCAT, \"Although North Dakota is one of only a few states where prosecutors are required to report dispositions for criminal history maintenance, many of the concepts of this project are suitable for replication.\" The relationship between NDCAT and the BCI enabled several related projects to be accomplished by State and local government working together. Because of these collaborative efforts, the opportunity existed to capitalize on available funding sources.

There are only 5,612 total roadway miles of which approximately half are currently hard surfaced. The population of the State is 599,200 with 60% of the people living in the urban areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. The remaining 239,680 people reside in the vast rural area of the State. In this area there are over 225 native villages ranging in population from less than 100 to nearly one thousand, which require public safety services. These are villages where there are little or no medical, educational, police, or social services professionals. These isolated communities are only accessible by air or water transportation, and reaching them can be delayed as a result of adverse weather and runway conditions. Over the past five years the Department of Public Safety, Division of Troopers has had an average of 258 commissioned Troopers to provide public safety services for the entire State. In the early 1980's, as a solution to the disproportionately higher rate of crime and accidental deaths in the villages in comparison to the urban communities, the Alaska State Troopers introduced the Village Public Safety Officer (VPSO) program into rural villages. The program was designed to train and employ individuals residing in the villages to provide initial response to public safety emergencies in the areas of law enforcement, medical assistance, search and rescue, and fire protection. The number of VPSOs and villages where the program was established has fluctuated from year to year as a result of changes in the funding from the State legislature. An average of 94 officers have handled almost 10,000 calls for service each year. The presence of these officers has had a significant impact on improving the quality of life in the participating villages. During the same period, in response to a decline in health and safety attributed to the widespread abuse of alcohol in these remote villages, State legislation was passed which allowed local communities to determine the level of restriction desired on the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol. These are known as \"Local Option\" laws. In villages which chose to control or totally ban alcohol, for a period of time the quality of life improved. As a result of the \"Local Option\" laws and the Village Public Safety Officers, there are less violent crimes, domestic violence, accidental deaths, fire related deaths, and drownings. As time passed, alcohol bootlegging became a common practice, and with the increasing importation of illegal drugs to these remote villages it was apparent that law enforcement alone could not solve the quality of life problems. Again, violent crime and domestic violence associated with alcohol and drug abuse were on the rise. The people residing in these remote 23 villages became increasingly frustrated with the rising crime. As frustrations grew over law enforcement's failure to provide a solution, village leaders increasingly voiced their dissatisfaction with State government. It became clear that the villages needed to create and maintain community interest in identifying local problems and finding solutions ina partnership with VPSOs and the Troopers. Consequently, in April 1993, initial steps were taken by Troopers assigned to the western Alaska Post and the Western Area Narcotics Team to establish a program which is referred to as \"Community Problem Solving.\" Goals and Objectives The primary goal of the Community Problem Solving program is to reduce alcohol and drug abuse and the resulting criminal activity and loss of life associated with this abuse. Additionally, a goal of the program is to enhance the relationship between the village leaders, the Village Public Safety Officers, and the State Troopers. The objectives designed to accomplish these goals include the following: encourage village members to identify the needs of the village; encourage village members to establish corrective actions; encourage village members to implement change which is centered on a combination of cultural beliefs and criminal justice resources; identify ways in which the village members can work in partnership with the VPSOs and the Troopers to implement actions to accomplish their plans; test this program effort in four villages; and develop a model process that could be applied to other villages with an interest in making social change and in having a significant role in resolving conflict in their villages. Program Components Initially, a plarming group was formed to develop the concept of community problem solving. The group was made up of village leaders, Village Public Safety Officers, State Troopers, State court system personnel, and rural health care and social service providers, as well as youth and school groups. 24 The Slate Trooper assigned oversight duty for the Village Public Safety Officers was tasked with generating public interest in meetings held in each community, establishing voluntary participation by village leaders, and securing a formal invitation to the State Troopers from the village governing body for assistance in the implementation of the program. One of the Alaska State Troopers involved with the program, Lieutenant AI Schadle, said that basically, \"We went into these villages and got the communities excited and got them identifying their own problems, (and) got them taking action.\" Additionally, the oversight Trooper was responsible for continued follow-up activities with each village to maintain continuous community support, identify law enforcement needs, and assess program results. Village community problem solving committees, which include various village representatives, were established at each site selection. Results and Impact Performance Measures Each month, Troopers and VPSOs hold meetings with village committees to review the accomplishments, obtain subjective feedback on specific program efforts, and monitor the impact on problems related to alcohol and drug abuse. Each quarter, the request for service reports are reviewed by the Troopers to assess the Village Public Safety Officers' activity. The oversight Trooper reports monthly as to the effectiveness of the alcohol and drug interdiction efforts and the efforts made to expand training in interdiction skills for VPSOs and outpost Troopers. Annually, statistics for the numbers and types of requests for service will be compared to the same data before implementation of the Community Problem Solving program. The same comparison will be made of the death records in the villages. Implementation Problems and Successes There were numerous problems encountered during the initiation of this program. The proximity of villages which voted to completely restrict alcohol, \"dry villages,\" to that of neighboring villages with no alcohol restriction caused some friction between the communities. Also, this created an easy means of access to alcohol for those individuals who were unwilling to abide by the alcohol restrictions in their village. Meetings were organized between villages to air concerns and combat this problem. Each community problem solving committee is made up of representatives of the various leadership groups from each village. Due to power struggles among these groups and the different views on important issues such as sovereignty, subsistence hunting and fishing rights, and tribal courts, considerable time and effort was necessary on the part of the oversight 25 Trooper to keep the committee focused on alcohol and drug abuse issues and the negative impact each was having on the village. There have been occasions when committee members and village leaders have been intimidated by village residents who have enjoyed financial gain from illegal drug and alcohol activities. At these times, the community's cooperative efforts with the State Troopers have been undermined. In these situations, the Troopers target the individuals and monitor them closely. The Troopers also do \"knock and talks\" with the suspected bootleggers to attempt to dissuade them from these illegal activities. In support of the efforts being made by village members, follow-up from the oversight Trooper has not always been timely. Since the Troopers assigned to the western region are located in larger hub communities, access to the villages has often been limited by weather, aircraft availability, and remote runway conditions. The leaders of the villages are usually the elders, who speak little or no English. As a result, translators are often required in order to avoid misinterpretation of information and intent. Additionally, many concepts captured in English words do not easily translate to the native languages. Another problem was the initial high turnover rate of VPSOs. This was due in part to cultural issues concerning one individual having authority over others. This was solved by turning to new individuals or by going outside of the village to hire a VPSO. In addition, in communities where the VPSO turnover rate is high due to his/her dismissal by the village council, no replacement is provided if there is no legitimate cause for dismissal, and the community is positioned at the bottom of the waiting list to receive another VPSO. There has been significant resistance on the part of some Troopers assigned to the region to support the program, which they have viewed as a social services effort rather than law enforcement. This problem was solved through a mandatory cultural awareness course provided by the University of Alaska, and by assigning each Trooper a set of villages for which he is responsible so that he will take ownership of the program. Successes and Accomplishments There has been a measurable reduction in alcohol and drug-related problems in the four villages where the Community Problem Solving program has been introduced. Participating villages, which once resented Trooper presence, are now working with the Troopers to address local issues involving public safety. The Troopers are beginning to feel a sense of appreciation for their efforts, which are directed toward a common goal with village members. With these initial results, resistance to the program efforts on the part of some Troopers assigned in western Alaska has appeared to have declined. 26 For the first year of the Community Problem Solving program, a comparison of the number of requests for Trooper service in the pilot villages was compared to the number of requests in the prior year. There was a 37.5% increase in the number of requests. The number of calls involving the report of information about individuals illegally importing and selling alcohol or drugs rose significantly over the previous twelve months. These increases indicate that village residents are addressing the problem of illegal drug and alcohol activity by requesting assistance. In the year prior to the implementation of the Community Problem Solving program, the four pilot villages had three accidental deaths directly related to the use of illegal alcohol. During the 12 months the Community Problem Solving program has been active in these villages, there have been no such accidental deaths. Community leaders, school teachers, and individual residents have testified as to the positive changes they have observed in their villages. They cited this program as having created a unified cause with the villages. There has been an increase in the interaction between leadership groups, youth and elders, public service providers, and school and church groups. Apathy has been replaced by community action and volunteering. Lieutenant Schadle of the Alaska State Troopers has said that \"People that had tremendous apathy are now getting involved and saying 'we want to do something as a community.'\" In Toksook Bay, students designed a sign to be placed at the village airport declaring the village alcohol and drug-free. The school principal described noticeable improvement in overall student behavior which he attributed to the youth involvement in addressing community problems. In the village of Mekoryuk, the elders formed a group to meet with the village youth to pass on village history and knowledge of their culture and traditions. During the winter months, the leaders organized safety patrols, which included the village's young leaders, to check for intoxicated individuals and take them home or to the clinic. A tri-council reprimand board was established to address misconduct and to stimulate behavioral changes. The village leaders and councils wrote letters placing all air carriers on notice that their village was drug and alcohol-free and that the carriers should not be involved or allow their aircraft to transport any alcohol or drugs into their village. Additionally, the community notified individuals known to be involved in illegal bootlegging activities that such activity would no longer be tolerated. This allowed these individuals the opportunity to stop their illegal activity before the village took action to stop it. Such actions included patrolling the known routes of the bootlegger with volunteer snow machine patrols, watching the airports for these individuals, and notifying the VPSO or State Troopers of any continued activities. The ability of these four villages to take self-initiated action at determining the well being of their community has been infectious in the region and has confirmed that village residents can take responsibility for establishing accepted behavior in the spirit of self-determination. More 27 villages are seeking out the State Troopers for assistance in the development of a community problem solving concept in their village. Other village leaders are asking the leaders from the pilot villages to attend council meetings and describe how this program is working for their villages. Prospects for Replication The prospects for replicating this program are excellent. However, a consensus on the part of the village to commit to the program is necessary. In the State of Alaska it was necessary for the community individuals to reach a level of intolerance that invoked the desire for change in those things which were adversely affecting their well being. The agency organizing the community problem solving program must be able to commit the manpower needed to maintain regular contacts with the various groups and committees. The agency should also develop methods for evaluating the program's ongoing implementation and effectiveness so that modifications to the community's problem solving approach can be timely.

Jack Holt, Jr., Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, has said that drug charges are involved in 15 to 25% of felony cases filed in Arkansas. Several other judges contend that the percentage of drug-related cases may be as high as 75%. According to detectives with the Little Rock Police Department, Little Rock's burglary rate increased 40% in the first quarter of 1994 over 1993, an increase they attribute to career burglars feeding drug habits. The number of drug-related cases prosecuted in the courts also increased dramatically. In November 1991 Arkansas sent a team to the National Substance Abuse Conference in Washington, DC to learn more about Supervised Treatment and Education Program (STEP) Court programs which had been developed in several cities and counties. As a result of the Washington conference, a detailed plan was drawn up to hold the Arkansas Drug Conference in August 1992. Teams of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers, and treatment providers from almost all of the State's judicial districts participated in the conference. An outstanding program of national and local presenters dealt with issues related to the disposition of drug cases and the treatment of drug abusing offenders. After the Arkansas conference, the teams from each judicial district developed a local action plan designed to meet the particular needs of the local jurisdiction. These plans included the development of educational programs, community corrections programs, and others. The plan for the Sixth Judicial District, which covers Pulaski County, called for the establishment of a \"Drug Court\" -- STEP Court -- based upon a diversion treatment model. Goals and Objectives The STEP Court's mission is to offer drug criminals intensive treatment within days of arrest. Prior to its implementation, offenders would go without treatment as their cases wound through circuit court, a process which typically took nine months. The overall goal of the program is to treat the offender and to forestall the offender's reentry into the criminal justice system. 29 Objectives of the STEP program include: housing all of the drug court facilities in one building; developing a comprehensive, collaborative program which provides a range of services to drug offenders to help them overcome their addiction; combining a carrot and stick approach in that any participants who fail must go to prison; allowing drug users who lapse the opportunity to reenter the program; setting up a computer system, accessible to all parts of the program, which allows for evaluation; and allowing first-time, nonviolent drug offenders, or felony offenders with serious drug or alcohol problems, to leave the criminal justice system without a record. It also became apparent that a new approach to the sentencing of drug users would help to alleviate overcrowding in prisons and free prison spaces for violent prisoners by diverting nonviolent drug users to treatment and counselling. Program Components The Arkansas STEP Court combines a three-pronged approach to drugs and crime: a justice component, a public health component, and treatment for addicts. This is the only drug court in the country which has managed to house all of these components in the same building. One of the lessons learned from visiting other STEP Court programs is that the strength of the program depends on the personality and commitment of the judge assigned to it. Chief Justice Holt appointed Circuit Judge Jack Lessenberry to be the drug court judge in Pulaski County. Judge Lessenberry was selected because of his demonstrated commitment to community service. The goal was to choose someone who would accept that diversion was not abating the criminal process, but a sensible approach to dealing with drug issues. Judge Lessenberry is a proponent of this view. The STEP Court accepts diversion referrals from all of the municipal courts in Pulaski County, as well as from circuit courts. The STEP Court is an alternative to circuit court for people accused of felony drug crimes. As such, the court's focus is different from that of circuit courts, which do not treat drug addiction. The process works as follows: the offender is arrested, arraigned, and taken directly to the STEP Court. Clients are referred for screening and assessment to the Central Assessment Unit, at which time a decision is made regarding their eligibility for the program. All clients receive an initial substance abuse screening and a health screening. Clients are divided into three groups: (1) individuals who do not appear to have a substance abuse problem or are not motivated to participate in treatment services; (2) individuals who have a moderate substance abuse problem and need less intensive treatment services such as drug education; and (3) 30 individuals who have a serious substance abuse problem and need more intensive treatment services. Individuals in the first category are not recommended for services as part of the STEP Court. The STEP Court order can include any of these three components: ancillary referrals such as vocational and educational training, medical care, liaison services, or alternative housing; treatment; and self-help groups. Many service organizations have come into the STEP Court and have been funded through the Governor's office. Treatment before this was on an ad hoc basis, and most of what existed was residential. Once diverted into the STEP Court program, the defendant signs a waiver to the right to a speedy trial and agrees to participate in the specific treatment program tailored to his or her needs after completion Of an evaluation and recommendation from a certified substance abuse counsellor. The treatment component lasts a minimum of one year. Random urinalysis and regular reporting to the court occurs throughout the treatment phase. The initial assessment includes a complete physical examination and special testing for tuberculosis, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other sexually transmitted diseases. For those participants who complete the program, the State waives any right to file charges based upon the incident leading to the initial arrest. Judge Lessenberry maintains the ability to remove any person from the program, at which point the individual is returned to the referring court and the regular criminal justice process. Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes The process to create a STEP Court was begun in 1991, and it did not become operational until September 1994. Locating and purchasing the building took 18 months. Program administrators wanted to be near the Pulaski County Courthouse, and the new building is four blocks away. The STEP Court is a totally self-contained unit, including the court, the meeting rooms, and the treatment rooms. At first, working out the format for getting people into the program was a problem. The prosecutors wanted everyone to plead guilty. They were convinced that it was better to have participants waive the right to a speedy trial but volunteer for the program. Law enforcement and the prosecutors had to be educated. The program has 100 clients now with an anticipated 600 cases. The success rate has been wonderful. Initially, program administrators feared that people without addiction would try to avoid the proper disposition of cases, that the court system would \"dump\" cases into the STEP Court. This has not occurred. 31 Successes and Accomplishments This is the first attempt in the United States to bring together not only courts and the treatment community, but also public health entities. It successfully diverts drug and alcohol addicts from the criminal justice system. The program works because it is flexible. Participation is voluntary, and if the client fails at the individual and group therapy or violates the terms of his/her agreement with the court, he/she goes to a prison bed for a week. Once the client is sober, he/she is again offered a place in the program. Funds from various sources have made the STEP Court possible. Technical assistance funds have been received from the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These funds have provided consultants to come to the State to work with court and treatment communities and have allowed Arkansas officials to travel to several sites to review drug courts in other states. The National Center for State Courts has provided the technical assistance to develop a software program which links the court and treatment databases. The State Justice Institute has provided a grant to fund a complete evaluation of the program. The Arkansas Coordinating Council has provided U.S. Department of Justice funds for the cost of the facility and the cost of drug screening. They have also funded the salary of an assistant for the Sixth District prosecuting attorney and public defender. The former Arkansas Adult Probation Commission has provided a case manager to act as a liaison between the court and the treatment providers and to oversee the progress of all clients. The Arkansas Department of Health is providing funds for the treatment services and the salary of the project director, health nurse, and two licensed substance abuse counsellors to staff the Central Assessment Unit. Pulaski County agreed to set aside jail space in the event that bed space is needed for the drug court. A grant from the Arkansas Bar Foundation furnished the courtroom, exterior signs, and a flagpole. A crucial and innovative approach to dealing with drug users is the Central Assessment Unit, which is a component of the STEP Court program. It is beneficial to courts because it provides an additional and effective option for this very large and difficult group of offenders. It provides public health agencies access to very high-risk persons to whom they would not ordinarily have access. It provides the treatment programs with sanctions through the courts, making it more likely that persons will take seriously their commitment to treatment. The program provides a major benefit to Pulaski County by relieving court dockets, freeing up bed space in the jail, diverting low level offenders from the State correctional system, and providing more effective treatment to offenders. Prospects for Replication A Central Assessment Unit could serve not only a drug diversion court, but also many other institutions. Juvenile courts and family courts could utilize the services of professional health and mental health evaluators. There is a good possibility that the Federal government will 32 consider providing block grant funds to establish such a Central Assessment Unit in each judicial district of the State. Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Jack Holt, Jr. has said that \"The success of the program depends in part on the strength of the person sitting as judge.\" A strong personality will virtually ensure the success of the program.

Drug dealing, drug-related robberies, shootings, and assaults are daily threats to the residents of the Tenderloin, especially the elderly. Gangs involved in drug-trafficking frequently resort to violence in an attempt to control their \"turf.\" The victims of this violence are all too often the residents of the Tenderloin. The Tenderloin suffers from the effects of general physical deterioration and economic decline. This neighborhood, surrounded by major hotels and retail centers, has large numbers of abandoned buildings and vacant store fronts. The streets and sidewalks are filthy, and the street lighting is inadequate. There are many community-based organizations and agencies in the Tenderloin. These agencies draw needy people from other neighborhoods in San Francisco to a community already overwhelmed by the distress of its own residential population. Community-based organizations (CBOs) had been working independently to meet some of the challenges faced by the residents of this neighborhood. By inviting these organizations together to work on Operation Revitalization, the project had a more extensive, immediate, and long-lasting impact on the quality of life in this community. In June 1992, the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) implemented a pilot program in the Tenderloin entitled Operation Revitalization (Weed & Seed). The program, funded through the California State Office of Criminal Justice Planning, established a collaborative partnership between local criminal justice agencies and CBOs to develop a comprehensive plan to revitalize this troubled community. Goals and Objectives The overall goals of Weed & Seed were to establish programs and enhance existing activities aimed at assisting local government in the apprehension, prosecution, adjudication, and supervision of drug offenders and to assist local government and CBOs in the cleaning, reclaiming, and revitalization of the Tenderloin. The priority of the weed portion of the program was the control of crime, primarily drug trafficking and the street crime associated with it. The Police Department~ efforts in this program were supported by the District Attomey~ Office, the probation department, and the Victim/Witness Assistance Program. The City Attorney's Office was able to conduct code 34 enforcement proceedings for buildings in the neighborhood and create a program to make sure that buildings were maintained as safe, clean, and habitable residences. The seed programs were created to enhance the educational and organizing efforts for the residents of this community and to improve the physical surroundings of the area. These efforts would enhance the economic viability of the area, encouraging the opening of new businesses, the development of new housing, and improvements in the service delivery systems of all agencies and departments involved in the program. Program Components Weed A component crucial to the success of the enforcement program involved the SFPD Narcotics Unit. The Narcotics Unit provided enhanced enforcement through a \"Buy Bust\" program as well as increased undercover street operations. The police department determined that a high percentage of calls to their narcotics hotline came from the Tenderloin community. They were able to enhance their enforcement efforts based on calls from the community. The SFPD's community policing philosophy enhanced Operation Revitalization (Weed & Seed). Community police officers from the Tenderloin Task Force developed partnerships with the citizens, merchants, community organizations, and government agencies to identify and solve problems in the area. Officers provided additional foot patrols and bicycle patrols and targeted mobile patrol aimed at violent offenders, repeat offenders, drug-trafficking, and other gang-related criminal activity. The District Attorney provided intensive vertical prosecution at every stage of the investigation and prosecution of cases generated in the weed portion of the program. This prosecution method allows one Assistant District Attorney to follow the case from booking to completion, allowing for more comprehensive case development. The District Attorney\u00a7 Victim/Witness Program, Utilizing staff and volunteers, provided crisis intervention, court liaison, resources, and referrals to Tenderloin residents who were victims of crime. They established an intake site in the Tenderloin to better serve the population. The Adult Probation Department designated an officer to provide extensive supervision of 25 probationers living in the Tenderloin. This officer worked as a liaison with the SFPD and the San Francisco Sheriff~ Department to facilitate the enforcement of warrantless search conditions of probation. The officer was assigned to the SFPD~ Tenderloin Task Force office. By working there, he became well known to community groups. These groups helped him enhance service delivery to probationers living in the target area. 35 The City Attorney's Office assisted residents, owners, managers, and neighbors in addressing concerns they raised about poorly maintained buildings. The grant provided this office with the opportunity to work with community organizations to develop a training program for residential hotel operators. This training program is now being used throughout the city of San Francisco. The Assistant City Attorney worked with community organizers who came in contact with buildings where building and fire code violations existed. The San Francisco Sheriff's Department provided a uniformed sergeant, deputy, and a work furlough crew of eight to support the street cleaning and sidewalk sweeping in the neighborhood, assisting the City's Department of Public Works, Street Cleaning Division. The deputy sheriffs provided an additional law enforcement presence which served as a deterrent to criminal activity on the streets. The SFPD~ Drug Education Program for youth was expanded into Galileo High School, a high school attended by students living in the Tenderloin. Volunteer police officers were assigned to the campus as liaisons between the police department, the school administration, and the student population. The officers spoke to classes on crime prevention and drug education and investigated student-related crime issues on and near the campus. Seed The Police Department contracted with San Francisco SAFE, a non-profit crime prevention organization, to implement a comprehensive crime prevention education and community organizing program. SAFE provided crime prevention programs for residential hotels and multiple-unit dwellings in the target area. Trainings were designed specifically for building managers and residents that included building security and personal and property safety. Workshops were provided at organizations serving the senior population for the purpose of introducing safety awareness, street safety, apartment security, and how to avoid scams. Networking with other neighborhood agencies and referrals was accomplished at these presentations. Home and street safety presentations for a special safety program were developed for the children of the Tenderloin. The program included workshops on street and apartment safety. The children were given an opportunity to learn ways to prevent harm, including the harm that can come from those within their community. The North of Market Senior Services Intergenerational Program (IGP) was created to bring senior citizens and youth together to take an active role in Operation Revitalization as part of the seed phase. The IGP is a joint program with the Vietnamese Youth Development Center (VYDC). The program~ aims are to involve seniors in mentoring youth, community service projects, community events, and crime prevention and safety education programs. IGP components enable the seniors and youth of the Tenderloin to build meaningful experiences together. These activities serve the community and help to increase understanding between 'youth and seniors of many cultures. 36 VYDC expanded its Peer Resource Group Program to become partners in the IGP. The high school students participating in this program were involved in an integrated program of training, community service, and leadership development. They explored teen, senior, and community issues as they worked with the North of Market Senior Services and other participatingagencies and departments. The North of Market Planning Coalition (NOMPC) hired a full-time housing organizer and a part-time Southeast Asian community organizer to work with other organizations to revitalize the Tenderloin. Revitalization of the Tenderloin has been the focus of a comprehensive research document produced by NOMPC. This document, \"Tenderloin 2000,\" identifies housing and economic development as cornerstones of neighborhood revitalization. NOMPC will help build resident organizations in buildings throughout the target area. These groups will preserve existing low-cost housing and develop new affordable housing. The State of California Employment Development Department (EDD) assigned an Employment Program Representative to provide a job service program in the Tenderloin: The staff person was given office space at the Vietnamese Youth Development Center. This out-stationed EDD employee recruited clients to participate in the program, and through interviews, assessed their employability, aptitude, abilities, and interests. The program representative then developed job referrals and placement for the client. Referrals to other EDD programs and supportive services were also made. Services were provided to these residents effectively through a phone/computer link so that clients were immediately connected to resources throughout Northern California. Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes A challenge faced in working in the Tenderloin is the diversity of the languages spoken there. During the grant period most of SAFE~ presentations were given in several languages. In addition, SAFE was able to have seven of its crime prevention brochures translated during the grant period. Those materials continue to serve the community. SAFE has been successful in contacting persons throughout the community who will translate additional materials as needed. Successes and Accomplishments Weed The Police Departmentg Narcotics Unit was very successful in reducing narcotic activity in the Tenderloin. The \"Buy Bust\" program resulted in numerous arrests, and in the last quarter of the grant period, 75% of those arrests were filed for vertical prosecution. Officers from the 37 Narcotics Unit will continue to establish \"Buy Bust\" programs in the Tenderloin, as well as assist in other major narcotics enforcement efforts. The community policing efforts by the officers from the Tenderloin Task Force were instrumental in coordinating resources to provide comprehensive problem solving strategies. Those strategies included code abatement, safety lectures and workshops, and security surveys. The strategies have become priorities in the ongoing work of the community police officers in the Tenderloin. The drug education program in the high school was so well received that the Police Department has sought funds to expand it. The success of the Program can be seen in the way the traditional barriers between the Police Department and the school district have been eliminated. The school district will continue to support this program at Galileo High School. San Francisco~ Adult Probation Department has been given space at the SFPD\u00a7 Tenderloin Task Force Office so that a probation officer can continue to work directly with law enforcement officers in this district in identifying problematic probationers in the community. The City Attorney's Office established a very effective program to address building, health, and fire code violations in the community. Code enforcement efforts successfully improved the conditions in many apartment buildings and residential hotels. A training manual and workshop were developed by city attorneys to provide hotel and apartment management with the tools needed to operate safe, clean, and affordable housing. The resources of the City Attorney's Office are available to law enforcement and have become part of the outreach done as these officers work in their designated beats. The vertical prosecution of narcotics offenders completed by the District Attorney's Office was instrumental in the reduction of narcotics in the Tenderloin. Under this system, cases were followed from arrest through the entire court process by the same Assistant District Attorney. Cases developed in this manner resulted in the conviction Of some of the area's most active narcotics dealers. The District Attomey~ Victim/Witness Program established a site at the YMCA in the heart of the Tenderloin. This site provided crisis intervention, case status, and resource and referral assistance to Tenderloin residents who had been victimized. The office saw an increase in the number of clients from the Tenderloin, and the satellite office has been retained in the YMCA so that the program can continue to provide these services. The San Francisco Sheriff~ Work Furlough Program made a major contribution to the Weed & Seed program and to the Tenderloin community. The revitalization of the Tenderloin can be seen in the extensive efforts of this program to clean the streets, sidewalks, and alleys of the neighborhood. While providing the cleaning service, the Sheriff~ Department was able to serve warrants on many individuals who had left drug treatment programs, work furlough, 38 and work alternative programs. The Department~ Work Furlough Program will continue its cleaning efforts in the Tenderloin and will expand them into other troubled areas of the city. Seed SAFE staff shared crime prevention expertise and strategies with hundreds of Tenderloin residents. They participated in workshops in which a variety of providers, both grant-funded and non-grant-funded, gave information about services available throughout the community. Through these workshops and presentations, SAFE was able to provide crime prevention information to a very wide audience. The safety education program through the North of Market Senior Services (NOMSS) was more extensive ,and included more senior groups in the Tenderloin than have ever been able to be involved. There were multilingual presentations and discussions as well as those in English. The seniors and NOMSS are prepared to strengthen their own advocacy organization to become a more viable voice in community affairs. The youth and seniors who participated in the IGP helped SAFE create crime prevention tips and strategies that directly address the needs of the Tenderloin. The relationships with these two organizations has enabled SAFE to extend crime prevention and community organizing services to previously under-served and highly vulnerable populations. The organization of residents accomplished with the help of the North of Market Planning Coalition was an important element in helping residents advocate for changes in conditions of buildings where they live. It also provided important data for the City Attorney~ Office when it investigated potential building health, fire, and safety code violations. The relationship between SAFE and NOMPC and the City Attorney~ Office continues to grow as they work together to improve conditions in individual buildings. The work done on this grant paved the way for many ongoing community revitalization efforts. The Job Service Program of EDD was able to provide a range of services to many residents of the Tenderloin. The location of the out-station, at the VYDC office, was successful because many homeless and unemployed persons come to that building for general services. The Tenderloin out-station created by the EDD/SFPD community collaboration provided direct employment services and acquainted residents with other job-related services and how to access them. In working closely with the NOMPC~ Southeast Asian community organizer, SAFE, the SFPD, and other participating agencies were able to identify crime concerns previously hidden from them. Pedophilia and domestic violence within the Lao and Cambodian communities of the Tenderloin have been an unspoken concern and underreported crime for many years. With the assistance of the NOMPC and other agencies that serve children and families, these areas of crime were addressed through education and law enforcement efforts. 39 f- SAFE and the SFPD cooperated to develop problem solving frameworks that residents, owners, and business people in the community found vital in their efforts to combat crime. Many community officers assisted at presentations and have continued to offer presentations and crime prevention strategies to groups of residents and business people in the community. The Department of Light, Heat, and Power was given the funds to improve some of the street lighting in the Tenderloin. During the grant period, this department received a private donation from a ~local bank of $50,000. With this money, lighting engineers were able to replace most of the street light bulbs in the community with brighter, longer lasting ones. This change in lighting has made the neighborhood brighter and safer at night. A small portion of the grant was devoted to sidewalk steam cleaning, which was done by Steamy Solutions, a small owner-operated business. In addition to the hours contracted, this business provided additional hours of donated time. The cleaning significantly improved the neighborhood's appearance. Steamy Solutions has encouraged the development of an ongoing sidewalk cleaning program for the Tenderloin. Prospects for Replication The success of Operation Revitalization (Weed & Seed) was made possible by the collaboration of all the participating agencies and organizations. The people of the neighborhood and the agencies working there understand the value in working together to solve problems and revitalize their neighborhood. \"We have broken a lot of barriers working with the program, working much closer with other departments, instead of separately,\" said Sergeant John Bisordi of the San Francisco Police Department. The people of the Tenderloin have a greater understanding of the role of the Police Department and other facets of the criminal justice system in their community. They also have a deeper understanding of the importance of community action in response to issues, and how effective that action can be when combined with the efforts and support of the Police Department, city agencies, and organizations in their neighborhood. These city departments and agencies know how valuable involving the community can be in making their efforts more successful. Contact Information Sergeant John V.

Officers in the Broomfield Police Department can cite many calls they have handled that left them feeling frustrated and helpless when dealing with senior citizens. All too often, police officers have no resources and no knowledge about where to turn to alleviate the problems that are particular to seniors. These problems may involve health, lack of family support, limited income, illness, death, and victimization. Fear of crime and victimization are principle concerns for senior citizens. Seniors' fear of crime is heightened by their limited resources, fixed incomes, and physical limitations to resist. Sometimes, this fear of victimization limits their lifestyles and mobility. Goals and Objectives The goal of the Broomfield Police Senior Liaison Program is to reduce the fear of crime and enhance the overall .quality of life for the senior community of Broomfield, Colorado. The objectives of the program are to: maintain a storefront operation at the Senior Community Center that will improve police/senior relations through direct contact between seniors and police officers; provide a minimum of 12 crime prevention programs for seniors to reduce criminal opportunity and vulnerability; provide direct contact concerning crime awareness to 1,000 seniors through the storefront operation and crime prevention programs; provide a minimum of 24 home security checks for seniors, in conjunction with Operation I.D., during the grant year; provide a Neighborhood Watch Program for seniors and interested citizens as requested, but a minimum of six times per year; 42 publish a quarterly senior newsletter with crime tips and program information, including distribution to 2,550 senior citizens to increase awareness of criminal behavior and inform seniors of available resources; produce six public service announcements for the Senior Liaison Program to be aired on a local cable television station; and conduct follow-up on all police department reports involving senior citizens. Program Components The Broomfield Police Department's mission statement addresses its desire of \"enhancing the quality of life for the community and protecting life and property through a wide range of services.\" With this mission in mind, the goal of the Senior Liaison Program is to enhance the overall quality of life and reduce fear of crime for seniors living in Broomfield. This is achieved through focused services including a storefront operation, educational programs on crime-related topics, and personalized prevention measures. The Senior Liaison Program uses a creative approach to fight criminal opportunity and address a variety of important topics. The Senior Liaison Program was initiated in 1992. The police department assigned a senior liaison officer to expand services with the Community Senior Center. This officer is responsible for coordinating specialized crime prevention programs, services, and reference materials for the senior community. In coordination with Senior Center staff and the Broomfield Police Department, a storefront operation was established at the Center to assist seniors. The Center is a central gathering place for the senior population. Once a week the senior liaison officer is available for approximately four hours at the storefront to discuss crime prevention concerns, suggest preventive measures, or suggest other resources. Examples of topics addressed at the storefront are: fraudulent solicitation; living will scares; driving skills; neighborhood disputes; elder neglect; and personal safety. Individual discussions with seniors or their friends create additional follow-up contacts for the senior liaison officer. The officer raises awareness of criminal opportunity and availability of crime prevention services through the police department. Thomas C. Deland, Chief of Police in Broomfield, says that \"the most important thing (in working with seniors) is to have individual contact with the same officer in order to develop their (the seniors') trust,\" and the seniors look forward to this direct contact with the officer who has opened these lines of communication. The Senior Liaison Program provides crime prevention classes at the Senior Center, senior housing complexes, mobile home parks, and to various service groups. The educational programs cover diverse topics. \"Self-Protection\" addresses travel safety and personal safety tips; \"Home Security\" provides home safety and security tips; \"Fraud and Con Games\" makes seniors aware of fraudulent practices and seniors' vulnerability to such tactics; \"When to Hang 43 Up Your Car Keys\" addresses warning signs that a senior should stop driving and offers alternative transportation means; \"Stop That Thief\" points out the importance of community involvement in crime prevention; and \"Elder Abuse and Neglect\" addresses a very sensitive topic for elders and community members. Although not originally in the program, security at senior dances became important bec.ause it was based on a request for service. Seniors attending the monthly social events were being confronted by juveniles and were fearful. Attendance was low at evening events. Senior Center staff requested the assistance of officers to provide security. The Senior Liaison Program responded to this need and provides officers during these events. Since the initiation of the escort service, the Senior Center staff has noted an increased attendance and a feeling of security on the part of the seniors. A quarterly Senior Sentry newsletter is mailed to each senior resident of Broomfield. Information about crime prevention programs, services, and newsworthy crime tips are published. This mass mailing enhances the program's ability to reach isolated seniors and disseminate information as broadly as possible. By working exclusively with the senior population, the Senior Liaison Officer has become an expert in senior issues. The Senior Liaison Officer has become familiar with a variety of available community services and referrals for seniors. Service providers work closely with the Senior Liaison Officer to ensure that seniors' needs are met. For instance, a locksmith has helped to secure homes. Meals on Wheels staff notify the police department of seniors in need, or when they discover something suspicious. In addition, the Senior Liaison Program works in coordination with senior associations such as the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Boulder County Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP). These groups provide support and resources for senior concerns and problems. Collaboration within the police department also occurs. The Senior Liaison Officer receives every report taken by the department that involves a senior. The report is forwarded to the Liaison Officer to conduct a follow-up. The officer may contact the senior and decide whether he or she is in need of services provided by the police department or by another community agency. Department personnel are trained on the special needs of seniors, including elder abuse and neglect. Results and Impact Performance Measures The success of the Senior Liaison Program can be measured quantitatively and qualitatively. The program's efficiency can be measured in part by the number of seniors served and the number of crime prevention classes conducted. The program's goal for its first year was to contact 1,000 seniors. As of October 1994, over 6,000 senior citizens have been contacted. 44 The Senior Liaison Program supports the Broomfield Police Department's. positive community policing approach. Many effects of this type of policing are difficult to quantify, other than through a \"feeling\" expressed by the seniors who have participated in the program. The primary result of the Senior Liaison Program has been anincrease in safety and a decrease in vulnerability through education. Thank you letters to the Senior Liaison Officer show that the seniors are noticing a difference in their lives. Implementation Problems and Successes At first, officers had trouble deciding if the seniors' fears were based on reality. The program has alleviated this problem by having one or two officers who know the seniors and are acquainted with their specific problems. Successes and Accomplishments The number of contacts made represents an outstanding accomplishment for the Senior Liaison Program. As a result, seniors are better protected, are more involved in the community, and have received needed services. Seniors have developed a high level of confidence and trust in officers, and communication between seniors, officers, and community members has increased significantly. Seniors express that they \"feel secure,\" are \"happy to know someone is thinking of their safety, i' and are pleased that they \"can talk to the officers.\" All these positive accolades provide the motivation behind the success of the Broomfield Police Senior Liaison Program. The support from the local Senior Center has been crucial to the success of the program. These efforts have enhanced the overall quality of life for seniors and have reduced fear of crime through focused services such as crime prevention classes. The primary means for contacting the seniors is the storefront operation, and without the cooperation and collaboration from the Senior Center this type of activity would not exist. Three thousand, five hundred and fifty-one seniors have been contacted through the storefront operation alone. The Senior Liaison Officer has evolved from a stranger whom no one would talk with to the primary source of advice for thousands of senior citizens. Thank you letters to the Senior Liaison Officer show that the seniors are noticing a difference in their lives. One thank-you letter expresses a couple's gratitude for the program: We are in our late sixties with a fixed income. It is sometimes difficult to get everything done that needs doing. Your program in helping senior citizens has been a tremendous help. We know we are much safer in our home. To express their gratitude, seniors wanted to \"give back\" to the community. Several senior groups make quilts and toys to give to crime victims. Over 250 quilts have been donated by 45 seniors to victims. Donating their hand made quilts and toys have been their way of saying \"thank you.\" The Senior Liaison Officer and those helping him have committed themselves to helping needy seniors. Officers have provided lamps, shopped for groceries, and have helped seniors in many other circumstances. The new attitude of the officers can best be expressed by the many examples of officers helping seniors. The Liaison Officer has gone as far as relocating individuals who were living in abject circumstances and had no family assistance. The program has created a better understanding of senior-related issues. Problems that previously would not have been recognized are now being resolved because of the increased level of awareness. The International Association of Chiefs of Police initiated the Webber Seavey Award for Quality in Law Enforcement to recognize innovative and creative police programs. Over two hundred police agencies throughout the world submitted their program information for this competitive award application process. The Broomfield Senior Liaison Program was selected as a semifinalist for this award. The program has increased senior safety and security by providing education to 770 seniors and security checks for 34 seniors. The project's services have been explained to 504 seniors who live in isolated areas. Citizens have reported 260 crimes against seniors. Prospects for Replication The Senior Liaison Program can easily be replicated in any city or rural setting. The success of the Broomfield Police Senior Liaison Program has encouraged other cities and agencies throughout the country to start similar programs for their senior populations. These agencies have requested the technical assistance of the Senior Liaison Officer to develop similar senior programs in their areas. Proactive departments committed to enhancing the quality of life for their communities are seeking innovative programs to accomplish this goal. It has become imperative for police departments to form partnerships with their communities and use all resources available to achieve community wellness. In Broomfield, the Senior Liaison Program is just one way that the department has enlisted other agencies and community members to work together toward common goals. 46 Contact Information Thomas C. Deland Chief of Police Broomfield Police Department One Des Combes Drive P.O. Box 1415 Broomfield, CO 80038-1415 (303) 438-6440 (303) 438-6490 fax 47 Florida S.A.F.E. Program Statement of the Problem Census and economic statistics show a dramatic rise in one-parent families as well as families with two working parents. This has caused an increase in unsupervised children during after- school hours. Research suggests that children need structure and direction during their formative years, and unfortunately these attributes are not available. The \"latchkey\" child has ~, become more the norm than the exception in today's society. With the rise in \"latchkey\" children comes the next catch phrase: at-risk. The definition of \"at-risk\" includes children with one parent and delinquent and/or truant children who are behind grades in school or have had contact with the juvenile justice system. The City of Jacksonville, in conjunction with the Duval County School Board, the Office of the Sheriff, and the Jacksonville Children's Commission has established the Safe, Accessible, Flexible, Enrichment program to combat truancy, juvenile crime, substance abuse, and poor school performance as well as provide a safe haven for \"latchkey\" children. The target group for the S.A.F.E. Program are children ages ten to fourteen. The program specifically seeks children who lack supervision and/or guidance during the afternoon and evening hours, Monday through Saturday. Goals and Objectives The overall goal of the program is to afford an opportunity for positive early adolescent development by providing a safe haven for latch-key and at-risk children (ages ten to fourteen), while providing educational, cultural, social, and enrichment programs to further enhance their growth into responsible teenagers and young adults. The following objectives have been determined to achieve this goal: increase the number of latchkey children attending the S.A.F.E. Program; pinpoint students who have not been making academic progress or still exhibit unacceptable behavior for special assistance and counselling; increase volunteer and community support of the program; establish business partnerships with the program; increase youth attendance in after-school programs; and change the perception of police officers as antagonists to helpful friends. 48 Program Components Seven sites have been identified as target sites for the S.A.F.E. Program. These sites house the students or are located within high juvenile crime areas. Each site is staffed by one S.A.F.E. \"coordinator,\" four \"specialists,\" and one police officer. The majority of the salaried employees are people holding college degrees (MED, BS, BA, or AA) in areas related to youth. All of the staff have had experience in youth-related programs and are committed to improving the success rates of 'children, which will result in decreased truancy and school dropouts. Several of them are former teachers who have had training in effective strategies for at-risk youth. Extensive training regarding early adolescent development was provided to all S.A.F.E. employees by faculty members at the University of North Florida and Florida State University. The seven \"Community Affairs\" Officers are fully sworn police officers, provided by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, who assist in maintaining security, arranging community tours, assisting with children who have behavior problems, and teaching or providing various lectures (anti-drug, kidnap prevention, and conflict resolution). Some of the topics provided in training are: situational leadership, understanding resilient youth, problem solving strategies, characteristics of ten to fourteen year-old youth, value clarification, communication skills, positive role modeling, and conflict and behavior management. The four major components of the program are: Education, Recreation, Enrichment, and Life Coping Skills. Education Every day the students begin by doing their homework. If no homework was assigned, program staff provide exercises in the areas of study that the children are presently working on. The program has educational and computer games that are used as supplements to regular classroom work. Tutors, both paid and volunteer, are used to assist the staff with educational assignments. Recreation In this component the children have different scheduled activities each day. These recreation activities are both individual and team oriented. There are also competitions between S.A.F.E. sites in selected sports. The possibility is being explored of having the local Police Athletic League provide interscholastic competition, or a full slate of sports activities in which the S.A.F.E. Program would compete against other schools and community teamsl Enrichment Each site takes up to six field trips per month. These trips are free to all participants who earn the right to take them. A point system is set up in which children earn merits for attendance, behavior, and academic accomplishments which allow them to attend these trips and other S.A.F.E. functions. These trips range from educational trips to historic sites to professional sporting events. S.A.F.E. staff attempt to make these educationally, socially, and culturally enriching. 49 Life coping skills In this component, participants learn many different skills they will need when they are out on their own. The real life simulation allows participants to receive a \"wage\" and pay \"bills,\" plan their daily lives, plan meals, and live within a budget. There are numerous instructional aids and handouts for this exercise. It also includes instruction on the types of things each adult must be prepared to handle, such as insurance, taxes, credit, and legal issues. There are numerous activities that relate to these components. Workshops available to the students include: culinary arts, drama and fine arts, drug and alcohol abuse, health, life coping skills, interpersonal skills, conflict management, and individual counseling. In addition to specialized workshop sessions, all of the sites have implemented arts, craft, and musical activities including puppets, ceramics, drawing, kites, jewelry, photography, painting, chorus, modem dance, music appreciation, line dancing, karaoke, jazz dancing, and group dancing. As a result of the high percentage of students requesting workshops in the area of \"home skills,\" a wide variety of activities has been implemented at many of the sites, including: employment skills, cooking, food management, time management, domestic skills, landscaping, home safety, manners, grooming, personal hygiene, housekeeping skills, and gardening. One of the most positive aspects of the S.A.F.E. program has been a variety of recreational activities including: basketball, ping pong, volleyball, racquetball, track and field, football, double dutch, swimming, boundbaU, tennis, karate, boxing, gymnastics, and jogging. The program is completely free to participants and their parents. The monies that support the project come from an allocation from the Mayor's Office, and volunteers play an important role in the program. Every site recruits as many volunteers as possible from parent councils that are being formed at each site. Contracted service people perform a variety of duties from tutoring to teaching ventriloquism, cooking, arts and crafts, and sign language. The Duval County School Board opens their facilities for the program's use at no charge to the program. Certain fees are paid to the School Board to recoup overtime charges that are incurred by custodians. Each site has a student council that has input into the programming of activities and often rules on disciplinary action that should be taken against students who have committed offenses . against the \"Student Code of Conduct.\" This Code of Conduct is the same set of rules that is used by the School Board, which promotes consistency between the two agencies. Results and Impact Performance Measures The program objectives have short-term and long-term measurements. The short-term measurement for the objective to increase youth attendance in after school programs is to see an increase in enrollment by 25%, and the long-range objective is to increase daily 50 attendance by 25%. All participants and their parents/guardians must fill out enrollment information, and daily logs are kept on attendance. All participants must sign in and out. Attendance and registration records are computerized and stored at the site for analysis. The short-term measurement for the objective to decrease the number of latchkey children left unattended is the increase in the number of children participating in the program who have been identified by S.A.F.E. surveys or by School Board records as children who are home after school without parental supervision. The measurement for the objective to improve overall school performance and decrease truancy and poor behavior is the analysis of guidance/discipline records and comparison of report cards over the course of the year. This allows program staff to pinpoint the children who need individual academic attention and counseling. These figures and reports are made available to program staff by the individual schools. The ultimate goal is to have every S.A.F.E. participant promoted every year without behavior and/or truancy problems. A fourth, unwritten goal is to expand the seven existing sites to all middle schools in Duval County. Program administrators are constantly looking for more effective ways to fund and expand existing programs. Business partnerships are the new thrust. Implementation Problems and Successes At first, there was a large turnover in staff due to the credentials sought, including college degrees and specific experience, and the inability to pay high wages. Modifying the pay scale and finding dedicated staff have been extremely important to keeping a regular staff. The staff to student ratio must be kept manageable, given that the children are troubled. One of the major difficulties was merging of the Duval County School Board and the Recreation Department of the City of Jacksonville, which have different policies, procedures, and philosophies as to how this mission should be accomplished. A problem in working with governmental organizations such as the Department of Parks, Recreatiori, and Entertainment is getting the right type and numbers of equipment and supplies. Equipment and supplies must be adequate and readily available. Scheduling must be flexible, and items necessary to accomplish the goals must be on hand. The ability to purchase new items must be as flexible as the programming. All sites will be as different as the neighborhoods that they serve to allow for creativity among staff members. Blanket purchasing for similar programs at all sites will not sustain the children's interest. In the beginning, the fact that the children would be at the program for upwards of seven hours and the need to feed them because of this was overlooked. The program now provides simple snack foods, and cooking classes allow the students to eat what they themselves create. 51 Successes and Accomplishments Many of the initial obstacles have been overcome, with seven sites successfully opened in School Board facilities. There is a strong spirit of cooperation between the two agencies. The sites are fully staffed with professionals who are receiving training on a regular basis to upgrade their skills and knowledge. This training is being provided free of charge by the Duval County School Board. The purchasing system is becoming more diverse, which allows easier access to supplies and materials essential for the successful operation of the program. Prospects for Replication There are several important factors to weigh when considering replication of any project of this magnitude. In this day of prudent government spending, it is important to note that no one entity will be able to fund such an aggressive project. Joint venturing is probably the only avenue whereby funding and a variety of resources can be made available. Problems may be encountered when working within another organization's facilities. A commitment to back the program fully must be made by decisionmakers in all involved organizations. This problem was not created overnight and will not be resolved quickly. Long-term commitment of all parties involved is essential. These projects should have a foundation based on hard dollars, not temporary grant funding. It is more of a disservice to begin an effective program and not continue it than not to begin it at all. According to Richard Fagan, Manager of the S.A.F.E. Program, the \"program has to be innovative. It's got to be a program of attraction, not necessarily one of promotion.\" Children must want to be there since it can not be made mandatory. Aggressive and innovative programming must be planned. These programs should be fun as well as enriching. Community and corporate support are also of utmost importance. The taxpayer/parent needs to be aware of and understand the benefits and ramifications of the program. They can provide further encouragement to its participants and other resources to the overall program. Contact Information Richard R. Fagan Manager S.A.F.E.

Hiawatha is not unlike the majority of rural communities in the United States. It has the following social concerns: increased teen pregnancies and date rape, escalated alcohol and other drug abuse, escalating cases of sexually transmitted diseases, disrespect for public properties, increased juvenile crime, and the start up of gang activity, like its urban neighbors. Most people have turned to schools for the solutions to these problems, but the schools are not the complete answer. The schools need outside support, thoughts, and ideas for useful programs to better address the social behavior of today's youth. From this need, Hiawathans Offering Positive Environments (HOPE) was formed in April 1992. Goals and Objectives The goal of HOPE is to form a community coalition that is a partnership of schools, parents, and community players that addresses the social policy and environments of the youth in Hiawatha. The objectives of HOPE are to: (1) become a working catalyst in the community to get organizations to work together on youth programs addressing social concerns; (2) help procure the funds and location for a community youth center; (3) create a parent network; (4) create youth activities for Healthy Highs; (5) develop full-time prevention programs in the school and the community using law enforcement personnel; (6) help support and develop community policing efforts; (7) help to obtain a chemical dependency therapist to work directly with law enforcement, inmates, juveniles, and their parent(s); and (8) work with the schools to enhance the use of drug and alcohol monies. Program Components The Steering Committee The steering committee of HOPE is a cross section of the community that includes law enforcement, media, churches, public and mental health providers, school administration and board members, youth, clubs and organizations, the National Guard, the area prevention center, and various businessmen and women. This committee is the \"think tank\" for HOPE that discusses the social concerns of the community and assigns them to various 53 working committees such as student activities, parent network, or community relations. The steering committee designs some of the programs that are implemented in the community. Many members of the steering committee are CEO's or employees of community organizations or businesses that have access to youth resources or youth related programs. It became apparent early on that the HOPE organization would act as the catalyst to get area agencies to work together on youth projects and parent education. A Church Donation When the community learned that the youth wanted a community youth center, a local church donated $30,000 in start-up funds. This caused businesses, individuals, and clubs to donate money, labor, and materials to the center. The youth center is run by a combination of youth and adult board members who are responsible for activities planning, maintenance, and fund raising. The center is open daily during \"at-risk\" times in the evenings after school and long weekend hours and serves 30 to 50 kids per night. The youth center offers simple, fun activities to all youths in the community. The activities include bonfires, sledding parties, skating, sports, and games. Parent Network Jump starting parents to be responsible and addressing parental concerns through educational gatherings is the job of the Parent Network. This network teaches parents to look at themselves as role models. HOPE is currently using the Parent University model put out by the Kansas Extension on a regular basis to conduct their parent education, resources, and workshops. Resources for parents are also available at the local library in a designated area. A monthly newsletter is distributed by the project which addresses topics related to parents. Youth Activities Youth activities are currently being carried out at three different levels. The grade school activities are coordinated and carried out by a committee of parents. The middle school has activities for grades five and six that are conducted by parents and school sponsors. The high school activities are currently planned by the youth center board, the community, and parent sponsors. Law Enforcement It was noted early on after interviews with youth that law enforcement was viewed as an adversary. There were no prevention or related programs in the county regarding law enforcement and youth. This had to be addressed if the other programs were to have a chance to succeed. Money from Brown County, the City of Hiawatha, and the Bureau of Justice Assistance, channeled through the Kansas Governor's Office for Drug Abuse, was awarded to Brown County to have a full-time prevention officer in grades K-12 and in the community to help with other youth programs. Brown County was also awarded a DARE officer for the 1993 - 1994 school year. The very positive results of the grant, and the gaps in service it identified, led to three grants in 1994 - 1995. 54 The prevention officer grant was expanded into four Northeast Kansas counties, necessitating two additional officers. A new grant for community policing officers was awarded. The prevention officers receive information in class and privately and the community policing officers further evaluate it. The third grant was for a chemical dependency therapist who would serve four counties out of the area mental health center. This therapist is used by stressed law enforcement personnel, inmates, juveniles, and their parents who need mental health counseling. A bonus to the grant is the help that the therapist provides to the prevention officers in their daily classroom dilemmas. School Alcohol and Drug Monies The schools in Hiawatha have a drug and alcohol curriculum for grades K-12, but the youth become tired of the same program, and by the time they reach the seventh grade, peer pressure usually wins out over these teachings. The HOPE committee helps to evaluate programs and gives ideas for new programs to be used in schools. To combat disrespect for public properties, the middle school youth now are involved with community projects or functions - two functions per year are mandatory for each student. Leadership Training Instead of picking a few top students, the school now does leadership training for the entire seventh grade and their parents. This involves all students in decision making and starts parents networking for class functions. Results and Impact By creating the above programs, the project hopes to achieve the following results: (1) the community Will address its social policy standards; (2) youth will be directly involved with activities and decision making for the short- and long-term viability of the youth center; (3) law enforcement will become active partners of parents and the school and friendly educators of youth, with the impact of reducing juvenile offenses; (4) the school, with the help of the prevention officer and community input, will be better able to address the whole agenda of social concerns facing today's youth at all grade levels; (5) the overall impact will be a community whose organizations and resources work in a partnership to create a positive environment for youth. Implementation Problems and Successes Community perception of HOPE When a community coalition is formed to address a subject not previously addressed, such as alcohol consumption by youth, a somewhat skeptical perception of the coalition is inevitable. Addressing social policy in a community takes time and much communication to answer peoples' questions about the organization. Once the community realized that HOPE wanted to help youth in a positive manner, many people offered their time and resources to help expand the project base. Funding When forming a coalition, funding is always a major concern. Initially, HOPE operated from donations from individuals, clubs, churches, schools, and businesses in the 55 community. This proved to be the stimulus needed to get the coalition rolling, creating local ownership. HOPE is now also funded through fundraisers and Federal grants. Youth Center The Baptist church donated $30,000 to start the youth center. Several thousand more dollars came from the community in donations, equipment, labor, and volunteers. The youth center project was successful until the summer of 1994, when a problem developed that resulted in many changes. Some urban youth with gang experience moved to Hiawatha and started forming gangs. They tried to take over the youth center, and most of the other youth stopped attending functions at the center. The center was closed while law enforcement broke up the gangs. When the center reopened, it had an expanded board of both youth and adults and was much more structured. The youth center now conducts high school and middle school activities (Healthy Highs) and is currently looking at starting a youth job service center and a day care center to generate funds for the youth center and young people in the community. The center has helped many at-risk youth with no parent at home. The center is considering a tutoring program for these students. Law Enforcement The HOPE program's work with law enforcement of all forms (KBI, highway patrol, sheriff, city police, and police auxiliary) has proven to be rewarding for many parties. The first grants for the full-time prevention officers and the DARE officer opened up a new arena in prevention, education, and community programs. The level of success of these various programs will not be known for a long time, but the results from the first two years are very promising. The DARE program is now being funded by the City of Hiawatha, and another officer has been trained to be a DARE officer. The program hopefully will be presented to additional grades in coming years. The positive relationship between parents, youth, and law enforcement led to the community policing grant. These officers now have communication lines that were non-existent before the prevention officers started their interventions and apprehensions. They are receiving community support. The community wants more interventions and is looking at a drug dog as their next project. The police and sheriff's departments are also considering a cadet program for youth. At first, some officers did not understand the work of the prevention officer. This created in- house and departmental stress, because the prevention officer was not helping with interventions. This problem was solved by creating a committee outside of the polic e department to listen to the officers; complaints and mediate the situations. Meetings were also held with other officers to explain the role of the prevention officer. In addition, the prevention officer was made a representative of the sheriff, so that the sheriff would feel less threatened by the program. Another problem was that the prevention officer initially needed instruction regarding some of the cases in the schools. This led to the addition of a chemical dependency therapist in conjunction with the local mental health center to the program. This therapist has helped law enforcement officers with their job stress and counsels inmates, juveniles, and prevention officers. This therapist is also available to counsel parents. The 56 overall success of the programs by law enforcement has benefited both law enforcement and the community. Effect on Schools Since the formation of HOPE, schools now have a partner in parents and the community to address social concerns. One success of the program is that school administrators can visit with law enforcement officials regarding at-risk or problem youth. The alcohol and drug-free schools' monies committee has developed new programs concerning cultural awareness, leadership, decisionmaking, and an evaluation of existing programs. It has allowed parents the opportunity to learn how to actively chaperon social functions and school activities. Parent Network This has been the toughest part of HOPE to keep functioning. Regular parent meetings were not successful, which is why the program has adopted the Parent University model. This allows for mini workshops on parental topics, a monthly newsletter on parent- related subjects, and an annual Parent University showcasing all resources available in the community for parents. These activities are growing in number, and parents have already started support groups. It appears after two years that the parent network will continue to exist and expand. Principals call or send letters to recalcitrant parents to continue their participation in the program. Successes and Accomplishments When HOPE began, many people thought it would not last one year. However, it has almost completed three years as a community coalition. HOPE has continued to grow and expand programs where a major social concern exists. HOPE Awareness Week was held in March 1994. This week of activities was used for celebration, education, and fun for all ages. The events included a volunteer dinner, a motivational speaker, parent education, and a Kansas City Chiefs benefit basketball game with proceeds going to the prevention officer program. HOPE helped obtain enough voter petitions to get the City of Hiawatha to change a city ordinance that allowed alcohol to be consumed at the city ballpark. HOPE organized a National Guard Fly-In in October 1994. Ribbon Week and the Parent University. F This helped to kick off Red HOPE has also helped the State of Kansas start a statewide parent network using the HOPE organization structure as a start up model. The DARE program has been expanded to include sixth and seventh grades as well as the fifth grade. -~ \" .,I,. ~,5: 57 The juvenile offenses during the five years prior to the grant averaged 104 offenses yearly in Brown County. Twenty-one months into the program, the juvenile offense rate is now at 50, or a 50% reduction. The working relationship created between the sheriff, city police, school administrators, teachers, counselors, parents, and youth has benefited the whole community. The prevention officers had run a total of 269 programs in 22 schools by January 1995. The programs have been delivered to an estimated 5,000 students. Many of these students have received more than one program. Prospects for Replication There are several elements required for a community to start a comprehensive coalition such as HOPE. There need to be many interested people, both youth and parents. The adults need to come from a cross-section of the entire community and be both administrators and workers. They can be recruited through advertising of the HOPE program and its components. A retreat for these individuals needs to be held in order to discuss their community and focus on the pertinent issues. Once the people see, understand, and are committed to addressing the social concerns in their community, a coalition can be formed. Once the coalition is formed, it needs to get all organizations concerning youth in the community involved. A positive relationship between law enforcement, youth, and parents is imperative for social programs to have an impact on a community. Law enforcement \"has to be involved at all levels for prevention programs to be effective. Contact Information Stephen L.

The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (JPSO) is the main law enforcement agency in the Parish and is the second largest police agency in the State. The JPSO is a multifaceted police agency providing a full line of services including patrol, investigations, forensics, and corrections. The Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office (JPDA) represents the people of Jefferson Parish in the 24th Judicial District of Louisiana. The JPDA has jurisdiction over all criminal matters arising within the Parish, including felony and misdemeanor charges, parish ordinances, juvenile cases, and traffic offenses. The primary mission of police service is to protect the public from violent crime. There are many ways to meet this challenge, but the most effective means to impact violent crime is to deter those intent on its commission. Deterrence can be described as the state of mind whereby a potential offender resists the opportunity or impulse to commit crime for fear of apprehension and punishment. Unfortunately, as it relates to the habitual, violent offender, deterrence is a bankrupt theory. As studies and experience have demonstrated, the true recidivist is a criminal by choice who has demonstrated a reluctance or inability to reform. As a result, the only meaningful method known of interrupting the criminal careers of these hardcore offenders is through a process of selective incapacitation. It has long been established, both academically and in law enforcement circles, that a relatively small percentage of the population, estimated at 6%, is responsible for a large and disproportionate share of crime in general, estimated at 60%, and of violent crime, estimated at 75%. This minority of offenders is often referred to as the CHRONIC 6%. So great is the impact of this element of society that if law enforcement officers did nothing more in the war on crime than focus attention on this element of society, communities would experience an immediate and dramatic reduction in the incidence of violent crime. The problem with most strategies that attempt to focus on recidivists is that they fail to objectively and correctly identify the true impact players in the community. For the most part, the decision to target a certain individual over another is based on a subjective \"gut feeling.\" If ten people were involved in the decisionmaking process, ten different targets might be selected. In an effort to systematically identify and neutralize this 'cream of the rotten crop,' the Sheriff and District Attorney of Jefferson Parish, in conjunction with the municipal police 59 departments, established an elite police/prosecutor unit designated \"CODE 6.\" A cooperative effort now exists in Jefferson Parish to negate the effects of this chronic minority through analytical incarceration and prosecutorial strategies. Goals and Objectives The goal of the program is to reduce significantly the incidence of predatory crime perpetrated by violent recidivists through a process of objective identification, selective incapacitation, and vertical prosecution. Program Components On October 12, 1992, the CODE 6 Program was established as a joint police/prosecutor initiative comprising the Sheriffs Office Career Criminal Intercept Unit (CCIU) and the District Attorney's Office Vertical Prosecution Unit (VPU). The program is centrally headquartered within the Sheriff's Office Investigations Bui'eau, with satellite offices located at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. Offenders are objectively identified through the use of an Intensive Criteria Rating Scale, which comprises seven distinct categories, each having a corresponding point value. Twenty points is the maximum number an individual can attain in the system. A higher point total indicates a greater propensity for violence. The criteria takes into account both felony arrest(s) and/or conviction(s). It evaluates the total criminal history accumulated by the offender including the instant or pending charge(s). Heavy emphasis is placed on crimes involving violence, drugs, and weapons. Attention is also given to the career criminal having obtained five or more felony arrests in at least three different crime categories. In addition, it notes whether the offender has obtained a felony arrest within thirty months of the instant charge and whether the offender has a substantial juvenile record. Next, offenders are selectively incapacitated by being physically prevented from committing future criminal acts. CODE 6 accomplishes this systematic quarantine by appealing to magistrates to enhance bonds based on either the severity of the instant charge or the criminal history of the offender as reflected by the point total accrued by applying the Intensive Criteria. Perpetrators are vertically prosecuted by a CODE 6 special prosecutor who manages the case from screening through trial. Vertical prosecutors make extensive use of the State's Habitual Offender Law which enhances sentences throughmultiple billing. The notification process begins when an investigating and/or arresting officer contacts communications and requests a CODE 6 criminal history of an individual. Communications enters the name, race, sex, and birth date of the individual intoa metropolitan-wide criminal information network computer. The computer displays pertinent information on the individual which includes a concise criminal history. If the individual in question has attained at least 60 five felony arrests and/or two felony convictions, he/she is flaggedas a possible career criminal. If the individual is the subject of a felony arrest(s), all paperwork is immediately forwarded to the Career Criminal Intercept Unit for analytical processing. At this stage, all potential candidates are evaluated by the Intensive Criteria Rating Scale to determine the extent and degree of documented violence. In the tracking portion of the program, a CCIU member attends magistrate court daily, armed with all available information obtained during notification on all potential targets. It is at magistrate court that the CCIU will selectively incapacitate targets by making appeals for enhanced bonds even though the instant charge may be relatively minor. Tracking also includes the assigning of a CCIU investigator to work one on one with a vertical prosecutor to perform any research and investigative functions deemed necessary by the vertical prosecutor to enhance the probability of conviction. In the final phase of the system, all available information on the targeted recidivist is forwarded to vertical prosecution for screening. At this time, based on a number of variables including the criteria score and case quality, the target is either eliminated from consideration, the case transferred to the regular screening division of the D.A.'s Office, or accepted for vertical prosecution. If accepted, the target may be tried by the VPU. These defendants rate high on the criteria and have one or more prior felony convictions that make them candidates for multiple billing under the habitual offender law. Other accepted defendants who would have been tried by a vertical prosecutor, because of mitigating factors (i.e., sheer volume or no prior convictions), may be tried by regular division assistant district attorneys with special supervisory instructions regarding pleas or disposition of sentence. Results and Impact Performance Measures To date, the CODE 6 Program is achieving its stated goal of significantly reducing the incidence of predatory crime in the community by objectively identifying, selectively incapacitating, and vertically prosecuting violent recidivists. All qualitative data on targeted individuals are loaded into the Sheriff's Office main frame VAX Computer system. Data retrieved from the system on a monthly basis reports the following short list: total number of Possible Career Criminals arrested and booked at the correctional facility by felonies, misdemeanors, and attachments; total number of bond enhancements and amounts; average length of incapacitation of potential candidates at the correctional facility; total number of candidates accepted for vertical prosecution; total number of trials, pleas, convictions, or acquittals; 61 average number of years per sentenced target; and average length of time from acceptance to trial. Implementation Problems and Successes As in any multiagency initiative, certain compromises must be made. Clear and concise areas of responsibility must be worked out well in advance. In addition, emphasis must be placed evenly on all areas of the process. At first, too much emphasis was placed on arrests and not enough on convictions. When the judges weren't enthusiastic about the program, more attention was distributed to convictions to even out the distribution of positive publicity. One problem encountered by the CODE 6 program is that criminals are filing motions to expunge their records so that it cannot be determined if they are eligible for the CODE 6 program. District Attorneys are still trying to decide if this is legal. Another problem is that there is no multiple bill law with regard to juveniles. They can be identified as CODE 6 perpetrators, but they can't be kept incarcerated for a great length of time. Successes and Accomplishments From October 12, 1992 through December 31, 1994, the CODE 6 Program has achieved some impressive results. It is important to note that from its inception until November of 1993, the Vertical Prosecution Unit consisted of one prosecutor. Since that time, the number of vertical prosecutors has increased to three. The Career Criminal Intercept Unit has steadily grown to its present compliment of twelve personnel. From October 1992 through December 1994, the CODE 6 Program compiled the following statistics: 14,152 possible career criminals arrested: 5,324 felony arrests, 3,980 misdemeanor arrests, and 4,848 attachment arrests; 307 bond enhancements totaling $76,715,414; 127 candidates on average incapacitated at the correctional facility; 419 candidates accepted in the program for vertical prosecution; 235 total convictions; average sentence per conviction was 33 years (excluding 4 life sentences) in the category with more severe cases and 8 years in the category with less severe cases; and 4.8 months average time from acceptance to trial. Prospects for Replication The prospects for replication of this program are good. During the planning stages, program managers should attempt to include all elements of the law enforcement community, including the judiciary. Frequent meeting and recognition of all parties involved is a must. The systems 62 aspect of the program can be manual or computer generated, depending on the sophistication of the agency. The CODE 6 Program is working because it is a quick, simple, and budget-friendly method of identifying and removing habitual, violent offenders from the community. CODE 6 targets violent recidivists, moves them quickly through the criminal justice system, and removes them from society.

With the certainty of that trend's continuance, law enforcement and national elder lobbies have focused research and media attention on this section of the population. The American public views the older citizen as highly vulnerable to and a frequent victim of criminal activity. Many seniors hold this view as well, and as a result live in a state of fear that far outweighs the reality of their vulnerability. Television and newspaper accounts of criminal activity often introduce hyperbole; the fear of possible victimization mounts unrealistically. The anxieties which accompany these perceptions reduce the quality of life for older persons. While most studies indicate that elders are victimized less often than any other age group, the economic, physical, and psychological consequences of those victimizations are more debilitating. A purse-snatching experienced by a younger person, although serious, is not as likely to have the severe consequences that would be more likely with an elder. For an elder, limited fixed income makes replacing what was stolen more difficult; possible physical injuries resulting from the assault heal much more slowly; .and emotional consequences could lead to increased isolation and a reduction of social support. An elder victimized while in public frequently decides to isolate her/himself more completely, especially at night. This reduced vulnerability may account somewhat for the finding that those over 65 are less often victimized than other age groups.. Staying at home does lessen the chance of being assaulted, but it also can reduce significantly the quality of one's interactions. However, the home is not always a haven. Victims of elder abuse face the burden of having to choose whether to report the abuse to authorities, thus jeopardizing family members and their own ability to remain at home, or subject themselves to continued abuse. If they report the abuse, they face the question of who will care for them. If they remain at home, they wonder how the perpetrator will retaliate. If they do not report the abuse, they face continuing, and often escalating, mistreatment. Frauds and scams increasingly target older citizens. According to Doug Shadel, economic security/consumer representative with AARP, while seniors compose 12-13% of the population, 64 they are the targets of nearly 1/3 of all reported frauds -- telemarketing,, postal, and door-to- door -- and 60% of all health frauds. Reasons cited for the high incidence include the likelihood of seniors having considerable savings, lump-sum pensions, or insurance premiums; the strong possibility that seniors with fixed incomes are more susceptible to get-rich-quick schemes; and that they are more likely to be home, often alone, when swindlers call. As criminal activity in society continues and fear intensifies, society and law enforcement have an obligation to address the security needs of these older citizens. The establishment of the Triad program in a community, county, and/or State is a realistic, cost-effective method of addressing those needs. Goals and Objectives In,serving Franklin and Hampshire Counties in western Massachusetts and their citizens, the Triad program has the following goals: to reduce criminal activity which targets older Americans; to alleviate seniors' fear of victimization, and build confidence in their ability to reduce vulnerability; and to expand collaboration between law enforcement, human service providers, and seniors. The objectives of the program in Franklin and Hampshire Counties to accomplish the above goals are to: establish a community format to increase interaction between seniors, law enforcement officers, and human service providers; educate seniors, officers, and providers conceming each others' responsibilities and advantages gained through collaboration; provide education on crime prevention and personal/home safety; increase reporting by seniors to police of suspicious/criminal activity; offer seniors leadership training and the opportunity to lead; and improve senior awareness of services. Program Components \"Triad\" is a local community policing initiative among seniors, law enforcement, and human service providers to increase safety and confidence for older citizens through education and crime prevention. In each community Triad is implemented through a SALT (Seniors and Law Enforcement Together) Council which is corfiposed of seniors, representatives of community service organizations, and local and county law enforcement officers. Frequently involved are Councils on Aging, Home Care and senior housing organizations, protective services, AARP, 65 clergy, and business leaders. Law enforcement representation includes local police, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff. Implementation of Triad consists of learning the needs of the community's senior population through the SALT Council and then working cooperatively to seek and put into place solutions to those needs. Surveys and questionnaires often are utilized to help determine the concerns of older residents. Once needs have been pinpointed and prioritized, the Council regularly convenes a forum to decide how best to accomplish the specified goals. A responsibility of the SALT Council is to see that information that originates in the Council, or that results from its initiatives, is circulated throughout the community to assure that those who would most benefit from the information receive it. The media -- print, radio, television - - and newsletters, pamphlets, and other publications, civic meetings, community meals, and workshops become avenues for distributing information. Locally, implementation and maintenance of a SALT Council require little money other than that which allows professionals sufficient time to meet and to fulfill the Council's agenda. When police departments have required funding to provide for a Triad officer, State grants have been helpful. On the county level, Triad in western Massachusetts operated for two years with a volunteer part-time coordinator who assisted the District Attorney and the Sheriffs. As the, program grew, the need for a full-time person led to a grant application to the Massachusetts Committee on Criminal Justice (MCCJ). A requirement of the $50,000 grant was that one quarter of the total was to be provided by the District AttOrney and Sheriffs. Renewal of the grant for a second year will necessitate that one-half of the total be obtained from sources other than MCCJ. The advantages of a SALT Council to a community are numerous. For seniors, the Council provides the opportunity to meet directly and regularly with local police officers. Citizens are more inclined to turn to the police when they know officers as people and not simply as uniforms. Consequently, police departments are more likely to be contacted by people who previously may have been reluctant to involve the police. Seniors also become more aware of services to which they and their peers are entitled and how to access them. They become more aware of criminal activities and of steps to avoid victimization. Police officers benefit by becoming more aware of the fears and perceptions of their senior residents regarding crime and victimization. Frequently, police chiefs have expressed concern that seniors, more than any other age group, are reluctant to involve the police when it would be appropriate for them to do so. Whether many seniors are concerned that they will bother the police whom they may believe have more important things to do, or whether they are afraid of recriminations if they notify police of suspected criminal activity, older citizens frequently are hesitant to call the police. Improved communication and sharing between seniors and police officers can work to counteract that tendency. Increased respect for the department from members of the community develops as a result of the commitment that has been shown through Triad. 66 Human service providers gain from increased interaction and cooperation with law enforcement and from improved distribution of services. Council on Aging directors become more conscious of the needs of the seniors they serve concerning the issues of vulnerability to crime and victimization. Protective services and police departments gain an improved understanding and appreciation for what each other's tasks and challenges are. Advantages to be gained through collaborative efforts become more apparent. Results and Impact Performance Measures Full implementation of Triad, consisting of SALT Councils in each of the 47 communities, is to be completed by July 1995. Indicators of Council effectiveness are: the level of reporting to police/protective services by seniors of suspected criminal activity; evidence of senior initiatives to plan and to implement workshops to focus on issues; elements of elder security: personal protection, outreach to isolated elders, vulnerability to fraud, and home/neighborhood protection; and enhanced senior involvement in the community evidenced by media contact, participation in workshops, and involvement with local, State, and national representatives. Measures of the effectiveness of the program have been primarily qualitative. Interviews with police officers, service providers, and seniors have demonstrated a belief that Triad is needed, welcome, and effective. Quantitative measures have included local questionnaires and their results, newspaper and senior newsletter articles, crime spots on local radio, panel interviews on cable access television stations, and workshops. Implementation Problems and Successes The principal difficulties encountered in implementation efforts have been \"turf' issues. As the primary law enforcement organization of the Commonwealth, local police departments are committed to maintaining that position and can become defensive if another department is suspected of infringing on their territory. Open discussion between police, sheriffs, and district attorneys, and a commitment to keep chiefs informed of efforts and initiatives designed to assist, not to dominate or replace, have led to increased respect and cooperation. Successes and Accomplishments Virtually every community to which Triad has been introduced has expressed a willingness to implement the program. This reflects both the perceived need to approach crime problems 67 collaboratively and the willingness to attempt it. The statements summarized below are by seniors from Triad communities in Franklin County. They are characteristic of feelings expressed by seniors throughout both counties. \"I don't feel as fearful. I feel better qualified to cope through education. It's a very valuable program. I think that the other people I've talked to feel the same way .... I think if people know we have a new kind of senior out there, that we are not as easy a prey, and they (the seniors) know ways of taking care of themselves, I really think... down the road it will be a very valuable crime fighter .... I have more confidence; I'm not nearly as timid about going out now.\" Dorothea Hoehrein, 74. \"I'm alerted, and I tell other people what I've learned. My impulse now is to call the police right away. Before I might have thought I was just being neurotic where now I'd just call them right up. Some of the seniors are inclined to say, 'I don't want to bother the police,' where now we are being told, 'Bother us; that's what we're here for'... I feel a lot different toward the police now, much more secure.\" Mary Poirier, 62. \"I know I could go into the police station at any time and have someone help me and give me good advice. Or I could stop a policeman on the street. It's just more comforting, more reassuring knowing that you can talk to people. Yes, I am much less fearful .... To be able to sit each month with the police chief and a detective and to have them listen to you is great.\" Fran Callaghan, 82. \"I've lived here two years. I have people living right outside my door who wouldn't even talk to me; they didn't even say 'Hi .... ' Now they stop me and say, 'You had those (no soliciting) signs put up. We think that's a wonderful idea.' I told them, 'Don't wait to get robbed; find out how to protect yourself.' Now they're more outgoing. It (Triad) is opening people up more .... Where I used to live (New York City) we never had positive relationships with the police like we are having now.\" Vincent Capasso, 72. In addition to the SALT Councils that have been implemented, a significant development of the Triad program in western Massachusetts has been the cooperation between police and sheriffs' departments to reach out to seniors who are living alone and in isolation. When police officers have been unavailable due to staff shortages and/or other commitments, a sheriff's deputy has been able to respond. Seniors have found home visits to be reassuring for several reasons: the presence of a patrol car in the neighborhood is a reminder of police interest and their commitment to deter crime; the visits help to alleviate the fear an older person can experience while living alone and can reduce significantly the feeling of isolation; 68 a visiting officer can make suggestions as to what the resident can do to make his home more secure, educating the senior concerning what steps can be taken to increase safety; and an officer trained in detecting frauds and seams that target elders can detect signs of possible involvement and can dispense information to deter future defrauding. Triad SALT Councils have provided a base for the presentation, dissemination, and discussion of information to counter vulnerability to fraud. With direct access to .seniors, police, and human service providers, Councils have sponsored presentations that assure current and accurate information on past seams and seams that currently are operational in an area. Through the cooperative resources that the Councils provide, pamphlets can be prepared, distributed, and discussed by utilizing media outlets. Another issue affecting older citizens on' which Triad is having an impact is that of mixed population housing. As State hospitals and institutions have been closed throughout Massachusetts, community resources have been called upon to provide additional services including housing. Often housing complexes constructed exclusively for elders are being opened to younger individuals with special needs and their own personal and social habits. The Triad SALT Councils are bringing together the groups which are affected. Discussion of what is not working and what could lead to improvements is beginning. Of issue to police officers, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT's), and firefighters who respond to emergencies in private residences is the availability of vital medical information. For senior residents who are more likely to have particular medical conditions that could affect their treatment, the accessibility of that information is essential for saving time and lives. Several SALT Councils in Western Massachusetts have adopted an initiative from the Triad in Bridgeport, Connecticut by creating a \"file for life.\" The plastic file has a pocket which contains vital medical and emergency information kept on an updatable form. Highly visible, the file attaches to the outside of the refrigerator door with a magnet. Officers and EMT's will know where to look for medical information including whom to contact on the senior's behalf. Efforts have begun through local Councils on Aging to have files distributed throughout the State. Other Triad initiatives have included home and personal safety seminars and police reports on the nature of criminal activity in the community. Accurate information from police departments and from protective service agencies is helping to reduce fear and to strengthen the sense of community. SALT Councils have sponsored presentations on shopping rights, how to address conflicts between seniors and young people, street lighting short;ages, telemarketing fraud and telephone technology, town by-laws concerning solicitation, the advisability of utilizing personal and home security devices, and self-defense. Some police departments working with local Councils have begun to offer training for seniors to assist officers with home security checks, with the utilization of Operation Identification to deter house break-ins, and with outreach. 69 Through January 1995, 30 of the 47 communities that comprise Franklin and Hampshire Counties have been introduced to the Triad program and are in various stages of implementation. In November 1994 the Northwestern District Attorney and the Sheriffs from the two counties sponsored a statewide introduction of Triad which was attended by over 200 people from Massachusetts: police officers, sheriffs, district attorneys, Council on Aging and AARP representatives, and protective service personnel. As a result, a dozen communities from neighboring counties have asked for assistance in beginning Triad, as have representatives from other States. Prospects for Replication The National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) provides a full-time national Triad coordinator to facilitate the creation of a Triad program in any state. NSA sponsored a national conference in October and will host a second in St. Louis in April. The conference includes workshops on how to begin and to maintain SALT Councils. Several counties in Massachusetts as well as other States have asked for assistance in introducing Triad. Recommendations to implement the program throughout Massachusetts have come from a Governor's Task Force on Mixed Population Housing and from the State White House Conference Subcommittee on Crime and Elders sponsored by the Executive Office of Elder Affairs.

The general principle behind the creation of DART was that the most effective weapon against drug houses is the community. Since this was not just a county, city, or one neighborhood's problem, it was envisioned that a cooperative effort among all groups adversely affected by this problem would provide the most effective method for eliminating it. DART was created in 1991 through the assistance of a grant from the State of Missouri and through funding from the Jackson County Anti-Drug Sales Tax (commonly referred to as the Community Backed Anti-Drug Tax, \"COMBAT\"). It should be noted that Jackson County, Missouri is one of a very few places in the United States that has decided to tax itself to help eliminate the county's drug problem through enforcement, prevention, and treatment. Goals and Objectives The goal of DART is to provide a method to quickly shut down drug houses by citing city housing code and fire code violations, thus bypassing the more traditional police methods that take longer and sometimes are less effective. DART's primary goal and function is to take measures to identify and remove illegal drug activity within the community. Program Components DART is a multiagency, multijurisdictional program that was developed to combat the increasing problem of drug houses within Jackson County. DART's primary role is to provide a quick, alternative method to close drug houses using the resources of county and local government, the citizens of the community, and private sector utility companies. Before the creation of DART, it was determined that drug trafficking operations within Jackson County were located predominantly in residential properties and occasionally in business establishments. Illegal drug distribution and associated activities present safety and health issues not only for those individuals who are involved in the illegal activity, but also for those innocent individuals who might be impacted through community ties -- either residential, educational, family, business, or otherwise. Based on the increasing presence of drugs and drug-related activity throughout Jackson County, it became apparent that in order to have an 71 impact on the issues and circumstances created by illegal drug activity, there was a need for increased community involvement. The need was also identified for the involvement of public organizations which possessed the resources to address not only individual criminal activity but also illegal activity based in whole or in part on the actual physical structure of properties. In recognition of this, the DART concept was developed with the commitment to identify and apply all legal means available to eliminate the entire spectrum of problems associated with properties being used for illegal drug activity. The Drug Abatement Response Team (DART) represents a very unique and innovative approach to identifying and addressing issues and circumstances created by the illegal use of properties for the possession, manufacturing, storing, or distribution of controlled substances. DART's primary goal is to identify and remove illegal drug activity. In doing so, DART relies on the collaborative effort among the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office, Kansas City, the Kansas City Fire Department, the Kansas City Police Department, the Jackson County Sheriff's Department, and the citizens of Jackson County. Each member of the DART Team provides access to the services, resources, and expertise of its organization. The Jackson County Prosecutor's Office houses the DART administrative office and serves as a focal point. The Prosecuting Attorney's DART staff consists of an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney assigned as DART Coordinator, an Investigator, a Community Liaison, an Administrative Assistant, and a Law Intern. Kansas City, through its Neighborhood Preservation Department, provides a DART Housing Codes Inspector. The Kansas City Fire Department provides a DART Fire Codes Inspector. The Kansas City Police Department provides investigative and responsive services through the Street Narcotics Unit, the Drug Enforcement Unit, and various Patrol Divisions. Finally, the Jackson County Sheriff's Department provides police interaction and representation of the municipalities in Eastern Jackson County through the Jackson County Drug Task Force. The DART process begins with members of the Jackson County community. In fact, except for instances when unrelated police contact with a property leads to the discovery of illegal drug activity, all DART action begins with a member of the community reporting the suspected activity. This reporting occurs through telephone calls made directly from concerned citizens to the DART Office, the Police Department, or various community organizations or through direct contact with the community of DART staff at community meetings and events. Additionally, DART has been assisted by the development of community-oriented policing programs such as Community Action Network (CAN) Centers and Community Action Teams (CAT). These community policing components have been instrumental in the identification and elimination of drug houses and other buildings which have been used as part of the drug trade. Once a property has been identified, it is targeted for investigation by the appropriate narcotics division of the police agency which has jurisdiction on the area where the property is located. When the drug activity is confirmed, documentation is then forwarded to the Prosecutor's Office for immediate DART follow-up action. 72 DART follow-up action begins administratively with a county record check for the identification of the legal owner of the targeted property. A notice letter regarding the illegal activity is sent which includes a request for abatement of the activity and the possible consequences of failure to abate the problem. An inquiry is made into the criminal history of the residents and/or parties associated with the property along with a review of prior DART contact with the property. The primary purpose of the DART inspection is to identify municipal housing and fire code violations and to review those violations as a potential means for immediate closure of the house. According to Willis Toney, Chief Drug Prosecutor for the project, \"What we (DART) discovered is that people who operated out of drug houses had one fatal flaw, they never kept the houses up like most people would.\" When a property is posted, it is deemed unsafe for human occupancy. An order to vacate the property, which specifically sets out the code violations, is forwarded to the owner. The owner is then required to make the necessary improvements and repairs on the property before it is reinspected and recertified for occupancy. As long as the property is posted and not recertified, any entry onto the property is deemed illegal and those persons found at the property are subject to arrest for trespassing. Work access permits are granted to owners to allow for repair and the removal of property. In addition to' the notice of violations and order to vacate notice sent to the owner from the DART inspector, the owner is also sent a notice letter of illegal drug activity from the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office. This notice letter is sent via certified mail and is an official request for the owner to take immediate action to abate the activity. Enclosed in the letter is the applicable Missouri statute as well as an explanation of the potential jeopardy to the continued ownership and control of the property if drug activity continues. \"When property owners start losing their property because they're letting drug deals take place in their property, they become aware and they stop it,\" says Toney. The interaction between the DART Team and owners usually results in a voluntary resolution of the problem created by the illegal activity. At times, the tenants are evicted or voluntarily vacate the premises. However, on those occasions when the owner is directly involved, or there is a recurrence of drug activity from rental property, legal action is pursued by way of Petitions for Public Nuisance or Criminal Activity Forfeiture Actions. Houses ~hat are vacated under court order are boarded up for six months. If after this time, the landlords cannot be located, the houses are demolished or put up for public auction. Some of the abandoned houses are given to the Community Development Corporation, a program for many different kinds of offenders that teaches construction skills. The offenders rehabilitate the dilapidated houses and sell them. The money earned from the resale goes to the Community Development Corporation. 73 Results and Impact Performance Measures The DART program's success is measured by the reduction of: drug trafficking in the previously affected area; the number of open drug houses; the numbers of police \"calls for service\" in a particular area; the number of incidents of violence or drug-related crimes in a particular area; and crime overall in the targeted areas. Implementation Problems and Successes The challenge to DART's initial development was increasing community involvement in the identification and investigation of the targeted properties as well as increasing interagency awareness, cooperation, and utilization. While resource development was crucial in DART's development, it was also important to identify those resources already in existence for possible utilization and expansion while keeping in mind. the goal of providing immediate, short-term as well as long-term methods for the removal and/or closure of properties being used in drug- related activities. The difficulty in the implementation of DART centered on maintaining a balance within the legal parameters of the State, county, and local organizations that comprise DART. There existed a general hesitation to embrace this very unusual, innovative, and unchartered project which likely stemmed from an inability to fully visualize the roles and significance of each individual organization. Nevertheless, after a series of interagency brainstorming sessions and the continual identification and addition of other organizational resources, DART became a full-fledged program. An ongoing problem of the program is prioritizing neighborhoods to investigate. When DART began, the first areas entered into we/'e the Weed and Seed areas because of funding issues. The program has expanded its range based on where the calls for help come from. Another problem was the political aspects of who would receive credit for the reduction in crime. A roundtable was held in which all participating parties received credit for the successful operations, and the program was billed as a joint operation. A'final challenge was the integration of the most significant DART partner, the community. It was of paramount importance to stimulate the community to call in and report suspected illegal drug activity. A mechanism for receiving and documenting that information also had to be developed. Data Research and Analysis for Geographic Narcotics Enforcement Targets (DRAGNET), which was already being used by the police department, became and remains a very productive resource and tool for this purpose. Information generated from community telephone calls is used by the Street Narcotics Unit (SNU) of DART in targeting properties for investigation. Once a property has been successfully investigated by SNU, via an undercover purchase of illegal narcotics and the subsequent execution of a search warrant, the other DART partners take action. Based on the initial police investigation and city and county follow-up, 74 the Jackson County community has developed a greater level of confidence and security in their anonymity in reporting the activity, but also pride in their involvement in the closing of the property. Closing the problem property is the first step in restoring the quality of life in the affected areas. Successes and Accomplishments DART allows citizens to have direct input in the war on crime within their communities. When positive steps are taken to close a drug house, citizens see their tax dollars working, and they get a feeling of satisfaction once the house is shut down and the accompanying noise and violence is removed from their neighborhood. Another measure of the program's success is the increase in the number of drug cases filed. Prior to the COMBAT tax in 1989, there were less than 200 drug cases filed. In 1994, over 1,400 were filed. The DART program accomplished many tasks from 1992 to 1994 including sending out over 1,723 notice letters to property owners, completing 441 evictions, implementing 924 fire and housing inspections, posting/vacating after inspection 683 properties, boarding up 112 properties, filing 15 nuisances of which 5 were completed, and filing 10 forfeitures of which 8 were completed. To date, DART has had contact With almost 2,000 properties throughout Jackson County. This action ranges from notice letters being sent to property owners informing them of the illegal drug activity, to properties actually closed on code violations, to properties being declared public nuisances by the Court and ordered vacated and boarded up for a period up to a year and/or being ordered forfeited to the State of Missouri. Prospects for Replication The DART concept is easily replicated because most of the necessary components already exist within communities. Specifically, there is a prosecuting attorney, a narcotics unit or patrol officers who confront narcotics-type activities, some form of fire codes and housing codes in existence, and usually some block clubs or neighborhood associations with a vested interest in identifying and addressing the issues presented by illegal drug activity. DART's success is inextricably interwoven into its continual development and flexibility in taking all legal steps to respond to issues presented by drug activity as well as developing and communicating proactive means of preventing the activity. 75 Contact Information Willis L.

The 1990 U.S. Census recorded a population of 73,552 people within East Orange's 3.9 square miles. This results in one of the most densely populated urban centers in the country with 18,388 people per square mile. The unofficial population is approximately 100,000. The target neighborhood has approximately 4,000 residents. Less than 8% of them are senior citizens, lower than average for the city. About 30% of the population are under 18, about the city-wide average. East Orange is a low income city with a minority population over 90%. The target area has historically accounted for approximately 42% of all serious crimes that occur in the city. The Police Community Partnership Program was initiated on February 15, 1993. The Police Communily Partnership Program uses a multiagency approach to address violent crime, drug abuse, and deteriorating social conditions. The Police Community Partnership Program relies on the establishment of a healthy, positive relationship between the police and citizens. Goals and Objectives Some of the goals of the program are to: increase drug prevention programs in the schools by expanding D.A.R.E.; organize Community/Neighborhood Watch Programs; educate children, parents, and the public to be aware of and avoid potential crime situations and minimize their risk of being crime victims; and expand the number of neighborhoods in partnership with police programs. Program Components The Police Community Partnership Program is made up of 4 components: Violent Offenders Removal Program (VORP), Community Oriented Policing, Safe Haven, and Neighborhood Revitalization. 77 VORP This component is designed to remove violent and repeat offenders from the target area. It is a multiagency strategy which includes city, county, and State law enforcement personnel working together to combat crime in the target area. Meetings are held monthly to discuss strategies to apprehend and remove violent offenders. Individuals who continue to degrade the quality of life in the target area are prosecuted with the assistance of the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Community Oriented Policing The community policing unit consists of ten officers who form the core of the project and are supported by the department as a whole. They engage in a daily vigorous patrol function. The primary objective of the selection criteria is that police officers should \"get to know the community.\" Their role is that of policeman, mediator, representative, and friend to the target area residents. Their responsibilities range from enforcing to advising, and they look for all avenues to improve the quality of life in the community. This partnership is developed through trust and open lines of communication. This component involves the mobilization of target area residents to assist law enforcement in identifying problems and developing solutions. Area residents become the eyes and ears of the police. Safe Haven The Safe Haven was incorporated into the YMCA and Rowley Park, located in the target area in East Orange. The concept is to create a positive, healthy environment, for recreational, cultural, and educational programs. Safe Haven, the recreational component of the community policing partnership grant, has approximately 600 members between the ages of five and eighteen. Of these 600, 83 are members of the Safe Haven/East Orange YMCA After School Program. The After School Program is for youth between the ages of five and thirteen and runs from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the East Orange YMCA gymnasium. Activities offered to the After School Program members include: dance, swimming, tumbling, arts and crafts, games, martial arts, science, after school homework assistance, games, snacks, and trips. Evening and weekend offerings are as follows: Girl Scouts, the Archonette Club (chapter of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority), boxing, swimming, 4-H, basketball, open gym and weight room, Creative Spirits Performing Arts Group, and video game room. Periodic parent meetings and the involvement of parents in planning activities has been crucial all the program's successes. Mandatory parent orientations were set up at the beginning of the program to orient parents regarding the program and to elicit their suggestions and desires regarding program delivery. Revitalization The city intends to rehabilitate Rowley Park, which is located in the target area. The basketball courts have been resurfaced, and new playground equipment has been added. The city intends to make the park more of a focal point for community activities. This will be done by adding a picnic area, softball field, and security kiosk/concessions stand. Additional garbage receptacles and planters were placed throughout the target area. 78 Four two-family homes are presently being built at the comer of Park Avenue and North Clinton Street. A 16-unit multifamily property at 356 William Street is being rehabilitated and is near completion. Five multifamily homes with 163 units of affordable housing are to be rehabilitated on North Walnut Street. The rehabilitation of 139 North Arlington Avenue will result in the creation of high quality, low-cost housing for families in the city. There is also a proposal for the development of a 16-unit multifamily home at North Walnut Street and Park Avenue. Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes Attempts made to begin a Pre-Teen/Teen After SchoolProgram at the East Orange High School were unsuccessful due to low enrollment/interest. One of the biggest problems in implementing the program was knowing how each component should run and getting it to meet that standard or higher. Another problem was trying to get everyone involved with the program to work together. Successes and Accomplishments One of the accomplishments in 1994 was the creation of a drug-free environment in Rowley Park. \"Another was the field house, now the home of a Mini-Station. Through the Mini-Station, safe corridors were established to and from school. At the start of the school year a meeting was held with the principal of the high school which borders the target area. Key issues discussed were truancy, loitering, and disorderly conduct in and around the school. One solution was to stagger dismissal times. Officers assigned to the school work with Board of Education Security to accomplish this. A summer D.A.R.E. program was implemented for children at Rowley Park. D.A.R.E. officers continued to teach their program during the school year at local schools. Officers assisted neighborhood residents in applying for GED and job training programs. ..S '~ Daily interaction with building managers and superintendents has kept the lines of communication open. Security surveys were conducted. Vacant apartments were utilized for the surveillance of drug activity. Signs were posted on buildings in the target area notifying area residents that building owners are working with the police to rid the area of law violators. Crime tip placards were placed in stores and homes in the area. Calls for service are being monitored. If a building is receiving complaints, a letter is sent to the owner. This letter requests that the owner respond to police headquarters. Once the letter is received by the owner, problems, strategies, and solutions are discussed. A team effort is utilized to find a solution to the problem. 79 Many innovative ideas have led to numerous arrests and the confiscation of drugs, money, and vehicles. A grocery store in the target area which played a major part in the drug trade has been closed, and permits for a neighborhood laundromat are being processed. Vacant lots were blocked off by large tree stumps to prevent dumping. Two vacant lots have been turned into community gardens in the summer months, making the area safer and more .attractive. Officers in the Community Oriented Policing Unit made 247 adult arrests and 75 juvenile arrests in 1994, compared to 450 adult arrests and 71 juvenile arrests in 1993. A total of 247 adults were arrested as part of the VORP component of the program, 131 cases were reviewed, and 51 cases were referred to the grand jury with dispositions in Superior Court. The highlights of the Safe Haven Program have been the successful completion of the 1994 Summer Camp, which registered 252 youth; Healthy Kids Day; Oktoberfest Flea Market; Halloween Party; Thanksgiving Feast; and the end of the year Holiday Pageant. The growth of the Safe Haven component can be seen not only through the increased membership, but in the addition of new programs, events, and parent participation. It can also be seen between the officers working with the program and the youth, who look for them and trust them and their presence in the neighborhood. The process of revitalization will generate long-term benefits to the area. Neighborhood residents who are involved in job training will work as apprentices to the sub-contractors hired to build the project. Being able to address problems and find solutions has played an important role in strengthening the position of the police in the neighborhood. Prospects for Replication For the program to be a success, it must have the commitment of the Chief of Police, and the mayor must set the tone of the program. Also, program organizers should tell others what the goals of the program are to encourage success. . --- Being able to work with other agencies in the city, county, and State is of paramount importance. Some of the agencies that the Police Community Partnership Program works with are: Code Enforcement, Public Works Department, Health Department, Fire Department, Parks Department, Tenant Resource, Board of Education, and Public Service Electric & Gas. Area residents must be empowered to combat neighborhood problems. Being aware of all available resources is important. 80 Contact Information Lieutenant Ronald Borgo Police Community Parmership Program East Orange Police Department 61 Northmunn Avenue East Orange, NJ 07019 (201) 266-5070 (201) 675-7311 fax 81 Oregon Family Violence Intervention Steering Committee Statement of the Problem Domestic violence is a serious social problem in Multnomah County. In 1994, 21 or one-third of the homicides in Portland were committed in domestic violence situations, and law enforcement officers were dispatched to over 17,000 domestic violence incidents. In addition to calling 911, victims of domestic violence call crisis lines and shelters at an even higher rate for support, information and referral to services, and to find safety for themselves and their children. Crisis lines received over 29,000 calls with requests for shelter for nearly 28,000 women and children. Unfortunately, only 1,200 women and children (less than 10%) could be place d in domestic violence shelters. By 1987, it had become clear to many people involved in intervention of domestic violence situations that coordination of services, communication among agencies, and a clear vision of a more effective system were needed to formulate the most effective response to domestic violence. In that year, the Family Violence Intervention Steering Committee was formed. Since that time, the Committee has developed comprehensive strategies to address the problem of domestic violence and has pursued specific collaborative solutions. In their 1991 report, From Harassment to Homicide, the Committee stated that: Although incidents of domestic violence in Multnomah County exceed those from gang violence or drug overdose, to date no commensurate public outrage, planning, or dedication of funds has resulted, lnstead misconceptions about domestic violence abound. Abusive relationships are deemed to be private matters, with the victim at fault for \"choosing\" to stay -- even if she has children, no income, and no place to go. Little attention has been given to this victim-blaming or to the lack of coordination that permeates this community's official response to domestic violence. Shelters and services for victims are grossly underfunded. Intervention with perpetrators is almost nonexistent. Goals and Objectives The Committee is a collaborative effort that has developed over the last eight years. It provides leadership and a forum for solving problems and developing partnerships, and a shared vision among the agencies and bureaus that address domestic violence. Each member agency is independent of the Steering Committee and has its own goals and objectives. The 82 process of collaboration and coordination involves a continuous assessment of the system in place, an evaluation of its successes and failures, and steps to balance and improve the response. The overriding goal of the Steering Committee and its member agencies is to effectively prevent, intervene in; and reduce domestic violence in Multnomah County. The mission of the Family Violence Intervention Steering Committee is to provide an inter-agency forum for developing, implementing, and assessing a coordinated response to domestic violence in the City of Portland and Multnomah County. The objectives of the Committee are to: share information about local responses to domestic violence in order to decrease its incidence in the community; plan, develop, implement, and monitor an integrated services model of effective intervention in domestic violence; focus public attention on the problem of domestic violence and develop community resources to deter it; and propose and support legislation, ordinances, and other public policy protocols to further the objectives of the Committee. Program Components Twenty-two public and private agencies are now members of the Steering Committee, and ten to twenty other agencies regularly participate in meetings, planning processes, and activities to prevent or intervene in domestic violence. Steering Committee members include: local shelters and crisis lines, legal advocates for survivors, criminal and civil justice providers (public defenders, Community Corrections, Courts, District Attorney), law enforcement units (Portland Police Bureau, Sheriff's Office), health care providers, batterers' treatment providers, Children's Services Division, and key funders (City, County, and United Way). The Steering Committee with its sub-committees and the formal and informal relationships that develop among its members is the forum for coordination and development of policies, programs, and problem solving. The following activities of the Committee are in place. Emergency Intervention: Crisis lines, shelters, police/sheriff, and health care providers are usually the first points of contact for people seeking help in domestic violence situations. There are five domestic violence shelters with crisis lines and two other crisis lines available in the County. This safety network for victims and their children provides support, information and referral by phones, and safe shelter, transportation, advocacy, case management, material support, and domestic violence education. The committee also has motel voucher money available on a limited basis to get victims out of dangerous situations on a short-term basis. 83 The police/sheriff departments respond to reports of family disturbance 911 calls. Officers are statutorily mandated to arrest the primary perpetrator when the officer has probable cause to believe that an assault or other crime has occurred between family members or when the officer believes that a restraining order has been violated. In addition to actions taken by officers at the scene, a domestic violence unit was formed in 1993. The objectives of this unit are to assist victims, reduce overall violence, and conduct follow-up investigations on domestic misdemeanor cases, particularly if children are present, weapons, drugs, or alcohol were used, or if the incident is a repeat offense. The committee is currently studying how felony cases are handled by the law enforcement system. Criminal Remedies: Criminal remedies, intended to prevent future violence, give the perpetrator the message that domestic violence is not acceptable to the community. The objectives of the Domestic Violence Unit District Attorney are to stop the cycle of domestic violence, to seek appropriate sanctions against defendants, and to assist the victims. The unit is committed to prosecuting domestic violence crimes aggressively, in some cases without the victim's participation. This Unit, the Courts, and Community Corrections all participate in a deferred sentencing program for batterers, including treatment, intensive supervision, and jail time if the perpetrators fail to complete the treatment or re-offend. The objective of this program is to reduce re-offenses in 70% of those completing the program. Defendants who qualify for this program are misdemeanants who have no prior convictions for crimes against a person and have not previously participated in a deferred sentencing program. Civil Remedies: Civil remedies consist of Family Abuse Prevention Act Restraining Orders and divorce and custody orders. The objective of all of these civil remedies is the separation of the victim from the perpetrator. Two agencies, Portland Women's Crisis Line and the Oregon Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, provide advocacy and assistance at the courthouse for survivors who wish to obtain a restraining order. Additionally, the Volunteer Lawyers Project and Lewis and Clark Legal Clinic provide lawyers or third-year law students to assist petitioners in obtaining a contested order. Multnomah County Legal Aid's Family Law Center provides free attorneys to assist survivors in divorce, custody, visitation, and child support hearings. The County Court Family Law Department has five judges who handle cases involving restraining orders and the deferred sentencing program. These judges grant and vacate orders, hold hearings on contested cases, and determine violations of orders. They also hold 30-day and 6-month hearings on the status of deferred sentencing program participants. 84 Results and Impact Performance Measures In From Harassment to Homicide: UPDATE, 1994, the Committee made 38 recommendations for more effective intervention in domestic violence in the following categories. General Recommendations: standardize date collection; design and evaluate a model for a multidisciplinary response team; institutionalize training; provide stable funding to staff; promote a community intolerance for domestic violence; examine the relationship between domestic violence and substance abuse; assure an adequate response to domestic violence in gay and lesbian relationships; and encourage information sharing between child abuse prevention programs and committee members. Services for Victims: seek stable funding from local government, large corporations, and individual donors for existing shelters; increase shelter capacity and transitional housing; support efforts to recruit attorneys and law students to assist in civil remedies; develop stable funding for court advocates; and study the occurrence of crimes committed by domestic violence victims at the behest of their abusers and identify appropriate recourse. Intervention with Perpetrators: support the development of statewide standards and protocols for jailing, bail, release, sentencing, treatment, and probation for offenders; and develop a closer relationship between the County Sheriff's Office and the Committee. Law Enforcement: assist in comprehensive training for police officers and other law enforcement professionals, with a focus on officers making cases without participation of the victim; create a resource directory for use by all police officers; and monitor community policing. Civil Justice System: improve the justice system's response; provide judges, attorneys, and court personnel with up-to-date information inthe field; provide ongoing training for judges, attorneys, and court personnel; and locate adequate, private space for restraining order applicants and provide child care for their children. Criminal Justice System: train all criminal court attorneys and judges; develop batterer intervention programs and treatment and misdemeanor sentencing guidelines; and support communication between the District Attorney and Corrections. Corrections: increase and stabilize funding for deferred sentencing intensive supervision; train all corrections staff; develop standardized release criteria and sanctions; and implement vigilant supervision of all domestic violence offenders. 85 Implementation Problems and Successes The Committee was originally convened and staffed in 1987 as part of a federally funded pilot program through the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges to study the response of the court system to domestic violence. After the Committee's results were published in Family Violence: Improving Court Practice in 1989, it continued to meet and broadened its focus. One of its major successes since then has been the ongoing collaboration and communication among agencies which address domestic violence. In the last three years, there has been a significant increase in the number and kinds of agencies represented at the monthly meetings. Planning by individual agencies (especially public/governmental) is now done on a collaborative basis with the participation of victim advocates and other representatives from appropriate agencies. Barriers to collaboration and communication have been many, including disinterest by agencies or individuals in the agencies, historic difficulties or animosity between agencies, differing philosophies or modes of operation among agencies, lack of consistent funding for staffing, and maintaining interest and involvement over eight years. The problem of differing philosophies has been rectified through law suits against government agencies to contest old philosophies and the build-up of personal relationships among personnel from many agencies. The funding issue can be resolved by obtaining hard funding from private corporations and the community in addition to or in lieu of government grants. Isolation among organizations such as the District Attorney's Office and law enforcement magnified the importance of listening, a function provided by the Steering Committee. Successes and Accomplishments The Committee and its member agencies have had many successes in the 4 years since From Harassment to Homicide was published, including: In 1993 and 1994, the Committee and the City of Portland received grants totalling $384,000 from the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program to assist in the development of a coordinated response. Key components of these grants are: extensive training for police in the domestic violence unit; a bilingual, bicultural Outreach Advocate to assist the police domestic violence unit with the Hispanic community; one Parole/Probation Officer to handle intensive probation supervision of perpetrators; shelter for 250 women and their children; intensive services for victims who are involved with drugs, alcohol, and gangs; advocacy and referrals for victims to obtain restraining orders; and legal assistance for low-income victims. Almost 3,500 restraining orders were issued last year. From July 1994 to December 1994, this number increased by 19%. This is due in part to increased 86 advocacy and assistance received by women at the court house and to the activities of the police domestic violence unit. In 1993, the Portland Police founded a domestic violence unit. Last year, this unit reviewed over 5,000 reports of domestic violence made by \"street officers.\" They followed-up on 621 of these reports and gathered additional evidence for prosecution. They also assisted victims in obtaining restraining orders and other resources and enforced these orders. In some cases, they were able to increase the prosecution from a misdemeanor to a felony. A pilot study by a local research institute has shown a significant increase in victim-initiated prosecutions and applications for restraining orders when this unit has intervened. In the last three years, the District Attorney's Domestic Violence Unit has almost doubled the number of domestic violence cases prosecuted annually. They have a \"no drop\" policy in felony cases and in certain misdemeanor cases, even if the victim can not participate in the trial. Last year, this unit reviewed over 3,000 cases and prosecuted approximately one-third of these cases. The Committee has been instrumental in obtaining $324,000 annually from City funds for shelter services and $100,000 annually from County general funds for services to children of domestic violence victims. Community Corrections has developed a domestic violence unit which provides intensive supervision to offenders in the deferred sentencing program. This unit has provided supervision to 380 offenders in the last year and a half. Approximately half of those who have left the program have successfully completed it. They have begun to plan the development of an enlarged domestic violence unit which would provide supervision for all domestic violence offenders. Additional successes have included the creation of a standardized policy for release from jail; funding for full-time staff for the Committee; increased legal advocacy for victims in civil actions; endorsement and participation in community fundraising and public awareness campaigns; publication of From Harassment to Homicide: UPDATE; increasing evaluation of the coordinated response through a local research institute; collaboration with and assistance in founding a statewide council on domestic violence; improved data collection, compilation, and release of annual statistics about domestic violence; formation of a committee to study response to serious and repeat offenders; and testimony at hearings and to civic groups. Prospects for Replication Because the Committee is a voluntary association, its success has depended on leadership and initiative by key individuals and on community concern about domestic violence. The 87 Committee has no enforcement power, but has been able to rely on the use of information sharing, influence and mutual support, and peer pressure to obtain its accomplishments. Replication of a collaborative approach such as this has several key components. The participation of victim advocates and/or formerly battered women on the Committee is essential for the development of an effective response. Chiquita Rollins, Domestic Violence Coordinator for the project has said that \"one of the most importan t things that you can do is have victim advocates or victims themselves sit at the table with you. It's so important for law enforcement people, for the shelters, for the prosecutors, (for) corrections, for people at large to hear victims' perspectives of this -- what works and what doesn't work.\" Support by the Courts or by individual judges is critical in bringing additional players to the table and in carrying out the recommendations of the Committee. Fluidity of structure has allowed the Committee to respond to various issues quickly when they ari. \"se by forming ad-hoc sub-committees and by involving new partners or agencies easily. For this to be successful, everyone must come to the table as equals.

Statement of the Problem Until recently, most prosecutors' offices lacked specialized divisions for family violence. Cases were typically assigned to a generic pool of lawyers, often with little expertise or interest in the complex dynamics and legal issues presented by child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse, and adult sexual assault. In the last few years the need for specialization has been acknowledged. Many prosecution offices nationwide now have discrete units, each dedicated to a separate specialty. Each unit typically has its own staff, supervisors, protocols, and training. While specialization has undoubtedly increased conviction rates and enhanced victim sensitivity, the separation of family violence into categories of child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse, and adult sexual assault encourages tunnel vision. To focus on the criminal act while ignoring the familial environment in which it occurs is often to iniss the forest for the trees. Inadvertently, this kind of prosecutorial specialization may leave at risk those who are most vulnerable to harm. This problem can be illustrated in the scenario where the father intends to assault the mother but inadvertently injures their child in his path. If the child suffers injury, this case is characterized as child abuse and assigned to the Child Abuse Unit. The father's intended assault on the mother goes unaddressed, and a long history of escalating violence is left unexplored. If at the child abuse trial the mother refuses to testify against the father, she is likely to be condemned as unprotective of her child and possibly subjected to criminal penalties for her refusal to testify. In addition, the mother's failure to cooperate with the prosecution may trigger the involvement of the child welfare system. If the caseworker has no understanding of the dynamics of domestic violence and views child protection as attending exclusively to the child while ignoring the mother's safety concerns, both mother and child may be more harmed than helped by this well-meaning but uninformed response. The prosecution may win the case but leave the victims, both identified and hidden, in a more vulnerable situation than before criminal justice involvement. Winning in cases of family violence must be redefined. The goal must be the protection of both adults and children in the household. In response to this problem, the Philadelphia District Attorney's 'Office merged the Child Abuse Unit with the Domestic Violence Unit to become the Family Violence Unit in 1992. Unit members became aware of how frequently adult sexual assault occurs between intimate partners, sexual violence often being a manifestation of domestic abuse. Many sexual assault survivors need the services of both rape crisis counselors and domestic violence advocates. Prosecutors who handle sexual assault cases must be educated that a sex crime may be the tip 89 of the iceberg in a sea of long-standing violence. With the observation that when more support services are offered and staff is more educated, more women actively cooperate with the prosecution, the Unit decided to take cases of adult sexual assault. Goals and Objectives The goal of the program is to change the vision of the criminal justice system with regard to domestic violence from an adversarial system to a medical model. Program Components The Family Violence and Sexual Assault Unit staff includes 15 prosecutors and three victim advocates (one of whom is Spanish bilingual and bicultural ) who assist with information and support services before, during and after a criminal case. Philadelphia Police Officers do follow-up investigations and safeguard victims from possible intimidation or retaliation by swift arrest if victims are threatened or harassed because of their participation in prosecution. The Unit encourages multidisciplinary coordination and cooperation and works closely with domestic violence, rape crisis, and child advocates. College and law students also volunteer their efforts. In addition, established mental health professionals including a family therapist and a forensic child psychiatrist volunteer their time for case consultation when requested. Domestic Abuse Response Team (DJI.R.T.) It is within the context of this comprehensive approach to prosecuting family violence and sexual assault that the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office adopted a strategy of prevention. Utilizing Federal funding that was designated for crime prevention services, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office created the Domestic Abuse Response Team (D.A.R.T.), an approach to prosecuting domestic violence which focuses its attention on those cases traditionally awarded the least prosecutorial attention: misdemeanors. The vision was that a centralized, coordinated, multidisciplinary response to domestic violence at its earliest criminal manifestation would preempt its escalation into a more serious crime. The D.A.R.T. program targets misdemeanor cases where there are risk factors associated with escalating violence. These factors include a defendant's history of assaultive behavior, substance abuse, threats of homicide or suicide, threats with a gun or knife, obsessive stalking behavior, violence where there are young children in the home, and where there are ongoing child custody problems l~etween the defendant and the complainant. According to Mimi Rose, Chief of the Family Violence and Sexual Assault Unit, \"Multidisciplinary work is extremely important. The prosecutor in our system is the hammer, but if all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail, and it's not, and you must work with other people.\" To that end, the D.A.R.T. team consists of two prosecutors who 90 became part of the team voluntarily, a victim advocate, and a domestic violence counselor from a counseling agency who is housed within the prosecutor's office. D.A.R.T. members select domestic violence cases meeting program criteria. The complainants are contacted by the victim advocate within 24 hours. The victim advocate provides information about the court process, and the D.A.R.T. assists the complainant with safety concerns and counseling referrals for herself and the children when requested. The team's theory is \"If you keep an open door, people will come when they're ready to come.\" The D.A.R.T. prosecutor reviews the case for any additional evidence collection or investigation that may be necessary such as 911 radio tapes, photographs, additional witnesses, or hospital records. At trial the complainant is accompanied by the victim advocate. If the case is continued, the same D.A.R.T. prosecutor remains with the case at each listing until disposition. Complainants are invited to attend support groups and the new witness workshop program which provides information about a trial in a courtroom setting. Children in these situations may receive a separate advocate or attorney to ensure that their needs are being met. At the conclusion of a case, the D.A.R.T. team has follow-up contact with the complainant by phone or mail to see if there are any continuing problems with which it can assist. During weekly case conferences, D.A.R.T. members meet to discuss both case-specific and systemic issues which need collaborative intervention. Results and Impact Performance Measures Some of the measures of success for this program are the recidivism rate of domestic violence offenders, victim satisfaction with the program, and life improvement of the victim. Implementation Problems and Successes At the beginning of this program, there was not enough leadership. The criminal justice system was apathetic to changing its role from a law enforcement to a more social work oriented focus. People with a vision need to step up from the start to energize the other players, including prosecutors and law enforcement officers, and begin to reprioritize cases and redefine winning. The D.A.R.T. program experienced an initial reluctance on the part of the police to cooperate with the new outlook towards domestic violence. Lawsuits as well as directives from the Chief of Police have helped to change their attitudes. A big selling point for the program has been the inherent involvement of children. Once the officers understood the impact on children, they were more willing to help. 91 Successes and Accomplishments The program has served 400 people since its inception. It has created a ripple effect in that the police departments want domestic violence units in all of the districts in the State based on the Philadelphia model. The attitude of police officers toward victims has changed in Philadelphia. Police are listening to victims and working with their requests. Prospects for Replication This program can be easily replicated because it only needs one individual to be a family violence specialist to complete the unit which consists of prosecutors and police officers who are already in place. This specialist must work with the prosecutor but not for the prosecutor to maintain victim confidentiality and trust. All staff on the project must redefine winning from making convictions to making people safer. Cross training by outside sources of criminal justice professionals is important to the success of this program in order to redefine the roles of prosecutors and law enforcement professionals. Choosing police officers who want to do this type of work and training them appropriately is also very important to setting up a D.A.R.T. program. Program staff must work with the victim to obtain what she wants out of the situation. For example, she may want the abuser to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings instead of going to jail. The trust and confidence of the victim are extremely important to the success of the case, and criminal justice professionals must emphasize that they are there to help her in any way that they are able. In addition, the problems of mothers and children cannot be separated into different issues; protecting the mother is protecting the child. For success, program staff must speak to the community about domestic violence to make the issue more visible. The Philadelphia Police Department modeled the D.A.R.T. team in the form of a domestic violence unit in all of Philadelphia's districts.

The numbers were growing fast, especially because of the serious offenders. There was also a large number of minors entering the system for the first time charged with Class I and II offenses. The Juvenile Justice System was aware of the relation between drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. The communities demanded more action. In 1986 a new law for minors, Law 88, was enacted. In this new law, diversion was statutorily introduced to attend to the preventive and rehabilitative aspects of criminal justice. However, the community was not very enthusiastic since there were few diversion programs sponsored by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and these programs were not very successful. The Juvenile Administration facilities were and still are crowded. They lacked personnel, rehabilitation services, and other necessities. The social and economic costs were extremely high for the government. The effectiveness of the agencies' services to the minors was hampered by low morale, lack of responsibility, lack of funding, and lack of community .... support and awareness. The Puerto Rico Justice Department decided to establish a well structured and organized Diversion Program. The Diversion Program was implemented in Puerto Rico to comply with Law 88, creating the Special Prosecutors for Minors and other support personnel. This Law guarantees minors of both sexes, 17 years of age and under, who have been charged with committing a Class I offense or a first Class II offense, that they can be granted a diversion into a public or private rehabilitation program in the community through a formal contract. Through this program, certain minors can be prevented from getting into the formal prosecution system, and those who have already entered do not become recidivists. Goals and Objectives The first goal of the Diversion Program is to divert minors from the formal adjudication process in the courts and to provide follow-up to minors to prevent and control juvenile delinquency in Puerto Rico. 93 The objectives to reach this goal are: to establish the program island-wide in each of the thirteen (13) Judicial Districts; to disseminate information about the program to all law enforcement agencies and other related agencies to explain how diversion can be used to prevent juvenile delinquency; to divert minors from the judicial process into public and private rehabilitation programs; and to establish an evaluation system for individuals being referred, evaluated, recommended, placed, and released due to compliance or non-compliance with the program. The second goal is to help minors fulfill their diversion contracts' conditions and to develop social and emotional skills to prevent recidivism. The objectives designed for reaching this goal are: to follow-up diverted minors; to design a program to help parents or legal guardians get acquainted with their responsibilities and roles with regard to child and adolescent care; to enroll diverted minors and their parents or legal guardians in a fourteen-hour comprehensive workshop discussing the areas of resolving problems, becoming a functioning family, experiencing being a victim, clarifying family roles, and other topics; to promot e \"stay out\" and \"say no to drugs;\" and to furnish progress reports and attend review hearings in court. Program Components Services The Diversion Program provides multiple services for minors granted diversion into a public or private rehabilitation program in the community. After probable cause is determined by a judge, the minor's lawyer, parent, or the juvenile prosecutor requests that the minor be considered for diversion. The juvenile prosecutor then makes a referral to the program. 94 The referred candidate is evaluated by the social worker in coordination with a special investigator. They gather information from court records and other human service professionals who have provided him services. An appointment for an interview with the minor and his parents or legal guardian is required. The evaluation process also includes a community visit to discover the minor's relations with school personnel, community members, neighbors, peers, and others. At the same time, the social worker looks for community resources that are available as possible service providers. All the information about the minor is gathered into a social evaluation report and delivered to the juvenile prosecutor with the social worker's recommendation. If it is favorable and the juvenile prosecutor agrees, the social worker schedules an appointment with the minor and his/her parent or legal guardian, the defense attorney, the receptor agency representative, and the juvenile prosecutor to discuss the case and the diversion contract. If the conditions are accepted, the diversion contract is signed and submitted by a motion to the judge. The contract is very specific about the minor's and parents' or guardian's responsibilities as well as the agency that will provide the rehabilitation services. If the judge approves diversion for the minor, he imposes the diversion terms and sets the date for the next hearing review. The social worker then prepares and submits an official referral to the receptor agency. Once the minor is placed, the social worker or the agent follow-up his conduct twice a month. If there is a problem, new planning or modification of the contract terms may take place. The receptor agency submits progress reports quarterly or upon request. The agency representative also attends the review hearing and gives recommendations to keep the minor diverted or to end the contract. In the meantime, lab tests on a regular basis determine if any illegal substances have been used. If the test is positive for drug use, a case discussion takes place with the same group that participated in setting up the diversion contract, and the rehabilitation plan is modified. If the youth continues to use drugs, it is recommended to the juvenile prosecutor that diversion cease, and the minor returns to the formal adjudicative process. If he/she finishes the diversion contract conditions, all charges are dismissed. If the youth's parents or guardian fail to support the child in the program (i.e., fail to take them to scheduled appointments), they can be brought up on neglect or abuse charges. The diversion program can be extended if necessary to help the child. The Program also provides an intensive and comprehensive fourteen-hour seminar divided into six or seven workshops for the minors and their parents or legal guardian. A curriculum as well as a Rules and Procedures Manual were designed and reviewed to implement the seminars. At the completion of the workshops, a graduation ceremony takes place with special guests invited such as distinguished athletes, singers, musicians, government officials, and the Attorney General. A follow-up program was designed to operate twice a month focusing on diverted minors remaining active at the end of the fiscal year. The most recent component is the Summer Camp for the diverted minors, their parents or legal guardians, and siblings. 95 Staff The Minors and Family Affairs Office Director is responsible for the overall functioning of the program. The juvenile prosecutors in charge are responsible for the overall functioning of the program at their offices (13 District Offices). The Program Director - Social Worker Specialist coordinates the programmatic and administrative activities of the Program, providing technical assistance and specialized training to the staff, evaluation, and monitoring of the program. The program team is composed of key personnel including the juvenile prosecutors, social workers, special agents, and secretaries ateach district office. The Program Director trains the program personnel. Sometimes the budget allows for training on the mainland. Results and Impact Performance Measures The performance of the Diversion Program is measured in several ways. First, it is measured by the monthly statistic report which shows the numbei\" of minors referred, evaluated, recommended, placed, and released due to compliance or non-compliance with conditions. The Program Director gathers all of the statistical reports and tallies them and conducts administrative and programmatic monitoring, which identifies problems and needs. In addition, a lengthy study was carried out in order to determine the effectiveness of the prpgram. Another way the program is measured is through auditing and monitoring by Federal Funds Division personnel. Implementation Problems and Successes The Diversion Program experienced some difficulties in the implementation process. As stated before, in Puerto Rico there were approximately 18 diversion programs which failed to accomplish their goals due to lack of structure, little or no follow-up, and funding problems. The community was demanding more action, and the law enforcement agencies related to Juvenile Justice were suffering from lack of enthusiasm with regard to diversion. Program administrators had to solicit everyone's support and convince them to give the Diversion Program an opportunity to work. Funding was received from a federal grant. Successes and Accomplishments The Diversion Program has been very successful. The table shows the program's performance from fiscal year 1989-90 through fiscal year 1993-94. 96 TABLE I DISTRIBUTION OF MINORS DIVERTED INTO THE PROGRAM - BOTH SUCCESSFUL AND NOT SUCCESSFUL - FISCAL YEARS 1989-90 TO 1993-94 Year 1989-90 1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 Grand Total Balance from Previous Year 0 75 Youth Diverted to the Program 159 446 Youth Placed into Agencies 159 521 Youth Finishing the Program (Successful or Not) 56 204 Youth Completing the Contract 56 156 Youth Not Completing the Contracts 0 48 306 460 766 425 347 78 337 389 726 414 357 57 315 423 738 381 315 66 2,910 1,231 1,780 249 1,877 1,033 The evaluation report submitted by the Division of Federal Funds stated that \"during this period of operation, the program has attained a 100% performance rate as to the goals and objectives established.\" The Diversion Program has gained great support from the Attorney General's Office, lawyers, judges, community groups, and private organizations such as religious groups. The program's greatest achievement was to be recognized by the State government as a very important and needed programl adopting it as a permanent State program after Federal funding ended in 1994. The program has also reported the following accomplishments: in Fiscal year 1989-90, it was established in 8 out of 12 district offices; it has now expanded to all 12 offices; other government agencies have been opening service programs for diverted minors, such as the Voluntary Corps of Puerto Rico; the awareness program has had an overwhelming impact among community members as evidenced by their positive responses to surveys and the high referral rate of the program from parents who have been involved; to enhance its communication, the program produces printed brochures, radio and television appearances, conferences conducted by professionals, town meetings, and workshops; the program provides a 14-hour workshop for juvenile divertees and their parents or legal guardians; 97 0 the substance abuse tests for juveniles attending the program are conducted by the Forensic Sciences Lab Institute; staffing has grown from 18 to 32 employees; in 1994 a Summer Camp Program Pilot Project which includes parental participation was established which will be expanded island wide for 1995; and the program's clients are 97% drug free. Prospects for Replication To replicate the program, a Minors Law which includes a diversion mechanism is needed. Community support and cooperation from the Juvenile Justice System and Law Enforcement Agencies are also needed. Judges involved with the program must be told to be tough with the receptor agencies to make sure that the youth in the program are receiving adequate services. Since the program depends upon the availability of services in private and government agencies, institutions, or programs, an intensive interagency relationship is needed. The program has strong potential for replication because it meets common needs.

With less than 50 local and county law enforcement agents to cover the 696 square miles of this vast county, Fairfield is in a vulnerable position for drug-related crimes, domestic violence, and homicides. With high unemployment and few positive alternative activities for youth, violent youth offenders are emerging at a dramatic rate. Like many rural areas, this county has no community centers or other sites to serve as a community focal point. Families living below the poverty level and headed by females total 47% of the population, and the unemployment rate, the third highest in South Carolina, has risen to a dismal 9.5%. According to the Sheriff's Office, an increased number of drug dealers and other criminal elements have moved to Fairfield County in the past several years to prey on the county's youth. Since 33% of the total population of the county is under 18 and law enforcement agents are stretched to cover the entire county, the need for pro-active delinquency prevention programs has become a top priority. Serving the 1 lth largest school district in South Carolina with an enrollment of 4,250 students, the Sheriff's Office experiences first-hand the results of delinquency, adolescent gangs, and youth violence. Also, this district has the l lth highest dropout rate in South Carolina for grades 9 through 12. Realizing that middle school is such a pivotal time for youth and that research shows that many students drop out of school during the summer between 8th and 9th grades, the Sheriff's Office remains committed to targeting 8th graders, especially those from environments where violence or incarceration has been \"the norm\" or those with indications of other high risk factors. As demonstrated by the Sheriff's Success Academy (SSA), the Sheriff's Office is committed to pro-active, collaborative delinquency prevention programs as a deterrent to youth violence and crime. 99 Goals and Objectives The primary goals of the Sheriff's Success Academy are: (1) to provide a unique environment in which adolescents can learn and practice skills and attitudes that will help to prevent violent and delinquent behavior and safely participate in positive risk-taking activities; and (2) to provide opportunities for positive interaction with law enforcement officers and other adult role models who care about their futures. The following objectives were established to meet the overall goals: to engage students in a process where they will have increased involvement, interaction, and ownership in the sessions while learning to trust and respect each other, thereby helping them to grow into more responsible, contributing individuals; to engage parents/significant others in a process that strengthens the family unit and emphasizes social capital and giving back to the community; to expose students to the real world of law enforcement by working closely with individual officers as mentors and role models; to utilize the ideas, resources, and volunteers from the total community through collaboration and mutual respect; to expose students to a wide array of career options available to them, so they have a greater sense of hope and motivation and can make good choices about their futures; and to promote public awareness of the SSA and the old African proverb, \"It takes a whole village to raise a child.\" Program Components Currently, the Sheriff's Success Academy is in its second year, although the new SSA class has only been meeting since December 1994. All of the major components are up and running, but the program is constantly being readjusted and improved. YOUTH The criteria for being accepted into the SSA are that the student is not in trouble with the law; shows symptoms of behavior problems in school; has attendance problems at school; has been held back a grade for one or more years; and has no support at home. Selections for the program are made through the help of teachers and guidance counselors. Twenty-five eighth grade students from three schools (one private and two public) voluntarily participate in the SSA. These youth represent a diverse group and have quickly begun to bond. Their willingness to take positive risks is rapidly increasing. Ten of last year's SSA graduates have been selected and trained as Team Leaders and are involved as positive role models and mentors, while continuing to develop their own skills and attitudes. 100 In addition to building a safe, caring community, the SSA incorporates periodic student incentives (e.g., t-shirts, rewards, and a formal graduation ceremony) that enhance pride, build a sense of \"family,\" and acknowledge to the community that SSA members are junior ambassadors to the Sheriff's Office. Transportation and all expenses are covered for all SSA participants. The goal is to maintain a consistent core of twenty-five eighth graders and ten Team Leaders. PROGRAMS/SESSIONS The SSA sessions (comprised of 12 to 15 exciting, meaningful Saturday, weekend, and after-school events) provide opportunities for the SSA students to be exposed to experiences that motivate and broaden their horizons and enhance their self-concepts. ,These sessions focus on: Trust, Respect, Communications, Team-Building, Conflict Resolution, Cultural Sensitivity, Law-Related Education, Career Awareness, and The Arts. As students proceed through the program, they begin to integrate these new skills, behaviors, and attitudes that act as buffers against the risk factors and negative influences in their lives. PARENTS The SSA established an active Parent Support Network that meets on a regular basis and offers guidance and mutual nurturing to the parents and significant others of the SSA members. A Parent Speak-Out is held for the new parents. Here they identify youth issues of concern to them and go through an interactive process to determine appropriate solutions to these problems. Also, each year at least one Parent/Youth/Community Project is required that involves family members working together with volunteers to give back to the community. Last year the parents and SSA members worked diligently with the deputies and other community groups to set up and sponsor the annual Sheriffs Family Day. This is an event that draws at least 1,500 families from across the county to become acquainted with law enforcement officers and services. Parents have offered their services to transport students and/or parents when necessary and to serve as \"wait staff' at the formal dinners and other events. A group of parents from the first SSA class is continuing to chaperon at sessions and to encourage some of the new parents, as well. The goal is to engage 75% of the parents in SSA activities and 95% in graduation. LAW ENFORCEMENT The SSA recruits and trains deputies and other law enforcement officers as mentors and chaperons. Having these individuals play an active role is a strong deterrent to youth violence and crime. Some of the officers prefer to be assigned to an SSA student as a mentor who meets with the youth on a regular basis. The students thoroughly enjoy having the Sheriff and officers participate in the activities. Whomever attends a session becomes part of the extended family, which solves problems, makes group decisions, shares, and supports each other. The goal is to actively involve 25 officers. Another aspect of the SSA involves tours and discussions with officers, personnel, and inmates at the county detention center, the State Department of Juvenile Justice, and other law 101 enforcement agencies. Such visits create a \"reality check\" into the criminal justice system as a legal process and as an environment for a multitude of careers. COMMUNITY COLLABORATION The program is built upon an active Citizens Advisory Committee which meets on a monthly basis. This group of twenty-five represents a cross-section of the community. They provide input and resources for the SSA. With the help of these individuals, physical facilities for the monthly sessions are reserved, and after-school tours of their plants are scheduled. Many of the CAC members also serve as chaperons for events. A Mentoring Sub-Committee oversees the process of assigning caring, positive adult role models to SSA students as a complementary support system to the home environment. Realizing that effective mentoring can utilize a variety of procedures, the volunteers on the subcommittee offer interested officers and adults two options: to be matched with a specific SSA member with whom they will meet off a regular basis or to attend a series of four or more sessions and interact positively with all of the SSA members. In either situation, the students are afforded the opportunity to get to know officers and other adults as positive influences in their lives. Fliers have been mailed county-wide to 122 churches of all races and creeds seeking 35 interested individuals as new mentors. Follow-up phone calls will be made. Several clergy have offered their facilities and services to the program. In addition, some of the local businesses and industries, including Mack Trucks, Inc. and Hon Corporation, have centered employee projects on the SSA, including mentoring and sponsoring trips to the Columbia Bombers baseball games. Some employees have even collected money to make donations. The goal is to actively engage more than 100 community volunteers with the SSA. CAREER AWARENESS Since the majority of the students have limited access to travel outside of the county, it is necessary to take advantage of every opportunity afforded the SSA to help the youth gain a realistic picture of potential jobs available locally and statewide. Planning sessions at different facilities around the county and touring various types of work sites demonstrates to the youth a world of possibilities. This summer the SSA will be utilizing the local business community in a Shadowing Program to expand SSA students' career awareness. The Fairfield County Rotary Club has agreed to participate in this effective approach to exposing students to careers in which they have interests or talents. Members of the Fairfield Chamber of Commerce, individual business owners, and county agencies will also be invited to host a student for a Shadowing experience. The goal is to schedule a minimum of 35 visits for interested students. MEDIA AND PUBLIC AWARENESS The SSA ensures that local and State media provides meaningful and accurate coverage of the program and the commitment by the Sheriff's Office 102 and the community. Whenever possible the SSA publicly recognizes SSA student and volunteer accomplishments. The goal is to schedule media coverage or public presentations once a month. Results and Impact Performance Measures One measure of the program's success is the number of students who receive an improvement award or academic award at school by the end of the academic year. Implementation Problems and Successes The most difficult part of establishing the Sheriff's Success Academy was that the first year there was only ~one staff person. Having adequate personnel is essential to the project's ability to positively impact every participant. Now that the program has an additional part-time staff member, it has made a difference in the ability to have regul~ contacts with students and parents and to maintain improved records and data. Historically, in Fairfield County there has been a lack of parent involvement in any program. Motivating SSA parents was no easy task, but nurturing and strengthening the small group of devoted parents became a priority of the project. These determined individuals remain a focal point for parents. Another problem is that there are few officers in the county spread over a large geographic area. It is difficult to depend on their attendance at functions. It is also hard to evaluate the officers' performance with regard to the program because their attendance is so erratic. Successes and Accomplishments On September 27, 1994, twenty 9th grade students graduated from the first Sheriff's Success Academy. Ten of those youth have been through additional leadership training and are now serving as SSA Team Leaders for the second SSA class, which meets from December 1994 to September 1995. This year's group currently has signed up 35 students, and a core of 25 is anticipated to attend consistently. During the course of the program, students have actively participated in the following sessions: Orientation; Law-Related Education; Conflict Resolution; Tours including Department of Juvenile Justice, Fairfield County Detention Center, Mack Trucks, WIS-TV, WWDM Radio; Columbia Bombers Triple A Baseball Game; Formal Dinners; Ropes Course (outdoor adventure); Overnight Weekend Experiences; Simulated Disaster Drill for Fairfield County; Original Adventure Days created for the SSA, i.e., Survival Day, Mystery of the Snoop Doggy Dog QT, Space Odyssey, and Luncheon with Kimberly Aiken of Columbia, SC, Miss America 103 1994; The Arts, writing and directing a play with our own set design; and The Sheriff's Family Day. Not only have. improvements occurred in attitudes, behaviors, willingness to take positive risks, and increased responsibilities, but also there have been marked changes in physical demeanor, vocabulary, respect, and a great amount of healthy laughter and smiles. The best measures of success are the beaming faces and genuine hugs from caring participants diverse in race, gender, age, size, and backgrounds. A survey of the pai'ticipating students at the end of the academic year showed that the kids had connected with better friends, had better grades, and felt better about their community. At the first graduation, six students had volunteered to prepare testimonials and present them to an audience of nearly 100 people, including families, friends, and dignitaries. Another eight students presented an original play for which the entire class created the scenery and wrote the music, song, and script. Six parents from the previous year are actively mentoring and volunteering to assist wherever they are needed. This year's class has a core of parents who are just beginning to reach out to others and renew the process of a parent network. Besides having several articles published in the local and State newspapers, an outstanding segment was recently aired by the local CBS affiliate, and both the NBC and ABC affiliates are scheduled to cover the \"lock-in\" weekend at Sesquicentennial. State Park in March. A comprehensive article on the SSA has appeared in the South Carolina Sheriff's Magazine, the Lake Wateree Home Owners Association (WHOA) newsletter, and the State Association of Crime Prevention Officers (SACPO) newsletter. The National Sheriff's Association has also requested an article for publication in their next quarterly magazine that reaches thousands of sheriffs and other leaders in law enforcement. Norma M. Higgins, Director of the Sheriff's Success Academy, pointed out another success of the program. \"The Department of Juvenile Justice has told us that not one of ... (the) children who has started with our program has ever been seen in their office since the program began a little over one year ago. As embryonic as these statistics are, it's a good beginning.\" Prospects for Replication Initially, when the SSA was created, it was developed with the idea that it should be easily transported to any community in the country. If it can be successful in a poor rural county with few resources and a volunteer base already overloaded with other community projects, then the SSA can be successfully replicated anywhere. The major ingredient is identifying a director or chairperson with creativity, energy, and vision to bring the collaborative process together. When focusing on the Old African Proverb, \"It takes a whole village to raise a child,\" support and resources can be developed throughout all segments of the community. 104 Since the SSA is not a school-based program, any law enforcement agency or other determined entity could coordinate such an academy. The structure and guidelines are in place. However, since this program has no limits on creativity and scope, the possibilities are vast and exciting. Contact Information Norma M. Higgins Director Sheriff's Success Academy Fairfield County Sheriff's Office SC 29180 (803) 387 Winnsboro, SC 29180 (803) 635-5038 (803) 635-3325 fax 105 Tennessee Weed & Seed Statement of the Problem According to studies and surveys conducted by the Planning Section of the Chattanooga Police Department, drug trafficking and the crime associated with illegal narcotics were ranked as the greatest concerns among residents in public housing, for several reasons. First, street level drug dealers provided a role model for youngsters in public housing complexes. The drug dealers frequently hired youngsters to hold the stash of illegal drugs or to act as look,outs. The youngsters were often impressed with the elaborate material goods such as cars, jewelry, and expensive clothes and shoes worn by criminals. Second, public housing offered a convenient avenue of escape from police. The criminals knew that they could run from police officers on foot and stand a good chance of becoming lost in the crowd or hiding in the apartment of a sympathetic resident. Statistics show that most persons arrested for drug violations in public housing are non-residents. Another reason criminals prefer to operate from public housing complexes is because of the dense concentration of people. The advantages for criminals are that higher levels of traffic are not as conspicuous to police and residents and that residents of an apartment complex are less likely to complain about the increased flow of traffic. Previous efforts to address drug trafficking in public housing did not alleviate the problem. This is demonstrated by the number of drug arrests by police in the targeted complexes. Some of these efforts included undercover drug operations, street level reverses which target users in order to promote demand reduction, and Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) programs for youngsters in the complexes. During the period before the Weed & Seed program, 485 persons were arrested and charged with a total of 546 drug violations in the targeted complexes. According to safety surveys conducted by the local housing authority, many residents reported that they did not feel safe in their apartment or in the complex and some residents reported that they slept on the floor of their apartment for fear of being struck by a stray bullet. In the Harriet Tubman development, nine murders occurred during calendar year 1992. A recreational facility was constructed on this site and was operated for several years by the City~ Department of Recreation. Due to safety concerns several years ago, the facility was closed. Goals and Objectives The goals of the program were to reduce the incidence of drug trafficking and the crime associated with drug sales and usage in the targeted complexes. It was hoped that, as a result 106 of the reduced drug activity, the public housing complexes could be a safer, more peaceful place to live. Another goal of the program was to provide residents the opportunity to become responsible for their communities, identify goals, and develop strategies to achieve those goals. In addition to safety issues, a common concern of residents was their inability to obtain sufficient employment to move from public housing and assistance and become self-sufficient. Some residents did not graduate from high school. Many wanted to go to college in order to obtain or improve marketable job skills. The focus of the program is two-fold. The weed portion involves intensive enforcement to address crime and safety concerns in the complexes. The seed portion is designed to organize the residents' associations of the targeted communities, the management of public housing, and law enforcement into cohesive groups. These groups are responsible for identifying problems encountered by the residents of their respective complexes, identifying available resources, and developing strategies which utilize the available resources to address the issues raised. Program Components Through a partnership between the police, public housing residents, and the public housing authority, certain needy developments were targeted for the Weed & Seed program. The first step of program implementation was carried out by meeting with residents and management to identify safety concerns in the targeted complexes. Intensive enforcement was provided by Utilizing police officers on an overtime basis in conjunction with police officers assigned to the Public Housing section of Chattanooga. At the same time, management of public housing began a graffiti eradication campaign in the targeted complexes. Program administrators requested and received assistance in cleaning complex grounds from the Community Corrections program. Police officers maintained a high visibility to prevent the return of open criminal activity in the complexes. Residents stated that a major safety problem in the complexes was caused by non-residents selling drugs in the developments. Signs were posted to warn trespassers that they would be arrested. A stringent lease enforcement program was adopted to identify problem occupants and remove them from the complexes. Upon recommendation of the residents and police, a policy of conducting background investigations of applicants to public housing was instituted by the housing authority in order to prevent problems. 107 Results and Impact Performance Measures The program anticipated a reduction in the incidence of drug arrests and charges in the targeted complexes. Another desired result was to instill pride in residents so they would no longer tolerate crime in their communities, banding together to attack the problem. Implementation Problems and Successes The program was received by the targeted complexes in a variety of ways. The notion of weed enforcement was resisted by some residents. Shortly after implementation, a relative of their residents' association president was arrested on the site for selling narcotics. The program efforts were better received after a new president was elected. Residents in other communities were well organized and were able to accomplish a great deal with the assistance of the program. One development is currently undergoing an extensive modernization program, and the resident~ association will require restructuring at the conclusion of the modernization. Successes and Accomplishments Initially, success was measured by drug arrests and decreases in crime and drug activity. Drug trafficking was moved away from the complex. To truly measure success, a standard to measure quality-of-life was needed. A survey of residents, asking them if they felt safer, was relied on more than crime statistics. The residents are more satisfied now. They call the police more often, indicating greater confidence in law enforcement services. There are now fewer calls and incidents to report than at the beginning of the program, yet officers are often in the projects walking their beats anyway. Relationships with other agencies improved, particularly with the housing authority. Now residents and the police meet with the housing authority on a weekly basis. Programs and the coordination of the delivery of services are discussed. The communities recruited help from Chattanooga State Community ' College and the Private Industry Council. Learning centers were established in the two larger targeted complexes to help residents obtain their General Equivalency Diploma. An extension campus of Chattanooga State Community College was established on site at the Harriet Tubman development, where residents are now able to take classes for college credit. Residents of the Maurice Poss Homes organized a jobs fair and worked to remove drive-up crack sales in their community. This was accomplished by installing a playground in the center of the development, making through traffic an impossibility. Substance abuse treatment is provided on site at the Maurice Poss Homes and the Spencer McCallie Homes developments. Some younger residents of Emma Wheeler Homes participate in the Youth Bicycle Club. Members of the College Hill Courts have banded together with other residents in the neighborhood to 108 form the Westside Redevelopment Corporation. This group has spearheaded a proposal to achieve site recognition by the national office of Weed & Seed. The major success of Weed & Seed in Chattanooga has been the changing relationship of the police with the residents. In the beginning, the Homes were a \"no go\" zone for the police. Police went in as a group and left quickly after an arrest. The program was initiated with new, unbiased recruits. Most of those recruits still work in the Homes after more than two years. The number of officers has grown from 10 to 17, and their role has changed. They act as role models and mentors for children. Prospects for Replication The prospect for replication of this program in other sites or other cities is good. The premise of the program is simple. First, allow the residents to identify their community concerns. Traditionally, law enforcement and news media have determined the needs of the community. Second, employ sufficient police resources to address safety concerns and maintain a visible presence. Third, look beyond the membership of a few groups or organizations for resources to help solve problems. Local businesses or other branches of government often are able and willing to provide help in addressing community concerns.

Within Memphis and Shelby Counties over the past seven years, there has been a dramatic increase in cocaine use, arrests, convictions, and seizures. There were only 65 juveniles arrested for cocaine-related offenses in Shelby County Juvenile Court in 1986. With the introduction of \"crack cocaine,\" arrests increased 1,200% to over 900 in 1992. In 1986, the Twenty-Eighth Judicial District, primarily a rural area, reported only six cocaine arrests. In 1992, 154 people were arrested for cocaine-related offenses. In 1988, in the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District marijuana cases outnumbered cocaine cases. There were no firearms involved in any of the arrests. By contrast, in 1992, cocaine arrests outnumbered marijuana cases, and firearms, especially handguns, were prevalent when arrests were made. DEA and local rural investigators have reported a marked increase in the presence of crack cocaine in rural areas. Prior to its arrival, drug prosecutions in rural areas were primarily for marijuana. Rural law enforcement officials were hindered because of their unfamiliarity with methods to conduct investigations and prosecutions of street dealers. Rural officers had few or no common links to the cities. Communication and interest from the big counties to the rural areas was almost non-existent. There was a need to develop cooperation to determine who, where, and how drugs and associated violent crimes were being moved into the West Tennessee rural areas. After this information brought about arrests, prosecution needed to be performed by prosecutors familiar with all facets of prosecution of drug offenses and gang violence. Accessible training of rural officers needed to be offered. Goals and Objectives One goal was to institute a mechanism for the judicial districts to target mid and upper-level manufacturers, dealers, and distributors for prosecution under Federal and State statutes. The program also sought to develop an officer-exchange program between the large cities and counties in the judicial districts to allow rural law enforcement agencies to conduct undercover operations. Finally, the program provides a forum for the sharing ofexperience, training, and expertise between the prosecutors and law enforcement personnel within the districts, which could lead to higher conviction rates throughout the West Tennessee region. 110 Program Components The West Tennessee Regional Drug Prosecution Unit (WTRDPU) began to operate in January 1994. The Unit Director is appointed and approved by the six Judicial District Attorney Generals who represent the sixteen-county target area. Two Criminal Investigators and a Statistician were employed to initiate cooperation and investigation. These operations were implemented out of the Thirtieth Judicial District Attorney General's Office in Memphis, which provides office and phone service at no charge, in addition to vehicles for investigators. An agreement entered into by the Thirtieth Judicial District with the 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th Judicial Districts allows for cooperative investigations and prosecutions to take place in their respective districts. Because rural prosecutors are often unskilled at prosecuting drug offenders, a general prosecutor was appointed to all six districts to prosecute drug cases. Through the RDPU, investigators go into the districts and conduct investigations of drug-related crimes. Undercover officers are also provided to rural jurisdictions through urban police departments by the RDPU to conduct investigations that would be impossible for the local, well-known police officers to conduct. Results and Impact Performance Measures The success of the program is measured in several ways. Prosecution priorities and enforcement operations will be established with targeted individuals and organizations listed for investigation and prosecution both in Federal and State courts. Special emphasis will be placed on those activities affecting more than one judicial district: (1) the creation of a mechanism for the collection and sharing of data and setting of enforcement activities and priorities; (2) the sharing of manpower, enforcement, expertise, and training in both prosecution and enforcement activities between the urban prosecutors and enforcement personnel and their rural counterparts; and (3) the establishment of a Regional Drug Prosecution Unit that will develop a cohesive strategy and enforcement priorities between the six Judicial District Attorney General's Offices and the law enforcement agencies within the West Tennessee area. Implementation Problems and Successes One problem was the amount of time required for the Director and the investigators to travel, limiting the actual time spent with the agencies visited. Two criminal investigators living and working in the rural areas with the rural agencies as part of the RDPU helped limit travel. Another problem was the reluctance of rural law enforcement agencies to accept outside help from large metropolitan areas. This was alleviated by building trust through training, ~. . ~ ~, :.'.., --- 111 maintaining a presence in the area through two permanently placed RDPU staff members, and working the investigations with the local officers. There was also a reluctance of small law enforcement agencies to share information on their major targets and organizations for fear of being excluded from the arrests and seizures as well as any publicity received from the investigation. These fears were calmed over time as trust built between rural sheriffs and police chiefs and the RDPU. There was also a reluctance on the part of sheriffs or police chiefs in rural .areas to allow their only investigator or officer to work in another jurisdiction for fear of l!ability. This was resolved when the Memphis Police Department took over the liability of officers brought in to work with rural agencies. In addition, sheriffs and police chiefs hesitated to allow officers to leave the department for out-of-county training because of the need for manpower. Finally, judicial district prosecutors failed to relinquish prosecution of their drug and violent crime defendants to the Unit Director for fear of showing an inability to handle the cases, which would overshadow their chances for re-election. Successes and Accomplishments Continued meetings with West Tennessee area law enforcement officers alleviated their fears and the tension of not participating in the initial investigations. The Unit's participation with these rural law enforcement agencies in investigations and the sharing of information with them on the smallest of details brought about trust and accessibility for the West Tennessee Regional Drug Prosecution Unit. Two additional criminal investigators were placed in these rural areas alongside the agencies. \"Cooperation, which was almost non-existent before the grant, is now visible and defined with the goal of assisting each other in law enforcement arrest and prosecution,\" according to Captain Jim Harris of the Western Tennessee Regional Drug Prosecution Unit. Training sessions are held outside Memphis/Shelby County in different locations so that officers may attend from all over the region. Training topics cover items that rural officers need to address including gang recognition and high-risk entry techniques. To date, five sessions have been held, and over 357 officers have been trained, representing 120 law enforcement agencies. Establishment of an officer-loaner program between WTRDPU, Memphis-Shelby County law enforcement agencies, and the rural police and sheriffs departments has been responsible for over seven operations, resulting in over forty-five arrests of drug and violent crime offenders. The officer-loaner program is necessary to rural departments because the members of the rural law enforcement agencies are known by the offenders within the community, and most undercover operations would be impossible without outside assistance. 112 The 6stablishment of a \"hot line\" in one rural county in the southeastern section of the RDPU targeted area has allowed citizen involvement in the arrest of drug and violent crime offenders. This request came from an area previously not known to take any type of action against drug or violent crime offenders. This joint effort by city, county, and judicial task force officers, along with RDPU investigators, has opened a door which had long been closed to law enforcement agencies in that area. Movement of unit personnel into the Federal Bureau of Investigation Gang Task Force Office increased members' knowledge of gangs and gang problems within the targeted area. Prospects for Replication To replicate this program, enough investigators are needed to cover each county and attorney general. These investigators must have experience in working with law enforcement officers.

Today's youth, on average, spend barely 9% of their first 18 years in school. The other 91% is spent at home, on playgrounds, and in front of the television. For too many children, the family that should be their protector, advocate, and moral anchor is itself in a state of deterioration. In addition, the neighborhood is a place of menace, violence, drug use, unemployment, and other modem maladies. Enormous financial investments have been made in law enforcement and social services, but all too often these agencies provide their services with little effort to coordinate programs and strategies. Clearly these are problems that are not amenable to solutions by a single agency. Providing a place where youth and other residents can develop relationships, find opportunities to be productive and successful, and enhance their skills -- a safe haven -- fosters an atmosphere necessary for positive development. Goals and Objectives The Safe Haven concept is an important aspect of Weed & Seed. Weed & Seed is a multiagency strategy that weeds out violent crime, gang activity, drug use, and drug trafficking in targeted high-crime neighborhoods and seeds the areas by restoring these neighborhoods through social and economic revitalization efforts. ~ The Weed & Seed strategy recognizes the importance of collaborative initiatives to maximize the impact of existing programs and resources. In the beginning, the objectives for the Safe Haven programs in San Antonio included: identifying and assessing existing Safe Haven programs nationwide, with specific emphasis on drug and alcohol prevention components and the feasibility of introducing Safe Haven programs into public housing developments; defining and developing the concept for a local Safe Haven program; preparing a training curriculum and technical assistance material; providing training and technical assistance for components of the Safe Haven program; and 114 providing financial resources for implementation of the Safe Haven program that focus on drug and alcohol prevention issues. The goals of the program are: to establish a multiservice education center that is free of drugs, alcohol, and violence; to provide direction and capability for organizing and coordinating the delivery of public and private educational, social and justice-system resources for youth; their families, and others through the Safe Haven multiservice center; and to enable neighborhood youth and adults to become productive and law-abiding citizens, free from drug and alcohol abuse and the influence of gangs through the use of Safe Haven multiservice centers. The San Antonio Safe Haven program developed goals specific to the local target area. These goals include: providing a safe environment that will nurture interaction between adults and youth; involving participants in recreational activities; deterring drug and alcohol involvement through drug and alcohol education; offering space for agencies to provide supportive services in the Safe Haven; working with the San Antonio Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the development of crime prevention programs; and improving the environment in the community through involvement in beautification projects. Program Components A Safe Haven is a multiservice center where a variety of youth and adult services are located in a highly visible and accessible facility that is secure against crime and illegal drug activity. It brings together law enforcement, community services, basic and continuing education, health, recreation, employment, and other key sectors to provide opportunities, skills, and recognition for young people, their family members, and other residents of the community in a safe environment. A special emphasis is placed on education. 115 San Antonio Weed & Seed has established three Safe Haven sites. A community center, a housing project, and a local elementary school provide locations throughout the Weed & Seed target area for the San Antonio Safe Havens. Since virtually all neighborhoods are served by schools, primary consideration was given to locating a Safe Haven at a school site. However, in communities where a school building is not available, other sites to explore include community centers, public housing developments, churches or temples, or other secure, accessible, and appropriately equipped buildings. The Safe Havens are open after school and, to the extent possible, before normal school hours. Operational considerations depend on local conditions. A variety of services and supportive programs (educational, cultural, recreational, health, and justice-related) are made available. Educational programs addressing the social climate such as gang alternatives and drug and alcohol abuse prevention are emphasized. While a primary focus of the Safe Haven program is to provide youth living in the area with productive activities and a safe place to go, parents of the youth and other residents in the target area are also served. The services Safe Havens provide are targeted at people who are in need of assistance and guidance within the community. These services cannot be provided without the combined efforts of community agencies and grassroots organizations that support the program in a financial and volunteer capacity. San Antonio has an extensive network of agencies to provide services to the Safe Haven project through the Weed & Seed program. The following agencies are some which provide resources in San Antonio: the U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Texas; San Antonio Police Department; San Antonio Fighting Back; Davis/Scott YMCA; New Light Tenant Association; Springview Resident Association; King Middle School; San Antonio Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse; Claude W. Black Center; Barbara Jordan Community Center; Boys And Girls Club, Springview Branch; Crossroads Missionary Baptist Church; Weed & Seed Advisory committee; Palmer Drug Abuse; San Antonio Literacy Council; Police Athletic League (PAL); and Communities in Schools. Specific services and activities made available to the participants of the Safe Havens include tutoring, rap sessions, drug prevention education, and drug counseling. PAL provides recreational opportunities to youths involved in the Safe Haven program. Local professional sports organizations actively support the activities of PAL. Opportunities include the San Antonio Spurs Drug Free Basketball League, San Antonio Mission Baseball League, modeling, karate, and numerous other activities designed to enhance self esteem and develop positive team building and decision-making skills. Through support provided by additional agencies, the Safe Havens provide guest speakers to address social and cultural concerns. Field trips and special occasion events are also provided by the San Antonio Safe Havens. Project Assist was developed in coordination with the Safe Havens. The goal of this project is to benefit the spiritual, physical, and mental needs of children through counseling, tutoring, and referrals in a family-oriented setting. Supporting the Safe Haven initiative, the Family Service Association of San Antonio, Inc. partnered with the Safe Havens to develop a curriculum for girls between ages nine and thirteen. Some sessions include Feelings 116 Identification, Feelings Expression and Anger Management, Self-Esteem Building, and a Modeling Club in coordination with PAL. Resuils and Impact Performance Measures The San Antonio Safe Haven Program began as a \"Cities in Schools, Inc.\" (Communities in Schools locally) project contracted to San Antonio Fighting Back. San Antonio Fighting Back is one of the 14 national drug prevention initiatives funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the largest health care philanthropy in the world, and the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County. Because preliminary program design is contingent on assessments and expectations based on those assessments, meeting the needs of the community is critical to the success of any service-based program. San Antonio FightingBack had been involved in a two-year needs assessment, planning,, and implementation process to develop comprehensive drug and crime prevention strategies. This work provided the infrastructure and foundation for the Safe Haven project. Therefore, some of the initial steps involved in developing a Safe Haven program were completed prior to the Cities in Schools, Inc. project. They comprise the following four activities: Community Assessment: risk; protective; resiliency; community needs; community resources; attitudes and perceptions with regard to substance use, abuse, and crime; community leadership; and broader community support for substance abuse and crime prevention programs; Community Training: organization and mobilization; advocacy skills; and organization development and plan; performance measures; evaluation instrument; and evaluation contractor. Implementation Problems and Successes The difficulties encountered during implementation of the San Antonio Safe Haven program have been few and primarily financial. Funding considerations are significant with the initiation of any new program. San Antonio was fortunate to have received grant funding to support the Safe Haven concept. Resources have been attained through collaborative efforts and grant funding and private sector support have been sought. 117 The San Antonio Safe Haven project is managed by a coordinator with minimal support staff. Initially, the staff to participant ratio provided inefficient provision of services. That problem was solved when San Antonio received funding for the Americorps/Just Serve program. Using Americorps members in the program has shifted the participant to staff ratio. Successes and Accomplishments San Antonio Safe Haven programs have exceeded initial expectations. Program administrators did not expect so many people to use the facilities. The project was expected to serve 20 children at two sites. The local Safe Havens serve an average of 45 youth and adults, and a third Safe Haven site was established in 1994. Service support has also grown. Local professionals, community leaders, and area residents have provided additional resources. Two major successes have been that the philosophy of the police department has changed and that the relationship between the police and the community has improved. Now, after school the children come looking for the police officers who are their \"pals.\" There has been a change in officers who have done the Weed & Seed training: they are less cynical and less prone to burnout. The Safe Havens in San Antonio have successfully involved youth and other area residents in numerous projects. Feeding the homeless, elderly, disabled, and hungry was a collaborative effort between the Safe Havens and two churches -- Crossroads Missionary Baptist and Good Faith News Missionary Baptist church. The Safe Haven concept has been well received in the San Antonio area and was highlighted by local news channels. In April 1994, media coverage focusing on what is being done to combat the violence in San Antonio featured youth from the San Antonio Safe Havens. Many of the youth interviewed stated that the Safe Havens provided a safe and fun place to learn, play, and work together. Twenty youths and one adult from the Safe Havens participated in the Anti-Drug Conference held at St. Mary's University in August 1994. They were involved in workshops, team competitions, self-esteem building, recreation, dance, and talent shows. This was the first time many of these youths had ever been on a University campus. In conjunction with San Antonio Fighting Back, San Antonio Housing Authority, Fort Sam Houston, and the Weed & Seed Safe Havens, 15 youths were given the opportunity to be involved with military and civilian personnel in a military setting. La Salida, The Way Out, is a two-day adventure designed to provide an atmosphere to nurture and enhance the self image of students and work to break the chain of drugs, gangs, and negative peer pressure as well as provide physical challenges. 118 During her visit to the San Antonio Weed & Seed site, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno provided an exciting opportunity for Safe Haven youth involved with the Learning Garden to proudly display their horticultural successes. Prospects for Replication The Safe Haven facilities have proved to be accessible to the whole community. Ideal locations for Safe Havens are schools, public housing facilities, or community centers. The established relationships with community and city agencies eased the initiation of Safe Havens. The delivery of services in an established organization can enhance existing projects and expand available resources. Working collaboratively to assess and address the needs of the community provided a foundation for success in the Safe Haven implementation.

This meeting brought together over 60 State planners and local practitioners as well as researchers, analysts, and law enforcement officers from 27 states who have previously been or currently are involved in implementing and/or evaluating programs designed to meet the needs of youth involved in the criminal justice system. This publication identifies and documents programs that focus on youth, drugs, and violence at the State and local levels. The first section of the publication presents a perspective from a national expert on a successful youth program in San Antonio, Texas. The second section of the publication documents the twenty-one State and local programs that were presented at the workshop. 0 0 Perspective on Youth, Drugs and Violence 0 0 0 The San Antonio Fighting Back Project: A Model Drug Prevention Program. Mr. John Sanders, Board Member of The San Antonio Fighting Back Project (San Antonio, Texas), presented San Antonio Fighting Back's innovative approach to the prevention of substance abuse. San Antonio Fighting Back is a program dedicated to the prevention and reduction of substance abuse. The project aids citizens of the south and southeast sections of San Antonio in combatting the problems which plague their neighborhoods. Since it began in 1990, San Antonio Fighting Back has been funded by the United Way of San Antonio and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. San Antonio Fighting Back comprises several components which work together to achieve the goal of \"establishing a continuum of care to effectively address alcohol and other drug abuse through a comprehensive prevention, intervention, treatment, and relapse prevention program.\" The goal is realized through the consolidation of resources and the creation of a single community-wide system of prevention, early identification, treatment, and aftercare. This approach reduces the demand for and illegal use of alcohol and other drugs. The elements of the program include neighborhood resource centers, community empowerment, public awareness, Weed and Seed, and neighborhood beautification. Three Neighborhood Resource Centers are located in the target area. Each. functions as a resource for training, coordination, support, resource development, and technical assistance to community activities. Every resource center provides a variety of services to San Antonio residents such as a Food Bank Program, Boy and Girl Scouts, and the San Antonio Independent School District Gang Unit. Community empowerment in San Antonio enables the residents to \"take back'! their neighborhoods. In order for residents to reclaim their community, aid must be given in the areas of education, leadership development, and advocacy training. Community empowerment is displayed through a variety of actions, including the availability of current information on alcohol and other drugs in the resource centers and public awareness and health campaigns which are culturally specific to help enrich the community. Finally, collaborative measures among organizations, communities, and task forces address prevention, intervention, treatment, and relapse prevention activities. San Antonio Fighting Back utilizes the influence of the media in shaping behavior. The program has established partnerships with various media sources including radio, television, and newspapers. The partnerships help to convey the message of positive, healthy, and drug- free youth and community role models. Neighborhood newsletters focus on the personal success stories of residents, achieved through prevention, intervention, treatment, and relapse prevention efforts. \"Human Renewal\" is the focus of San Antonio's Weed and Seed Program. The program is San Antonio Fighting Back's strategy for community policing. Coordinated law enforcement initiatives and combined resources from social, community, and private entities strengthen existing community policing efforts. Also, this strategy enhances detection, apprehension, and prosecution efforts in cases of narcotics trafficking, weapons violations, and violent crimes. San Antonio two goals. Second, this boarding up the youth in nearby bases of over 650 volunteers. Fighting Back has implemented a neighborhood beautification program to achieve First, the project provides employment to the city's youth in the target area. employment results in community enhancement through the removal of graffiti, of abandoned buildings, and clearing of vacant lots. Residents of all ages assist this clean-up effort, fostering a sense of community. Military personnel from also take part in the beautification initiative. The program resulted in the removal tons of debris through the efforts of more than 1,000 community and military The comprehensive substance abuse, crime, and violence prevention strategy of San Antonio Fighting Back includes eight components necessary to mobilize and organize the community for positive change. The strategy is a community-wide prevention effort of inclusion, assessment, planning, and awareness. A community assessment should be done to identify important issues and available resources. Both short and long-term planning efforts should be implemented. Community awareness should be promoted to alter community attitudes. Next, the strategy recognizes, provides, and develops leadership. The leaders function as facilitators. They share leadership and authority qualities with one another and other members of the group. The leaders are instructed to discourage apathy and negativism. The program must preserve its momentum in order to be successful and continue to function. Three ideas for maintaining the momentum of a program are communication, ongoing recruitment, and the establishment of operating norms. Communication initiatives may take several forms, such as regular coalition meetings, community-wide meetings, and retreats or other activities aimed at \"getting people to talk, interact, and bond.\" Recruitment must be continuous and efficient to put recruits to work as soon as possible. Personnel assignments should attain a working balance between \"comfort\" and \"growth.\" Operating norms are a mixture of conflict resolution; clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountability; and recognition, reward, and celebration. Several concerns should be kept in mind when implementing program activities. Among these considerations is that the activity should address the identified needs of the community. Also, as many people as possible should be involved in both the planning and the implementation of the activities. After all, \"people support what they help to create.\" An evaluation of each activity should be conducted so as to establish the success, impact, or failure of an activity and the reason behind the outcome. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the activities are culturally sensitive, relevant, and appropriate. The assessment of prevention efforts is an ongoing process that should begin at the start of the organizational 6 phase. Evaluation skills should be taught to community residents to ensure that these important skills remain within the community. San Antonio Fighting Back views evaluation as a \"tool of improvement\" through \"constructive, healthy feedback.\" Within the evaluation component lie the accountability standards initially established by the group. Collaborative efforts are becoming increasingly important to the survival of a program. San Antonio Fighting Back calls for the development of partnerships which foster cooperation, coordination, and collaboration. The \"three C's\" are achieved through the sharing of resources, facilities, and volunteers; participation in joint programs, activities, and training; joint fundraising activities; and the development of joint grant proposals. In order to effectively address \"turf issues,\" roles and responsibilities should be clearly identified. San Antonio Fighting Back participates in approximately 12 collaborative programs. Among these are a Treatment Collaborative, a High Risk Youth Collaborative, a Mentors Collaborative, and a Housing Development Collaborative. The impact that San Antonio Fighting Back has had on the community is evident in a variety of ways. Neighborhood residents have displayed pride toward the community by actively contributing to the success of neighborhood clean-ups. A community bond has formed among the 400,000 residents who participated in community events from 1992-1994. Through hard work and dedication, the staff at San Antonio Fighting Back and community residents were able to \"reweave the fabric of the community.\" 0 0 0 State and Local Programs: Youth, Drugs and Violence 0 0 0 Alabama Commitment and Supervision Alternatives Statement of the Problem Huntsville, Alabama is the wealthiest community in the southeastern United States. It is a community with many resources, including an outstanding school system. However, in 1989, the Madison County Juvenile Court of Huntsville, Alabama, only had two disposition options available for adjudicated delinquents: probation with very limited services, or commitment to the Alabama Department of Youth Services (ADYS) for placement in a training school. Juveniles who violated the conditions of their probation were often committed to ADYS. During that year, the court committed 66 juveniles to the long-term on-campus training school programs of ADYS. The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation study of juveniles in the custody of the Alabama Department of Youth Services in 1989 found that 74% had committed relatively minor offenses and 54% scored less than seven points on a risk assessment instrument in which ten points was the recommended lower limit for secure placement. The study concluded that if alternative programs could be developed, the State's training school population could be reduced by 50 to 55%. There are significant disadvantages associated with the provision of rehabilitation services for delinquent juveniles in State training schools. Delinquent peer pressure may be detrimental to the goals of rehabilitation (i.e., the most severe delinquents may teach other juveniles how to perform delinquent acts not previously in their repertoires). Training schools can be centers for the recruitment, induction, and training of gang members. The campuses may be located far from the juvenile's family so that family involvement in the rehabilitation process is severely limited. Home and community factors which contributed to the juvenile's delinquent behavior cannot be addressed effectively. Upon release, the juvenile could return to the same environment, but with new skills in delinquent behavior. Goals and Objectives Since the State training schools were an ineffective strategy for dealing with juvenile delinquents, in June 1990 the Madison County Juvenile Court set the goal of reducing by one- third the number of juvenile delinquents from Madison County admitted to the training schools of ADYS by using community service work as a commitment alternative. In order to achieve this goal, the following objectives were established: (1) to conduct a 11 community service program for 100 or more juvenile delinquents ordered by the court to perform a specified number of hours of community service; (2) to monitor progress and compliance; (3) to provide reports to the court; and (4) to collect information regarding the number of admissions to State training schools. Program Components The community service program was designed to be a positive experience for the juveniles while at the same time holding them accountable for their behavior. Since low self-esteem is generally thought to be a characteristic of many juvenile delinquents, it was expected that work assignments commonly associated with community service work (e.g., trash collection along highways) might lower their self-esteem even further. Instead of trash collection, work sites were selected which would enable juveniles to be of .assistance to others, to interact with responsible adult role models in providing services to persons in need, and to gain skills which could help them obtain employment in the future. The program employed one coordinator to work regular office hours Tuesday through Saturday and, in the second year of the program, added an aide to work after-school and evening hours Tuesday through Friday and regular office hours on Saturdays. This work schedule permits maximum participation of juveniles in the program. Juveniles who are not in school and are not employed can work during regular office hours, and juveniles who are in school can work after school and on Saturdays. Work Sites and Supervisors To develop the program, the presiding juvenile court judge contacted public agencies to obtain work sites. A wide variety of those agencies agreed to participate and identified persons willing to assume responsibility for supervising the juveniles assigned to those sites. Agencies included Christmas Charities (collects toys, household goods, and clothing for distribution to needy families); North Alabama Food Bank (collects and distributes food to needy families); a lunch distribution Center for senior citizens; the public library; Boys and Girls Clubs; and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The program personnel studied the various work sites and determined the skills and abilities juveniles would need to work at various jobs in each location. On-site supervisors were trained to monitor the juveniles in their work duties. Emphasis was placed on finding work experience for juveniles which involved a professional environment in which the juvenile had to wear a suit and tie. Court Referrals Juveniles who have violated the conditions of probation or who have been adjudicated for offenses which the court concludes require accountability to the community in the form of community service are ordered to perform a specified number of hours of community service as a condition of probation. Most of the juveniles assigned to the program have been adjudicated for offenses which would be felonies if committed by adults. Those assigned to the program for offenses which would be misdemeanors if committed by adults usually have carried a concealed firearm or been in first-time possession of a controlled substance. 12 Work Assignments A juvenile who is ordered to perform community service comes with his or her parent(s) for an interview with the program coordinator. Prior to the interview, the coordinator reviews the juvenile's file in order to understand the juvenile's legal history and other information which might influence a work site assignment. The rules and procedures of the program are explained, and the juvenile participates in determining where he or she will work. A work schedule is prepared and arrangements are made for program personnel to transport each juvenile to and from work sites, unless the juvenile can provide his or her own transportation. Monitoring In order to assure that juveniles are performing their duties satisfactorily, program personnel monitor work sites. Work site supervisors complete written reports of each juvenile's hours of work. When juveniles have completed their hours of service, program personnel submit a report for inclusion in each juvenile's file. Training School Admissions In order to determine the number of admissions from Madison County to the long-term on-campus training school programs of the Alabama Department of Youth Services, program personnel review court records and actual admissions to those programs. Results and Impact Performance Measures In order to determine the extent to which program components are being conducted, several performance measures have been established. To assure that work sites are readily available for work assignments, a list of work sites currently available for use by the program is maintained. To assure that a sufficient number of juveniles are assigned to the program to achieve the program's goal, a current list is maintained of those juveniles assigned to the program, the number of hours specified to be performed, and the number of hours of community service each juvenile has completed. In addition, a record of the number of admissions to State training schools is compiled. A concern with regard to the over- representation of minority juveniles in State training schools has prompted the monitoring of minority participation in the community service program in order to assure the use of community-based alternatives for minority juveniles. Implementation Problems and Successes During 1990, the first year of the program's operation, only one person, a community service coordinator, was employed in the program. The program was operated during regular office hours, Tuesday through Saturday. Juveniles were unable to perform hours of community service after school or during early evening hours. A community service aide was added to the program during its second year of operation. During the summer months when school is not in session, both program employees work regular office hours Tuesday through Saturday 13 in order to maximize participation in the program. As increased numbers of younger juveniles have appeared before the court, a few juveniles have been assigned to the program who are too young for jobs at work sites. The court has permitted them to receive tutoring in their school subjects as an alternative to a work assignment. Other juveniles in the program have provided the tutoring services as their work assignment. The program was readily accepted by juvenile court: judges, prosecutors, and probation officers. It was praised by the general public, the juveniles, and their parents m all of whom have commented that it is a good way to teach responsibility for one's actions. Successes and Accomplishments The program goal for 1990 was to reduce admissions to the long-term on-campus training school programs of the Alabama Department of Youth Services by one-third. That goal was exceeded as admissions dropped from 66 in 1989 to 26 in 1990, a reduction of 61%. The 123 juveniles who participated in the program in 1990 performed 7,021 hours of community service, an average of about 57 hours for each juvenile. The success of the program has continued in subsequent years with 20 admissions in 1991 (a 70% reduction); 24 admissions in 1992 (a 64% reduction); 48 admissions in 1993 (a 27% reduction); and 28 admissions in 1994 (a 58% reduction). In 1991, 155 juveniles performed 9,912 hours of community service; in 1992, 160 juveniles performed 10,876 hours of work; in 1993, 196 juveniles performed 12,600 hours of work; and in 1994, 146 juveniles performed 12,225 hours of work. Had Madison County continued to admit juveniles to the State training schools at the rate of 66 per year as in 1989, a total of 330 juveniles from the county would have been admitted during the five-year period from 1990 through 1994. Instead, only 146 juveniles were committed to those programs, a reduction of 56% (184). During the period cited, admissions to ADYS training schools doubled from about 900 in 1989 to almost 1,800 in 1994. Had Madison County admissions increased at that rate, admissions would be up to 132 per year in 1994. The cost of providing services to a juvenile in an ADYS training school is estimated to be about $30,000 per year. The cost per juvenile per year in the community service program has averaged less than $275 per juvenile over the five years of the program. The program has consistently served a very high percentage of minority juveniles in order to reduce over-representation of minority juveniles in the State's training schools. Minority participation has been as follows: in 1990, 88 juveniles (71%); in 1991, 105 juveniles (68%); in 1992, 114 juveniles (71%); in 1993, 125 juveniles (64%); and in 1994, 88 juveniles (60%). The fact that there has been a significant reduction in admissions to the training schools and 14 that there has been a high participation of minority juveniles in the program confirms that the number of minority juveniles admitted to training schools from Madison County has been reduced during the last five years. The program's success can be viewed from several perspectives. At $30,000 per year for a training school placement, the State has saved millions of dollars. Community agencies have benefited from 52,634 hours of community service work performed by the juveniles. The juveniles have benefitted the most by learning to be accountable and responsible for their own behavior while acquiring job skills and establishing friendships with adult supervisors at the work sites. Some children have repeated the program, but the numbers have been low. Recidivism rates have not been tracked specifically, but rates have not gone up. No specific offenders are screened out; although certain groups m status offenders or those who only commit misdemeanors -- are excluded. Staff selection has been difficult. It is very important that staff want to work with kids and be tough and charismatic. The staff should have high expectations for youth. Prospects for Replication The Commitment and Supervision Alternatives program can be easily replicated in other juvenile courts. A community service program is. an excellent community:based alternative that can be effective in reducing admissions to State training schools and other correctional facilities. In order for such an effort to be successful, however, there needs to be cooperation and support from the various juvenile court participants, including judges, prosecutors, and probation officers. Some jurisdictions might want to use this model for less serious offenders, although focusing on more serious juvenile offenders and emphasizing altematives to incarceration has been the most fruitful approach for Madison County. The next step is to develop restitution programs, so that juveniles not only do community service and thereby give back to the community, but also give back to the victims of their crimes. By requiring the juveniles to pay back the community through service, the offender learns responsibility and accountability for his behavior. 15 Contact Information James H.

Statement of the Problem In 1993, Arizona Governor Fife Symington asked the State's Department of Public Safety to develop a comprehensive approach to deal with the escalating gang problem in Arizona's communities. In response to this request and overwhelming statistical data that indicates that the number of identifiable gang sets in the State had grown from approximately 380 in 1991 and approximately 9,000 gang members to more than 800 sets in 1993 with membershi p over 15,000, the Gang Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission (G.I.T.E.M.) was conceived. This unique program brings together law enforcement and prosecution agencies from State, county, local, Federal, and tribal jurisdictions in a coordinated, intelligence-driven approach that deals with gangs on a broad scale. Traditionally, Arizona agencies had dealt with the gang problem individually rather than collectively. This resulted in displacement rather than focused and directed enforcement efforts in the area of gang enforcement and identification. The primary benefit of the G.I.T.E.M. project is that it joins the involved agencies and those that would ultimately be the recipients of the project's services to try to cripple gangs in the State rather than just move the problems created by these gangs into adjoining jurisdictions. The G.I.T.E.M. program is at its roots a pure enforcement project designed to provide opportunities for citizens to reassert their ownership over the community. Goals and Objectives The G.I.T.E.M. project is designed to deal a crippling blow to street and other gang elements. The project seeks to accomplish this by: (1) providing agencies statewide with a highly trained and highly mobile rapid deployment force to respond to calls for assistance and services directly related to gangs and gang-related problems; (2) franchising local agencies in the development of enforcement and intervention strategies unique to both the gang and quality of life issues present in their communities; (3) providing high quality, cost effective training for criminal justice agencies and community groups statewide; and (4) providing all of the listed services outlined herein in a nearly expense-neutral method. 17 Program Components The G.I.T.E.M. project comprises a ready deployment task force of nearly sixty officers and supervisors from more than twenty different State, county, local, and tribal agencies. These personnel have been assigned to the task force on a full-time basis. The agencies receive full reimbursement from the project for all salary and employment-related expenses. Additionally, all equipment, with the exception of duty sidearm and body armor, is furnished to the assigned officer, as well as any travel or overtime costs the officer may accrue. In addition to the above officers, agents from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms have been assigned to assist the officers of the task force on a half-time basis. The project is administered by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The task force is located in two deployment centers, in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. From these centralized locations officers can respond to requests for service from agencies throughout the northern, central, and southern areas of the State. The personnel in the task force employ a zero tolerance approach to the interdiction of gang problems in their areas of responsibility. This approach, which entails the strict enforcement of all criminal and traffic laws in an area targeted by the requesting agency, has proven to be highly effective. This methodology also guarantees that issues of selective enforcement against ' suspected gang members because of ethnicity are minimized if not eliminated, and ensuresthe defense of such methodology in court challenges. The program also has a prosecution component. Prosecutors:associated with the program are specially trained to handle gang cases: They are aware of the gang culture and instructed not to bargain. The project has an intelligence gathering and sharing component. Some officers are located in an intelligence unit within G.I.T.E.M. These officers debrief prisoners and arrestees and collect data to obtain search warrants to close crack and heroin distribution houses. Another aspect of the program involves the G.I.T.E.M. Advisory Board. This group comprises representatives from local, county, State, and Federal criminal justice agencies as well as representatives from the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission, the Arizona National Guard, and the Governor's Office. This is an oversight group whose tasks include the review of task force activities and assignment of priorities if an interagency need arose that the task force commander could not resolve. Additionally, this group provides valuable feedback to the task force commanders and the Department of Public Safety as to the level of service and success the project is providing. Another unique component of the project is the ability to pay for the assistance of other law enforcement personnel which may be called upon to assist the task force in its endeavors. Part of this effort is a program called the Regionalized Anti-Gang Training Enforcement (R.A.T.E.) program. This program brings officers from four rural areas of the State to a 3-day training session and two days working in the city. With this configuration, the officers do not become acclimated to city law enforcement that does not apply to rural areas. Instead, they use their 18 training at home almost immediately. This capability greatly reduces the financial strain on assisting agencies, allowing many to assist their fellow agencies which would otherwise be impossible. Although the project is purely an enforcement effort at this time, it works with other groups to provide preventive services. The project trains school teachers, community groups, and victims' groups to recognize gang activity and provide early intervention to gang-involved youth. The funding of the G.I.T.E.M. project in its introductory year was also noteworthy. First, the Governor and the Arizona Legislature appropriated nearly $900,000 directly to the Arizona Department of Public Safety for the enhancement of its gang enforcement and intelligence gathering capabilities. Prior to this appropriation, the Department of Public Safety, which had begun its anti-gang efforts in 1989 following an executive order from then Governor Mofford, had relied exclusively on Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization (R.I.C.O.) funds acquired by the agency to support its efforts in this area. This appropriation provided sufficient funding for the addition of twelve officers, two sergeants, and one lieutenant to the existing sergeant and six officers in the gang detail. Following the regular legislative session, Governor Symington, who continued to become more concemed with the burgeoning gang and street violence problem in the State, called a special session of the Arizona Legislature in which an additional $5,000,000 was appropriated to the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission, which granted the same amount to the Arizona Department of Public Safety for initiation of the multi- agency task force that is now known as G.I.T.E.M. Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes The agencies in the State of Arizona displayed a tremendous willingness to involve themselves in a new and innovative approach to deal with the problems associated with gangs. In fact, the desire of the agencies to participate resulted in the need to limit the number of officers that any one agency could assign to the team to ensure equal participation opportunities for all agencies. However, there was a problem in that many of the agencies willing to participate couldn't afford to send their personnel to a 30-day training course because of the lack of personnel this would cause in small agencies. G.I.T.E.M. shortened the course to three days with a two day field component to make it more accessible. A significant drawback to the full implementation of the plan on a statewide basis is the continued delay of the Federal government in granting concurrent authority of the task force on Indian reservations. This is a major problem in Arizona because there is a documented growth of gang sets on many of those reservations. At the time of this writing, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has cooperated fully with the task force, is attempting to execute individual interagency agreements between all the tribes and the task force. \"\" \";i 19 Another problem that has been encountered deals with the availability and delivery of needed equipment for the task force personnel. Most of the problems in this regard have been associated with contract provisions and not with the task force itself. There has been a moderate displacement of crime and gang activity to other areas. The G.I.T.E.M. project tracks the gang members who move to new areas. Eventually, the gang members go underground in their home jurisdictions and discontinue their activities to avoid arrest and prosecution by G.I.T.E.M. Successes and Accomplishments The G.I.T.E.M. task force has been funded since July 1994 and has been in full operation since September 1994. During its operational life, the task force has been immensely successful in its mission of assistance. To date, the project has provided assistance to nearly 50 agencies statewide on more than 125 specific missions. These missions have resulted in the arrest of more than 2,200 adults and juveniles on criminal charges ranging from illegal possession of alcohol to a variety of violent crimes including at least a dozen arrests for homicide. Nearly 30% of those arrested were documented gang members, and the remainder of those arrested were street criminals. In addition, more than 400 firearms have been seized from suspects, over 1,500 new gang members have been identified, and nearly 4,000 traffic citations have been issued to violators. The personnel in the unit have completed nearly 6,000 field interrogation cards and have been involved in more than 8,000 other public or non-enforcement contacts with persons in the targeted areas. As impressive as these numbers are, the greater success of the unit has been its ability to regain some measure of tranquility and normalcy in the targeted areas. In one major city, the efforts of the local officers and the task force reduced gang-related violent crime by more the 30% in a 70 day period. In a smaller central Arizona city, the task force and the local officers were able to take enforcement action against the owners of a residence used for gang alcohol and drug parties. The attendees at these events were members of a major gang in that city and had been involved in several confrontations with police when the officers attempted to intervene in the illegal activities occurring at the residence. As a result of the combined and focused efforts of all involved, this location has ceased to be a problem or focus for gang activities. The task force has been involved in the assessment of gang problems in a number of non- metropolitan communities in the State. In each of these communities, the personnel were able to assist the local agency in identifying particular gang sets present and the extent of their influence, and in co-developing appropriate enforcement and intervention plans. In addition to the enforcement successes of the operation, one of the most active and beneficial aspects of the project has been the training component. This is staffed by one officer on a full- time basis and by numerous others, both internal and external to the task force, on an ad hoc basis. The full-time officer is an experienced gang enforcement officer who holds a Masters Degree in Education and has a corresponding level of experience in training both law 20 enforcement and lay personnel in gang enforcement. To date, this officer has provided or coordinated more than 80 training sessions totalling nearly 600 hours to more than 80 law enforcement agencies and civic groups. The number of personnel and citizens attending these training sessions exceeds 4,100. Prospects for Replication The G.I.T.E.M. staff has already presented in-depth programs on the project to personnel from a number of western states. A number of other agencies have asked for and received basic information on the project via letter and telephone. The possibility of replicating this operation in other states is unlimited. It is simply a matter of commitment to global gang enforcement by agencies in any area and a willingness by those agencies to abandon the territorial approach to dealing with a problem. Such limitations and parochialistic methods have proven detrimental, while interdependent and cooperative styles have proven to be most beneficial in dealing with transient problems such as those posed by gangs.

Recent studies indicate a higher than national percentage of substance abuse at the time of intake into the system. Despite this fact, intervention efforts for the substance abusing juvenile offender are not adequately supported. Community-based substance abuse treatment is an effective approach to this problem. The Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC) program model has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of substance abuse by the offender population. The TASC program, which coordinates the criminal justice and treatment systems, works to provide incentives for offenders to enter community-based treatment programs and matches offenders with the most appropriate treatment programs. In most states, the preponderance of resources are in adult corrections, and the TASC model is instituted for more adult than juvenile systems. In many districts in Colorado, juveniles' needs are not properly assessed, and the youths are ordered into treatment without a diagnosis of substance abuse. Without appropriate intervention, the substance abusing juvenile remains. within the juvenile justice system and eventually, the adult criminal justice, system.: The First Judicial District is showing a rate of treatment-level youth committed to the Division of Youth Services higher than the statewide percentage, based on youth committed between July and December 1992. This demonstrates a need for the TASC program, which has shown to effectively reduce the incidence of substance abuse by the juvenile offender population. Goals and Objectives The first goal of the program is to implement the integrated TASC model in the First Judicial District probation department. To accomplish this goal the following objectives are necessary: to provide ongoing training to the probation officers of the First Judicial District during the 12 month grant cycle and to implement and maintain the TASC performance standards in the First Judicial District Probation Department. The second goal of the program is to increase the number of substance abusing juvenile offenders who receive substance abuse assessment and treatment services. This is accomplished by administering 144 differential assessments within a 12 month period with a target of 12 assessments monthly; enrolling 92 treatment-level juveniles in the TASC Program within a 12 month period; matching juvenile probationers with appropriate community-based 22 treatment agencies and providing increased case management for these juveniles; and continuing the expansion of the Adolescent Treatment Network (ATN) in the First Judicial District to serve youth and their families. The program's third goal is to establish continuity of treatment for substance abusing juvenile offenders in the First Judicial District. This is achieved through continued collaboration between the First Judicial District Probation Department/TASC Project and the Division of Youth Services; by reviewing and modifying agreements with the Division of Youth Services Central Region to facilitate the transfer of drug and alcohol assessment and treatment information to the Division of Youth Services at the time juveniles from the First Judicial District are committed to the Department of Institutions; and through continued participation in the oversight committees with representatives from the First, Second, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Judicial Districts, the Division of Youth Services, and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division throughout the duration of the project. The final goal of the program is to conduct a recidivism study for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of treatment services. This is achieved by defining data elements that will need to be collected on all terminated TASC clients; collecting and recording defined data elements from both first and second year client populations; and reviewing and collapsing aggregate data. Program Components The project plan is to implement the Denver Juvenile Justice Integrated (DJJI) TASC model in the First Judicial District in order to increase the number of substance abusing juvenile offenders who receive substance abuse treatment services and to establish a continuity of care model for these juveniles. The following are the key elements of the Juvenile TASC model: a broad base of support within the justice and treatment systems with a protocol for continued and effective communication; an independent TASC unit with a designated administrator; documented policies and procedures for required staff training; a data collection system to be used in program management and evaluation; a number of agreed upon offender eligibility criteria; procedures for the identification of eligible offenders that stress early intervention; 23 documented procedures of assessment and referral; documented policies and procedures for random urinalysis and other tests; and documented procedures for offender monitoring that include criteria for success/failure, required frequency of contact, schedule of reporting, and notification of termination to the justice system. The TASC project staff consists of one full-time TASC Specialist who serves as the referring link between probation and treatment, one part-time tracker for non-compliant offenders, and one half-time clerical person. All TASC staff and other relevant staff (i.e., judges, magistrates, probation officers, district attorneys, public defenders, and Division of Youth Services personnel) are provided initial and ongoing training. In addition, the Operations Management Team, which consists of mid-line supervisors, TASC Specialists, representatives from the Division of Youth Services (DYS), representatives from the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division, and treatment providers, was established to plan and discuss case management, programming issues, and training issues, and to make recommendations. The TASC model in the First Judicial District aims to provide identification, assessment, treatment, and case management to substance abusing juvenile offenders who are on probation or in community placement. The process involves identifying the treatment level of the probationer, assigning the case to a designated probation officer, making a referral to an appropriate treatment provider, and following up on the compliance of the probationer. TASC clients who are not compliant will be placed on jeopardy status, a probationary, period during which they will be monitored more closely. Clients have two chances, Jeopardy I and Jeopardy II. If they fail to meet Jeopardy contract requirements, they will be terminated from the TASC project and referred back to the probation officer. One strength of the Juvenile TASC model is the collaboration between community-based treatment agencies and the project in order to bridge the treatment and juvenile justice communities. There are currently 20 treatment agencies that are members of the Adolescent Treatment Network in the First Judicial District, and the network continually works to include new members. This network was created in the first year of funding to provide treatment services to project youth. This collaboration has also strengthened the relationship between treatment providers and probation officers. The feedback system provides information regarding treatment progress or problems to probation officers. The TASC Specialist facilitates and coordinates the flow of information between treatment and probation. The TASC Specialist has been integrated into Jefferson County's Cooperative Council. This Council comprises representatives who identify gaps in services to youth and strategize to fill those gaps. Council meetings provide insight into the county response to juvenile problems and inform other county officials of the TASC model and its effect on delinquent youth. 24 To ensure that service professionals are familiar with the project and the juvenile justice system, the TASC Specialist coordinates ongoing training. This training prepares service professionals for eventual implementation of the program in other districts. Representatives from the First, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Judicial Districts were incorporated into the already existing TASC Management Team established by the DJJI TASC project. The Management Team also includes administrators from the Denver Juvenile Court, Department of Youth Services, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division, Office of Probation Services and TASC Supervisors. The team meets regularly to oversee planning and implementation of the TASC model, advise program management, and provide policy direction. Participants from all areas discuss how to make the program most effective. The project has also enhanced collaboration between the First Judicial District Probation Department and the Division of Youth Services. This link further helps to facilitate transfers and provide the most effective services to youth committed to the Division. Results and Impact Performance Measures The success of the Juvenile TASC project can be measured both quantitatively and qualitatively. No one measure determines success or failure. However, many performance indicators considered collectively suggest the level of success this project can achieve. Performance indicators include: number of TASC Management Team meetings per quarter and frequency of TASC Management Team meetings per month and level of participation by agencies involved; number of Operations Team meetings per quarter and frequency of Operations Team meetings per month and level of participation by members involved; type(s) of training provided and members participating in training session(s), number and frequency of training sessions per quarter, accessibility of training, quality of training manual and lesson plan, and knowledge and skill level of trainers; number and title of positions hired; level of communication between TASC Specialist and the courts and frequency with which the courts follow TASC recommendations; frequency with which the court orders substance abuse evaluations; 25 number of referrals accepted from probation; number and appropriateness of differential assessment tools used and number of differential assessments completed; efficiency of feedback between TASC Specialist and probation officers on the outcome of the assessment and recommended treatment; number of juveniles identified to be at each Prevention, Intervention, Treatment, and Aftercare level; number of appropriate referrals made by TASC Specialist to treatment and type of treatment provided; quality of communication and information shared between the probation officers, TASC Specialist, and treatment agency regarding client cases, and level of communication between the TASC Specialist and the juvenile; number of juveniles served per quarter and ratio of needs identified to needs met; accuracy of documentation of Juvenile TASC referrals and client contacts; number and frequency of treatment summaries ,received from, the treatment provider; number of progress reports from the TASC Specialist to probation officers; number of non-compliant juvenile offenders and clients placed in Jeopardy I status; level of parental involvement; number of clients needing TASC monitoring and the effectiveness of tracking; number of successful completions of the program versus number of terminations; service providers participating in the Adolescent Treatment Network (ATN) and number and frequency of ATN meetings per quarter; number of quantified service agreements received from all participating agencies; identification and description of gaps in service; number of meetings between the Chief Probation Officer and the Division of Youth Services (DYS) Central Region Director; and 26 quality of information shared between DYS and TASC and effectiveness of the transfer process between TASC and DYS. Implementation Problems and Successes As a result of the smooth implementation of the program, the number of referrals to the project was greater than projected. Because of the development of other program components, the TASC Specialist was unable to process the initial volume of cases at one time. In response to the high number of referrals from probation officers for assessment and the number of juveniles referred to the treatment services, parameters have been set in terms of the maximum number that the TASC Specialist can handle in a month. One obstacle to successful implementation was the coordination between the different actors in the program and their roles and the policies developed for the program. The Management Team helps to alleviate this problem by meeting to discuss policies and funding issues. Successes and Accomplishments Prior to the establishment of the Juvenile TASC program, probation officers had total discretion in testing juveniles for illegal use of substances and referring them to substance abuse treatment. Differential classification based on assessment was not available to probation officers, and monitoring was one of the numerous tasks the probation officer had to perform. As a result of the project's mandatory criteria for referral, the number of referrals to the TASC project and the number of evaluations completed are well above expectations. The project is identifying youth substance abuse levels, referring them immediately into treatment, and. monitoring them in treatment on a consistent basis through a centralized approach. The project has provided important information regarding the level of treatment as well as the types of substances being used by adolescents on probation, making collaboration with service providers more effective regarding appropriate treatment. This information is communicated on an ongoing basis in order to serve adolescents more effectively. Furthermore, the courts have been cooperative and seem to follow recommendations from the TASC Specialist. The collaboration between community-based treatment agencies and the project has been facilitated by the ATN, which provides treatment services to project youth. The bi-monthly ATN meetings have increased sensitivity to the needs of the juvenile offender population, increased communication between treatment agencies, expanded services for juveniles and their families, and increased accountability for client services. The level of communication between the TASC Specialist and the treatment agencies has been much better than originally expected. During the first year of the project, 146 differential evaluations were completed, or 165% of the stated goal. A total of 68 youth were enrolled in the treatment level during the first year grant cycle, or 136% of the projected goal. 27 By engaging the juvenile's family in assessment and treatment, TASC staff discovered that many times the juvenile offender's parents have substance abuse problems as well. With awareness of this problem, the TASC Specialist can recommend treatment to the parents in addition to their children. Prospects for Replication Since its inception, this project has focused on replication of the critical elements of the Juvenile TASC Model in other judicial districts. The model implemented in the First Judicial District was a replication project from the City and County of Denver. Documentation of policies and procedures addressing project components in the First Judicial District Probation Department TASC Project have been utilized to replicate the model in two large judicial districts in the Denver Metropolitan Area. During Fiscal Year 1994 and Fiscal Year 1995, a total of three replications have been realized. Presently, the TASC Model is operational in the First, Second, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Judicial Districts Probation Departments. The probation departments work together to ensure the integrity of the TASC Model.

Prior to the development of Project Stay Free, the curriculum at the Ferris School did not include a comprehensive aftercare component or preparation for release from incarceration. The establishment of Project Stay Free was based on the premise that every youth incarcerated in a secure care program will eventually return to the community from which they came. Therefore, it is necessary to provide supportive services that are truly grounded in the community and run by the community. Project Stay Free identified this need and has developed several programs targeted at this group of young people. Goals and Objectives The overall goal of Project Stay Free is to liberate the youth from the juvenile justice system so they do not become repeat offenders. Project objectives include: to provide intensive instruction, guidance, and supervision for 115 pre- and post- adjudicated males or females referred by the State Division of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS). to operate the Project Stay Free transformation phase system -- characterized by a high level of supervision and program control w to be progressively decreased as the youth displays a greater level of responsibility, respect, and discipline. to deliver or access a wide range of services guided by a continuously monitored, individualized service plan that focuses on instructing referred youth on the social and interpersonal skills necessary to maintain positive involvement with family, school, work, pro-social peers, and community institutions. to instruct, guide, and supervise the youth's family, where feasible, as a positive element of his or her support system. to instruct, guide, and supervise the development of relationships between the youth and law abiding persons/groups/institutions which can provide the following: 29 altemative role models; a source of rewards and sanctions external to the program; a network of community support; and a vehicle for disengagement from delinquent peer groups. to instruct and guide youth to develop competencies in the key areas of life skills, education, and employment, and to arrange and advocate for access to opportunities in these areas. to address the youth's individualized risk factors that impede functioning or pro- social attachments. to apply consistently a system of graduated rewards and sanctions that recognizes each youth's achievements and provides immediate accountability for violations of rules. Program Components Project Stay Free provides a combination of early reintegration and/or transition services for youth released from institutional placements; intensive supervision and case management services; and 24-hour on-call crisis intervention that gives the youth an opportunity to survive and progress at home, in school, on the job, and in the community. Each youth is expected to complete the four phases of a transformation process: Phase I, Intake and Assessment; Phase II, Instruction, Guidance and Supervision; Phase III, Accountability and Self Discipline; and Phase IV, Liberation. Expectations of length of participation in the program range from ten to twelve months depending upon the needed services and the overall progress of the youth. All youth enter the program at Phase I and advance to the next phase only after completing all responsibilities within the first phase. After the youth completes the four phases, he or she participates in a post-termination interview. For a period of 30 days the youth is monitored by telephone and receives follow-up support correspondence and program resource referrals as deemed necessary. From May 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992, Project Stay Free contracted to provide four core services: (1) Community Reintegration, (2) Diversionary Program, (3) In-Home Detention, and (4) Probation and Aftercare Assistance. Community Reintegration The Community Reintegration Program emphasizes the coordination of early reintegration activities and service preceding release from secure care. Intensive mentoring in the community emphasizing gradual re-entry and the development of social skills helps to prevent criminal behavior. 30 The project provides 90 days of intensive community interaction with the youth and their families, including case management, family therapy, career preparation, and culturally appropriate intervention. The program is divided into two phases. The institutional phase provides 30 days of reintegrafion activities that focus on preparing students and their families for release from the institution. The community phase provides a minimum of 60 days of intensive supervision, case management, and services at the community level. Project Stay Free's program structure requires youth referred by Ferris School case management staff participate in at least 30 days of programs and activities sponsored by the Project Stay Free Consortium. Programs and activities include daily African Rites of Passage, sponsored by the People Settlement Association at Fen'is School and one of the local Community Centers; a weekly Computer-Based Learning at Edgemoor Community Center; a weekly Career Awareness at West End Neighborhood House, Inc.; and the Project Aware Program at the Delaware Correctional Center. Upon release each youth is required to attend a minimum of three group counseling sessions with Project Stay Free and to abide by a curfew enforced by the parent. Diversionary Program The Diversionary program was designed as an extension of the reintegration services. The focus of the program is to serve youth on probation or in aftercare . :- who are having difficulty adjusting at home, in school, or in the community. Project Stay Free utilizes the community phase of the project to divert youth from incarceration, and has .~ ...... increased the number of slots available from five to fifteen. In-Home Detention Program The In-Home Detention Program is a non-secure detention alternative for youth who require supervision and support to remain at home and meet all court-ordered conditions of release such as scheduled appointments or court appearances. Youth accepted in the program are required to comply with all program conditions and are supervised by Project Stay Free staff. The objective is to provide the youth with the necessary services to impact the judicial decision made during the adjudicatory and/or dispositional proceeding to divert the youth from incarceration. During the period of supervision, and prior to formal case disposition, Project Stay Free develops a community service plan agreement to keep the youth at home. The plan makes individual assessments and identifies a combination of State and community resources to address his or her needs. Probation/Aftercare Assistance (Tracking) The Probation/Aftercare Assistance Program consists of three vital tracking services to ensure that referred youth abide by the conditions of their probation or aftercare and receive the full compliment of services offered by the DYRS and community. The overall goal of the program is to reduce the number of technical violations or arrests that result in incarceration. 31 \u00b8 Upon request from the DYRS, Project Stay Free staff perform the following tasks: Surveillance consists primarily of contacts with assigned youth that include visiting schools to ensure attendance, visiting work sites, and checking curfews by telephone and in person. Monitoring youth activities at home and in the community includes overseeing community service placements and the collection of restitution; and assisting in implementing sanctions, such as an at-home restriction program for youth who violate their probation and/or aftercare. Transportation Assistance is provided to youth and families who are otherwise unable to keep scheduled appointments for referral services. Programs and activities sponsoi'ed by the Project Stay Free include the following: Project Stay Free Consortium The Consortium provides a full range of community- and group-oriented structured services designed to develop a youth's daily living, social, leisure time, organizational, vocational, and community integration skills. Each youth referred and accepted into Phase I or Phase II of Project Stay Free is required to participate in some of these programs and activities. Organizations which participate in the Consortium include Latin American Community Center, Christina Cultural Arts Center, Edgemoor Community Center, West End Neighborhood House, and IAMBIEN Institute. Evening or Second City Program Upon initial acceptance in the program all youth are required to participate in Second City workshops and evening activities for 30 to 60 days. This enables Project Stay Free staff to establish order and respect for the program and outline the youth's and parents' responsibilities and the youth's behavioral restructuring. Project Stay Free established the Second City Program in direct response to the number of youth involved in violent acts and the drug culture after dark. As part of Second City, Project Stay Free provides structured programs and activities, and intensely monitors the youth's activities at home, in school, and in the community between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. HARAMBEE Center School Community Accepted youth may enroll in the Day Program at the HARAMBEE Center School Community, in addition to Second City workshops, programs, and services. The HARAMBEE Center School Community can serve a maximum of 25 students with a staff to student ratio of 1.5. The IAMBIEN Institute is responsible for the overall design, planning, and coordination of the holistic educational curriculum, and management of the day-to-day operations of the HARAMBEE Center School Community. Each youth enrolled in the school has an individual holistic education plan developed prior to the completion of Phase I. Additional services and programs are coordinated between HARAMBEE Center 32 School Community and Project Stay Free, with emphasis on making services gender specific and culturally appropriate. Project Stay Free staff are geographically located throughout the city of Wilmington and parts of New Castle County. Each Intervention Specialist is assigned between five and ten youths, for a period specified by the individual youth's needs and his or her ability to adjust. Each Intervention Specialist is responsible for assessing each youth, ensuring that he or she adheres to the conditions of his or her service plan agreement upon release, monitoring youth activities and behavior in the home and community, visiting the public schools or training programs attended by the youth, and meeting with the youth's counselor, parents, or other school personnel to discuss the youth's performance. The Intervention Specialist also visits the youth's place of residence at least twice a week; engages each youth in community center programs, and monitors attendance (based on the needs assessment); accompanies the youth to interviews, court appearances, and meetings with DYRS Case Managers; and conducts a monthly adjustment report on each youth. Also, Project Stay Free Staff are responsible for instructing and guiding youth to educational and vocational achievement, adult skills building, conflict resolution and mediation skills, manhood and womanhood training, computer-based learning, career awareness, and other topics that will motivate and encourage a youth to be liberated from the program. If individual or family counseling services are needed, Project Stay Free contracts a professional licensed therapist. Results and Impact Project Stay Free has evolved into a far more comprehensive program than originally imagined~ Since May 1991, each year the program has expanded both in number of youth served and in contract amount to accommodate the needs of youth who come in contact with the juvenile justice system. Performance Measures The first full year of operation, May 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, produced the following results. Project Stay Free served a total of 169 youth by providing a combination of reintegration services for youth released from institutional placement; diversionary services for youth in jeopardy of violating conditions of probation or aftercare; in-home detention services for youth who could be better served in the community; and tracking services for DYRS clients. Length of stay in the program ranges from four to twelve months, depending on the needs of the youth and his or her family. Of the four core services Project Stay Free was contracted to provide from May 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, the following outcomes were recorded: 33 Community Reintegration Since May 1991, Project Stay Free has provided reintegration service for a total of 77 youth prior to their release from Fen'is School. Realizing that the 90 day period was not enough time to provide a quality service, Project Stay Free extended intensive supervision for many cases from a minimum of three months to nine months after release. While some contact with the system is inevitable for many youth, penetration into the system can be minimized. With the extended period of service, Project Stay Free has been very effective in diverting youth from arrest or further formal court processing. Thirty-one of the 49 youth were successfully discharged from the project, with no major violations or incidents. Fourteen students (29%) have been in the community for over 12 months. Eight students (16%) have been in the community for nine months or more. Seven students (14%) have been in the community for six months or more. Twenty students (25%) have been in the community for three months or less. Forty-nine (49) youth are still in the community, twenty-nine (29) of which have been in the community for a period of six months or more. Diversionary Program Since implementation in August 1991, 15 youth have been served -- nine are still in the community; five have been placed in other institutions (such as Glen Mills and Ferris School); and the whereabouts of one is unknown. In-Home Detention Program Since February 1992, 17 youth have been referred to the in- home detention program. Through a cooperative agreement between the Family Court and the DYRS, court scheduling for a youth in-home detention-order was expedited and. referred ~ to -. Project Stay Free for services. Eleven youthswere placed' on probation or continued aftercare; ' one youth received a seven day commitment to Fen'is School; four youths were securely detained for violating court-ordered conditions and program conditions; and one youth was found non-amenable. Probation/Aftercare Assistance (Tracking) Since the inception of the tracking program in January 1992, Project Stay Free has provided services to 60 DYRS clients. Transportation services were provided to 36 youth; a combination of surveillance and monitoring services were provided to 17 youth; surveillance services were provided to four youth; and a combination of transportation and monitoring services were provided to three youth. Implementation Problems and Successes Although the original proposal clearly identified services to be provided and outlined a methodology to measure results, it did not address some major obstacles and barriers: How to effectively coordinate and utilize all project resources outlined in the proposal? How to implement a program that relies on the assistance and support of an institutional staff that has undergone considerable transition and scrutiny? How to motivate and prepare youth who have been institutionalized for transition? How to maintain community compassion for those youth who commit serious and violent offenses? The Consortium understood that these questions were not going to be answered in a three, six, or even 12-month period. However, a seed has 34 been planted; there is a reason for optimism and change. The attitude toward Project Stay Free after its initial implementation, changed dramatically from skepticism to acceptance and outright enthusiasm. As a result, the relationship that exists between Project Stay Free and Ferris School staff, and in general the Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services, has provided a better understanding of the problems that exist within the system and a renewed spirit to address each problem in a constructive manner. With the support of the State Division of Youth Rehabilitative Services and a budget of $854,000, Project Stay Free has created a balanced and more structured approach in providing alternative community-oriented services for youth. Successes and Accomplishments Project Stay Free is the first community-oriented program that is maintained in and operated by the community. It has implemented the only African Rites of Passage and Manhood Training Program in an institutional environment in the country. It is recognized by the City of Wilmington as an appropriate community-oriented intervention strategy for the city's youth. It has raised over $600,000 to complete renovations of a building that will enable Project Stay Free to be open seven days per week from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Since May 1991, the State supported the Consortium's efforts to expand, and increased its capacity to serve more youth who come in contact with the system. In addition, the State of Delaware awarded a contract to provide electronic monitoring for high-risk youth, established the Second City Program in direct response to the number of youth involved in violent acts and the drug culture, and increased staff size from four to a total of 20 full-time employees who live in the community. All staff are trained and knowledgeable in the area of youth development and are able to deal with the unique and sensitive needs of each youth. Project Stay Free has assisted the City of Wilmington in establishing a Youth Intervention Unit in the Police Department. The Consortium, the State of Delaware, and the community realize that Project Stay Free is an appropriate intervention strategy for youth to remain in the community. Subsequently, the Consortium is in a position to supplement and intensify the most appropriate services offered to youth in the custody of the State, while proactively influencing the way services are coordinated and administered to youth in the institution and community. Project Stay Free continues to advocate State institutional program standards conducive to the treatment, education, and counseling needs of all youth. In order to sustain itself past the formative years, Project Stay Free has undergone a reevaluation and a renewal process. This has forced the Consortium and the State to realize that an impact analysis is necessary to validate the achieved aims of the project. As a result, Project Stay Free has outlined an evaluation design scheduled to be implemented in July 1995. 35 Contact Information Tyrone Jones Director Project Stay Free Kingswood Community Center 2300 Bowers Street Wilmington, DE 19802 (302) 762-8229 (302) 762-5785 fax 36 Florida PACE Center for Girls, Inc. Statement of the Problem Historically, institutionalization has long been a cornerstone of the juvenile justice system's response to troubled girls. Commitments of girls to detention centers have declined somewhat, although girls are still more likely than boys to be incarcerated for status and minor offenses. Many girls in correctional settings have experienced physical and sexual abuse; nearly four out of five are runaways. Not surprisingly, most report that their first arrest was for running away from home (for the physical and sexual abuse that was occurring there) or for larceny theft. Studies of the conditions in the nation's detention centers and training schools indicate that rather than protecting girls, many neglect their needs and often victimize them. There are few programs at the State or national level designed to deal with this problem. Since troubled girls rarely become armed robbers, they are easier to ignore, and thus they often choose self-destructive alternatives. The transition to adolescence is a time of great psychological risk for girls, during which they are vulnerable to contracting sexually transmitted diseases, early childbearing, substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, suicide attempts, and dropping out of school. By the time they leave high school, 52% of teenage women have had sexual intercourse. The rate of STDs and AIDS is increasing among teenagers, especially females, and the STD rate is 2.5 times higher for females than for males. Among women aged 15 to 20, AIDS is the leading cause of death. Every day in America almost 3,000 girls become pregnant. There are an estimated one million teen pregnancies every year. In addition to the multiple health risks of teenage pregnancy, there is the increased likelihood that teen morns will drop out of school, thus lowering their chance for productive employment. Daily in this country over 1'500 teenage girls drop out of school, and every 35 seconds an infant is born to a mother who is not a high school graduate. Florida, like the rest of our country, has not addressed the needs of at-risk young women despite clear evidence of the connections between abuse, neglect, teen pregnancy, delinquency, high school dropout rate, substance abuse, and other destructive behaviors. Florida has the nation's highest youth suicide rate, and ranks fourth in the nation for teen pregnancy and parenting. Ninety percent of Florida's teen mothers are not in school. Not surprisingly, less than half of the teens who are parents before the age of 18 graduate from high school (Florida Demographic Conference, 1990: Florida Center for Children and Youth, 1990). PACE [Practical Academic Cultural Education] Center for Girls, Inc., is a unique gender-sensitive, nonprofit, nonresidential, community-based, educational and therapeutic intervention program designed to address the needs of at-risk girls. 37 Goals and Objectives The goal of PACE Center for Girls, Inc. is to improve the quality of life for at-risk girls. The purpose of the program is to prevent juvenile delinquency referrals, status offenses, high school dropouts, foster care referrals, and teen pregnancies. This is done by empowering young women to further their education, build self-esteem, and develop personal/social and family relationship skills so that they may become productive citizens. To achieve this goal, PACE provides accredited high school completion and basic skills education; develops and implements career placement plans; prevents substance abuse through education and counseling; prevents teenage pregnancies; teaches cultural awareness; enables young women to choose a safe environment free from violence and abuse; teaches responsible health choices; and encourages involvement and volunteerism in the community. Program Components PACE was incorporated in 1983 with a board of directors made up of five community volunteers. These volunteers were dedicated to making changes in the juvenile justice system as it related to the treatment of girls. The program opened in a donated room at the Snyder Memorial Methodist Church in downtown Jacksonville, Florida in 1985. PACE Center for Girls, Inc. currently serves nearly 300 girls daily throughout:Florida at seven program sites (Jacksonville, Bradenton, Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, Tallahassee, and Pensacola). An additional 729 students are served daily through the aftercare/follow-up component. PACE Center for Girls provides educational, counseling, and case management services to teenage girls aged 12 to 18 who are labeled status offenders, delinquents, runaways, truants, ungovemables, dependents, dropouts, incorrigibles, and unwed teen mothers. Services include enrollment in a fully accredited high school credit or General Equivalency Diploma (GED) program; gender-sensitive life management curriculum; individual, group and family counseling; and community service volunteer experience. Referrals/Intake PACE has an open referral process, and enrollment is voluntary. Referral sources include juvenile judges, Department of Health and Rehabilitation Services counselors, Department of Juvenile Justice personnel, community service agencies, school personnel, parents, family members, friends, and the students themselves. Students are accepted without regard to race, creed, or socio-economic background. PACE has designed a comprehensive intake process that is designed to determine individual needs. Staff utilize a wide range of resources during the assessment phase, including interviews, home visits, psychosocial assessments, psychiatric evaluations, and educational placement testing. 38 Comprehensive Education Education is the core of PACE. It is the key to addressing girls' broken homes, poverty, and low self-esteem. Each girl attends school while at PACE, and works toward her high school credit diploma or GED. The PACE staff/student ratio in academics is l:10. PACE is a fully accredited high school credit program which includes remedial, high school credit, GED (if applicable) examination, and college preparation. PACE has a scholarship fund to assist the girls with continued education after they graduate from PACE. Life Management The PACE curriculum features a gender-sensitive curriculum designed specifically for its students. SMARTGIRLS! (Students Making a Right Turn) consists of four modules that address the development of healthy choices. SMARTALK! assists girls in learning the importance of using appropriate language in varying situations, while ICE (Inclusive Cultural Education) focuses on the appreciation of cultural differences. PINK SLIPS highlights career awareness and the employment process, and SOS (SAVE OUR SISTERS) encompasses healthy lifestyle choices in regard to sexual activity, nutrition, and drugs. Counseling PACE treatment plans are specifically tailored to each student. Individual, group, and family counseling sessions are conducted regularly (weekly and monthly at a minimum). Often a girl's success is dependent upon family involvement. PACE strives to improve a family's commitment to their daughter. Staff is on call 24 hours a day. Each student is assigned an advisor who is responsible for compiling an individualized treatment plan, including monthly visits with parents or guardians, and documenting weekly progress toward short- and long-term goals. The advisor/student ratio is l:10. Individual, group and family counseling sessions are conducted regularly. Specialized therapeutic interventions include crisis counseling, grief and loss counseling, peer support, and cultural diversity groups. Community Service Projects PACE requires each girl to participate in at least two different community service projects while enrolled. Community service projects were initially a way to repay the community for their support. However, they also proved to enhance self-esteem and promote self-worth, which are integrally related to pride and involvement in a community. Community service projects allow the girls a unique opportunity to see themselves as individuals who are needed by others. Community service projects include serving lunch to the elderly, working with disabled and abused children, and working in homeless shelters. AfterearefFoilow-up PACE has developed a comprehensive three-year aftercare/follow- up/placement component for all students, whether they were successful or unsuccessful at PACE. This component consists of a one-year intensive aftercare program for students needing that service. Intensive aftercare includes individual treatment plans and comprehensive case management services. Education groups and therapeutic counseling services are also available. Follow-up consists of regular telephone contacts made with girls at three-month intervals during the second year after exit, and every six months thereafter to ensure that students continue with their education and employment. 39 Although the average length of stay is six months, the program is based upon individual needs, so length of stay varies. Girls are eligible for graduation after they have successfully completed their individual treatment plans. These plans typically include the completion of two community service projects, maintenance of a 92% attendance rate, demonstration of improved academic functioning (by receiving a high school diploma or advancing a minimum of one grade level and re-enrolling in their home school), and completion of life management courses. Results and Impact Performance Measures Semi-annual quality assurance reviews of all programs are conducted to ensure compliance with all grant and government mandates, as well as the minimum standards established by the PACE, Inc. Board of Directors. Personnel Policies and Procedures and Program Policies and Procedures are used as reference tools for all programs, to ensure the delivery of quality services. The quality assurance assessment is also designed to accomplish the following: assure the credibility of PACE programs through the provision of quality services; assure that the services provided by PACE are safe and effective and that they are meeting the needs of at-risk girls and their family members; assist in the identification of training and technical assistance needs; assist in inter-program education and the exchange of ideas among PACE programs; and assess pattern/trends related to young Women and gender issues. The following table represents the programmatic measurable objectives for PACE programs: Pro~,rammatic Measurable Obiectives State Standard Standard based on Years of Operations 0-1 Yr 2-4 Yrs Over 4 Yrs Monthly Attendance Average Daily Enrollment Favorable Exits Favorable Placements Number of days 225 Implementation Problems and Successes As PACE has grown from serving ten girls in the donated room of a church (1983), to serving over 1,000 girls daily in programs located across Florida in 1994, many challenges have been encountered. It has been a continuing challenge to balance honoring funding contracts and simultaneously meeting the needs of at-risk girls. The development of involved, local boards 40 of directors has proven to be a key element, not only in the long-term success of the program, but particularly in the viability of the program during the critical first year. Staffing also presented challenges, as PACE has broken the traditional mold for teachers. Developing teachers into \"teacher/advisors\" (a teacher/social worker hybrid) has presented its own set of training, development, and supervisory challenges. Geography has also presented challenges: the State Office in Jacksonville provides assistance to programs located as far as 400 miles away. Creative and dedicated board members and staff have been the solution to the challenges that growth and expansion have brought about. People whose vision is to provide excellent services to girls are those who have \"met the challenges,\" turning them into positive experiences. Staff work diligently to balance girls' needs with contract compliance. The State Office staff, under the direction of State Director, Dr. LaWanda Ravoira, has made board development and technical assistance to new programs high priorities. The role of teacher/advisor continues to grow and change. Several programs have adopted a dual component model in which an academic program manager and social services manager work under the direction of the executive director. The geographic challenges are being met with creative solutions such as training local program staff to co-facilitate training, and holding peer staff meetings and quarterly administrative meetings at program locations around the State. Successes and Accomplishments PACE Center for Girls has provided comprehensive services to over 1,800 young women since its inception in 1985. This year, as PACE celebrates ten years of successful work as a major voice and service provider for troubled girls, it continues to boast a documented 75\u00b0//0 success rate. Identified by the University of Michigan Center for Youth Policy as one of the most promising girls programs in the country, PACE was the 1987 winner of the Juvenile Judges Award for Most Outstanding Dependency Program in Florida. PACE was featured as a successful model on the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw (1993), and profiled in the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention National newsletter. PACE has been highlighted in the National Coalition of State Juvenile Justice Newsletter, and the Miami Herald wrote an editorial endorsement of PACE in 1992. In March 1995, Attorney General Janet Reno highlighted PACE's success during a news conference. Recently, the PACE Center for Girls received the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's 1994 Gould Wysinger Award, given to outstanding programs throughout the country. PACE has also entered the arena of public advocacy, convening the first National Girls' Caucus in Washington, DC; co-chairing the State of Florida Girls' Initiative; and delivering Congressional testimony to U.S. House of Representatives Education and Labor, Human Resource Subcommittee which resulted in the inclusion of girls in the Reauthorization of the 1992 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. ,:z\" 41 Prospects for Replication The positive effect of the PACE program was quickly evident as requests for expansion began pouring in from other areas of Florida. Based on the success of the Jacksonville program, PACE has been replicated in Bradenton (1989), Orlando (1991), Fort Lauderdale (1992), Miami (1992), Tallahassee (1993), and Pensacola, Florida (1993). PACE has also received numerous inquiries for national expansion. In response to this expansion, a detailed replication manual was designed to document the critically important development process, program elements, and funding requirements. The manual offers information about the formation of local boards, organizational structure, facilities, budgeting, staffing needs, fundraising, and public relations. The key to any PACE chapter's success is the combination of elements that makes the program unique: a blending of academic and social services, home visits, 24-hour availability of staff, individual treatment plans that honor the PACE mission statement, a holistic spectrum of services, and a staff-wide, statewide, organizational commitment to girls.

Instead of finding challenges in the classroom, many Chicago youth have been finding them on the streets and have created major challenges for the nation's third largest city. Murder rates, violent crimes, and gang activity are at an all-time high. Drug abuse and unwed motherhood continue to spiral out ofcontrol. The magnitude of these challenges will continue to increase as each generation .reaches maturity. Character education helps students to conquer the at-risk conditions that surround them. Growing up in playgrounds and street comers, urban youth are ill prepared to courageously and wisely confront the many moral decisions that assault them every day: cheating on a test, lying to a parent, shoplifting, etc. Going beyond personal behavior, character education also prepares one for success. Doug Heath, an author and ethics consultant, has conducted research that demonstrates that personal virtue, not academic grades or SAT scores, predicts success and well-being. Youth who live by values and principles have greater self-esteem and personal happiness, and they have it as a consequence of their good behavior. The Character Education Partnership (CEP) has been tracking the success of character education curricula in different school districts throughout the country. CEP is \"dedicated to developing civic virtue and moral character in our nation's youth as one means of creating a more compassionate and responsible society.\" Another example of the growing concern about helping youth to develop good character was a recent interview given by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros. He argued that most of the problems his agency deals with cannot be solved without finding a way to reconstitute families and, in particular, to instill a sense of responsibility in young men. \"One of the most important things we have to do is to find ways to re-engage fathers in the lives of their children,\" he noted. Goals and Objectives The Midtown Educational Foundation (MEF) aims to equip students for long-term success and happiness. This is done through four principal objectives: (1) motivating young people to strengthen their academic skills; (2) encouraging personal growth and development; (3) instilling a vision of service to the community; and (4) giving support and guidance to parents. 43 Program Components MEF is now entering its fourth decade of service to Chicago inner city youth. It operates two resource centers for youth, with after-school, Saturday, and summer hours: the Metro Achievement Center for girls and the Midtown Center for boys. Its students come from neighborhoods that frequently dominate the news. Ninety percent of MEF kids are African-American or Hispanic, and almost 70% of MEF families are in the \"very low income\" group. Participation in the program is voluntary. How does an after school program with a small core staff and a consistently low cost-per-student affect the academic performance and personal behavior of 800 at-risk youth? MEF's programs are centered on supplementary education. Its distinguishing characteristic is a highly effective character development program that imbues and enriches every activity of the centers. Crime, drugs, gangs, and teen pregnancy all involve moral decisions. Because of these challenges, there is a need to help young people develop good character so that they know and act upon values such as honesty, compassion, responsibility, and respect for self and others. This means delivering a consistent and clear message that is reinforced through the behavior of every staff member and volunteer. It means having a personal mentor for every child so that students can effectively integrate these values. MEF staff and volunteers act as positive role models. There is a permanent staff of 16 who recruit and train a volunteer corps of 375 people. Most of the latter are young professionals. Everyone involved with the centers is carefully selected to assure that they can project the virtues that are being communicated to the students. Moreover, ongoing training is given. Walgreens One-on-One Program (4-6 grade) - Young professional volunteers act as individual tutors/mentors for students. Weekly sessions aim to encourage good attitudes toward learning, assist students with homework, present positive role models, and develop in students the study habits associated with high achievers. In addition to tutoring, participants attend character development classes, athletic programs, and recreation and receive counseling. Midtown/Metro Achievement Program, MAP (7th & 8th grades) - Math, science, and English courses prepare students to enter a college preparatory high school, and ultimately, college. Character development is strongly emphasized. Individual mentors are provided. College Orientation Program, COP (9th to 12th grade) - Through this program, students build strong math and science skills by participating in a series of technically-based courses. They prepare for college entrance exams and explore college options. They participate in enriching activities such as Junior Achievement, Museum of Science & Industry Science Club, and Toastmasters in order to develop confidence and promote constructive ways to use free time. Individual mentors are also provided in this phase of the program. As stated earlier, there is a strong character education component in each of these programs. Each student has an adviser/mentor who meets with him/her individually on a weekly basis. 44 The adviser chats with the student, encouraging him/her to set realistic study goals, use time wisely, be a good son/daughter and sibling, and get along with other kids. Each week, the goals are reviewed and built upon. Students attend dynamic talks on values such as honesty, compassion, responsibility, cheerfulness, generosity, order, and respect for self and others. Volunteer service projects, including visits to elderly shut-ins and distribution of food to poor families, are made available to students. MEF views parents as partners in the scholastic and character education of children. It offers parents opportunities for enrichment, guidance, and support in their parenting role. Classes and seminars in parenting strategies, as well as personal interviews with their child's adviser/mentor, provide chances for parents to share experiences, service, and friendship with other families. Parents are exPected to assure regular program attendance by their children, cooperation with program requirements, and payment of a nominal fee for services. Results and Impact Performance Measures Tangible measures include outstanding high school and college graduation rates, student attendance, and avoidance of criminal or self-destructive behavior. There have been third-party evaluations by authorities such as the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago. In addition, there are testimonials by parents and tutors that provide many anecdotal examples of the small \"miracles\" being worked in students. Implementation Problems and Successes i Most recently, efforts at improvement have been made in three main areas: improving and expanding parenting programs; strengthening high school programs; and increasing contact with students of all age groups. The biggest obstacle is recruiting good volunteers. The program needs more volunteers to spend more individual time with the kids. According to Midtown Educational Foundation Executive Director Jim Palos, \"people are the key\" to the success of the program. The programs are based in the target neighborhoods. The downside of this is the segregation of Chicago neighborhoods, which hinders the integration and socialization of the kidS. Successes and Accomplishments Phone surveys of MEF graduates indicate that 95% graduate high school and 64% go on to college. The percentages for all Chicago students are, respectively, 51% and 14%. In a 1992 review of the Walgreens One-on-One Program, Dr. Joan Costello of the University of Chicago wrote, \"the One-on-One program at Midtown Center exudes vitality. It is a strong 9 45 mentoring program that fosters academic and character development through relationships, one by one. In short, it gives one a hopeful sense of what can be done when a capable organization helps one adult and one child to become friends and grow stronger together.\" In her conclusion she noted that it \"is an exemplary mentoring program, not a traditional tutoring program. Tutor/mentors in One-on-One serve as guides and role models who encourage academic achievement and character building through a relationship that goes well beyond homework help or teaching academic skills. Students have the opportunity to develop relationships with educationally and occupationally successful adults whose involvement with them on a weekly basis provides individual attention, interest and encouragement that few children, especially inner-city children, usually enjoy.\" Attendance at the Walgreens One-on-One Program is high, 87% for students and 78% for tutors. This has been attributed to the personal relationships that develop between students and tutors, the commitment of parents, and the staff's emphasis on reliability. To lead the parenting program, a full-time Parenting Coordinator was hired. Both Midtown and Metro have been increasing the frequency and quality of their parenting sessions. To increase contact with students, 1995 will be the first year that high school programs will run through the summer. Also, relationships with local universities are being strengthened to expand the resources available to high school students. Midtown has received commendations from corporate heads, U.S. presidents, Chicago mayors, and education experts. In addition, the One-on-One Program was chosen in 1993 as one of only 44 programs worldwide to join YouthNet, an initiative of the International Youth Foundation. These programs were selected from more than 2,000 applications for their excellence in meeting the needs of disadvantaged youth. Prospects for Replication Programs modeled on Midtown and Metro have begun in four cities: Boston, the South Bronx (NY), Washington, D.C., and Milwaukee. Some Midtown and Metro staff now work at these programs, and MEF has acted as an ongoing consultant to them. MEF is sharing its knowledge and experience in other ways. A class in character education for teachers is beginning this summer at the Metro Achievement Center. This graduate-level course is accredited by the University of Illinois at Chicago and will be offered through the school's education department. In 1994 the Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek, Michigan awarded a grant to document the MEF character building model. Six other youth-serving agencies requested that such a manual be developed so that these character building activities could be integrated into their programs. MEF personnel take part in education conferences and seminars, and MEF's Executive Director, Jim Palos, sits on the Illinois State Board of Education. 46 Contact Information Jim Palos Executive Director Midtown Educational Foundation 718 South Loomis Street Chicago, IL 60607 (312) 738-8301 (312) 738-8306 fax 47 Maryland Living Classrooms: Fresh Start and Tico Enterprises Statement of the Problem Many young people in Baltimore, particularly those who have repeatedly been in trouble with the law, have very little job experience. These youth typically come from very low-income, high-crime neighborhoods within the city. These areas lack social stability and offer few legitimate economic opportunities. Not surprisingly, they are also areas that are notorious for drug trafficking. Consequently, there is a need for economic development and job training, for youth in general and delinquents in particular, that are not getting the job training they need to survive. They need opportunities to complete their high school education or General Equivalency Diploma, and to receive training in employability and vocational skills. They also need to experience success and the enjoyment of learning. Living Classrooms seeks to provide these experiences in an employment model to help youth establish goals and turn their sense of hopelessness into one of opportunity. Living Classrooms' employment and entrepreneurialtraining programs serve juvenile offenders and other high-risk youth, aged sixteen to twenty, from Baltimore, Maryland. Goals and Objectives The goal of Living Classrooms is to provide at-risk and delinquent youth a chance to be productive members of the adult work force, thereby increasing self-esteem through hard work and accomplishment. The objectives of the Living Classrooms program are to: provide high-risk youth with a technical skills base in carpentry and the marine trades; provide these youth with training and practice in appropriate work-world behaviors and attitudes; set up a business with graduates of the vocational training program and train these youth in business techniques necessary for legitimate business enterprises; and establish a network of support among local companies, social service agencies, and community business leaders for the entrepreneurial training program. 48 Program Components On average, the participants in Living Classrooms have a history of eight to ten arrests, have dropped out of school after the first year of middle school, and live in the urban areas of Baltimore, which has a serious heroin problem. Students are on probation throughout the program and afterwards. Living Classrooms does not take murderers or sex offenders. Fresh Start and Tico Enterprises are two of 23 programs the Living Classrooms Foundation operates. The principles of Living Classrooms stem from a commitment to project-based education. The program employs the Socratic method throughout all activities to teach and reinforce important values and lessons. Instruction goes on throughout projects; it is not out of textbooks. Fresh Start Fresh Start takes in seven kids (and hopes to graduate five) five times per year. Sometimes probation officers refer clients, but programs are open to the community as well. Both men and women may participate. This first phase is a nine-month carpentry and boat building vocational program designed to teach broad-based employability skills, along with the trade and academic components. It is designed to mirror the workplace by placing students in small groups with an instructor acting as a supervisor. While there are opportunities for Fresh Start students to practice business skills (e.g., constructing a boat for a client), the second ~ phase is entirely based on the concept of business training. Tieo Enterprises This second phase is a student company program, Tico Enterprises, Inc, Tico Enterprises is a for-profit business operated by students with staff advisors providing business training. Tico Enterprises has its own Board of Directors. Students at present are aged 20 or older. Fifieen-year-olds are not accepted, and only some sixteen-year-olds may join, because Living Classrooms wants graduates to be able to enter the work force as soon as possible once they have completed the course. Very quickly during training there is a divergence between those who rise to the challenge and those who drop out within eight weeks. Tico Enterprises has participated in Baltimore's application to receive Empowerment Zone funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Tico Enterprises has business contracts worth $260,000 per year. Tico had a Harvard MBA volunteer for two years who helped design the business, Black and Decker has supplied Tico with equipment, and a pro bono corporate lawyer helped Tico secure a registered trademark. Students negotiate prices and sell boats on their own. Stipends are not offered; only cash for work is allowed. The students design their own projects, make their own calculations, and conduct profit-sharing directly. The program is small and flexible; if a student is skilled at computers and not wood work, then an attempt is made to find the student a position in the front office. .% 49 Results and Impact Performance Measures A measure of success is to have 80% of Fresh Start graduates enter employment and/or further education upon completion of the program and not be rearrested. Another anticipated result is that Tico Enterprises will be a profitable business and continue to provide the opportunity for high-risk youth to receive business training. Tico associates will, hopefully, gain skills and contacts that will be helpful to them in the future, and will earn a living through legitimate enterprises. There are seven criteria by which the success of the students is determined: punctuality, cooperation, self-motivation, efficiency, professionalism, completion of tasks, and quality of work. Violence is not tolerated. Implementation Problems and Successes Problems in Fresh Start result from students' living situations. Most students live in a dormitory residence run by Juvenile Services. These students receive transportation to and from the site as well as excellent care from a staff that is united with Living Classrooms staff in terms of program objectives. However, the program has always struggled with a shortage of staff and bed space at the residential facility. The program also enrolls some youth who come from their homes, who are difficult to retain in the Program. The student company -- Tico Enterprises -- was initiated in 1992 to respond to our Fresh Start graduates' further needs for jobs and training, and to their interest in becoming business owners. Since that time, the company has named itself, developed a logo, become legally incorporated, written bylaws, and developed and marketed products. The company provides full-time employment for four associates (students) and three staff advisors, and has a Board of Directors with eleven members. One of Tico's great successes has been in networking with local business people. Many of these people have a sincere desire to help our youth and are delighted to serve on the Board of Directors, and provide consulting, pro bono legal assistance, office equipment, and business contacts. Tapping into the business community as opposed to depending solely on grant monies has widened our ideas on creating sustainable programs that are a real part of the community. One of the problems in implementing Tico has been the difficulty of balancing the business with the educational program. In order for the program to be successful (i.e., to provide a real business environment as a teaching platform) significant energy and time has to be spent in the nuts and bolts of operating the business. The obvious \"Catch-22\" is that there is less purely instructional time than anticipated. There have also been problems for the staff in trying to instill in students the consistent motivational drive that is necessary for entrepreneurship. 50 Successes and Accomplishments Fresh Start has been in operation since 1990. Of the 30 graduates, 22 are presently holding jobs. Those in regular employment are role models for others still in the program. Participants know that if they work hard, they will earn the reward of paid work. This program has been consistently funded by the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services to provide employment training for delinquent youth. The program's success stems from a talented and caring staff working in small groups with students, and from a high integrity level. The no-violence policy has led to a completely safe workplace. Students are held to high work and behavioral standards, which in turn demonstrates a belief in their ability to reach those standards. Within the last year, Baltimore City schools placed two certified high school teachers on site, allowing better academic service to the students. The program developed a project-based curriculum in academic subject areas as well as in GED preparation. Success of participants is measured by using the Harter Scale, as well as in-house technical assessment. Through Ph.D. evaluators, Living Classrooms has developed a tool to evaluate development of desired characteristics in graduates, such as empathy and anger management skills. Often students are functionally homeless during and after the program. This program. helps them to find a place to live in the area. One success story from Fresh Start concerns a young man who had a drug problem. He stopped using drugs and was admitted to Fresh Start. As a result of his commitment to staying drug free, the rest of his family eventually stopped using drugs. All six family members are now working. That the Fresh Start student became clean and employed created change within his family system. When one family member breaks the dysfunctional system, it creates an environment for the development of a healthy family system. Obstacles have arisen primarily in dealing with mental health and human services professionals. Living Classrooms does not get enough referrals from them, because information does not travel through systems efficiently. We are very active in recruiting participants. In fact, we call probation officers regularly to recruit candidates. Prospects for Replication Living Classrooms has been given a three-year demonstration grant for both phases of this project from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family and Youth Services Bureau. Since the beginning of the project, Living Classrooms has documented activities, problems, and significant findings in narrative quarterly reports. At the end of the three years, a manual detailing the entire project will be made available nationally. Independent evaluators are also working on ongoing and final evaluation reports. This entrepreneurial model is highly replicable elsewhere. 2 51 Contact Information Edmund Snodgrass Director Education Programs Living Classrooms Foundation The Lighthouse, Pier 5 717 Eastern Avenue Baltimore, MD 21202 (410) 685-0295 (410) 752-8433 fax 52 Mississippi Mississippi Children's Advocacy Center Project Statement of the Problem Although all victims of crime benefit from therapeutic support and treatment, child victims are often forgotten, either as a result of system neglect or because families do not have the resources needed to get help for their children. The trauma suffered by children at the hands of others can cause lifetime impairmentincluding emotional, psychological, and physical problems. Of particular concern are child victims of sexual abuse who may suffer a plethora of symptoms ranging from physical complaints, difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, lack of trust, broken homes, guilt, shame, decreased self-esteem, nightmares, and numerous other behavioral problems, such as increased aggressiveness, alcohol/drug abuse, inappropriate sexual behavior and promiscuity, numbing of emotions, difficulty concentrating, school problems, running away, depression, withdrawal, and self-injurious behaviors. If these victims are treated soon after the crime occurs, the child sexual abuse victim has a better chance, of healing and developing into a healthy and productive citizen. If untreated, a child victim may grow into a depressed and maladaptive person or a perpetrator him/herself. Many child victims of familial sexual abuse fear retribution by the perpetrator or by other family members who do not believe that the abuse occurred. Thus the time when the victim needs family support the most becomes the time when the family can not cope enough to support the child. Often these factors and the stress within the family cause the child sexual abuse victim to recant his/her abuse disclosure, making prosecution almost impossible. In order to provide services for the victims of child sexual abuse, emphasis needs to be placed not only on the child, but also on the non-offending family members. Professionals working within the system need to coordinate their victim service efforts. Often children are interviewed many times throughout an investigation by criminal justice and child protection agencies, causing the child to relive the trauma of the event(s) over and over again, typically increasing the child's fear of the system as well as his/her apathy toward the professionals involved in the case. The problem is intensified by professionals who either have inadequate interview training or none at all in interviewing the child sexual abuse victim. This creates an atmosphere in which there is a strong risk of alienating the child victim and frustrating both the child and the professional when information is not adequately obtained. 53 Goals and Objectives The primary goal of the Mississippi Children's Advocacy Center (MCAC) is to protect and rebuild the child sexual abuse victim. Another goal of the MCAC is to create a multidisciplinary approach to the handling of child abuse cases and to facilitate a support system for the child throughout the criminal court process. Currently the MCAC is able to provide services to the child victim and the criminal justice system in the form of free, therapy- based forensic interviews and psychotherapy. Based on the experience of MCAC to date, it appears that there are four problem areas related to serving the child victims of sexual abuse that must be met to achieve the MCAC's goals. First, hard data needs to be collected on the victims. Hard data is defined as psychological inventories and tests that show the behavioral and psychological difficulties that the child victims are experiencing. This is typically lacking for the child victim of sexual abuse. As a result, expert testimony often relies on the expert's opinion, which may not be sufficient to convince a judge or jury. Second, non-offending parents need to be educated on the dynamics of child sexual abuse, methods for coping with abuse, ways to deal with the child victim, and ways to handle the court system. Groups need to be formed to prepare non-offending parents/family members for what to expect from their child victim and how to better handle their own stress as well as problems that arise. Third, the child victims need to be prepared for participation in the criminal justice system. They need to be briefed on the processes of the court system and the realistic outcome possibilities of their case, in terms that they can understand. A child who must face the system with no understanding of it can break down or recant his or her disclosure of abuse. The court system's officials and prosecutors seldom have time to prepare victims and witnesses properly. Fourth, to prevent the child from being revictimized by the system, professionals involved in the child's case need to be educated on the dynamics of child abuse, how to interview and relate to children, and how to form and use the multidisciplinary approach to cases. Program Components The Mississippi Children's Advocacy Center is centralized and coordinated within the community to oversee the treatment of child victims and insure that children receive counseling and support and are not revictimized by the system. This central unit provides training and support services to law enforcement, district attorneys, social workers, and other professionals involved in the process. This center uses the multidisciplinary team approach to serve the needs of the child sexual abuse victim. The MCAC was established not only to provide counseling and support for child victims of sexual abuse, but to serve as a liaison between other professionals involved in the case, so that information is exchanged freely between 54 professionals. Currently, the MCAC provides services for approximately 400 children per year. Roughly 95% of these children are possible victims of sexual abuse. The therapists at the center provide forensic interviews that can be forwarded to the child protective service worker, law enforcement, prosecution, and the judiciary. These therapists provide therapy for child sexual abuse victims on a short-term basis. Within the past fiscal year, over 50% of the cases that have been referred to the MCAC have been substantiated cases of child sexual abuse, closely matching the national average. While most of these cases go to the Youth Court, only a small percentage result in criminal prosecution. Many activities are performed under the MCAC project. Psychological hard data is collected on children who have been determined to be victims of child sexual abuse, have a supportive non-offending parent or guardian, and may testify in court. The parent or guardian fills out the Child Behavior Checklist, a Conner's Rating Scale, and a Child Sexual Behaviors Inventory. The child's primary teacher is asked to complete the Conner's Teacher Rating Scale to provide corroborative data. The child victim completes a Child Depression Inventory and a personality inventory. This data is scored and analyzed for each child, and the results are included in the child's clinical summary report. Summary data on cases is compiled and kept as a database for reference. The psychologist at MCAC develops the curriculum and recruits members for the non- offending guardian group. Group members are accepted from the MCAC caseload and through referrals from community and criminal justice agencies. Group members must be willing to attend meetings and read all distributed materials. A questionnaire is completed upon entering and exiting the group to assess the knowledge gained. The psychologist develops the curriculum and recruits members for the court preparation group. Child victims who are required to testify in court are selected for this group. The group lasts several weeks and includes: actual courtroom visits with the child; age-appropriate education on the court system; a forum for exploring fears about the legal process and how to overcome those fears; parent-child sessions to exchange ideas and educate parents on what they can do to support their child; and a class about what to expect on the trial day. Prosecutors, victim/witness coordinators, and judges are invited to speak to this group. Training is provided for professionals working with child victims of sexual abuse. This training includes learning successful interviewing skills, speaking the language of children, and running multidisciplinary processes. Training is given on using the Children's Advocacy Center. The Mississippi Children's Advocacy Center staff consists of two full-time therapists, one part- time therapist, a program director, and an administrative assistant. Collegiate-level interns in related fields are used when available. 55 Results and Impact Performance Measures The areas outlined for this project are evaluated as follows: the number of child sexual abuse victims who have completed the data requested and the number of completed clinical reports for these same children; the results of non-offending guardian groups is counted and based on entry and exit questionnaires; the results of the Court Preparation Groups are recorded; the surveys assess the effectiveness of the two types of groups; and a summary of each training program is prepared indicating attendees and their backgrounds, along with a rating questionnaire to assess training effectiveness. Implementation Problems and Successes One problem with the program was a lack of collaboration, Another problem was opening the educational system to volunteer information about the children to the court system or the psychologist. Successes and Accomplishments The impact to date for this project has been extremely pleasing. The MCAC helped implement and participates in a multidisciplinary team in the three metro counties that make up its primary service area. Training and consulting has provided improved handling of child victim cases in the child protection and criminal justice fields. There is a fluid line of communication with area law enforcement to respond to their needs related to investigations. There are at least 25 hard data cases evaluated in a project year to meet objectives and provide a foundation for the creation of a data base. Prospects for Replication The program, one of 140 centers across the country, is easily replicated. To be successful, a center must meet the needs of its community. Each center is slightly different to accommodate each community, but the goal to create a multidisciplinary environment that supports the abused child is the same. A full member of the National Network of Children's Advocacy Centers is required to make a site visit to a proposed member center, perform an evaluation, 56 and present the evaluation findings before the Board of Directors of the Network before a center is accredited.

Moreover, there continues to be a lack of public and professional awareness, information, and training on how to serve chemically abusing children, including where and how services may be acquired. According to the 1992 report to the governor and people of Minnesota from the Action for Children Commission, Kids Can't Wait: Action for Minnesota's Children: since 1980, the number of single parent families in Minnesota has grown by 42%; one child in five now lives in poverty in Minnesota, and from 1979 to 1989, child poverty increased 78% compared to a national increase of 26%; approximately 69,000 children have no health insurance, making up 18% of the State's 370,000 uninsured people; 65% of the 50,000 Minnesota families that turned to food shelves for help in 1990 included children under 18 years of age; approximately 50,000 Minnesota children aged five to twelve have no adult supervision after school, and children who are regularly home alone after school for 11 or more hours a week are more likely to use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; on a daily basis, children spend less time with caring adults than ever before, and the average time parents spent with their children decreased by ten hours per week from 1960 to 1986; alcohol use is widespread among Minnesota teenagers, but is often ignored or sanctioned by parents and other adults; children of color are experiencing greater feelings of exclusion from their schools and from the larger community in which they live; and 58 the 1990 dropout rate for African American students in Minnesota was 13.1%, 12.4% for Native Americans, and 9.9% for Hispanics compared to 2.8% for white students. The Minnesota Department of Education conducts a Minnesota Student Survey every three years of students in grades 6, 9, and 12. Survey results reveal that three out of four high school seniors have used alcohol at least occasionally during the previous year, as have almost half of the ninth-graders. Twenty-two percent of the seniors and 15% of the ninth-graders have used at least one drug other than alcohol or tobacco during the previous year. Among the sixth-graders, one in ten students has used alcohol or drugs during the previous year. The author concludes: \"High school seniors who started drinking before the age of 14 have a 40% probability of problem use compared with a 10% probability of problem use if they started drinking at age 15 or older.\" The Tri-Ethnic Center for Prevention Research, in Fort Collins, Colorado, conducted a drug and alcohol use survey of the Northeast Minnesota Native American reservation school students in September 1990 utilizing the American Drug and Alcohol Survey. Of the 4th through 6th grade students who completed the survey, lifetime prevalence results show that 24% have used alcohol, 10% have been drunk, 27% have smoked cigarettes, 13% have abused inhalants, and 8% have smoked marijuana. Young people who are abusing alcohol and other drugs require levels of service unheard of in the human services ten years ago. They are experiencing a myriad of problems that require much more time, energy, and attention. Many Minnesota communities have programs that demonstrate strong collaboration and partnerships, which ensure that families receive the best services possible. Most services, however, are designed to \"fix\" problems with little appreciation or understanding of the child/family's cultural or ethnic background. Family needs are different, and family problems have changed dramatically over the years. The current system does not have the capacity to respond fully to current family needs. Many times family members participate in several different programs with little or no coordination. Too often, the system requires clear family trouble before it can get help. Alcohol or other drug abuse is only one of the many serious and longstanding problems confronting families who come to the attention of the children's welfare or corrections systems. For many, chemical abuse arises in the context of poverty, substandard housing or homelessness, the absence of community and family support services, and pervasive feelings of alienation and hopelessness. Oftentimes, chemical dependency occurs in areas that lack needed services and are \"run down\" and sometimes dangerous. These areas often are rejected by the larger society, and the families who live in them experience that sense of rejection. Chemical abuse and dependency add to the sense of powerlessness and social isolation that these children and families experience. To adequately address and deal with children's chemical use, children and families must have access to a wide range of preventive and supportive services including alcohol and drug education, medical care, parental support, parent education, employment and educational counseling, assistance in locating adequate housing and 59 transportation, and access to income resources. The Eden Children's Project was developed in 1989 through a grant from the Minnesota Department of Human Services to address these and other issues related to children's use of mind-altering chemicals. It is the only program of its kind in Minnesota. Goals and Objectives The goals of the project are to: (1) decrease chemical use among children, aged 14 and younger, through case management, community education, and networking; (2) maximize use of available community resources on behalf of children who are using mind-altering chemicals; and (3) increase professional service providers' knowledge and skills regarding children's chemical use prevention, intervention, and treatment. Program Components The Eden Statewide Children's Chemical Health Services Project provides case management services to children abusing chemicals aged 14 and younger. The project includes a Project Director and three Children's Intervention Specialists (CIS) including: 1) a Native American whose sole responsibility is to provide services to Minnesota Native American families; 2) a Chicana who provides services to Hispanic families in central Minnesota; and 3) a CIS from the general population to provide services for children who are abusing chemicals. These Children's Intervention Specialists provide services in two areas: Direct Case Management and Education, Consultation, and Training. Children's Intervention Specialists are familiar with the particular cultures they are dealing with are bilingual, are familiar with child development, chemical dependency, and alcohol abuse, and are able to work well with people. Direct Case Management The Children's Intervention Specialists provide case management services to chemical-abusing young children and their families. The case management services include on-site, in-home, culturally-sensitive, community-based intervention, treatment, and referral services that address both the child's chemical use and underlying problems that give rise to dysfunctional patterns. The primary strategy is to stabilize the child and family, creating new services as well as utilizing existing community resources. Education, Consultation, and Training The Project Director and three Children's Intervention Specialists network with and provide education and training to community service professionals including child welfare workers, school personnel, chemical dependency counselors, probation officers, police, community groups, and other identifiable groups working with children in areas related to substance abuse among children. The purpose is to develop collaborative strategies to begin reexamining and restructuring existing children and family services. 60 In providing intervention, referral, and counseling services to children, the Children's Intervention Specialists counsel, advocate, and guide children and their families to be proactive and responsible. They coordinate existing community services and obtain the necessary support to alleviate the problem of chemical abuse and other problem areas as needed. They meet with families in the community and in their own homes as they work to educate, support, and empower families in their own prevention plans. Results and Impact Performance Measures A great deal of data from both the direct service component and the education and training component of the project is collected and analyzed. In order to evaluate the progress of the child and other family members, an initial assessment and follow-up assessments are completed at six-month intervals. In order to evaluate improvement of professionals' knowledge and skill levels at the education and training seminars, participant self-assessment forms are distributed. Additionally, parent satisfaction and service satisfaction forms are collected at various intervals to obtain opinions on project activities. A file is maintained for each child which includes the child's chemical health assessment, a' child and family needs assessment, a case management record, a Strickland Nowicki Locus of Control assessment, a Louisville Behavior Checklist, a Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, treatment plans, progress notes, a case contact sheet, and other data pertinent to the case. Monthly written reports are completed by the Children's Intervention Specialists. The Project Director submits a written Quarterly Progress Report to the State of Minnesota. An independent professional evaluation expert was contracted in 1992 to develop the project's evaluation instruments. The evaluator also analyzed the case management records for 1994 and prepared a summary report of the findings. Implementation Problems and Successes The project has been highly successful and well received by all sections of the State. The project is regularly featured in television and print media. Requests for services are received daily. Staff burnout is a consideration due to long hours, extensive travel, and the need to deal continually with highly dysfunctional families. Staff turnover within county social service and probation departments is challenging. There is high staff turnover, so that project staff are continually having to introduce themselves to new staff who are not familiar with the history of their inherited caseload. This rapid staff turnover is especially disruptive for the family. In order to ensure the retention of project staff, a generous salary and benefits are provided. 61 Successes and Accomplishments Sixty case management records, based on the initial assessment of the family needs, were completed by the Children's Intervention Specialists during the 1994 project year. A follow-up case management record assessment was also completed for 48 of the 60 families. The children ranged in age from 8 to 17, with half of the children 12 years old or younger. Fifty- eight percent of the children had used inhalants during the thirty days prior to referral to the project, about half had used tobacco, half had used alcohol, and about one-fourth had smoked marijuana. Other than the use of chemicals and inhalants, the most common issue was social isolation and withdrawal followed by nutrition, court involvement, depression/suicide, hostile/violent behavior, irrational behavior, lack of organized recreational activities, and absence from the home. The quality of parent-child relationships was usually poor. Three-fourths of the parents used alcohol at least once during the thirty days prior to the referral and 10% had smoked marijuana. Thirteen percent of the mothers and 29% of the fathers had received chemical dependency treatment in the past. The parents typically lacked: recognition of problems; motivation to solve problems; support from friends and family; support from agencies; self-esteem/confidence; and housing stability. The project's evaluation results reveal that: the children's use of tobacco, alcohol, and inhalants decreased between the assessment at referral and follow-up: 78% of the children did not use alcohol during the thirty days prior to the follow-up assessment, compared with 51% at the time of / referral to the program; of the 26 children who had used inhalants during the 30 days before referral, 73% of these children had not used inhalants during the 30 days prior to the follow-up; and the children showed improvement regarding social isolation/withdrawal, relationships with their parents, parent involvement in school, and school behavior. Eighty-eight percent of the parents reported that the project was \"a lot\" of help to their families. Three-fourths of the parents also indicated that they received \"a lot\" of help regarding: understanding better the needs of their children; getting through difficult times by being able to talk about their concerns; helping their children work through some of their concerns; improving communication with their children; finding community agencies that give families support; and setting goals and finding ways to change their behavior. 62 A pre-test, post-test, and six-month follow-up participant self-assessment evaluation form is used for the education and training seminars. Twelve all-day training seminars were conducted throughout Minnesota in 1994. Training participants included chemical dependency treatment staff, county social services, mental health, and corrections staff, police and sheriff's department personnel, school teachers and counselors, and various other service professionals. Two hundred and forty pre-test, 224 post-test, and 47 six-month follow-up participant self- assessment forms were collected. Pre-test data revealed that less than half of the participants reported good/excellent knowledge or skill level in the 18 areas measured. Post-test data revealed a marked increase in knowledge and skill level, and follow-up data indicated that training participants integrated their learned knowledge and skills into their professional and personal lives. The project was instrumental in the passage of new State legislation regarding the sale and use of inhalants by children. More than 1,000 Education and Training Seminars have been conducted since June 1989. Project staff have presented at numerous major Minnesota conferences as well as national conferences. The project is a member of the National Inhalant Abuse Prevention Coalition and an associate member of the Regional Alcohol and Drug Awareness Resource (RADAR) Network consisting of resource centers in more than 1,200 locations around the nation. The project is connected to the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention's (CSAP) computer-based message and information service used to exchange ideas and information around the nation. The project developed a school-based inhalant abuse. prevention curriculum which is utilized throughout Minnesota as well as several other states and Canada. Thousands of K-12 Minnesota school children have attended the inhalant abuse prevention class. Hundreds of Minnesota teachers and school personnel have been educated and trained in the use of the curriculum. Several children's inhalant abuse prevention information pamphlets have been developed in three languages. The project has provided direct services to more than 200 families with children who are abusing chemicals. Prospects for Replication This project can be implemented within any community/State withease utilizing the established written program materials. Successfully implementing the project requires the support of a State agency. Developing an advisory committee consisting of key individuals including representatives from the Department of Human Services, the Department of Corrections, the Sheriff's Office or Police Department, the school system, the community, and a social worker is a must. Securing long-term, consistent funding from more than one source is recommended. Establishing the project via a grant program is also recommended to buffer the staff from State, County, or local politics. Staff must be self-starters, motivated, culturally-sensitive, flexible, and committed. The Project Director must be open-minded and totally enthusiastic in the project's mission. 63 Contact Information Mark Groves Director The Eden Children's Project 1035 Franklin Avenue East Minneapolis, MN 55404 (612) 874-9441 \\(612) 874-0023 fax 64 Montana Rocky Top Academy Statement of the Problem Drug abuse and violent crime statistics are dominated by young males. While statistical models show correlations between arrests and community poverty and urbanization, personal conditions become relevant as the individual adolescent begins to seek chemical and violent solutions to his problems. Family and school problems accelerate, usually associated with rejections of authority, grades drop, involvement in physical recreation declines, job attendance becomes uneven, and diet changes radically. In addition, the potential suspect makes a willful change in his patterns of friendship, and he often cultivates a group of adolescents with behavior like his recently affected behavior. It is at this point in the youth's social decline that Rocky Top Academy, a special purpose private school, receives its students. At this point, conventional school and the youth's parents feel they can no longer control the student and that he is headed for a serious encounter with the legal system. Rocky Top Academy is a place to rebuild a life that may be thrown away without intervention. Goals and Objectives Rocky Top Academy has as its goal the restoration of the troubled adolescent to the healthier academic, physical, and social habits he had before he embraced poor behaviors. While it may be true from a psychiatric standpoint that negative behavior patterns are merely symptomatic of a deeper problem, it is the behavior that creates legal problems. It is also true that a productive life is more conducive to a sense of well-being than a life that is destructive. Rocky Top Academy's goals are three-fold: to restore mental and physical health; to. rebuild the connection between the alienated youth and the rest of the physical and social world; and to return the student to his home and school, in regular classes, at an age-appropriate level. The staff and consultants of the Academy have developed specific objectives to support these goals: (1) to construct a surrogate \"extended family,\" in order to provide an immediate working model of a community; (2) to replace the artificial stimulation of drugs with the real excitement of challenging physical activities, supported by a wholesome diet, in a clean outdoor setting; (3) to initiate study habits leading to conventional academic discipline; (4) to teach experiential education that promotes confidence and self-esteem; (5) to introduce the youth to responsibility within his school and community; and (6) to re-establish constructive contact with his family. 65 Program Components The program is a residential school which deals with disruptive behavior, learning disabilities, and drug, emotional, social, and authority problems. The school accepts only males age 12 to 18. Students may have been declined at other boarding schools and at military school because of discipline problems. Students enter at different times of the year and stay nine to 12 months. Some students stay until high school graduation. The program costs approximately $2,000 per child per year. Positive Peer Pressure Rocky Top uses the positive peer group model as the primary method of discipline. In order to participate in the numerous recreational activities available in the program, the entire student body has to earn the privilege as a group. When a single student decides not to cooperate, it is up to the other students to give that student the direction, assistance, encouragement, and motivation needed. Positive peer pressure is also evidenced in group meetings addressing conflict resolution, community building, student organization, and self-improvement. In order to demonstrate the interconnection of authority and community, most decisions regarding individuals or the group are made by a committee including students, staff, teachers, administrators, and mental health professionals, when necessary. The group is charged with devising practical and agreeable solutions to accomplish established goals. Students enforce their decisions with discussion and cooperation and are discouraged from referring to artificial external authority to solve problems. Nutrition for Healthy Bodies and Minds Food is cooked by professional staff with the help of students. Food service is one of the occupational training options for students, but all students share in kitchen chores. Meals are served family style. Students and staff clean up. A balanced diet is selected, avoiding processed foods, simple sugars, and preservatives. Academic Discipline: Failure is Not an Option At both the high school and middle school levels, the academic program at Rocky Top Academy is individualized. Through evaluation of school records and informal and standardized testing, a starting point is determined for each incoming student, and an educational plan is designed to make up for the lack of basic skills or courses needed to bring the student to the age-appropriate level and to progress from that point. Each concept is worked upon until it is mastered, allowing each student to work at his own pace. To monitor progress to the ninth grade, basic skills checklists are used that combine those skills outlined in the Brigance Inventory of Basic Skills, the Curriculum Guide of the State of Montana, and other lists of competencies drawn from State curriculum guides and textbook publishers. 66 Part of the high school curriculum is based upon the University of Nebraska design, where each course has its own syllabus providing both instructional and testing components. Self- check tests are conducted at the end of each unit along with instructor-administered tests. The remainder of the curriculum takes place in a group setting. This includes literature, social studies, foreign language, and current events. The group setting is used to increase the involvement and interaction of the student in the matter being studied. Experiential Physical and Emotional Education To make the connection between human endeavor and the real world, students' physical exercise is integrated with the social and physical environment and connected with academic studies. For example, in summer 1994 the faculty directed student projects toward regional issues: ecology, exploration, Native Americans, resource industries, animal conservation, and geology. An all-school trip to Yellowstone National Park incorporated outdoor adventure, abundant exercise, and opportunities to advance their studies, with the enthusiastic cooperation of the National Park Service staff. Physical and emotional education is tied with academic advances. After the classroom preparation for the Yellowstone expedition and the field trip itself, each student wrote an additional project paper. The thesis of each paper was to answer the question: \"What is my place in what I have seen?\" Students learn first-hand the rewards and the excitement of being competent and connected. Recreational Program The recreation program at Rocky Top Academy plays a major role in the building of self-esteem. It also establishes a framework in which students can practice the setting and meeting of goals, expansion of potential, and positive group interaction. As part of the recreational program, organized noncompetitive sports activities are designed to enhance the well-being of students. The goal is to get all students excited about participating. Using the peer group approach, with a team only as strong as all of its members, there is a place for everyone, regardless of athletic abilities. Each team works to help all students compete intramurally. One of the highly effective aspects of the recreational program is that martial arts are taught to studems with histories of violence. Social violence is often a function of the feeling of powerlessness and the lack of discipline. Every boxer, wrestler, or student of karate learns to fight on command and to stop on command, execute learned techniques in a chaotic environment, and think while fighting. This discipline is the reason competitive combative athletes almost never fight outside their sports, and why the students cease fighting as soon as they start training. Juvenile Delinquent Judo: Make the Irresponsible Responsible In the real world, Academy students were not responsible for misbehavior. At the Academy, they are given authority over the areas where they are deficient. If they do not satisfy the demands, their peers are quick to redirect the leader's efforts, since they and the offender suffer privilege loss if goals are not met. This is one of the most expedient, direct, and effective programs. 67 Close Encounters: Rediscovering the Family Students are encouraged to phone their family members, especially their parents. More useful in the experience of Rocky Top staff is the practice of regular letter writing. Not only are academic purposes served, but there is an integration of newly leamed reasoning, problem-solving, and conflict resolution skills at an appropriate and temper-reducing distance when family issues are committed to paper. Results and Impact Performance Measures Some of the means to measure the success of this program are the number of completed school assignments and raised grades; the added physical skills, willingness to participate, and reduced combativeness; the successful completion of school and housekeeping tasks, avoidance of friction, and cooperation with others; and the visits, letters, and scheduled activities with family of each student. Successes and Accomplishments The students achieve competence at conventional academics. Graduates return to regular school, not special programs. On their return to their own schools, graduates typically earn grades of A and B in the classes they had previously failed. Combining the record of Rocky Top Academy and its predecessor program, 64% graduated the program in an average of nine months. Of those graduates, 79% (51% of total enrolled students) graduated from an accredited college or university. Recidivism of previous negative behavior patterns has been almost non-existent. Graduates understand and act on the connection between themselves, others, and social institutions, which is the source of discipline. This is demonstrated by their performance in higher education. Graduates return home. All Rocky Top graduates, and nearly all program participants, return to their homes. Graduates do not go to foster homes, group homes, or public institutions but to their own homes. Most graduates forge a new, healthier relationship with their parents. Prospects for Replication To replicate the program, there is a requirement for facilities similar to those of the Rocky Top Academy Galen Campus and for adequate faculty and recreational staff resources. Location is essential to program success. It must be physical|y separate from surrounding communities. A variety of outdoor recreation must be close at hand. Zoning of the surrounding area must be appropriate to the student farming and building programs which release tension, teach academic and vocational lessons, and allow students to support themselves. 68 Contact Information Tom Gregory Director Rocky Top Academy P.O. Box 1349 Anaconda, MT 59722-1349 (406) 693-2277 (406) 693-2434 fax 69 Nebraska MAD DADS Statement of the Problem During the last three years, Lincoln, Nebraska has experienced a significant increase in the number of youth involved in criminal activities. Statistics from the Lincoln Police Department reveal that 2,431 juveniles were arrested in 1990. In 1993 that number increased 28% to 3,101. Factors contributing to this problem include an increase in the availability of drugs, an increase in drug use by youth, child abuse, an increase in gang activities, a lack of positive supervision by parents, and a lack of activities available for youth at night. Gang problems from Omaha are filtering into the City of Lincoln. In 1992, a representative from the Omaha MAD DADS (Men Against Destruction - Defending Against Drugs and Social-disorder) contacted Reverend Don Coleman about starting a MAD DADS chapter in Lincoln as a preventive measure against to the growing problem of gangs and youth violence. Reverend Coleman met with law enforcement officials, the county attorney, and the mayor to receive their input about starting a MAD DADS chapter in Lincoln. Strong support was received for this idea. Goals and Objectives The goal of the program is to create a safe, drug-free, recreational environment where youth receive positive support and encouragement. \"It's all about getting the child to start feeling good about himself again,\" said Reverend Coleman. \"I want every child, every child to feel 'I am somebody.'...I want a child to have that pride, that self-esteem in himself or herself.\" To meet this goal, the following objectives are used: increase the number of recreational activities available in the downtown Lincoln area for youth ages eight to 18; decrease the number of youth congregating on the streets in downtown Lincoln; increase the number of positive presentations against drugs, alcohol, and tobacco; and discourage sexual assaults, thefts, and other crimes. 70 Program Components MAD DADS began in Lincoln with 25 members. Membership included the Mayor, City Council, Chief of Police, County Attorney, Sheriff, State Patrol Commander, local business leaders, and grassroots community members. Membership is open to the community. Members of MAD DADS pay a membership fee of $10 per year. Individuals can sign up for areas of service including communications, education, and economic development. A monthly meeting is held for volunteers to coordinate activities. One of the first problems that MAD DADS addressed was the need for street patrols as a result of the rape of two women in the downtown area. To address this problem, the MAD DADS decided to patrol the streets in a program called Moonwalkers, to ensure safety in the downtown area at night. Ten citizens patrolled the downtown streets in groups of two from 10:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on weekend nights. The volunteers are equipped with radios to report any illegal activities to police. The patrol groups were surprised to encounter large numbers of youth ranging in ages from eight to 18 years who were unsupervised and unruly in the downtown area so late at night. Youth would gather in parking lots of businesses, creating disturbances. As a result of the youth congregating in the downtown area, there was an increase in fights, shoplifting, auto thefts, car break-ins, vandalism, and confrontations between youth and the adults leaving bars after closing. An outlet needed to be found to release this energy and control the movements of the at-risk youth. The citizens patrol groups visited with the youth to determine why they were in the downtown area at night and what they would like to do if they had a place to do it. It was found that the youth were in the downtown area to meet with their friends because there was no place available for them to assemble, and they didn't have anything else to do. The cost of available activities was a problem for some of the youth, but for the most part there were no activities available at night. The local newspaper published an article about the MAD DADS. In the article, Reverend Coleman spoke of this problem. As a result of the article, the Director of the YMCA called Reverend Coleman and offered the use of the YMCA. The YMCA offers a variety of activities, such as swimming, basketball, volleyball, boxing, weight-lifting, racquetball, music and dance, and space for youth to visit with their friends. The MAD DADS printed flyers about the Teen Nights at the YMCA, held every Saturday night from 7:30 p.m. to midnight. Flyers were distributed to the youth on the street, in Lincoln Public Schools, at the Police Department, at all community-based organizations, and through the media. The program was also advertised on the radio. Volunteers, including the Lincoln Police Department, provided the needed supervision during Teen Nights, and area businesses provided food and music. The volunteers working with the at-risk youth are helping them to develop self-esteem and self-worth. Conflict resolution, anger control, and problem solving are being taught during Teen Night. 71 To maintain order, youth who attend the Teen Nights are given identification cards as their pass to get in. Each Teen Night includes information about the negative effects of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Such information is provided both formally and informally. MAD DADS has several different programs. One program, GIRLS (Genuine Individuals Reaching Levels of Success), promotes community involvement of young women and girls who are residents of group homes or who are in at-risk situations. Girls from WICS (Women In Community Services) and Youth Services programs help make lap robes for seniors while learning about self-respect. Another program is the JAIL program (Juveniles Against Illegal Lifestyles). In this program, youth ages l 1 to 16 who have minor misdemeanor violations are paired with MAD DADS members to paint over public graffiti, tour the State penitentiary and talk with inmates, tour police and sheriff's departments, watch courtroom hearings, and work with business owners. Other programs whose goal is to make every child feel that \"I am somebody\" include: Kids to Kids - high school students are selected to be guest speakers for MAD DADS at middle schools and create a program in a call-in talk show format for public radio and television; Driving Miss Daisy - a program senior citizens may call for transportation; Lawn Mowing - students can borrow mowers to earn extra money during summer months and learn the skills of small-engine repair; Reach Out - teenagers 16 and over are paired with employers who are seeking extra help during the summer months; Moonburn - all-night festivities held in the spring once a year; Parent Patrols - parents monitor school property to ensure fights or gang-related activities cease before, during, and after school; MAC-DADS Kids - MacDonald's donated 500 t-shirts to be used in an attitude, drug, and gang awareness campaign for fifth and sixth graders; and Workshops - automotive workshop to teach maintenance skills for teenagers who drive and a computer skills class. An outgrowth of MAD DADS is MAD DADS Kids, a group of 40 Culler Middle School students who wanted to make a difference and prevent gangs. One of their activities is to remove graffiti all over the city. Results and Impact Performance Measures To assess the success of the program, the following items are measured: the number of recreational activities available to youth; the number of youth participating in those activities; the number of youth congregating on the streets of downtown Lincoln; and the number of presentations discouraging the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. 72 Implementation Problems and Successes Implementation problems were minimal because the downtown community realized the need for action. The major problem became transportation for those youth who did not frequent downtown late at night but were in their communities late at night causing problems. The program is working on obtaining a van to transport the kids. Financial support is a basic element to the success of the program and has been the hardest to maintain. The cost to operate the program averages approximately $10,000 a year. The funds are used primarily for janitorial services, staff of the YMCA, and food. Due to the loss of the program's basic financial support, the operation of the program was changed. This change has had a positive result in that the City's Parks and Recreation Department has taken a more active role in the program by opening up their facilities around the city at night. This allows youth to participate in the program but within close proximity to their homes. The YMCA still provides its facilities one Saturday night per month. Parental support is vital and also hard to maintain. Parents are pressured into participating by articles in the paper that state that there isn't enough parental support for the program. In addition, pictures in the paper of parents and kids together at MAD DADS' activities motivate parents to attend activities. It helps to get parents to network with each other to build community and maintain their support. .~ Successes ~nd Accomplishments There were numerous successes in implementing this program. One key success was the support and active involvement of the community, without whose active involvement the program would not have succeeded. Crime rates decreased 15% due to Teen Night. '\" The most important factor in the success of the program was that the youth bought heavily into the program. Approximately 132 youth attended the first Teen Night, and there is city-wide participation of youth which crosses all economic, cultural, religious, school, and age boundaries. By the end of the fourth week of the program, 300 youth were attending regularly, and there have been as many as 400 youth attending the program in one night. One participant, when asked what he would be doing if he were not at Teen Night, said, \"Probably out getting drunk. I had an offer.\" Law enforcement support provides a strong role model for youth. As part of the Community Policing program, law enforcement greatly contributes to addressing a major problem in the city and provides youth with the opportunity to develop friendships with law enforcement and see them in a different light. Involvement of local colleges and other civic organizations has had a significant impact on youth as it has given them additional positive role models and provided encouragement to achieve educational goals. 73 Prospects for Replication Replication of this program is possible as long as there is community support for the program, which includes volunteers for supervision of activities, mentoring and tutoring, and friendship building, and the donation of supplies, food, music, and other items. Establishing rules, parameters, and standards that youth are required to abide by is vital. Youth need to know the rules, boundaries, and standards they are expected to follow and that they will be held accountable for failure to comply. Often kids say, \"There's nothing to do and no place to go.\" If they have a place to go, something to do, and positive adult influences, youth will rise to the expected level of success.

Box 80732 MAD DADS 74 Nebraska YouthNet Community Based Evaluation - Douglas County Statement of the Problem Youth arrests for status offenses, misdemeanors, and delinquent acts have risen over the past three years in Douglas County, Nebraska. Arrested youths ages ten to 18 are sent to the Douglas County Youth Center. Status offenders are often placed in foster care, a community program, or hospital to await a Juvenile Court hearing. Depending upon the seriousness of his/her crime, the youth could also be sent to a youth center in Keamey or Geneva, Nebraska. Community-based evaluations have been mandated by Nebraska law to lessen overcrowding in youth centers. Family Service's YouthNet Community Based Evaluation (YCBE) Program originated out of this mandate. Goals and Objectives The primary goal of the YCBE Program is to provide a quality, comprehensive youth evaluation within the youth's community with a 30 to 40 day turnaround time. This evaluation gives the juvenile court officers and judges the best insight into the youth's strengths and weaknesses. This information is used to plan the most appropriate treatment or intervention. The following are 1995 objectives to support this goal: reduce youth center evaluations of status offenders by 50%; reports of 75% or more of the youth and families being served by the YCBE Program being actively involved in the YCBE treatment plan process in determining appropriate solutions for the family; and reports of 75% of the juvenile probation officers and juvenile court judges satisfied with the quality of the YouthNet Community Based Evaluation report. Program Components The Assessment The 1994 program consisted of one half-time Therapist II, one half-time YouthNet outreach worker, and one half-time secretary. Agreements with a Clinical Psychologist for psychological assessments, a physician for medical and dental screenings, the 75 youth's school counselor for a school progress assessment, and a drug/alcohol counselor for a drug screening rounded out staff needed to produce a comprehensive assessment of the youth within his/her family and neighborhood environment. The assessment is done in six parts. The therapist meets with the youth and his/her family and explains what is required of them to complete the evaluation. The therapist helps the youth and family set up appointments with the clinical psychologist, the Charles Drew Health Clinic, and the Family Service chemical dependency evaluator. Releases are signed by the youth's parent(s) for the above services, the youth's school counselor or teacher, and the YouthNet outreach worker. The YouthNet outreach worker meets the youth and his/her family either with the therapist at the initial intake visit or separately at another time. The YouthNet outreach worker will do a recreational time usage assessment and provide transportation for those families who need it. The therapist receives five evaluations from the other agencies involved and conducts her own three home visit evaluations on the youth and family. Strengths and weaknesses of the youth and his/her family support are summarized into one report. The original six reports are attached for reference. The reports are given to the Juvenile Court Judges, Juvenile Probation Officer, the youth's defense attorney, and the County Attorney. A written follow-up questionnaire is given to the Juvenile Probation Officer and Juvenile Court Judge for program evaluation. The parents and the youth are called by phone and asked to answer a four-question follow-up report. Cooperation of Douglas County Agencies The source of referrals for the YCBE Program is the juvenile probation officers and juvenile court judges. The source of the comprehensive assessments are the Charles Drew Medical Center, Woodhaven Counseling Center, Omaha Public School counselors, YMCA, and YouthNet outreach worker. The Family Service counselor's role is to coordinate, troubleshoot, and problem solve among all these agencies to ensure a quality product and keep referrals flowing. In 1994 cooperation was good, with the exception of one juvenile court judge. Results and Impact Performance Measures One of the 1994 goals of the program was to reduce the number of institutional evaluations by 50%. The second goal was to provide equal numbers or improve upon the 90% Geneva family participation in the evaluation. The third goal was that 50% or better of families served by YCBE report less disruption. The fourth goal was that 50% or more of families and individuals served by the program report being involved in the YCBE treatment plan process to determine appropriate solutions for their family. 76 Implementation Problems and Successes One problem was that the lead Juvenile Court Judge refused to allow program staff to talk to the other judges about the YCBE program. She stated that she preferred Geneva evaluations. The solution was for Juvenile Court probation officers to discuss the YCBE program informally during court with the other judges. After a while, the court began to send referrals to YCBE. Another problem was that extra communication was necessary by the YCBE therapist when a youth was a ward of the State and had a NDSS caseworker as well as a juvenile court probation officer. This problem was solved by checking the NDSS status of the youth upon receiving the referral and immediately notifying the NDSS caseworker of the court-ordered evaluation. The program also experienced problems with collaboration. Getting different systems to work together was difficult. The solution was to convene team meetings, especially with agency executives. Successes and Accomplishments In 1993, 49 Douglas County status offenders were evaluated at the Geneva Youth Rehabilitation Center. In 1994, 25 Douglas County status offenders were evaluated in Geneva, and YCBE performed 34 evaluations in the county. The program met or exceeded all four of its goals. Due to the availability of the YCBE program, 58% of youth who completed evaluations for the court were done in Douglas County. The YCBE program had 100% family participation. Ninety percent of the families reported less family disruption. Ninety percent of the families reported feeling involved in the YCBE treatment plans. During the first quarter of 1994 a part-time therapist, a part-time YouthNet outreach worker, and a part-time secretary were hired, oriented, and trained. Policies and procedures were developed, and evaluation forms were created. YCBE staff met with the juvenile court probation officers and networked with the juvenile court judges, prosecutors, and public defenders. During the second quarter, evaluations began and by July 1, 1994, 11 evaluations were completed. The parents' follow-up questionnaire was developed, and positive feedback was received from the contacted parents. As a result of seven agencies working closely together, the Juvenile Court Judges and the Probation Department are learning more about what Omaha agencies can do and how many other programs for youths and families Omaha has to offer. Thirty-four youths were given comprehensive evaluations, with their families closely involved in the assessment process. 77 Prospects for Replication To be successful, the program must be specific in determining how a family can best be helped. In order to facilitate Nebraska-wide community-based evaluations, YCBE has requested funding to train eight other communities in the evaluation model during the 1995-96 funding period of the Nebraska Crime Commission.

These factors, combined with the growing costs of facility construction, have prompted criminal justice officials to seek non-incarcerative correctional options for juveniles. At the same time, increased emphasis is being placed on reducing recidivism through the development of meaningful offender programs. Faced with these issues, New Jersey is in the process of developing and testing new forms of offender programming for its juvenile population. Recognizing the need to establish effective aftercare programming, particularly in disadvantaged communities, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, Division of Criminal Justice, approved the creation of a pilot juvenile aftercare program in 1993. Working cooperatively with Rutgers University, the New Jersey Department of Human Services (Division of Juvenile Services) implemented Project CORE (Communities Organized to Regain Their Environment) in early 1994. Project CORE is located in Newark, New Jersey and serves adjudicated Essex county males aged 15 to 18. Newark was chosen as the site of New Jersey's first juvenile aftercare program based in part on community need. With 37% of its children living below the poverty level, Newark is one of the most severely disadvantaged of all New Jersey communities. The city is 78% non-white with a teen death rate 133% above the State average. Essex County consistently ranks last among all New Jersey counties in terms of overall child well-being. Further, the county's juvenile arrest rates and commitment rates are well above the State average, ranking 19% and 107%, respectively, above the norm in 1993. Recent studies have found that children growing up in such communities are far more likely to be exposed to violence, do less well in school, become unmarried teen parents, and fail to make a smooth transition to work. This is particularly true for juveniles who have been previously adjudicated. All too often these children, without the tools and guidance necessary to establish and maintain a crime-free lifestyle, are as likely to return to the criminal justice system as they are likely to make a successful transition back into the community. As a community-based aftercare program, Project CORE is unique within New Jersey's criminal justice system. Through the provision of transitional support to court-adjudicated youth, the program is designed to address many of the inadequacies of the current system recently identified by the Governor's Advisory Council on Juvenile Justice. 79 Goals and Objectives The program seeks to reduce juvenile recidivism rates through the development of community- based programming. This programming is designed to provide increased employment opportunities and job training, ongoing relationships with positive community mentors, life- skills training, and a commitment to community service. Project CORE is targeted at Essex County youth who have been adjudicated for auto theft and related offenses such as drug charges. CORE provides these juveniles with aftercare services in an effort to meet the following objectives: to reduce juvenile recidivism rates; to increase levels of educational achievement; to provide job training and placement services; and to increase community involvement and awareness. Program Components Specific program activities include: enhancement of basic skills and abilities in mathematics, language arts, and computer literacy through applied skill development activities; provision of vocational, interpersonal and coping skills necessary for successful job placement; development of a framework which challenges youth to discover their personal career and educational goals, and empowers them to successfully attain these goals; reintegration of youth into the community through community service and team- building activities; improvement of youth self-esteem through opportunities for meaningful and gainful employment; and provision of hands-on experiential education applied to urban life, issues, and environment. Attainment of these program goals requires staff involvement with participants, the student's family, and the impacted community. By offering ongoing assistance to the student, while strengthening external support systems, CORE strives to provide participants with the guidance necessary to develop and maintain a crime-free lifestyle. Because Project CORE is operated in conjunction with Rutgers University and located adjacent to its Newark campus, juveniles are able to benefit from many of the academic offerings of the school. Students regularly participate in instructional programs led by University faculty, make use of University facilities, and interact with University students. 80 CORE is designed to be a 12-month program broken down into three phases of approximately equal length. The total program time, however, can vary depending upon the needs of the individual participant. Ideally, potential program candidates are interviewed by a selection committee shortly after adjudication. Phase I involves allowing eligible juveniles interested in participating in CORE to be placed in one of three residential facilities for approximately four months, depending upon student behavior and total term length. During this time, students are familiarized with the CORE program, work with staff in developing a program plan, and participate in selected CORE activities. Phase II begins with a week of transition during which participants are involved in CORE activities during the day and return to the residential facilities in the evening. As a group, second-week students engage in an \"Outward Bound\" type experience in order to build teamwork and self-esteem. For the remainder of the second program phase, participants are involved in a flexible mix of educational and personal enrichment activities. Client participation is key in determining which enrichment activities will work. Staff work with students on an ongoing basis, monitoring individual progress and assisting in the development of educational and employment goals. Working with staff, each participant identifies and receives an appropriate educational and/or employment placement. Juveniles participate in regular CORE programming when not involved in placement activities. The following program components have been developed and implemented as part of Phase II: Applied Basic Skills Development An individualized education plan is developed for each student entering CORE. The plan is developed and implemented by the CORE educational staff and based on standardized testing, student observation, and academic records supplied by the residential centers. CORE, like all residential juvenile facilities in the State, is required by the Department of Education to provide participants with minimum levels of educational instruction. Beyond these requirements, CORE staff endeavor to design educational programs suited to each student's individual learning style, educational needs, and interests. Specific attention involves providing instruction relevant to student goals, training pupils for General Equivalency Diploma or Scholastic Aptitude Test testing, and integrating learning experiences into all components of the program. Life Skills and Urban Issues CORE works with community contractors to provide training in life skills and urban issues. Classes cover a variety of topics including computer literacy, conflict management and resolution, personal finances, and minority history/culture. Educational and Career Placement During the early stages of CORE, efforts are made to assess each student's abilities and interests. In addition, participants are exposed to a wide variety of educational and career options throughout the program. Efforts are made to identify settings which are challenging and provide an opportunity for growth. 81 Community Service Participants perform community service work on a weekly basis. The community service component of CORE is designed to provide an opportunity to contribute to the community, build pride through accomplishment, and develop a sense of community responsibility. Vocational Training The vocational training component of the program is designed to expose participants to a variety of vocational employment opportunities. This training is expected to offer an understanding of the various vocational opportunities available, while providing sufficient skills to allow participants to seek entry-level employment upon completion of Phase II of the program. Mentoring The mentor program is designed to provide CORE participants with positive adult role models. They assist their CORE participants in acquiring the skills necessary to function effectively, and independently, in their communities. Because many mentors are recruited from the university community, their influence may also serve as a positive inducement for juveniles to explore higher education and aspire to careers beyond their own current expectations. Following successful completion of Phase II, students enter the third and final stage monitoring. During Phase III, on-site program participation is no longer required, though placement activities continue to be monitored. Monitoring is done by providing youth with a strictly enforced curfew. Daily CORE operations are supervised by the Project Director located in Newark. Other positions include Program Coordinator for Student, Family and Community Affairs, Basic Skills Instruction Program Coordinator, Placement Program Coordinator, Court/Intake Program Coordinator and Project Team Leaders. Project Team Leaders are responsible for the day-to- day supervision of CORE participants and for monitoring and assisting in the progress of participants assigned to his caseload. Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes As a pilot program, CORE is continuously modifying and improving its programming. CORE's initial program evaluation identified a number of problem areas including: participant selection and classification procedures; a system of graduated incentives and sanctions and the imposition of enforceable conditions; case documentation and record-keeping; placement procedures and monitoring; and community service opportunities. As a result, numerous program changes have been implemented and are planned. For instance, residential programming and aftercare were separate and are now integrated. 82 Successes and Accomplishments CORE has been successful in efforts to make meaningful educational and employment placements, to complete numerous community service projects, to establish a community mentoring network, and to involve participant families in program activities. Twenty-four participants are currently enrolled, and the program adds eight or nine new youth each month. Fifty youths completed the program thus far. There is a high staff to client ratio. There are no outcomes to report at this time, although a formal evaluation by Rutgers University will be conducted. Prospects for Replication The initial assessment of Project CORE documented program components and identified areas in need of modification. As a result of the study, sufficient program documentation has been developed to allow successful program replication. With the development and implementation of a planned program monitoring and reporting system, prospects for program replication should be excellent.

This survey and other reports showed: alcohol is the drug of choice for most New Mexican students: 43% of New Mexican high school students reported episodic heavy drinking, the highest rate in the nation; the percentages of New Mexican students ever using marijuana (41%) and currently using marijuana (18%) were also the highest in the nation; 26% of APS fourth graders have experimented with beer, wine, or wine coolers; 75% of APS seniors drink alcohol; 27% of APS seniors mix alcohol with other drug use; and 29% of APS seniors drive after drinking. During the 1980s, substance abuse prevention strategies gradually changed from focusing on short-term individual-oriented interventions to an emphasis on looking beyond the school to the community. Research began to identify the risk factors for youth problems, but truly effective prevention strategies for actual risk reduction remained unclear. Recently the emphasis has been placed on the development of resiliency in youth, examining \"protective factors\" that appear to alter or even reverse predictions of negative outcome. Traditional drug-education prevention programs exist in the Albuquerque area and in the State. Well known are the Drug Awareness Response Education (DARE) program and a University of New Mexico-based program. The programs are effective in educating directly about substance abuse and its negative effects, including long-term morbidity, associated vehicular trauma, and violence. Yet problems of violence and drug abuse continue to escalate. Goals and Objectives The overall goal of Talking Talons Youth Leadership is to motivate students through self- esteem enhancement by instilling empathy and confidence in students. This is done by providing public speaking opportunities for students. At-risk youth were originally targeted, but all youth are now included, because protective factors need to be enhanced in the general population as well as for high-risk youth. 84 Specific goals of Talking Talons include: motivating youth toward academics and community service; instilling positive attitudes and confidence in interpersonal relationships; increasing awareness about community problems such as substance abuse, gang violence and graffiti; building resiliency in youth by enhancing protective factors; and instilling leadership and values. The primary objectives of Talking Talons are to increase protective factors through a positive, peer-taught, engaging, entertaining, and proven method, as measured by professional evaluation. The protective factors include increasing a youth's positive self-esteem, self- efficacy, communication skills, and connection to community. One way to accomplish this is by providing an opportunity to involve the entire community -- law enforcement professionals, families, schools, churches, businesses, and other groups -- in a collaborative, holistic method to meet the needs of youth. Talking Talons also emphasizes a preference for long-term goals over short-term or immediate needs w in other words, instilling a sense of purpose and future. Finally, Talking Talons provides the availability of a strong support person or team. Program Components Talking Talons Youth Leadership (Talking Talons) is a nationally recognized, award-winning, 501(c)(3) youth development program incorporated in New Mexico in 1990. Talking Talons provides leadership and public speaking training free of charge to students aged five to 17 within three APS schools, and creates public speaking teams of youth which provide educational outreach to thousands each year throughout the State. The concept is original and professionally-proven to be successful in enhancing protective factors against drug abuse and violence. The program involves injured or orphaned wild animals, which, like youth, often come with a history of injury, neglect, and abuse. Initially, the children's incentive for participating in Talking Talons is to get out of school twice per week and to play with the animals. Strong leadership roles are internalized after the children become \"hooked\" on the program through the educational animals. Children take on attitudes of commitment and caring about animals and their environments and preserving health and habitat. Students are then introduced to the expanded role that we expect of them, that of examining their own world to determine how best to combat negative, self-destructive, and community-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse, violence and vandalism. They are invested with the Talking Talons role of becoming peer leaders and ambassadors for responsible citizenship. With live animals, student public teams educate people of all ages about these subjects. Through their involvement with the program, students are trained (generally biweekly within their schools) in public speaking, environmental science, public relations, interpersonal communication, health education, and law. Their activities teach them responsibility, restraint, accountability, and respect -- for themselves, for other humans, for animals, and for the earth itself. Students recognize their personal growth as the result of participating in the program 85 and commit themselves to the goals. Placement in the program is largely by school administrations, based on the children's direct need and interest. A portion of the Talking Talons students is intentionally placed in the program to be models for others. This is important so that there is no stigma associated with Talking Talons. The overall philosophy of the program is exemplified in a Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct. The underlying philosophy is to maintain a positive attitude. Honesty is expected at all times. Young people are trained to enhance their own esteem while building that of others. Within the world of Talking Talons, children find themselves surrounded by caring people who provide an atmosphere of security, comfort, stability, acceptance, and trust. Research shows that a caring and supportive relationship remains the most critical variable throughout childhood and adolescence, and that this basic sense of trust appears to be the critical foundation for human development, bonding, and resiliency. Inter-agency cooperation is intrinsic to the concept of Talking Talons. Ongoing collaborations have been established with many agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. Talking Talons is subcontracting with the museum to provide science presentations throughout rural New Mexico, especially to Indian nations. District 23 Toastmasters International provides ongoing public speaking training. The City of Albuquerque Graffiti Removal Services sponsors Olive the Anti-Graffiti Drug-Free Baboon presentations. Community Leadership outreach prevention education is specially designed to combat youth violence, drugs, and vandalism in an entertaining and positive way. Talking Talons provides Community Leadership presentations to group homes, treatment centers, schools, and hospitals. \"Olive\" serves as a role model who teaches how to say \"no\" to alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs, which captures the imaginations of youngsters.- \"Dash,\" a peregrine falcon, is used to illustrate negative effects of toxins on health. (The peregrine is endangered due to inappropriate chemical usage.) Through the use of Olive and Dash in presentations, a strong message of compliance with law and avoidance/resistance of peer pressure is delivered. To extend direct activities to youth and to enhance experiential learning activities, Talking Talons is opening the Talking Talons Leadership Center. The center is a rented house in rural Tijeras, New Mexico, next door to an animal hospital. Three veterinarians donate medical services to the animals. Students and classrooms will visit the Talking Talons Leadership Center and participate in projects designed to enhance their learning. They will be given the opportunity to help prepare the diets of birds and bats, and to see the veterinarians and wildlife rehabilitators in action at the animal hospital. The large living room will be the presentation and work room. The kitchen will be used by children to prepare animal diets. Students will be able to learn business ethics and simple retail procedures by working with adults in the gift shop/art gallery. The gift shop will sell bird houses and bat houses built by youngsters in the workshop in the back shed. One room includes a research library. An insectivorous bat room will house educational bats. Tropical 86 fruit bats will be housed inside, in heated and humidified enclosures. In the back yard and side yard the hawks, owls, and falcons will be housed in state-of-the-art facilities. An organic vegetable garden in the back will be maintained by the adults and youngsters to grow food for the animals. A terraced hummingbird garden of flowers will attract many birds and provide a restful spot for solitude. Students will be the docents for public tours of the educational facility. Many high-risk youngsters will find themselves participating in a lifestyle to which they had never previously been exposed, namely to Talking Talons. Results and Impact Performance Measures The program has been evaluated by the University of New Mexico (UNM) College of Education, Department of Counseling and Family Studies, supervised by Wayne Maes, Ph.D. He measured outcomes by conducting pre-test and post-test evaluations of 80 to 100 students per school year in a random experimental design with an adolescent social efficacy test. One group of high-risk adolescents at an inner city middle school showed statistically significant improvement in self-efficacy, and another group comprising high-risk elementary students, many living in a group home and/or victims of sexual and child abuse, showed a statistically significant increase in general self worth. Since 1991 Talking Talons has engaged the College of Education for ongoing professional evaluations. In 1992 and 1993 two evaluations of Talking Talons have been a part of the research on examining the protective factors which seem to create healthy development in young people. The evaluation design of the 1995 evaluation, under Dr. Maes, includes the measurement of both outcome and process variables. A pre-test and post-test control group design will be employed in assessing the outcome variables. Eligible students will be randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Individuals in each of the two groups will be tested prior to the beginning of the Talking Talons program on each of the outcome variables. Post-tests on each of the outcome variables will also be administered on the same individuals at the conclusion of the program. Statistical tests will be run on the data to determine the impact of the Talking Talons program on the members of the experimental group. The 1995 evaluation seeks to identify proneness to substance abuse and violence. These process variables will be assessed through direct observation of the treatment program (participant observer method) by a graduate student from UNM. Implementation Problems and Successes The primary difficulty faced by the program is that the outreach program has been an all- volunteer program with no staff funding. It is a testament to a core of extremely dedicated volunteers that accomplishments have been achieved. To date there is only one full-time paid 87 employee. Thus, the true potential of the program and its ability to touch the sensitivities of youth and thereby to become a major educational force in all communities lie largely untapped: Successes and Accomplishments The program has close to a zero drop-out rate, even with high-risk youth, and a long waiting list of youngsters and schools wanting the program. Although public speaking is generally recognized as the number one fear of adults, Talking Talons has a success rate of 100% in placing all students into public speaking, including the use of a microphone. The rewards of the program are entirely intrinsic. There are no merit badges, no point systems, no grades, and no graduations. To participate in public speaking events, students must contract to make up all missed work. Animals are the vehicle through which program staff successfully reach, teach, and motivate youth to serve their worlds. In 1994, approximately 122,000 New Mexicans were reached by the public speaking teams of Talking Talons, the equivalent of eight percent of the population of New Mexico. The popularity of the program and the demand for the presentations is a major factor making the children feel so important to their communities and world, and why the program has seen statistically significant changes in the self-efficacy and self-concept of young people. Awards received include the New Mexico Research and Study Council's First Place Quality Education Award, and the Renew America's Special Merit Award from the National Environmental Awards Council, 1992. This was one of six awards nationwide in the category \"Community Environmental Education.\" Governor Bruce King~ office hosted the ceremony and declared December 2, 1992 Talking Talons Youth Leadership Recognition Day. Public Speaking Outreach has dramatically increased since the incorporation in 1990: 1990, 7,000; 1991, 13,500; 1992, 44,400; 1993, 57,500; and 1994, 121,700. Prospects for Replication National replication is a goal of Talking Talons Youth Leadership. The specific plan for replication includes use of the developed methodology and curriculum of Talking Talons, and extension of developed partnerships with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, State game departments, and Toastmasters International. Over the past five years the efforts of Talking Talons have focused on solidification of the program, not direct expansion. Numbers of students have been held at approximately 80 to 100 each year, with in-school training at two middle schools and one elementary school. Plans are to expand to six to ten schools within APS in 1995-1996, assuming adequate funding. A pilot out-of-State program operating out of a Leadership Center similar to the facility described above will be a subsequent extension. 88 Contact Information Wendy Aeschliman Executive Director Talking Talons Youth Leadership P.O. Box York Riverhead School District: Anti-Violence Project Statement of the Problem The Riverhead School District is representative of the rural and suburban school districts of America which have increasingly become the scenes of violent and disruptive behaviors. The Suffolk County Department of Social Services reports that the Town of Riverhead accounts for 50% of the families in the region receiving public assistance; 41% of the students in the target schools receive free or reduced price lunches. The median income is the lowest of all Long Island towns; it is 32% lower .than the median for Long Island. The Riverhead High School is the target school for this project. Over the past several years the high school has been the scene of increasing incidents of violent and disruptive acts. The community has experienced a growth in crime committed by young people. The extent of the problem is indicated by statistics from the Probation Department. In 1993-94, there were 2,315 new probation files for individuals under the age of 21. During the first half of 1994 there were 1,484 new cases. The rate of increase over the past three years has been between 24% and 26%. During the spring of 1993, 25% of Riverhead High School's population received an out-of- school suspension. A total of 478 suspensions were administered during this period. The following are the most common causes for suspension: truancy and class cutting, insubordination and refusal, disorderly conduct, and fighting. In addition, there were suspensions for: weapons possession, harassment, menacing, unlawful assembly, assault upon teachers and students, and drug possession. During the 1993 school year there were 17 assaults committed by pupils on teachers. There was increasing community and parental concern. A Newsday article, \"Riven in Riverhead,\" captured the amount and degree of community concern. The stage was set to develop, adopt, and implement a comprehensive and systematic program dedicated to eliminating school violence and disruption. Goals and Objectives The overall goal of the Riverhead project is to decrease the incidents of violent and disruptive behavior in the Riverhead High School and to create a safe environment which is conducive to learning. This goal is supported by several program and performance objectives which represent the comprehensive and systematic orientation of the project: 90 to develop and/or review and revise Board of Education policies and building level regulations to establish a safe school; to decrease incidents of violent and disruptive behavior in the High School and increase the achievement, self-esteem, and compliance with rules and regulations of at-risk pupils through participation in the Alternative High School program; to reduce the drop-out rate for the Riverhead High School by 80%; to achieve gains in the pupils language arts and mathematics skills and achievement in credit courses through instruction, mentoring, and counseling; . to increase the knowledge, skill, and understanding of staff in dealing with disruptive students through a comprehensive in-service program which addresses awareness of anti-violence education, methods for coping with and diffusing violence, and techniques for handling critical incidents, and to achieve a 75% decrease in teacher requests for administrative or security guard intervention in discipline incidents; to develop a planning model for police and school interaction and action which addresses the mutual aims of eliminating violence and disruption in the school and community; to empower administrators to understand, through continuing in-service training and expert consultation, the dynamics of pupil disruption so that they may develop strategies and tactical capability to interdict, intervene, and prevent such unsafe behaviors; to increase the precision and evaluation of anti-violence program planning, through the development of a Safe School Data Base and Management Information System, thereby increasing the effectiveness of program planning and the efficiency with which staff accomplish data-dependent tasks; to foster in the pupil the ability to cope with stress, anxiety, frustration, and anger, and to deal in a nonviolent way with problems through the development, and delivery of prevention programs targeted at the development of coping skills; to empower parents to work with their children through the development and delivery of in-service education programs which will better equip the parent to become a partner in the processes of decreasing teenage violent behavior and becoming proactive in school and community substance abuse intervention activities; and 91 to design and install a video surveillance system for the outside perimeter of the building and for undersupervised areas in order to monitor the school environment and provide documentation for prosecution in drug-related and violent behaviors. Program Components The Riverhead School District Anti-Violence Project applies comprehensive and systematic planning strategies and tactics to the problem of school violence. It exploits what is known about youth violence and the importance of establishing a structured environment for the violence mitigation effort. The comprehensive planning effort involves the identification of roles, groups, and resources within the school and community that are affected by school violence and can contribute to its mitigation. The project targets a constellation of factors which impact violence mitigation. Among the areas targeted are Board of Education policy and its application in the school buildings; administrative tasking and training; teacher training in coping with disruptive and violent persons; the development of police and community liaison; the development of anti- violence curriculum for pupils; the establishment of an Alternative High School program for those pupils who are unable to profit from regular school and whose behaviors are disruptive to the safe and orderly education of others; parent training and empowerment in coping with their children; the application of technological solutions to surveillance; and the development of tactical response and interdiction plans to violent situations (Critical Incident Response Teams). At the initiation of the project, the Riverhead School District contracted with District and School Safety Services, Inc. (DSSS) to assist with project implementation. Project staff were recruited from among existing district staff. Assistance was also obtained from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, which provided active technical assistance; the New York State School Boards Association in respect to policy development; and the New York State Education Department, Division of Cultural Education, which provided statistical background and program information. * The project's specific components include: Board of Education Policy All policies relating to the issue of school violence including weapons, substance abuse, discipline and consequence codes have been reviewed and/or re-cast. Special attention was devoted to the issue of congruence between the Board's policies and the administrative regulations applied to the high school. A committee composed of teachers and building-level administrators worked on the building regulations; formulated a code which detailed universally applied consequences; and promulgated these regulations to staff, pupils, and parents. 92 Data Base Development Early in the project there was recognition that a data base needed to be constructed to record and measure progress in reducing violence and drug use. This system has been designed not only to access pupil data but also to provide an incident information system which supports the administration in tactical planning, scheduling, and the assignment of personnel. Staff Training A comprehensive staff training program has been developed and implemented. The mission of this program is to empower staff to become proactive in the process of building control (interdiction), intervention, and prevention of violence. For the vast majority of teachers and administrators, this represented their first discrete introduction to the field. The content for the in-service program has been drawn from the disciplines of education, law enforcement curriculum, sociology, psychology and law. The programs include an Awareness Program aimed at introducing the staff to the issues of personal safety, the functions of police, and security; defusing violent and disruptive encounters; management of incidents; the laws affecting search and seizure; anii-violence prevention programs; gangs and the occult; substance abuse, etc. In addition, there is a program entitled Coping with and Treating Violence in the School which concentrates on prevention and intervention strategies and tactics for the educator. A Crisis Management or Critical Incident Planning Course is offered to both administrators and teachers. The significant effect of this training has been to permit the teacher to become more effective in actively supervising pupil conduct. With training, teachers are more likely to assume or reassume the function of supervision beyond their classroom and into the hallways and transition spaces, where violent incidents are likely. Critical Incident Planning and Critical Incident Response Teams Over 30 strategic and tactical plans have been developed to cope with incidents with the potential for personal injury, signifieanl loss of property value, or disruption of the institution. In addition, a Critical Incident Response Team composed of teachers, security guards, and administrators has been trained to respond to critical incidents. The existence of this team has bolstered the school's confidence in its ability to manage student and teacher safety. Alternative High School Program An Alternative High School Program has been established for those pupils who exhibited an inability to function in or profit from attendance in the regular high school. In approximately 70% of the cases, these pupils' behavior had been violent. The Alternative High School is based on flexible scheduling, career path education, mentoring, and a strict code of conduct. The preliminary indicators of success for this project have been positive. This program serves approximately 50 students. Security Guard Structure and Training The District currently maintains four security guards in the High School. These guards have been provided with 60 hours of training and 40 hours of supervised field service. Their roles are defined by rules, procedures, and post orders. The function of the guard has been communicated to staff, and the guard has been integrated into the high school team. At the initiation of the project, there were eight guards, but with the 93 advent of teacher training, the need for guards decreased. Substance Abuse and Parenting Program A Substance Abuse Program with a parenting component has been initiated. The Neighborhoods in Action Program has been introduced and is scheduled for full-scale implementation. Police Liaison The introduction of a mechanism for regular meetings between members of the Riverhead Police Department and project personnel, the discussion of roles, shared training, and the development of a shared data base have all facilitated the development of a Police School Liaison officer. Surveillance A component of the project is the application of video surveillance hardware and techniques to the monitoring of the perimeter of the facility. This equipment has been installed and monitors parking lots, remote areas of the building, and the cafeteria. Results and Impact Performance Measures The project design includes an evaluation component. The evaluation design has been developed to document and measure the efficiency of the project activities and the effectiveness of the project in meeting its stated objectives and goals. Descriptive statistics are gathered documenting incidents of violent and disruptive behavior. In addition, questionnaires have been developed to gather perceptions of school climate. Pupil academic achievement and attendance data is gathered. Current evaluation results demonstrate that the activities are on schedule and the project is meeting the stated objectives. Implementation Problems and Successes There have been remarkably few problems in program implementation since the project's inception. The support of the Board of Education and the Superintendent cleared a path for project implementation and provided necessary and emphatic visibility for the project. Training is a critical component in this project, and as a result most change was dependent on prerequisite training. The initial scheduling of courses was difficult. The Superintendent provided conference days for staff training to accelerate implementation of the project. Successes and Accomplishments The fundamental measure of project success addresses the question of whether or not there has been a decrease in violent and disruptive behaviors in the High School. A major evaluation study is currently being undertaken. Preliminary findings point to the dramatic impact of the project. Interim findings demonstrate the following in respect to the numbers of pupils referred to the school administration for disciplinary reasons: 94 Set I (pupil behaviors consistent with violent behavior): pupil fights have decreased over 68%; pupil assaults on pupils have decreased 66%; assaults on teachers have decreased 100%; display and threat to use a weapon has decreased 63%; refusals to follow teacher direction have decreased 93%; and incidents of harassment have decreased 42%; and Set II (incidents which are indicative of staff initiative and activity): seizure of weapons by staff increased 56%; and drugfalcohol use and possession incidents increased 89%. Questionnaires administered to staff indicate an increased comfort level with the safety, security, and climate of the school after the institution of project activities. Over 90% of staff participating in the in-service course reported that they felt more confident in their own security as well as their own abilities to intervene in pupil discipline matters as a result of the training. Prospects for Replication From the initiation of the project there has been a commitment to document, validate and demonstrate the effective elements of this project. Initial and interim evaluation results are posflive. Components of the project have been demonstrated in several New York State School Districts and at workshops sponsored by the New York State Education Department, New York State School Boards Association, and others. There has been a great deal of interest expressed by schools, parent groups, and governmental agencies. This project is an excellent candidate for replication. Contact Information Edward J.

More recently, the Annual Report on School Violence 1993-94 Baseline Year published by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction reports 6,683 incidents or criminal acts occurring on school property including two kidnappings, four armed robberies, and four rapes. A number of profound social and demographic changes, which are statistically correlated with youth violence, are underway. In the past 35 years a demographic shift from the nuclear family of the 1950s to an ever increasing proportion of single-parent families has taken place. The rate of illegitimacy has grown. Many new families are headed by females who are at or just above the poverty line. Moreover, in those families where mother and father are present, the dual income family is becoming the norm, producing a generation of latchkey children who turn to peers and media for advice before they turn to family. One clear consequence of the demographic trends is a diminished capacity of many families to deal with the problems of adolescent development. In fact, some of the factors previously mentioned are themselves predisposing factors of delinquency: poverty, single parent homes, and lack of adequate parental supervision. In other words, inadequate child rearing practices are strong predictors of delinquent behavior. Children must learn from their families the ability to exercise self control and defer gratification in favor of long-term projects or prospects. The diminished capacity of the family to instill these values in some children produces enormous pressures on public schools. Clearly, some of these pressures are felt in terms of students who are unmotivated to learn and difficult to discipline, and some are ultimately released in the form of school violence. While researchers in the area of youth violence differ on the causes of youth violence, almost all agree that youth violence is better addressed early. In other words, youth violence in its more extreme expression -- assault, robbery, rape m is usually preceded by a pattern of earlier, less serious incidents such as truancy. The earlier society can intervene to divert at-risk youth from violence, the better the chances are that more serious violence later will be averted. This early intervention approach is more effective and ultimately less costly. 96 The current concern about school violence underscores the inherent incompatibility between real learning and school violence. No educator would disagree that violence is contrary to the order required for learning to take place. To underscore this point, the mission statement of the Charlotte, North Carolina schools reads: \"Education is the primary purpose of the public school. In order for teachers to teach and students to learn, an atmosphere conducive to learning must be consistently maintained.\" At a minimum, an atmosphere conducive to learning requires that students, teachers, and administrators be safe and perceive that they are safe while at school. Goals and Objectives The primary goal of the School Resource Officer Program is to maintain and improve the safety of the learning environment in the schools through the reduction and prevention of school violence. To accomplish this goal the following objectives are used: establish a WEBNET or a network of existing community agencies to catch children who will otherwise fail due to diminished capacity of their families to provide adequate socialization; assign an officer to schools from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; and establish a juvenile task force which provides referrals. Program Components A school outreach program begins with a multijurisdictional task force which has representatives that bring together decision-making authority and resources that directly affect. juvenile issues. Representation includes law enforcement, education, courts, the district attorney, social service agencies, parents, students, and the community. The task force is responsible for determining the best way to address school violence for their community. By involving representatives of all interested parties in the assembly of a community-wide group of leaders, the fact that school violence in a community is just like other violence in the community is recognized. This recognition leads to ownership of the problem of school violence by the entire community and the desire to address the problem. It is made manageable because the problem can be addressed school-by-school or district-wide depending on the resources and attitude of the community that tackles the problem. Many programs are available for consideration by such a task force. Research by the Governor's Crime Commission determined that a School Resource Officer (SRO) Program, operating under the umbrella of a task force, is a very successful approach. A School Resource Officer Program is a community policing approach practiced in a school environment. The school is the officer's beat. The exclusive focus on the physical and social territory of the school is an important aspect of the SRO concept. Unlike the police officer who responds to school problems as a result of a 911 call by the principal, the SRO regards the school as his or her community. He knows its physical design and layout and is aware of 97 who belongs on campus and who does not. The officer is required to wear both his uniform and his weapon while on duty to reinforce his role as an actual police officer in the school. He is the center of many school activities and extra curricular events and is a classroom resource to teachers in his areas of expertise. One expression of this approach is the Robeson County School Outreach Program (RCSOP). The RCSOP places a sworn law enforcement officer in targeted high schools in Robeson County. Unlike many other SRO programs nationwide that place uniformed officers in the schools, the RCSOP reflects a much more comprehensive policy focus that includes an integration of the resource officer's function with the existing social network of the community including the Department of Social Services, juvenile courts, the public schools, and law enforcement. The RCSOP is a community effort to provide juvenile intervention before court action becomes necessary. It is based on a premise that school violence is simply juvenile violence that takes place in a school setting. Results and Impact Performance Measures The ultimate desired outcome of an SRO Program is to maintain and improve the safety of the learning environment in the schools through the reduction and prevention of school violence. The best way to measure whether an SRO Program is achieving this desired outcome is to ask those who are directly involved in such a program -- the students and teachers in the schools. Surveys of students and teachers are important tools to measure program effectiveness. Although difficult to measure, one way to explore violence and crime prevention effectiveness is to examine incident numbers, such as the number of fights in schools. Incident numbers for schools and the community at large should be compared before and after program implementation to determine the impact of the SRO on youth crime outside the school. One way to set the amount of savings related to the SRO initiative is to use the SRO's own assessment of his interactions with students to determine how many of his student contacts actually prevent court petitions. He can then link these numbers to costs associated with such petitions. The reduction in the number of petitions is determined to be a savings in court costs directly attributed to the SRO's actions in the school. Implementation Problems and Successes Research shows that not all schools with sworn officers on campus have an effective SRO Program. To be of maximum effectiveness, the SRO must be integrated into the school community with a much larger role than just an officer. Specifically, the roles of the SRO are threefold: peace officer, counselor, and resource officer. 98 When the program was first introduced, there was a strong social consensus that the police and their weapons did not belong on campus. Once the program was established and the officer was trained and performing his furiction correctly, the community sustained the program. Many of the SROs were not comfortable with the different types of law enforcement required on campus, including traffic and drug law enforcement, and with the transition from being a street cop to being a lecturer in the classroom. Their training included lectures on these topics. Successes and Accomplishments Approximately 80% of the eleventh and twelfth grade classes at two high schools in Robeson County were surveyed. Respondents were asked, \"Would you say the School Resource Officer has helped reduce the amount of violence since he or she has been at your school?\" \"Yes\" responses came from 71.1% of the students who remembered their school before the SRO's presence. If the definition of effectiveness is expanded to include effective or efficient 'use of resources, an SRO Program offers communities an efficient means to combat crime and violence. If the SRO Program is effective, it involves very few additional costs for a community. In fact, if hidden costs are investigated, an SRO Program actually pays the community. General costs of a program include personnel costs, training and associated travel costs, supply an~d equipment costs, and administrative costs. Because many of these costs already exist independent of an SRO Program, the additional costs of such a program are less than those categories suggest. These additional costs essentially involve opportunity costs or a redirection of resources with the placement of already existing and trained officers into the schools, rather than the expenditure of additional monies. Two additional effects come from SRO coverage at the schools: (1) violence prevention, and (2) savings within the criminal justice system. The savings to the criminal justice system occurs when cases end as petitions. When SROs bring juveniles to court, the quality of cases increases so that judges dismiss fewer cases. Before SRO presence in schools, juvenile cases that made it to court were often dismissed because the quality of evidence was not acceptable. The municipality incurred court costs with no tangible benefit for the community nor the juveniles involved. Moreover, as one judge stated, such dismissals gave the juveniles involved the message that they could \"beat the system.\" It became a badge of honor for youngsters to go to court, have their case dismissed, and return to school to brag about the adventure. With SROs, the quality of evidence is such that case dismissal is less likely to occur. Another savings to the criminal justice system from an SRO Program is related to training school admissions. Court officials in Robeson County attribute a reduction in the number of training school admissions to the Robeson County Juvenile Task Force (RCJTF) generally and the SRO Program specifically. According to court officials, each admission to training school has an annual (1994) cost of $42,000. The average number of annual admissions to training schools decreased in Robeson County since the introduction of the RCJTF in July 1991. 99 Prospects for Replication To create a School Resource Officer Program, the local leadership must be identified and formed into a community-wide task force with members who represent all segments of the community, from law enforcement to social services. This group will assess the needs of the community and ascertain community leadership support. This group will also establish goals and objectives and identify the target population and funding sources for the SRO Program. A board of interested parties in each jurisdiction and school site chooses the SRO. Successful resource officers are well integrated and well trained using a proven curriculum. The SRO must be connected to a network of services so that he/she can provide all the services necessary to the children or refer them to the appropriate services. To institutionalize the program, the initial task force should continue to hold meetings, and the results of the program should be quantified.

Although the problems have existed for a long time, there is a renewed sense of urgency now, more than ever, to cultivate the best potential of young Americans. Until recently, society has responded to these problems with treatment and rehabilitation services. Such attempts, at best, do not change the behaviors but only deal with them after they have surfaced. Dealing with adolescents once they have exhibited problem behaviors has shown only modest success and is costly. Understanding underlying conditions that exist in the lives of young people is the first step toward identifying effective means of prevention. This particular program effort, OREGON TOGETHER! (OT!), provides local planners and service deliverers with a means to head off such problems long before they begin to drain the community of its economic and human resources. It focuses on those issues and concerns which research proves predict such problems. Research accumulated over the past 30 years or so has demonstrated that there are a number of risk factors that increase the chances of adolescent problem behaviors. Equally important is the evidence that certain protective factors can help shield youngsters from problems. If we can reduce or buffer the risks that youngsters face, while increasing protection throughout the course of their development, we can prevent these problems and promote healthy, pro-social behaviors. Goals and Objectives The major goal of the OT{ project is to mobilize communities throughout the State to reduce risk factors and to increase protective factors that predict adolescent alcohol and other drug abuse, delinquency, teen pregnancy, school-drop out, and violent behavior. The key objectives of the OT! project include the following: to involve a minimum of 50 Oregon communities in the OT! process, including completion of the three major stages of the process; 101 to institute risk~protective-focused prevention approaches throughout the State with particular emphasis on collaborative efforts to reduce adolescent and youth problems and those related to families; to cooperate with other states, and federal-level agencies as well, in the initiation of effective and research-based approaches, based on this risk~protective factor framework, in order to more completely assess its effectiveness; and to institute State- and community-wide approaches to scientific measurement of the quality and success of such efforts, in order to provide an opportunity for others to replicate such approaches, where appropriate. Program Components OREGON TOGETHER! is based on the David Hawkins and Rick Catalano Communities That Care model developed at the University of Washington. Listed below are the key elements and components of the OT! process. Involvement of Key Leaders: Key Leader Orientation The purpose of the orientation is to create an understanding of the risk/protective factor prevention framework, its basic premises, and the essential involvement of key leaders who should include the Sheriff and/or Police Chief, Mayor, District Attorney, School Superintendent, and business leaders. Organizers should try for diversity in ethnicity and spheres of influence. Involvement of key leaders is critical to success. This orientation prepares key leaders to: develop a vision of common goals for the community and forecast the community's capacity for change; decide whether or not to pursue the risk/protective factor prevention framework in their local community and whether or not to commit to a comprehensive, multifaceted, long-term undertaking; and decide whom to invite as members of the community board or task force. Formation of a Community Planning Board If the key leaders decide to launch the program in their community, they invite members of their community to participate. The community board is the main mechanism for carrying out the day-to-day operations of the effort, and some key leaders may be somewhat less involved as these board members assume a greater level of responsibility. The board members typically represent diverse groups and areas in the community. Law enforcement, schools, and local government are among those likely to be represented. These boards often include existing community coalitions, parents, human service agencies, crime prevention providers, service providers, youth, representatives of local businesses, service and civic organizations, religious and cultural groups, recreational organizations, and the media. 102 Conducting a Community Risk and Resource Assessment The third step in the process is for communities to conduct a local assessment of the risk and protective factors related to adolescent problem behaviors. Communities gather information on prevention programs and activities that are currently being offered in order to assess their effectiveness in reducing critical risks or building protective factors in local young people. In assessing risk/protective factors and local program delivery, the community is asked to focus primarily on outcomes -- the extent to which local programs are having an actual impact on the key risk/protective factors identified in the local assessment. In contrast to many situations in which communities rush to implement a program, this process will help focus on those parts of the community that are at highest risk and outline strategies that will address the major risks they identify. Community Risk and Resource Assessment Training prepares communities to: understand risk and protective factor research, apply the Social Development Strategy, conduct a community risk assessment, and examine local programs targeting adolescent problem' behaviors for effectiveness. OT! training materials include a compilation of Social Indicator Data for each Oregon county and the State, which help community board members assess risk factors according to different areas of a child's life (family, school, community, peers). This research assists communities in creating the profile of their community and identifying the most salient risk factors. Planning the Program and Deciding on Evaluation Methods Once the community board has completed an assessment of the community's most prevalent risks and understands what programs/activities exist that meet evaluation criteria, the next step is to initiate program planning. The focus of the Promising Approaches Training is on developing connections between identified risk/protective factors and effective strategies that address them. The community can then develop an action plan for implementing programs. The Promising Approaches Training assists communities to: prioritize the most salient risk/protective factors in the community; select appropriate strategies from a menu of programs that have been tested and evaluated for effectiveness in addressing problem behaviors; develop goals and objectives for an action plan in response to identified risks; identify obstacles to carrying out the plan and resources for overcoming those obstacles; and establish appropriate program evaluation methods. Results and Impact Performance Measures There are two basic performance measures for the project. The first is the assessment of changes in the risk/protective factors identified by each local community planning board. 103 Second is the viability of the key leader and community board within the community. Changes in the Risk Assessment Data A community collects updated information and assesses changes in data. Progress is determined by a reduction in the incidence of risk. For each risk factor there are multiple sets of information. Communities are encouraged to collect more than one set for each risk factor. As of February 1995, the Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs provides each OT! member with archival social indicator data, comparable on a county-by-county basis. State Student Alcohol and Drug Use Survey The biennial adolescent alcohol and other drug use survey of over 11,000 students statewide conducted by the Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs measures overall trends in prevalence of all intoxicating substances. In 1994, for the first time, this survey of sixth, eighth, and eleventh graders measured various risk/protective factors. Viability of Community Board Presty and Wandersman, Goodman and Steckler, Pentz, and other researchers have clearly shown that effective prevention efforts require a sustained involvement of a community. The University of Washington TOGETHER research staff and OT! staff, in concert with the above cited researchers and others, have preliminarily identified criteria to assess a community board's status. They have identified thirteen criteria necessary to ensure the community board's long-term survivability. Implementation Problems and Successes In 1990, the goal of the OREGON TOGETHER! project was to involve 25 communities from throughout the State. The project has far exceeded this goal. As of January 1995, there are 55 OT! communities, with another six being formed. Some of the issues and concerns the project continues to face include the following: The sustainability of community coalitions. Keeping the momentum alive is difficult, particularly in rural communities where a few volunteers do everything. Limited resources for the OT! communities and limited staff are also barriers. Encouraging key leaders to stay involved is of vital importance. How to more effectively measure and evaluate success. Because of the largely volunteer nature of the OT! coalitions, keeping people informed, trained, and motivated to continue collecting risk assessment data is staff intensive. Successes and Accomplishments Project staff are very pleased with the support of the Oregon Criminal Justice Services Division, which has provided three years of funding to support the OT! project. This year OT! communities are applying individually for Edward Byrne Memorial Grant funds through the 104 Oregon Criminal Justice Services Division to implement risk-focused prevention strategies at their local level. Currently 55 Oregon communities have been trained and actively participate in the risk-focused prevention approach to reduction of adolescent behavior problems. Thirty-five communities successfully completed implementation plans for their strategies and receive $4,000 mini-grants to aid in their efforts. Through a grant from MicroSoft, Inc., OT! members have been trained in and given software to aid the ongoing risk assessment process and evaluation of strategies. Oregon Office of Drug Abuse Prevention was awarded a grant from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention to provide a data analyst to profile the sixteen risk factors in every Oregon county by assessing common archival data and survey data. Additionally, the Department of Human Resources division heads and staff are now being trained to utilize the risk factors in their daily work with clients. Additionally, we have had significant success in getting other social service agencies and providers to consider the risk/protective factor framework in efforts to serve a variety of clients and consumers. Those adopting such an approach, at least in part, include local commissions on children and families; the Oregon Department of Education, which administers 70% of the State's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities funds; Reduce Adolescent Prevention Problems project of the Department of Human Resources; Oregon National Guard efforts in drug demand reduction; Tobacco-Free Coalition of Oregon (TOFCO); and Department of Human Resources Risk/Protective Factors Task Force. Included here is a brief profile of one OT! community effort to impact its salient risk/protective factors. Beaverton Together! efforts have been led by a strong group of key community leaders including the Superintendent of Schools, Mayor, local police officers, county sheriff's office, business leaders, school personnel, faith community leaders, youth, and others. Key leaders describe Beaverton Together! not as a \"program,\" but as a group that links and facilitates programs to address the risks facing young people. The Together! Board conducted an assessment of risk factors in Beaverton by collecting archival data and conducting a phone survey. Juvenile vandalism and loitering in city parks was becoming a problem for this suburban community. A city police officer approached Beaverton Together! about launching a Friday night basketball program to draw in gang members and juveniles with nothing to do. Night Court, a midnight basketball program for seventh to ninth grade youth, was launched at three middle schools in Spring 1994. This program is attracting over 500 young people each Friday night and has recently expanded to six sites. City police officers run the program assisted by :.i' , 105 the local park and recreation program and Boys and Girls Club staff. The school district provides the open gyms and a janitor, youth civil patrol help monitor parking lots, and Cellular One provides free phones for emergency calls. This project exemplifies model collaboration. In another project involving youth from the Beaverton Intermediate Schools and the Beaverton Police Department, Beaverton Peer Court, was launched in February 1995. As modeled in other peer court projects from around the country, peer court utilizes students as jurors, defense and prosecuting attorneys, and bailiffs. Only misdemeanor cases are heard by Peer Court juries at each week's sessions. A local judge serves as the presiding officer of the court. Prospects for Replication The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has supported many of the research efforts of the David Hawkins and Rick Catalano work at the University of Washington in Seattle. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has also provided resources to local communities and states investing in this approach, as has the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The work of a Six-state consortium has allowed ongoing communication between professionals implementing the risk/protective factor framework into their statewide prevention efforts. Those states (Kansas, Maine, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah and Washington) have received some limited assistance from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention to continue this work together. As they continue this collaborative effort, they have begun to reach out to other states and organizations nationwide, providing key information and guidelines for implementation.

As a result of the lack of coordinated services at the community level, youth run the risk of initially being \"ignored\" for behaviors (truancy, running away, substance abuse and beyond- control behaviors) that are symptomatic of potentially more serious delinquency, and then are prematurely removed from their communities and placed in a State system. On a local level, there is a need to seek out and provide accessible family services. Researchers agree that early identification of problems and early intervention are key to reducing later negative outcomes. Problem behaviors are precursors of more potentially serious behaviors. Youth involved in these behaviors respond best when they and their families are offered a range of services and there is multiagency collaboration. Emphasis needs to be on empowering both the youth and the family. Use of strategies based on the traditional mental health model (50 minute clinical hour office visit) consistently demonstrates little success with this group of youngsters. Empowering families means reaching out to them in their homes, schools and community, and experiencing their world. Parents and youth are more cooperative when they know you understand the environmental pressures they are facing. Evaluation of the human services delivery system in Rhode Island consistently paints a picture that is not family friendly, that lacks the financial resources to respond to the needs of the families and youth, and that is fragmented. The limited menu of services and delays in service delivery reduce the likelihood of success. Family Court, with its ability to \"order\" funding for treatment, is one avenue to access services. This is a \"Catch 22,\" since placement frequently becomes the treatment of choice, due to long waiting lists for essential services and the lack of preventive alternatives. Thus, a youth who is causing trouble at home, in school, or the community can be petitioned to Family Court to \"solve the problem\" and, if uncooperative, can ultimately be incarcerated at great expense to the taxpayer. Research is inconclusive about whether or not the threat or actual incarceration of juveniles prevents or enhances the possibility of further involvement with the juvenile justice system. Given the current mentality of \"zero tolerance\" for inappropriate behaviors, the thi'eat of incarceration is very real. 107 Goals and Objectives The goal of the Tide Family Services program is to intervene with youth who are most at-risk of becoming involved with the juvenile justice system. These youth are the most likely to be petitioned to Family Court on charges of truancy, wayward/status offenses, or delinquency. Traditionally, these youth are difficult to engage and not receptive to treatment. Although isolated attempts are made to find these youth, there is little or no consistent follow-through until the youth is petitioned to Family Court. Specifically, the objectives of the program are to: Improve the availability and coordination of local services related to runaway, truant, substance abusing, and beyond-control youth by identifying them and their families and insisting that they become involved in the services; and providing a model for legislative initiatives for the purpose of mandating appropriate family outreach counseling and advocacy services to wayward/status youth and their families prior to allowing a Wayward/Status Petition to be filed on a youth in Family Court. Provide a therapeutically sound and cost-effective continuum of services for youth at risk of being placed outside of the home and referring youth in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades to the project when a pattern of truancy begins; aggressively identifying these youngsters who continue to be truant or suspended, and, when possible, bringing them to the project during the school hours; insisting : that the parent(s) participate in services with other parents at least one night a week at the community center where community service providers will be present and available to help families; and developing a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week intensive tracking program with the capacity to service 50 youth in the target area for a maximum of six months. Provide a culturally sensitive program by ensui'ing the capability of communicating and understanding the various ethnic/cultural issues through networking with and, when possible, accessing services provided by the various ethnic groups and associations involved in the community; and hiring bilingual staff when possible. Provide information and training regarding issues related to the illicit use of alcohol and drugs and teaching refusal skills and nonviolent conflict resolution skills by developing a series of individual, family, and group counseling programs to maximize awareness of the dangers of illicit alcohol and drugs, and teaching refusal skills and nonviolent conflict resolution. 108 Program Components The program structure is a collaborative working arrangement involving the police, the youth's school, and Tides Family Services. In each of the target areas, a TEAM is established composed of a juvenile or community police officer, a school representative, and a family outreach worker from Tides Family Services. Tides Family Services seeks out these youth and families on home visits and initiates family counseling and advocacy. The TEAM meets regularly to monitor and attempt, with parental permission, to secure appropriate preventive services. Before petitioning the youth into court, which can be filed by either the police or school authorities, the TEAM must attempt to secure services for the youth within her/his community. Even when the youth is petitioned into court, the Family Court Diversionary Unit becomes involved in the project and works with the TEAM. The Family Court Diversionary worker can informally dispose of the petition provided the youth cooperates. Tides Family Services staff work directly with representatives of the schools, police jurisdictions, and Family Court. The concepts used in the original project have been refined and an intensive 24-hour, seven-day-a-week tracking program has been added. An Hispanic outreacl'ffcounseling component has been operational for one year in the Pawtucket and Central Falls area. There are also significant Portuguese and Cape Verdian populations. If a youth is known to the police or school authorities as a runaway, a substance abuser, a truant, and/or is beyond the control of the parent(s), a referral is made to Tides Family' Services. The Tides family worker will arrange an initial meeting at the youth's home to explain the program and conduct a family assessment. If the parent(s) or the youth refuses to allow the Tides family worker to come to the home, the truant or .juvenile officer will arrange a meeting either at school or in the police station, o If a referral comes to the police, the juvenile officer might choose to refer it to the Juvenile Hearing Board or to the Tides Family Services project. The initial meeting might take place at the police station with the parent(s), youth, juvenile officer and Tides worker, or at the home with the Tides family worker. In either case, the family worker begins the assessment at the home. The treatment team, at this point, is the school representative, the juvenile officer and the Tides family worker. Based upon the assessment, the team develops and approves a treatment plan. It is the responsibility of the Tides worker to see that the plan is implemented. The Tides family worker is expected to work with the family on all issues relating to the family and the family's involvement within the community. The minimum services include family, individual, and group counseling. Ancillary services include advocacy work, helping to secure additional resources (e.g., AIDS testing, fuel assistance, arranging General Equivalency Diploma classes, job training, etc.). If there are school-related problems, the Tides family worker and school team member are expected to work with the family to develop an appropriate school program. If the school cannot initiate a program, the family begins an appeal process. The family worker would be expected to advocate for the family. 109 The Tides family worker can recommend that the youth be evaluated for learning disabilities under Public Law 94-142. If the youth is determined not eligible for these services, the family worker can request that the youth be considered eligible for program adjustments under section 504 of the Rhode Island Education Law. At any stage of the process, the team, in conjunction with the parent(s), may utilize appropriate community resources. This can involve referrals to the local Child and Adolescent Service System Program, Alcoholics Anonymous or Alanon meetings, parent support groups, or Brother to Brother (family violence counseling). If the youth is a runaway or homeless, the team uses the services offered by the Rhode Island Runaway and Host Home Network. If the problem is still unresolved, the appropriate petition is filed with Family Court and the team requests that the case be sent to the Family Court Diversionary Unit. One member of this unit is assigned to the target area. The court diversion worker is part of the team (social service worker, school representative, and juvenile officer) and attends regularly scheduled meetings. The team attempts to resolve the issues and work on a quasi-probationary contract. If the youth or family still refuses to cooperate, the team may recommend that the case be placed on the court calendar. At the pre-trial hearing, with permission from the parent(s), the members of the team present a report prepared under the leadership of the Tides family worker to the Judge. The report includes a brief social history, description of services provided, and specific recommendations for that youth. Removal of the youth from the family is the last option considered. If the judge orders a short-term placement, the Tides family worker remains involved in the case, with the approval of the court. This facilitates a more expeditious: return of the youth to the family. Results and Impact Performance Measures The innovative focus of this project is that it has the capability of effecting a change in the current system that is used to deal with runaway and homeless youth. Currently, there is no organized or coordinated statewide approach to servicing these youth. Neither the police nor the truant officers were able to assess and treat the problems that the youth and their families presented, and their knowledge of the services within the human service community was limited. Their only function was to make the referral to court. With the involvement of Tides Family Services as the lead social agency, crisis intervention, assessment, and counseling are available prior to the youth being referred to Court. Implementation Problems and Successes In the original target area (Kent County), the overall implementation went smoothly. The police, school and Family Court readily agreed to become involved with the project. The TEAMS were quickly established and referrals were processed. Statewide, the difficulty was 110 the number of referrals. In January 1995, with a total of five full-time staff processing cases, there were still 71 cases on the waiting list. Parents were calling requesting services and youths were cooperating. Many of the youth resided in the same areas and their friends were either involved with this project or in other Tides programs. The Tides workers' main function is to find and engage these families in the community. The expectation for the original project was that with three full-time staff, the program could service a daily average of 70 youth and their families. The maximum length of service would be six months. The plan was to service 200 families in the original project during the first year of operation. The project used college student interns to work under the supervision of the regular staff. This accounted for approximately 200 hours a week of volunteer services from college students. Although staff were very successful at finding the participants and convincing them to return to school, staff nevertheless spent considerable time advocating on behalf of parents and youths with school administrators and teachers to provide an appropriate educational program. The youths frequently fell into a pattern of detention, suspensions and, eventually, exclusion. When not in school, the youths were caught up in the cycle of staying up very late at night and sleeping during the day. This pattern frequently involved alcohol and drug use/abuse and sexual promiscuity, indicating a high potential for more serious delinquent behaviors. It was. very difficult to break this pattern. .... Although Rhode Island is a small state, there are 39 municipalities, and each is independent, so that creating a legislative change is much more difficult then originally anticipated. Successes and Accomplishments The teams are operational in Kent County, the original target area. Petitions for truancy and WaywardJStatus offenses are referred to the Tides Family Services. Youths and families have basically cooperated. Although it was beyond the scope of the research component to measure success, the cooperation of the police, school, and Family Court personnel was very encouraging. As a result, a number of youth were diverted from the Family Court. Those petitioned to the Family Court in a number of cases were referred back to Tides for counseling services, and were able to continue to live at home. Two professional conferences have been conducted: one for professionals from across the State and one for the Kent County area professionals. The purpose of these conferences is to help communities assume \"ownership\" for their children. On a program level, in her report entitled Runaway Reunification Project.\" Program Evaluation (October, 1994) Lenore Olsen, Ph.D., noted the following: This program model incorporates many of the elements that have been found to be successful with this population of high-risk youth. It offers a range of services to 111 youth and their families and has developed strategies for multiagency collaboration. Early identification of problems and early intervention are key to reducing later negative outcomes. This program has components for identifying at-risk youth, and providing early intervention services. Social skills training, which was offered to most youth, is another component of successful early intervention programs. Reviews of successful programs also repeatedly emphasize the need to empower both the youth and their parents. Suggestions for empowerment include involving clients in cooperative case planning, peer support and education, involvement in agency and community policy making, experiential sharing, and involvement in advocacy and outreach efforts. Such groups (peer support) have been demonstrated to be particularly effective in dealing with drug abuse, anger management, and social skills development. Tides Family Services has a Latino Outreach Component. This has helped considerably in reaching this population, especially in Pawtucket and Central Falls. The workers are in direct contact with Progresso Latino and Proyecto Esperanza, the two major Hispanic agencies in Rhode Island. The Hispanic population is the largest minority group in the State. Prospects for Replication Tides Family Services began in 1983. The DHHS grant enabled Tides to focus more closely on the issue of preventing youth from being removed from their families. The project is in the process of being replicated in a second target area. The intensive outreach component begun in October 1994 in the second target area provides intensive tracking. The hope is to add another component which will allow Tides workers in conjunction with the truant officers and police to seek out truants and bring them to a central location. This new component is the final step in a total network of services for truant, runaway, substance abusing, and beyond control youth. Tides Family Services is currently attempting to secure funding and a legislative mandate to seek out truants and bring them to the Barton Street Community Center in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Tutorial and counseling services will be provided for the youth, and the parent(s) will be expected to attend family and group counseling sessions. 112 Contact Information Brother Michael Reis Executive Director Tides Family Services 1599 Main Street. West Warwick, RI 02893 (401) 822-1360 113 Virginia An Achievable Dream Statement of the Problem Thousands of children in Newport News are shut out of the \"American Dream\" because they are at-risk for school failure. Factors contributing to the risk include: poverty, single parent homes, violence in their environment, lack of successful role models, a pervasive street culture that degenerates education, and low opportunity for exposure to academic/cultural enrichment opportunities. In Newport News, more than 30% of ninth graders fail to complete high school with their entering class. Dropouts have little hope of competing for jobs, which require technical knowledge, communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The solution is education. This is the Achievable Dream: that these children stay in school and obtain the education needed to become contributing citizens. The vision is that many will attend college with help from the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program and others will go to technical and vocational schools after completing high school. To compete in a global economy, educated workers must be readied for the technically demanding industries that will drive the economy. If the United States is to compete successfully in this global marketplace, all of its children, including those at-risk, must be prepared to be productive. Goals and Objectives An Achievable Dream Magnet School is committed to the academic success of children grades three through eight who are identified as being at-risk of school failure. An Achievable Dream Magnet School provides a challenging educational environment including social, emotional, and academic support which enables students to take full advantage of educational opportunities leading to success as educated, employable, and highly responsible citizens. The overall goal of An Achievable Dream Magnet School is to provide an exciting but highly structured educational environment. This environment must challenge and motivate the academic and social skills of children who risk not realizing their full educational potential due to the presence of multiple negative socio-economic factors. This rigorous academic program is offered year-round and emphasizes self-discipline. The self-esteem, aspirations, and skills students develop while a part of An Achievable Dream 114 Magnet School will lead them to stay in school, pursue an education beyond high school, and become productive citizens. As students develop respect for themselves and for the value of their education, they will begin t'o understand, appreciate, and value others. Responsible patterns of socialization will unfold, making involvement in crime, delinquency, and substance abuse unlikely. The specific objectives of An Achievable Dream Magnet School are to: provide a creative, motivating, and exciting program to ensure academic success and improve school attendance; develop positive attitudes about school and the relationship education plays in success; provide a social bridge through the sport of tennis; provide social skills training and expect appropriate behavior to demonstrate this training; help students develop a positive and realistic self-concept; increase student awareness of career opportunities; expand student aspirations and instill a belief that these aspirations are achievable; strengthen parent involvement in the educational process; develop an awareness of individual responsibility in the community; achieve 12-month academic progress during a 240 day school year based upon the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) and Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) test scores; develop a minimum word processing literacy of 25 words per minute by the fifth grade; ensure that all fifth grade students read at the fifth grade reading level as indicated by IOWA and DRP scores; and offer positive alternatives to street culture which harbors crime, drugs, and violence. 115 Program Components An Achievable Dream Magnet School is a traditional elementary school with a major emphasis on academics, character development, and discipline. Emphasis is on reading, reading comprehension, mathematics, and computer skills. An Achievable Dream Magnet School imparts academics aggressively through an elementary school day which is 35% longer than the Newport News Public Schools standard in core subjects. This extended day allows teachers to provide lessons in much greater depth. Teaching is done at an accelerated level with tutoring provided for those children who are not on grade level. The school requires not only a longer school day, but a year-round school program with a calendar from September through June and a required 8-week summer semester. An Achievable Dream Magnet School is in session 45 weeks out of 52 weeks in the calendar year. There is a teacher and an assistant in each class, which represents a 12 to one student to teacher ratio. Teachers are recruited with a year-to-year commitment. The program attempts to select young teachers with good stamina, high energy, and diversity in race and gender. Teachers are dared to dream up the most exciting ways to teach and are given the freedom to be creative. An Achievable Dream Magnet School enhances the academic enrichment experience with frequent field trips. Weekly trips during the summer reinforce thematic curriculum, and monthly trips during the school year provide not only educational support but cultural and socially broadening experiences as well. Along with academic ability, An Achievable Dream Magnet School stresses the essential ingredients of character and citizenship to a person's success. The virtues for success which are concentrated on daily as part of the school and classroom culture are: self discipline, honesty, integrity, acceptance of responsibility, respect for adults, respect for property, punctuality, lawfulness, decision making, and peaceful conflict resolution. To stress the strong association between education, character building, and success, role models are brought in each Friday for a presentation which includes their backgrounds, education, and what they believe it takes to succeed. The children have an opportunity to ask questions of people whom they can learn from and emulate. The children have daily character development sessions conducted by a volunteer group from the military with an emphasis on moral and personal responsibility. Discipline is administered so that children understand that they have to be responsible for their own actions. There is a demerit system to monitor the expectations for uniform presentation and behavior. Tennis is an important part of the program, and every child must participate in it year-round. Playing tennis develops sportsmanship, teamwork, discipline, social skills, proper dress, and appropriate behavior which are necessary in the development of a good citizen. 116 An Achievable Dream Magnet School furnishes uniforms which must be worn every day and must be maintained and replaced by the family as needed. The program starts in the third grade and continues through the twelfth grade. Children in the program who maintain a C+ grade average, are drug and major crime free, do not become pregnant or father a child, and meet the necessary entrance requirements will be given their choice to attend a State college or trade school with tuition paid by the State through the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program. Students in the Achievable Dream Magnet School Program are expected to grow academically, socially, and emotionally. Study and organizational skills are expected to improve. Students are given many opportunities to interact with peers and adults in an attempt to improve social skills. For those students needing additional support, academic tutoring is available. If counseling or family services support is needed, the guidance department and home/school coordinators work with children and their families to provide requested support. Parental involvement is a big part of the program. Both parents and students are required to sign a contract that ensures participation, attendance, regular homework, and good behavior. A home-school coordinator is on site full-time to help teachers involve parents and support students. Families are expected to give 16 hours of involvement time every nine weeks. When children get their report cards every nine weeks, parents also get report cards, highlighting adherence to parent contract obligations and giving suggestions for continued family involvement. Results and Impact Performance Measures Performance is measured in several ways by gathering both hard and soft data. Academic success is measured with the DRP (Degrees of Reading Power) Test, ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills), and teacher-directed informal Reading Inventory and Math Testing. Growth in citizenship and work-study habits is measured by the staff and indicated every nine weeks on both the academic and citizenship report cards. Implementation Problems and Successes The Achievable Dream Program represents a complex amalgam of educators, business partners, and municipal government. The implementation of this complex program has been challenging due to the colliding paradigms of involved entities. As the school system strives to work with the business community and city government to insure adequate implementation of the components of the Achievable Dream Program, all entities have had to stretch and shift their paradigms about what works in the education arena. 117 The length of the school day, transportation from one end of the city to another (approximately 21 miles), parental involvement, attendance, uniform maintenance, and technology integration are some of the many challenges that the Achievable Dream Program has had to face this school year. Successes and Accomplishments Students are actively engaged in the academic experiences offered to them each day. They enjoy wearing uniforms to school and being associated with the program. The teachers and assistants are dedicated and make sure that students are successful. In the 1992-93 school year, the majority of the Achievable Dream Magnet School students made percentile growth in academic achievement: 42% on the the ITBS Math; 83% in at least one of the academic areas tested; and 17% in all areas. An Achievable Dream Magnet School students made quartile growth on the standardized measures (DRP and ITBS Reading and Math): the ITBS Math; 54% in at least one of the three tested areas; and 7% in all three areas. Thirty-three percent of an Achievable Dream Magnet School students made more than one year's gain in reading, and 68% made more than one year's gain in math. In the 1993-94 school year in the fourth grade, the average scores in math were maintained or increased, and more new fourth graders are scoring above the national average in math (52%). The fifth grade groups showed quartile growth in reading from 10% the first year to 49% the second year on the ITBS - Reading and from 22% to 40% on the DRP. After their first year in the program, 37% of the new fifth grade students made quartile gains on the DRP; 53% made quartile gains on the ITBS - Reading; and 42% made quartile gains on the ITBS - Math. Most fifth graders are scoring above the national average on standardized test measures, Most fifth graders are achieving more than one year's growth in reading or in math. Prospects for Replication Many other localities have inquired about what would be necessary to replicate the Achievable Dream Magnet School Program. Achievable Dream, Inc. is very willing to share information and staff to assist in the process of replication. Richmond, Virginia and Hampton, Virginia have actively investigated the possibility of beginning programs like this one. 118 Contact Information Jacob M. Wilson, III Principal An Achievable Dream Magnet School Dunbar-Erwin Elementary School 726 16th Street Newport News, VA 23607 (804) 928-6825 (804) 247-1720 fax 119 Washington Youth Violence Prevention and Intervention Program Statement of the Problem Incidents of youth violence in Washington State have been rising steadily for more than a decade, with arrests of juveniles for violent crimes increasing at a rate more than twice the national average. In 1992, Washington's Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development launched a counter offensive to this exponential growth of violence with an innovative pilot program which mobilized communities to develop solutions to their unique sets of problems related to youth violence. The roots of violence are an intricate web of compounding factors that include poverty, racism, drug abuse, child abuse, easy access to guns, and media glamorization of violence. While virtually all communities across Washington have experienced heightened levels of youth violence, the circumstances that lead to violent behavior often differ significantly from town to town and neighborhood to neighborhood. The Youth Violence Prevention and Intervention Program was created in recognition of this, with the belief that each community is the best expert on its own problems and in the best position to develop its own solutions. With this philosophy in mind, the Department invited communities to develop strategies for community-based solutions to youth violence. They were directed to use a developmental framework which begins with assessment and prioritization of community needs, followed by formation of strategies. The final stage of this development model involves identification and measurement of outcomes to assure strategies are working successfully. Fourteen custom- designed approaches, known universally as the Youth Violence Prevention and Intervention Program (Y'VPIP), have now been developed across the State, creating a laboratory in which individual categories of services and a variety of service combinations are being studied for effectiveness. Goals and Objectives The universal goal of the YVPIP is to reduce those factors which place individuals and communities at risk of experiencing violence and enhance those factors which protect against violence. Individual, community-level goals encompass these general areas: provide educational, employment, and health care services to youths living in areas with disproportionately low incomes and high rates of violence; reduce rates of recidivism for youthful offenders; 120 reduce school failure and dropout rates; create safe and empowering schools for students and staff; reduce rates of crime, violence, and unemployment in areas heavily impacted by violence and crime; and assist students to prevent or escape gang involvement and succeed in school. The objective of the YVPIP is to provide opportunities for young people to experience recognition and respect and forge bonds to their communities within the context of their schools, families, and neighborhoods. YVPIP activities and services are designed to develop in young people a sense of identity and purpose leading to positive contributions to their communities. Specific objectives at the local level include: individualized case management of youths in the development of educational goals, job training and placement, and special assistance and support in accessing needed resources; incarcerated youths develop skills in communication, anger management, victim empathy, and conflict resolution with aftercare support provided in job and educational placement and accessing needed services and supports; mentoring programs pair high-risk students with caring teachers and police to provide educational and social support; school district-wide training provided to students and staff in anger management, conflict resolution, and violence prevention skills; comprehensive case management of high-risk students by multidisciplinary team; drop-in recreational programs provide safe environments, educational assistance, job training and placement, and access to health and social services; school-based violence prevention and peer counselor training; interdisciplinary team uses outreach and case management to develop social and health service plans to improve family functioning; after-school homework assistance and life skills training for students impacted by poverty, family problems, and special educational needs; high school re-entry classes provide opportunities for students to make up high school credits, with reinforcement in areas such as self-esteem, gang prevention, career awareness, teen pregnancy, goal setting, life skills, HIV education, and seeking a vision; and street outreach and skill-building opportunities in the areas of life skills, education, leadership, and recreation for gang involved youths. Program Components While the specific activities and services provided by each individual communities' needs, each program is required to following development model: YVPIP differ according to develop services using the 121 assess community needs through identification of risk and protective factors; prioritize risk factors to be addressed; identify means for enhancing factors which protect against community risks; design strategy for minimizing risks and maximizing protective factors; identify indicators for measuring outcomes; devise means for measuring outcomes; implement outcome measurement; and participate in statewide evaluation. The YVPIPs use a community mobilization model at each site. This model allows each site to bring together a consortium of service providers, educators, parents, business and community leaders, law enforcement, and young people. This group designs and implements solutions to community problems. This broad-based inclusion of youths, service providers, parents, and educators makes for more comprehensive and reliable planning. By using a risk and protective factor based model, each community designs services to meet their needs, but within a format that assures accountability and maximizes success. Activities conducted by the 14 projects cover a broad spectrum of services, from prevention to intervention and treatment, including: educational assistance including school re-entry services, tutoring, educational placement, and alternative schools; job training and placement; drop-in activity programs; counseling and support groups; skill building in communications, anger management, conflict resolution, victim awareness and empathy, and life choices; transition services for paroled youths; and assistance in accessing social and health resources including drug treatment, housing, health care, and other basic needs. Results and Impact Performance Measures These indicators may be individual or community-based, depending on the services provided. In a drop-in, recreationally-based program, where individual ease management is not appropriate or possible, community trends such as drops in crime rates for the areas where drop-in sites are located are measured. In a program where specific individuals are being managed, tracking those individuals' successes is possible, and the indicators used by this kind of a program might include raised grade point average, completion of drug treatment, or job placement. 122 While the individual nature of the 14 pilot projects which make up the YVPIP presents an evaluation challenge, the flexibility which allows each community to custom-design services to meet their individual needs is expected to be more successful than prescribed program services. The risk and protective factor-based model provides the basis for evaluation, allowing for each program to be evaluated on its own merits, based upon the goals and measurements they themselves have identified. An independent evaluator, Dr. Claus Tjaden, has been contracted to conduct an evaluation of the program. A process evaluation was completed in January 1995. The first stage of the program evaluation will be completed in July 1995. Implementation Problems and Successes Community-designed and implemented services hold great promise for success, but such a design can also pose particular challenges because there is no single replication model. Most programs have struggled to some extent with the challenge of tailoring services to be community-appropriate. Training in risk and protective factors has been provided to the YVPIP contractors to help them make most effective use of this development model. This allows program strategies and services to be more effective when designed to mitigate specific situations. At the same time; by basing services on known risks and protective factors, the means for measuring and evaluating program effectiveness is created. The initial findings in the process evaluation confirm that services address important individual and community needs. In most instances, programs are well integrated into, and receive support from, the local communities. A wide range of community types and populations are served through these community-based models. Funding is a challenge for virtually all the projects, as YVPIP funding is minimal, from a low of $36,450 to a high of $74,300. The programs are required to access a minimum 25% local match in cash, in-kind, or a combination of the two. As described above, most programs are attempting significant community change requiring substantially greater resources than those provided through their YVPIP grant alone. Most programs are leveraging local funds far beyond the 25% match required. Successes and Accomplishments A total of 11,846 clients including 1,632 parents were provided services over fiscal year 1994. Demographically, those served were African American (15.8%), Asian American (13.4%), Caucasian (47.5%), Hispanic (15.6%), Native American (2.9%), and other ethnicities (1.6%). Clients ranged in age from eight to twenty-one years. Seventy-four percent of clients were 8- 15 years old; 21.8% were 16-18 years old; and 4.2% were 19-21 years old. In the Center for Career Alternatives YVPIP, 72% of youths who were provided job training were employed in un-subsidized jobs. Ninety day follow-ups indicated 100% job retention. 123 One hundred percent (100%) of the youths targeted for reentry into school are still attending or have graduated. The Yakima Police Department has reported an 83% reduction in violent crime rates in neighborhoods where Kid's Place and Night Action programs exist as part of the Yakima YVPIP. There has been a 75% reduction of reported on-campus violence since conflict resolution training has been provided through the Puget Sound Educational Service District YVPIP. The suspension rate for students of color has been reduced by 50% since implementation of school-wide conflict resolution training, and weapons violations decreased from ten in 1992-93 to three in 1991-94 in the Kennewick YVPIP area. Tacoma Police report a sharp decline in gang activity during hours when the Late-Night YMCA program is in operation as part of the Safe Streets YVPIP. Finally, 72% of the youths who initially indicated they intended to continue drug use after release from Echo Glen juvenile rehabilitation institution went into drug treatment after participating in counseling and youth support groups as part of the Echo Glen YVPIP. Prospects for Replication The development model can and has been successfully replicated. The model used by the YVPIPs is based largely upon a model developed by the University of Washington's Social Development Research Group, known as \"Communities that Care.\" The assessment of community risk and protective factors form the basis for strategies and services and the development of means for measurement. What occurs in between the assessment and the outcome is completely individualized,: although actual services provided generally can be categorized by type. It is the tailoring of these services to meet specific community needs and the particular combination of these services that makes each program unique. The other unique factor found in the projects is the mobilization of the community to assess needs and design strategies. The advantages to this community-based approach are compounded across the State through the exchange of ideas that take place among the YVPIPs, as they meet to discuss and provide updated information on their respective programs and communities. Representatives share what has and has not worked for each organization, trouble-shoot problems, and exchange solutions and models directly from their respective experiences. 124 Contact Information Sherman Wilkins Gang/Youth Violence Intervention Prevention Specialist Echo Glen Children's Center 33010 Southeast 99th Street Snoqualmie, WA 98065 (206) 831-1262 (206) 831-1320 fax 2? 125 Wyoming Wind River Indian Reservation Youth and Family At-Risk Project Statement of the Problem The 2.3 million-acre Wind River Indian Reservation in west central Wyoming is one of the largest Indian reservations in the United States. Seventy-five percent of the families on the Reservation are classified as low-income or living in poverty. The average family income for Arapaho families is $5,520; Shoshone, (61%) of so-called \"low-income\" Indian families on the Reservation have no income at all. By virtue of living in such a rural, isolated and poverty-stricken area, young people face considerable risks and obstacles. Problems facing these at-risk youth and families include unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse, and high levels of domestic and interpersonal violence. In addition, the high rates of school drop-outs, suicide and teen pregnancies -- all higher than the State average -- contribute to low self-esteem and poor academic achievement. Multifamily households are common. Goals and Objectives The overall goals of Wind River Youth and Family at Risk Project are to elevate the quality of life on the Reservation, and to provide a forum through which various groups can interact with one another and work together. Specific objectives include: Establish a Database to Measure Project Outcomes Data generated from the Teen Assessment Project (TAP) will be disseminated to provide information about community adolescent perceptions of mental health concerns, perceptions of the community, school and family; to provide self-reports of various positive and problematic behaviors; and to expand the TAP process into a third school district. Increase Community Support for Original and Expanded Audiences To accomplish community support and outreach, the program maintains coalition participation, communication and sustainability by providing a periodic newsletter, \"Support Line\", and conducts monthly meetings; reviews and updates coalition membership, resources, services, goals, outreach and activities; implements goals to increase participation in community youth, parent and educational projects 126 promoting effective problem solving and educational efforts; and works to increase the volunteer base. Expand Activities to Develop Youth Competencies The At-Risk Project provides training to volunteers and agency staff; continues outreach to schools, agencies and community events by organizing active 4-H groups, projects, afierschool programs, summer activities and summer camps; and increases student competencies in technical areas with 4-H educational programs. The expected results of these activities are to increase youth participation in 4-H and community projects; and to expand youth leadership, employability, and academic skills. Expand Activities to Develop Family Strengths The project provides outreach to schools, agencies, parent groups, community events and to isolated communities on the Reservation through training and consultation to volunteer and agency staff; facilitates community sponsorship of educational programs and recreational activities for parents and families; promotes the delivery of educational programs by agencies; increases volunteerism by introducing the opportunity for community volunteers to receive community training; and provides family enrichment activities. These activities are designed to improve parental self-worth and effective parenting skills; increase community support for individuals, families and children; empower:. community members with leadership skills; and enhance families' and children's creative opportunities. Develop Innovative Educational and Awareness Programs Addressing Youth and Families The Wind River project provides training for educators/teachers and parents to help cope with at-risk children; addresses community at-risk issues as identified by TAP data through identification and implementation of programs that supplement existing education and at-risk programs; and provides resources for Coalition for Families and Youth to prioritize issues. These educational programs increase teacher, parent and community awareness of at-risk issues facing Indian children; and increase cooperation through the development of partnerships among agencies, schools, and communities to explore solutions. Q .. Use Volunteers Wherever Possible Volunteer goals at the start of the program were the following: ten adults will contribute 240 hours of volunteer time toward family camp; 120 adults each contribute eight hours participating in developing parenting skills with 160 youth; six adults will contribute 120 hours of volunteer time working with 25 4-H youth at camp; twelve adults will volunteer a total of 60 hours of time improving leadership skills for community and self-awareness; twenty adults will contribute 1,200 hours of volunteer time developing and implementing TAP in schools to reach 150 youth; twelve adults will contribute 200 hours of service providing 80 youth day camp enrichment activities. 127 Program Components The Wind River Indian Reservation Youth and Family At-Risk Project is a collaborative effort among a wide array of organizations and groups who are trying to combat the serious and pervasive problems of the Reservation. Because of the unique history of these two tribes m they were enemies until the U.S. Government placed them side by side on Wind River Reservation -- the problems have become entrenched. The At-Risk Project recognizes this history, and seeks to involve the many different organizations which already provide services, albeit fragmented, to the Indians. The project's efforts have involved the following program components. The Wind River Indian Reservation Youth and Family At-Risk Project includes programs, projects, and approaches in trying to combat youth delinquency, teen pregnancy, family health, youth unemployment, addiction problems and extensive family violence. Because the problems are great, and many organizations recognizing this have become involved with the Reservation in the past, the list of collaborators and the programs they bring to Wind River is extensive. For instance, there is a 4-H SERIES using several different 4-H programs, some of which are based on the California Community Center for Action, including a 4-H CARES (Chemical Abuse Resistance Education Series) and 4-H PACT (Parents and Adolescents Can Talk) programs. Other programs include Building Common Ground, an educational, problem solving, skills- enhancing program regarding the land and environment; Wildlife Habitat Evaluation, which teaches youth fundamentals of wildlife management and the importance of habitat; PEER- PLUS II, an explanation of relationships for teens; Project Adventure (Rope Course); Self- Esteem: Your Children and You, an Extension Parenting Education Model; Youth Quake, an Extension Court Mandated Parenting Training; Supportive Connections: Rural Communities and Single Parent Families, an Extension Parenting Program; SPACES, a program designed for early adolescents (children aged nine to fifteen) and the adults who work with them. The primary goals of SPACES is to help prepare adults to work with youth in three areas: outer space (science and technology), inner space (personal coping skills) and shared spaces (environmental and cultural awareness). Another collaborative program is Raising Responsible Teens, a series developed for parents of early adolescents aged 11 to 14 and other adults who work with or are concerned about youth. Raising Responsible Teens provides parents with information to better understand the developmental needs of teenagers and specific parenting strategies for dealing with tough issues such as teenage sexuality, alcohol and drug abuse and communication. By attending meetings of the Wind River Youth and Family Coalition, the schools and health and human resources agencies have expressed the need for a continued collaborative effort. They have agreed to work together for the good of at-risk youth and their families, and have demonstrated their commitment to this project through in-kind resources. The project is now communicating with the USDA Networks. Two associate professors in Human Development and Family Studies are included in the grant as consultants and evaluators as well. 128 The following organizations have made additional commitments to the coalition and to this project: the Business Councils and Tribal Social Services, as well as several schools, which provide facilities for Coalition meetings and conferences at no cost, and provide staff to help facilitate workshops and conferences. Tribal Social Services provides resource materials as needed. Indian Health Services conducts in-service classes, provides information and resource materials, and refers youth and families. The Shoshone/Arapaho Head Start Program helps identify children and families for the program. The Wind River Health Promotion Program provides programs and serves as liaison with Wind River Reservation Youth Council to help identify youth and families. The Shoshone/Arapaho Tribal Court explore the possibility of court-mandated youth programs such as Youth Quake and assist in providing parenting classes with other agencies. Bureau of Indian Affairs Social Services work cooperatively on the project and serve as a resource providing information as needed, as well as identifying at-risk youth. Wyoming Council on Indian Affairs provides resource information for possible funding of youth educational programs from the Wyoming State Government. Wind River Reservation Youth Council works cooperatively to obtain a grant from the Shoshone and Arapaho Tribes and the Wyoming State Division of Community Services to provide employment for youth; serve as volunteers; identify youth; and assist with the self-esteem conference. The Shoshone/Arapaho Youth Shelter provides training for staff development for educators/teachers of at-risk students; implements program development; and provides technical assistance. The Wind River Extension 4-H Educator establishes 4-H clubs; trains volunteer leaders and works with families and youth on self-esteem; implements and expands CARES, SERIES, SPACES, and 4-H Kids Stuff. The Wind River Extension Family Living Educator serves as a resource and consultant; conducts in-service training; establishes support groups; and expands CARES, PACT and FCL. The Wind River Extension Agricultural Educator continues agro/ecology training with an emphasis on family decision-making, self-esteem building and improved skills; and works on increased employment opportunities through agriculture education programs and scientific research. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) holds nutrition/'food safety classes for youth and families. The Coalition for Families and Youth programs is delivered through a variety of methods including newspaper articles, club meetings, coalition meetings, conferences, workshops, camps, after-school programs and training programs. Results and Impact Performance Measures The greatest obstacle in measuring the efficacy of programs is the history of extensive testing already conducted on Native Americans. The last thing they want is take another evaluative or diagnostic test. Staff have to be sensitive to this reality in trying to balance the need to measure and improve programs. The project intends to rely heavily on the Teen Assessment Project (TAP) to give an indication of which direction the project needs to take, what issues need to be addressed, and what programs might be effective in addressing the issues. 129 Accountability progress is based on staff evaluation forms related to specific objectives, including measurement of contact hours and numbers of families and youth involved. Measurement of the number of agencies attending coalition meetings is an indicator of success, as well as support and participation in Wind River events, training and projects. Numbers of 4-H leaders and members are also monitored. Specific programs have been evaluated with a simple evaluation instrument in order to determine impact and to improve programming. The TAP instrument has been used in two separate schools. Staff consulted with teens themselves to develop the questions. Thus far, massive data sets have been collected. These data sets help to identify risk factors and protective factors. The aim is to conduct this survey again in five years to determine whether problems have been addressed successfully. Implementation Problems and Successes The Wind River delegation to the National Youth At-Risk Conference in Washington, DC identified two areas of particular need: the need to build a volunteer base and the need to introduce more science into the 4-H and youth programming. This will include encouraging training in telecommunications whenever possible. Volunteer numbers have been completely unrealistic in the past given the short history of the program. This next year it is essential for the project staff to conduct massive volunteer training in order to \"revolutionize'.' the volunteer mentality. Volunteerism as known in mainstream society does not exist on the Wind River Reservation, primarily because of the culture of poverty on the Reservation. People have had to work several jobs in order to survive, and many cannot even afford gas money to drive to the volunteer sites. Nevertheless, pooling resources and fostering a sense of community responsibility to solve problems is a necessary part of combatting the serious problems the Indian Reservations. Successes and Accomplishments The primary success of the program has been to find the wall of silence and cross it -- to foster the process of collaboration between different agencies which had already been working on the Reservation. It has taken four years to achieve this. Four years of projects have helped to reach the stage where there is a comfort level to discuss critical issues such as family dysfunction. For instance, an annual 4-H day has become popular. To illustrate the extent of the problems, one judge who presides over domestic violence cases killed his wife. This judge is not sympathetic to victims of domestic violence. Community collaboration has been the project's approach to try to temper the judge's power. The courtroom has been filled with supporters of the women who have had to appear before him. Indian Reservations present particularly entrenched problems of violence, teenage pemancy, substance abuse, hopelessness, and despair. Solutions can only result from multiagency comprehensive prevention and intervention programs. 130 Contact Information D.

This meeting brought together over 50 State planners and local practitioners as well as researchers, analysts, and law enforcement officers from 16 States who have previously been or currently are involved in implementing and/or evaluating programs designed to improve the criminal justice system, and especially the court system. This publication identifies and documents programs that focus on innovative courts programs that improve the criminal justice system at the State and local levels. The first section of the publication presents a perspective on problems and solutions for the criminal justice system. The second section of the publication documents the State and local programs that were presented at the workshop. 0 0 0 Perspective on the Courts 0 0 0 Problems and Solutions in the Criminal Justice System LeRon R. Howland, Superintendent of the Oregon State Police, provided the following remarks at the opening of the State and Local Programs Working Meeting: Innovative Courts Programs. The work that is done at these sessions is very important to the criminal justice system in general, but, more specifically, your work is also important to law enforcement. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) is setting forth new initiatives, program strategies, and funding priorities for the Byrne Formula Grant funds that are second to none. I highly commend you for the excellent work that you are doing at BJA. Oregon's new governor, Governor Kitzhaber, in his inaugural address this past January said that Oregon cannot be a good place to live for anyone until it is a good place to live for everyone. This statement is really the driving force behind all branches of State government right now. When it comes to criminal justice, we are seeking new and innovative ways to make our government more efficient and effective. But above all we are making government more accountable. The same could be said of our country. In order for it to be the best place to live and to be the best that it can be for all of our citizens, we must learn how to deal with our societal problems in new and different ways. The bottom line is that our basic systems of government need new solutions. That is what you have been trying to do, and that is why you are here today. I agree with you that the answers to crime are not going to be found in individual components of the criminal justice system, but in how we relate to one another and how we look at our treatment programs and deterrents. In a larger sense, the answers to crime in this country are not going to be found behind the walls of our prisons, but behind the walls of our own homes. In the next two days, you are going to have the opportunity to share your individual perspectives and programs regarding the future of the American court system, and we are all going to learn a lot about a number of innovative court programs which are being implemented throughout this country. However, you are not merely networking with each other or discussing funding allocations or grant strategies. In reality, what you will be doing here is helping to define a vision for the future; a vision for the future of not only this State, but for the entire country, and, perhaps, for the entire criminal justice system. This morning, I would like to talk a little bit abOut the American criminal justice system itself. Speaking from 28 years experience in this job, the criminal justice system is absolutely, in my opinion, the most visible form of our government. When people start losing confidence in this system, they are going to start losing confidence in government itself. We in the criminal justice system have to start taking some responsibility for this lack of confidence the American people have in their government. No longer is it good enough for individual criminal justice agencies, be it the Oregon State Police, Portland Police Department, the Unites States Attorney's Office, or the court system, just to say to the American people, \"Giye me the money to fund my agency 5 because we do a good job.\" What people want is to see is that the money they are giving is an investment across agency lines that is going to have some kind of effect on crime and make them feel safer. Citizens are asking themselves, \"Why are we funding four levels of law enforcement? Why fund federal law enforcement agencies, the State Police, the County Sheriffs Department, and the City Police?\" Funding in this way is costing the American people a fortune, and in the end, we are spending duplicate money on administration, and, at least at the State level, aren't those law enforcement agencies trying to do the same thing? People are also asking what we, in .the criminal justice system, are doing collectively across State, county, and city lines, so that the American people can get the most bang for their buck. The American people are asking how it is that they fund agencies within the criminal justice system that aren't even working together, when that money is also needed by other agencies, such as education, health, and social services. We, in the criminal justice system, need to sit down and create a strategy to work together. What goes to the heart of why there is an organization such as BJA is that substance abuse (drugs and alcohol) has been driving crime in this country for at least the past 25 years. People are starting to recognize that we are pouring money into a criminal system that is driven by drug and alcohol abuse, and it is time to get our act together. Criminal justice agencies need to stop competing for money and start communicating with each other about how to effectively combat the crime problem in the United States. Much of the current inefficiency within our system can be seen in that there are approximately 900,000 prison beds in the U.S. One hundred sixty thousand of those are tied up with non- violent criminals, such as drug abusers. In 1993, about 15,000 to 18,000 violent, predatory criminals convicted in this country had no prison beds because so many of them were filled up with non-violent offenders. We have chronic drug abusers being arrested every day in this country. They were drug abusers at the time of their arrest, they go into the correctional system as drug abusers, and they come out as drug abusers. In the meantime, we are developing systems to put electronic bracelets on our violent, predatory criminals, I guess so that we can track them to their next victim. The point is, according to Attorney General Janet Reno, it is time for a common sense approach to the crime problem. We will never have an effective criminal justice system in this country until we can learn to collectively work together to treat the symptoms of crime rather than the results. We will never buy or legislate our way out of this problem. On the brighter side, I am very optimistic about what is going on in our nation today because I think this is a time of great awareness that we need to get a handle on the problem, with everyone working together to identify solutions. What I believe is driving this new awareness among us in the criminal justice system, is the economics of getting our act together as well as becoming more aware of the political and moral accountability to the public. Outside people are beginning to step into the criminal justice system and offering to help us get 6 our act together, and I want to personally thank you for that, because it is about time. We cannot serve the people until we involve the people, and many of the answers to our problems are coming from BJA, who is helping to reinforce government and community partnerships. I believe we are going in the right direction. For instance, in Oregon for the first time in the history of the United States, we have created a cooperative policing agreement where city, county, and State law enforcement agencies have sat down, identified their roles, and determined how they can cooperatively work together toward some kind of measurable outcome in crime. In addition, they are trying not to duplicate services or compete with each other but compliment each other as they work toward a common goal. In closing, what it is that you are doing here does have an impact, does make a difference, and does influence the criminal justice leadership. Your efforts are helping this country become a safer place to live, and you are helping America to be what it should, is, and will continue to be. ,d 7 , State and Local. Programs: Innovative Courts Programs. 0 0 0 Arizona Maricopa County Adult Probation Department After-Shock Transition Program Statement of the Problem In 1988, Shock Incarceration, a \"military style program which is designed for youthful offenders and which includes intensive physical exercise, physical labor, and academic education,\" became a sentencing option in Arizona. The program is available to both male and female offenders and is intended to divert youthful offenders who would otherwise have been sent to prison. This is a high-risk group of offenders requiring significant control. On Maricopa County's Sentencing Continuum, only the State Prison provides a higher level of control than Shock Incarceration. The Maricopa County Adult Probation Department recognized that a significant number of Shock Incarceration graduates immediately fail to comply with probation requirements. A 1991 study revealed a 38% failure rate for Shock graduates with 50% of these failures occurring within the first 90 days following graduation. Research reflected that the problem in Maricopa County was not unique and appeared to be a national dilemma. In 1989, New York State Parole Board Chairman Ramon J. Rodriguez stated he would like to \"create Shock halfway houses to ease departing inmates through the difficult transition from the highly structured military discipline of the camp to the chaos of city life.\" (Newsday, June 11, 1989, p.4) Mark W. Oslear pointed out in his recent article, \"Shock Incarceration: Hard Realities and Real Possibilities,\" that \"we cannot hope for decreased recidivism unless 'bridge services' are provided.\" He further noted, \"the problem of resocializing an offender in a military manner and then returning him to his community without continued guidance is to do only half of the job.\" (Federal Probation, March 1991, p.40) The Maricopa County Adult Probation Department believed the failure rate for Shock graduates could be directly attributed to the transition from the highly structured, secure living environment of the Shock Incarceration Program to the chaotic, unstructured demands of reintegration into the community. Shock graduates are immediately faced with the need to secure housing, employment, educational or vocational training, and treatment to comply with probation requirements. Further compounding these challenges, Shock graduates suffer the stigma of a recent release from prison without the reasonable privileges afforded probationers allowed to remain in the community. Many are destined to return to a dysfunctional or unstable neighborhood and/or residence that subjects them to peer influence (typically gang members) or family problems which only serve to exacerbate the existing problems. In response to these problems, the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department developed the After-Shock Transition Program. 11 Goals and Objectives The purpose of this program is to develop and implement effective correctional options to divert non-dangerous youthful offenders from incarceration and deter them from further criminal activity. A comprehensive continuum of treatment and services are utilized with emphasis on the development of a substance-free lifestyle and attainment of adequate educational and vocational skills and employment. Through program design, non-dangerous youthful offenders are safely managed in the community, reducing jail and prison crowding. The program has seven goals. They are to: expand the range of intermediate sanctions in Maricopa County; reduce jail and prison crowding; reduce recidivism by youthful probationers; assist youthful probationers with educational and vocational development; improve the employment status of youthful probationers; reduce drug use and alcohol abuse by youthful probationers; and evaluate the effectiveness of correctional options. The goal to expand the range of intermediate sanctions in Maricopa County is reached by developing and implementing a jail diversion program for youthful probationers and a transitional program to follow Shock Incarceration. The goal to reduce jail and prison crowding has as its objective to divert at least 350 youthful probationers from the Maricopa County Jail and at least 708 youthful offenders from the Arizona Department of Corrections.' The objectives of providing youthful probationers with close supervision on specialized caseloads; developing and utilizing a continuum of treatment and services which address the individual needs of youthful probationers; and determining a baseline recidivismrate for the target populations and ~ demonstrating a reduction in the rate by program participants, are used to meet the goal of reducing recidivism by youthful probationers. The fourth goal, assisting youthful offenders with educational and vocational development, has the following objectives: to provide youthful probationers with literacy, basic education, and GED studies; to provide youthful probationers with life management skills training; to conduct vocational assessments on youthful probationers; to place youthful probationers in vocational training; and to assist probationers in obtaining higher education at a community college or university. The goal to improve the employment status of youthful probationers has two objectives: to provide job preparation workshops for probationers and to assist probationers with job placement. The goal to reduce drug use and alcohol abuse by youthful probationers has two objectives: to provide youthful probationers with substance abuse education/treatment and to monitor the drug-free status of youthful offenders with random urinalysis throughout the supervision period. The final goal, to evaluate the effectiveness of the correctional options, has one objective: to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice in the evaluation of the program. 12 Program Components The mission of the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department After-Shock Transition Program is to assist Shock graduates through their transition into the community and through their successful completion of Intensive Probation Supervision. This is accomplished by using a specialized team approach which builds upon the ideas and principals of the Shock Incarceration Program. The After-Shock Transition Program was developed to assist Shock Incarceration graduates returning to the community. Maricopa County created a specialized Intensive Probation Supervision (IPS) caseload in the county in 1991 to provide a smoother and more gradual transition for Shock Incarceration graduates. The specialized IPS caseload is supervised by three probation officers and two surveillance officers, commonly referred to as the \"Shock Team.\" They handle an average caseload each of 20 to 25 probationers. The Shock Team provides more enhanced supervision and surveillance than IPS and attempts to maintain some of the structure of boot camp. Every effort is made to foster continued cohesion among the Shock Incarceration graduates, as it has become evident that they provide positive peer pressure and support to one another. In addition to regular IPS stipulations, the Shock Team has developed a curriculum of group activities including job search, community service, and athletic pursuits, which emulate the programming experienced in boot camp. Approximately one-third of Shock Incarceration graduates are believed to have gang affiliations. Through positive peer group activities and frequent group discussion regarding the consequences of gang membership, these youthful probationers find help and support in developing new lifestyles. Some Shock Incarceration graduates need a place to live until they can establish independent living arrangements. Some are homeless when they leave boot camp, and others need alternative housing to separate from gang associates or other negative circumstances. In April 1992, the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department opened an After-Shock Transitional Living Center, which is currently called the Garfield Shock House. This setting allows probationers to participate in educational classes and counseling, seek employment, and perform community service without the burden of a negative environment. The location of this housing is in the same facility as the Literacy Center. The center is also open to the community, and community members take classes free of charge. Participants in the After-Shock Transition Program share a continuum of treatment and services with offenders on the Youthful Offender Day Reporting Center (DRC) caseloads. These services include counseling, specifically for substance abuse and educational/vocational skill enhancement services. Residents of the Garfield Shock House are under house arrest, requiring them to have prior permission from a member of the case management team to be absent from their residence at any time. Additional monitoring is provided through random urinalysis and breathalyzer testing, random room, building and grounds checks, daily checks of program attendance, and weekly checks with their employer of record. Each resident pays rent equivalent to what he makes per hour plus $1 per day. Clients must be constantly employed, and restitution is automatically paid through their paychecks. 13 While in the residential program, the participants follow a highly structured daily schedule. This includes: full-time employment or post secondary educational/vocational training; participation in available programs; daily housekeeping chores; community service projects; and organized group physical training. Programs offered on site at the Garfield Community Probation Center include: intensive outpatient substance abuse counseling and aftercare; drug education; Adult Basic Education curriculum; high school diploma testing; life skills programming; and one-on-one mental health counseling. Counseling services are provided by Mountain Valley Counseling, educational services are provided by the Literacy Center, and vocational services are provided by technical schools. Also provided on site are job and career development services, parenting classes, and 12-step meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, and Narcotics Anonymous. Participants are dismissed from the program and arrested on the property for possessing drugs, alcohol, or weapons or for assaulting a staff member or another client. Dismissal for positive urine analyses or breathalyzer analysis is determined on a case-by-case basis. All these programs are offered at no cost to the clients of the After-Shock Transition Program whether they reside in the Garfield Shock House or are supervised while residing in the community. Results and Impact Performance Measures: The program seeks to divert at least 350 youthful probationers from the Maricopa County Jail and at least 708 youthful offenders from the Arizona Department of Corrections. An evaluation of the program by a local university is underway to determine its-success rate and monitor any' improvement in the self-esteem and problem solving abilities of the participants. Implementation Problems and Successes One problem is obtaining and maintaining funding for the program. Without funding from State and Federal sources, clients would be unable to obtain services, and the facility could not be staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, clients would be unable to get to work at the start of their employment without money for bus tickets. Successes and Accomplishments Approximately 70 Shock Incarceration graduates benefit from this program during the grant period. Last year, 107 offenders graduated from Shock Incarceration and received Intensive Probation Supervision in Maric0Pa County. If numbers remain approximately the same, the After-Shock Transition Program will handle over 40% of the County's Shock Incarceration graduates during the grant period. 14 Since the Shock Team and the Transitional Living Center were created, there has been a significant reduction in the recidivism rate of Shock Incarceration graduates in Maricopa County. Before the After-Shock Transition Program, the recidivism rate for Shock Incarceration participants was in the 44 to 48% range. After the introduction of the After-Shock Transition Program, recidivism rates were reduced to 22%. There have been no rearrests for new offenses of After-Shock Transition Program participants. All arrests made have been for probation violations such as curfew violations, not new crimes. Participation in the After-Shock Transition Program is less expensive than incarceration in the State prison or the county jail. The costs are $35.70, $43.87, and $35.76 pet day, respectively. Prospects for Replication As a demonstration site, the After-Shock Transition Program could reach its full potential and be thoroughly and objectively evaluated, with the results made available to other jurisdictions. To be successfully replicated, program staff must be motivated, dedicated, and willing to devote ample time to the program. The community must support the program and be willing to provide resources for it. There must be adequate funding.

Outreach and Tracking Program Statement of the Problem Throughout the United States, juveniles have been institutionalized and then released into the community without an established continuum of care. Traditional means of dealing with delinquent youth, primarily out-of-home placement in institutional settings, have not proven effective, as is evidenced by high recidivism rates and increasing numbers of juveniles entering the adult correctional system. The Southwest Key Program, Inc. believes strongly that children belong at home with their families and that troubled youth are most effectively treated in their own communities with the participation of family members, school personnel, employers, and community resources. Accordingly, all of the Southwest Key programs place a great deal of emphasis on family development and family involvement in the therapeutic process. Goals and Objectives The overriding goal of the Outreach and Tracking Programis to help troubled youth:reform under strict supervision within their own communities while living at home. This forms the foundation of the program and is the basis from which service delivery occurs. Southwest Key, Inc. is committed to achieving the following primary goals: preventing acts of delinquency and self-destructive behavior among youth referred to the program; mainstreaming troubled youth into society's traditional activities such as education and employment, thereby facilitating a positive, productive lifestyle; strengthening the role of the family in determining a youth's behavior; fostering a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach to treating troubled adolescents; developing a comprehensive support network composed of family, friends, schools, employers, and community resources to maximize the client's opportunity to succeed on his/her own; improving family dynamics by actively involving and impacting each member of the family; and 16 encouraging client success by setting attainable goals and teaching positive social skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and self-discipline. The following objectives ensure that these goals are met: hiring well-qualified and professional personnel who appropriately represent the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the client population and can establish positive, trusting relationships with the clients and their families; delivering services to each client cost-efficiently and effectively; informing and involving funding sources in client treatment; ensuring that clients have their needs assessed from a psychological (behavioral) perspective by the caseworker and reviewed by the clinician and program supervisor on an ongoing basis; ensuring that all clients have an Individualized Development Plan (IDP) written by the caseworker and reviewed by the program supervisor that is based upon their unique needs assessment, which delineates goals, .services, and environmental needs to be provided by Southwest Key, the youth's family, other agencies, and support groups; ensuring that all clients are provided casework services to meet individualized goals by receiving a minimum of five hours of counseling services weekly; working closely with each member of the family to enhance their contributions to the success of the family unit; and making a minimum of two face-to-face contacts per day with each client,365 days per year. Program Components In 1987, the Southwest Key Program, Inc. was established with the objective of developing community-based \"treatment programs for troubled youth as an alternative to institutionalization. The private, nonprofit organization provides intensive supervision of youth. The agency operates 28 community-based treatment programs with six different models for delinquent youth and their families in Texas, Arizona, and Puerto Rico. The program employs more than 300 staff and provides services to over 1,000 children, youth, and families on any given day. The programs span the entire continuum of care. In addition to the Outreach and Tracking Program, Southwest Key provides Day Treatment, Residential Treatment Centers, In-Home Services for abused and neglected youth, a family preservation program, and the High Impact Program. 17 Essentially a supplemental part of the court system, the Outreach and Tracking Program serves 60 to 70 offenders at a time, approximately 10 to 15% of all youths on probation in Phoenix. Clients are ages ten to seventeen, 15% of whom are girls (out of a juvenile population of 25%). The court offers youths on parole the opportunity to come to Southwest Key, and Southwest Key .is required to take the youths who choose it. Many youths who are on probation are also referred to the program, although the program has some discretion in refusing youths who are not appi'opriate for community supervision. Crimes committed by these youth range from grand theft auto to gang involvement and firearms violations. Youths spend a minimum of three months in the program and are on probation or parole for an average of one to one and a half years. Southwest Key staff work diligently with parole or probation officers on long-term planning geared toward preventing future involvement with the juvenile justice system. Program staff take full responsibility for assessing the client's needs in such areas as education, vocational training, mental health, physical health, social skills, family work, and intensive direct intervention or referral of clients to appropriate services provided by other agencies. The focus is to develop intervention and treatment strategies that enhance the client's capability to remain in the community and complete the program in one to three months. A Contract with the Client Immediately upon intake, all clients sign a contract in which they agree to abide by certain rules and regulations. Contract expectations include cooperation with parents or guardians, daily attendance and participation in school, cooperation with caseworkers, active employment searching (where appropriate), attendance and participation in all mandatory recreational: activities, compliance with a predetermined curfew,, and nouse of illegal drugs or, alcohol. A series of consequences for: contract violations include .grounding, :time ~ in the Southwest Key office, riding with caseworkers, earlier curfew, restitution, and staff-initiated meetings with parole or probation personnel. Compliance with the contract may bring special privileges such as later curfew or individual recreation with a caseworker. The program also. incorporates work on targeted behaviors for individual clients to ensure that his/her own special problematic behaviors diminish. The staff develops a highly specialized program to meet the needs of the individual in his/her specific areas of difficulty. Each client's service plan is designed to provide growth and development by teaching him/her how to control impulsive behaviors and build internal self controls. Clients, as they progress through the program and gain self-confidence, are expected to work toward becoming productive citizens and need less frequent intervention from outside service providers. Multi-Cultural Awareness Multi-cultural awareness, education, and training are providedto both the staff and clients. The Southwest Key staff is chosen to represent appropriately the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the client population. Advocacy for the Client Southwest Key serves as an active advocate for the client in areas such as legal, medical, educational, and vocational needs. Staff members accompany clients to scheduled court appearances, meetings with attorneys, parole or probation meetings, and school meetings with teachers to provide active support for clients and their families. 18 Individual Development Plan (IDP) Treatment planning for each client commences immediately at the intake meeting. An initial IDP is written to cover the first 30 days. This plan is developed jointly by the caseworker, program supervisor, and the parole or probation officer with the client and his/her family. IDPs are reviewed monthly, and the goals and specific interventions are reviewed and adapted for each client based on his/her progress in the program. Southwest Key staff continually monitor care and treatment plans and service delivery through weekly service planning meetings, facilitated jointly by the program's clinician and program supervisor. Weekly Group Counseling Sessions Two group peer counseling sessions per week dealing with accountability are mandatory for all clients. Southwest Key staff may also organize smaller group sessions to address specific issues such as family conflict, problem solving, and drug use. These groups allow clients the opportunity to give and accept constructive peer feedback and build positive social interaction skills. Therapy Clients are involved in individual and/or group psychotherapy when appropriate. Clients who have their own therapist at intake are encouraged to continue that relationship. When a client does not have an actively involved therapist at intake, and individual therapy is needed, these services can be provided directly throughout the program and then a referral can be made for ongoing therapy after completion of the program. The program supervisor and caseworkers maintain consistent contact with all therapists to provide support, pass on information, and obtain input for ongoing treatment planning. Family Counseling and Focus There are three family counseling sessions per week. Family counseling and support is a major focus of the program because many clients live in dysfunctional family settings. Parental support is provided daily by caseworkers who track clients at home and maintain daily contact with parents. This allows for the communication of special concerns, planning services, and monitoring of performance and progress. If more regular meetings are needed with the family, they are scheduled by the caseworkers and led by the program's clinician. In the event that family therapy is deemed appropriate, Southwest Key either provides counseling services directly or works with the family to make a referral to an appropriate therapist. Families are encouraged to participate in service planning meetings and quarterly review meetings, and to call the Southwest Key office for 24-hour support should a problem develop. Crisis Intervention Clients and their families are encouraged to call the center any time, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year to receive assistance in order to respond to crises in a timely fashion. Tracking Procedures The cornerstone of the Outreach and Tracking Program is the tracking component. All clients are required to report their whereabouts in the community at all times. It is the client's responsibility to be in a location where he/she can be found by the caseworker on duty. All clients are seen face-to-face by caseworkers a minimum of twice each day, seven days per week, 365 days per Year. Tracking becomes a counseling tool that provides structure 19 and accountability while building a working relationship between the caseworker and the client. This enhances the caseworker's ability to forecast emerging problems and provide preventive rather than reactive interventions. Progress Planning Client status including accountability, crises, appointments, needs, and consequences is reviewed three times dally. The client's progress compared to individual goals and target behavior is reviewed weekly. Community-Based Education Each client participates in a 'community-based educational program that addresses his/her emotional, physical, social, educational, and vocational needs. Southwest Key staff track clients daily in school to monitor attendance, progress, and performance, and provide support to both clients and school personnel. A major emphasis is placed on developing strong, ongoing working relationships with teachers, guidance counselors, and school administrators to provide the best opportunity for success in the school setting. Part-time Employment Clients are encouraged to find part-time employment after school whenever possible and appropriate. Southwest Key staff help clients in obtaining working papers, completing job applications, and preparing for interviews. The staff also locates work training programs in the community in which clients are paid and supervised. Any client who is working in the community is tracked at work to provide support to the client and employer and to monitor performance. Recreational Programming, Recreational programs are designed to provide exercise and opportunities to build social skills and positive peer interaction. Recreational activities, include basketball, roller-skating, movies, field trips, and cultural events. All clients are expected to participate in at least two recreational activities per week. Client Transportation The Southwest Key staff provides transportation to all Key-sponsored activities and other activities as needed such as legal, medical, and educational advocacy, 24- hour-crisis intervention services, aftercare services, and planning. Release Planning The staff works with the client, his/her family, the referring agency, and appropriate community resources to develop a release plan that will establish ties with the community support network and ease the transition into a new environment. Results and Impact Performance Measures Perhaps the most meaningful, long-term measure of the success of the Outreach and Tracking Program is whether the program helps youth avoid future crime. Recent tracking data provided by the Texas Youth Commission about the Texas Southwest Key program has indicated reduced recidivism rates. 20 The Phoenix program is only now evaluating outcomes, yet' baseline data from 1993 and 1994 reveals information on the number of youth who successfully terminated the program and completed probation. In the future, the Phoenix program will be examining recidivism rates against adjudicated and incarcerated youth, keeping in mind that intensive supervision might lead to greater knowledge of recidivism by Southwest Key staff and affect the numbers. Implementation Problems and Successes The State and county's initial reception of the Outreach and Tracking Program was uncertain, because this was the first program of this type for which they had contracted services. At first, there were many obstacles. Judges can automatically order youth to the program. For youth on parole, Southwest Key has no right of refusal. Southwest Key feared they would prove a dumping ground for problem paroled youth, but this has not happened. Communication with parole and probation has evolved over time. State and county agencies were at first suspicious of a private organization providing these services, but they have become accustomed to and welcomed the Southwest Key Program within their community as they have seen a positive impact. Staff development has been an issue. Staff are expected to have a four-year undergraduate degree and a minimum of one year working with juveniles. They receive a two week in-house training and a two-week field training. Keeping up with training demands as the program expands has taken effort. Staff suffer from burnout because they work 50 to 60-hour weeks. A 24-month concept has been developed for workers. Unless they are promoted to a higher position, they are encouraged to move on after two years in order to replenish their energies. Because many of the staff are recent college graduates, the program serves as a good training ground for them before they go on to receive further professional degrees. Successes and Accomplishments Recent tracking data provided by the Texas Youth Commission about the Texas program indicated that one year after completing the Outreach and Tracking Program, clients have a' 65% lower re-arrest rate than youths released from institutions directly into standard parole services. This high success rate is even more significant because the Outreach and Tracking Program typically receives clients who juvenile justice agencies have deemed too difficult for standard parole or probation. The Phoenix program is only now evaluating outcomes, and the baseline data from 1993 and 1994 show that 40 to 45% of parolees terminated the program successfully and 70% of those on probation completed successfully. Across the Southwest, different Federal, State, and county agencies use the Outreach and Tracking Program to reduce the ever-growing demand and costs for additional institutional facility space. More important, these agencies are turning to the Southwest Key Program, Inc. because they have found that these programs are effective in helping troubled youth and their families re-direct their lives. 21 Prospects for Replication Many different State and county agencies across the U.S. have come to recognize Southwest Key Program, Inc. as an innovator and leader in institutional alternatives for juvenile delinquents. Most recently, the States of Nevada, Wisconsin, and California have utilized the Southwest Key Program, Inc. as a model to develop Outreach and Tracking programs. The implementation of the Outreach and Tracking Program continues to expand nationwide, as the need for alternatives exist in a growing number of communities.

However, with crime rates increasing, particularly for violent offenses, the scenario looked bleak. The judges and probation staff decided to analyze the driving forces behind the crimes and the probation failures. Along with violence, many of the young people coming into the juvenile justice system were charged with substance abuse- related crimes or were identified as having unacknowledged substance abuse problems. Assigning serious substance abusing youth to probation staff with excessive case loads compounded these problems. Most of the young people going through juvenile court come from unstable living situations. Parents or guardians were often unable or unwilling to enforce curfew orders issued by the court. The court often learned of curfew violations when a probationer picked up new charges, was cited for violating a local curfew, or was reported by school personnel who were attempting to explain a juvenile's poor performance in school. Arkansas law already allowed a juvenile judge to require a youth to complete community service work as a dispositional alternative. However, with no one to recruit placements or to monitor progress, this method of rehabilitating young people was most often not used. The Division of Youth Services (DYS), a division of the Department of Human Services, is charged under Arkansas law with rehabilitating the most serious juvenile offenders. Pulaski County commits the largest number of juveniles to the Division of Youth Services, and Pulaski County has a 24% recidivism rate. This recidivism rate is underestimated because Arkansas law grants prosecuting attorneys the discretion, within certain parameters, to charge juveniles between the ages of 14 and 17 as adults. Goals and Objectives The goal of the Juvenile Intensive Supervision Program (ISP) is to reduce the recidivism rate of juveniles by providing a disposition with enhanced structure, rehabilitation, and accountability for serious juvenile offenders who abuse drugs and alcohol and/or violate statutes~regarding drugs and alcohol. The following objectives were developed to pursue this goal: all juveniles will be enrolled in some form of education such as regular or alternative 23 school, GED classes, literacy classes, or vocational school; all juveniles will be engaged in paid employment or approved community service work to ensure accountability; enhanced supervision will be provided with an attempt to divert the juvenile offender from the adult system and increase rehabilitation success; appropriate dispositions will be provided for juvenile offenders who have reached or are nearing their eighteenth birthdays and are ineligible to be committed to the Division of Youth Services; \u00b0 the recidivism rate of juveniles will be reduced; o- commitments to the Division of Youth Services when the juvenile is unable to follow the rules of probation or court orders will be reduced; there will be swift consequences for violent or habitual juvenile offenders who violate ISP guidelines and community safety; an intermediate sentencing program that is less restrictive than incarceration, but more rehabilitative in nature will be provided; strict compliance with community service work, restitution and fine payments, adherence to curfews enforced by Surveillance Officers, and participation in random drug screens and treatment programs when indicated will be required; and assessments and screens will be provided in order to detect drug and alcohol addictions and refer youth for appropriate treatment and aftercare. Program Components The ISP operates on a three level design. Phase I lasts four months. During this phase, the offender must attend five face-to-face visits per week in the probation office; have three phone contacts weekly with his/her Probation Officer; undergo weekly drug screens; attend school; attend five Narcotics Anonymous/Alcoholics Anonymous (NA/AA) groups if applicable; perform regular community service hours; make a regularly scheduled fine or restitution payment; and receive 24-hour adult supervision or supervision as set by the court. During this phase, the Probation Officer makes appropriate referrals to community-based programs for the rehabilitation of the juvenile. If treatment facilities are required on an in-patient basis, the juvenile is admitted at this time. Also during Phase I, Surveillance Officers maintain curfew checks on participants on a daily 24 basis. Ifa participant is in school, the Surveillance Officers do spot checks to determine compliance. Job contacts are made weekly to determine if the participant is performing satisfactorily. Participants are required to submit to searches by the Surveillance Officers if there is cause to believe the participant is in possession of a weapon, narcotics, and/or alcohol. The Surveillance Officer also determines if the participant is associated with any known felons. During the four-month Phase II, the offender is required to attend three face-to-face visits per week with Surveillance Officers; make one phone contact weekly with his/her Probation Officer; complete his/her community service work if it is not completed in Phase I; continue making regular restitution, fine, court cost, probation fee, and other payments; attend three AA/NA meetings per week, if applicable; maintain an 8:00 p.m. curfew or as set by the court; submit to monthly drug screens; attend school; and be employed, if applicable. If technical violations occur during Phase I or II which are of a minor nature, such as a missed phone contact or missed AA/NA meeting, the Probation Officer has the discretion to intensify the supervision in an attempt to gain compliance. However, if at any time a violation of greater significance occurs, such as a re-offense or blatant refusal to follow the majority of the program conditions, a revocation is filed, and the juvenile is returned to court. If during the four months of Phase III there remains a reason to continue supervision for the purpose of monitoring the payment of fines, restitution, community service, or obtaining treatment goals, but intensive supervision is no longer required, the participant is referred to the regular probation staff for supervision until termination is appropriate. If the participant should re-offend during this period, he/she will be ineligible to begin the process a second time, unless it is ordered by the presiding judge and the initial probation period is extended beyond the year time frame. If the participant has successfully complied with all of the conditions set by the ISP and all treatment goals have been met, he/she is eligible for early release from the ISP at the beginning of Phase III. The participant has successfully completed the Intensive Supervision Program when he/she: does not re-offend during the duration of participation; remains drug-free for the period of supervision; fulfills all financial obligations under the conditions of ISP; completes all court- ordered treatment plans; maintains contact with the Probation Officer or Surveillance Officer as outlined in the phase levels; completes court-ordered community service; secures and maintains employment; and completes the GED or subscribed educational plan. One component of the ISP is a fund established for restitution. Program participants are eligible to earn up to half of the court-ordered restitution through community service supervised by court personnel. Through employment, the participant is held responsible and accountable for repaying his/her debt to the community. The Community Resource Officer develops contacts with victims who have experienced a loss which can be repaid by the offender through services, as opposed to monetarily. By implementing this component of restitution, the x;ictim/community is repaid, increasing trust in 25 the judicial system, and the juvenile offender is held accountable to his/her community. The Community Resource Officer makes all referrals for community service, tracks completion of this work, monitors all community service as it relates to restitution, and provides a thorough report as to compliance with community service and restitution obligations. The electronic bracelet was added in lieu of detention to the ISP to enhance the supervision of juveniles who have minor rule infractions. Approximately 10 bracelets are available for use at all times. In the event of a violation, such as a curfew violation or school truancy, the bracelet becomes an intermediate consequence prior to detention. Any violations are immediately detected and reported, prompting swifter consequences. Parenting skills facilitators provide an ongoing weekly series of parenting skills classes required for all parents of ISP participants. The goal of the classes is to strengthen parental understanding of and cooperation with the program. Furthermore, it is the intent of the parenting classes to strengthen parents' ability to supervise the juvenile adequately by strengthening their ability to set limits, impose consequences, and improve communication. Results and Impact Performance Measures In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of t.heprogram, the following factors will be examined: the target population of serious habitual offenders who have previously been committed to DYS to determine if these participants completed the ISP requirements successfully; the number of community service hours performed, the amount of restitution paid to victims, the amount of fines, court costs, and probation fees collected, the number of participants successfully completing treatment programs, the number of participants securing and maintaining gainful employment, the number of participants successfully engaging in or completing an educational program, and the number of participants who do not re-offend during their involvement in the ISP program; and the number of successful participants in relation to participants who do not complete the program and are eventually committed to the Division of Youth Services. The program has several performance indicators. These include: (1) the number of contacts with ISP Probation and Surveillance Officers; (2) the number of AA/NA meetings attended; (3) the number of phone contacts with Probation Officers; (4) the number of successful treatment programs completed; (5) the number of drug/urine screens conducted; (6) the number of educational programs attended or completed; (7) the number of successful job placements; (8) the number of community service hours completed; (9) the amount of probation fees, restitution payments, and fines collected; (10) phase movements; and (11) reassessment scores. 26 Implementation Problems and Successes When the program was first implemented, the juvenile judges were unclear as to which types of juvenile offenders were appropriate for admission to ISP. With more training and increased use of the program, this problem was resolved. It has been difficult to get bids for electronic monitoring equipment. The equipment currently being used was chosen by the County purchasing office because it was inexpensive. This equipment is less reliable, and the juveniles do not have faith that it works and tend to disregard its presence. The documentation required by the Bureau of Justice Assistance to maintain a grant was overwhelming to program administrators. Nine months into the program a part-time employee was hired to keep statistics on the program and act as a liaison between Probation Officers and the Surveillance Officers. Successes and Accomplishments ISP has been able to achieve in large part its original goal. It generally has been well received by the parents and the juvenile participants, and some juveniles have actually requested to participate in this program. Feedback from participating agencies has been extremely positive. The best measure for program evaluation is that many substance-abusing, young offenders have been kept in a less restrictive setting due to this program. During the first fullyear of operation, a total of 46 juveniles were served, and a recidivism rate of 11% was observed versus the prior rate of 34%. The program has achieved several successes during the time it has operated. In the first year, 100% of the participants were enrolled in school. All program participants were either employed or performing community service, and 1,000 hours of community service were completed in the first program year by ISP participants. To implement the program successfully, community support is crucial. This support has been obtained in different ways. In order to ensure strict compliance with curfew orders, Surveillance Officers were needed. The courts cooperated with local police agencies, and the Police Chiefs in both Little Rock and North Little Rock were requested to submit names from their certified staff to serve as Surveillance Officers during their off-duty hours. While both Police Chiefs supported this program in concept prior to funding, use of their staff as Surveillance Officers has built a bridge of better understanding between the courts and the police agencies. Since this program is directed at substance-abusing youth, partnerships with existing programs have been strengthened. Initial drug screens are performed by the probation staff, but all further assessment and treatment are performed by local providers in a cooperative and mutually satisfying arrangement. 27 Another area of cooperation has been with the local school districts. Most, if not all, of the participants in the ISP have either academic and/or behavioral problems at school. The three juvenile judges have been meeting periodically with the Superintendents of the local school districts in order to discuss problems and solutions. As a result of these meetings, another grant has been requested to develop an alternative county-wide dispute resolution program to be implemented in the schools, involving teachers, students, parents, local government, the courts, and other interested parties. The most recent act of cooperation with area agencies involved contracting for parenting services. Upon determining that one of the weakest links in providing services to ISP participants was parental involvement, particularly in setting limits and enforcing rules, a parenting component was added to the program. The program contracted two experienced parenting instructors who also work full-time as high school counselors. The Community Resource Officer has increased the number of participating community service sites from less than 10 sites before the program began to 116 sites. Several positive benefits can be identified from this program. First, the juvenile is giving something back to his/her community in a positive way and in a location near his/her home. This juvenile is also obtaining some work experience useful in future job searches. Several of the young people have been offered paid employment at their community service site based on the quality of their service. Community service work demonstrates to the community that all kids are not bad and that courts take crime seriously. Prospects for Replication Several items are important for the replication of the Intensive Supervision Program. First, this type of program is suited to a more .urban area, especially those with high crime rates. The second important consideration in implementing an ISP is the recruitment and training of high quality staff who are committed to working with juvenile offenders and their families. A community must be willing to support this type of programming for it to be successful. One of the best ways to engender community support is to actively seek and maintain ties with other community groups and institutions that are working with youth.

This congestion was causing a tremendous delay in getting juveniles into the court system and was affecting the quality of treatment and punishment of juveniles once they were brought to trial. It was clear that an alternative system was needed to cut down on the number of cases filed in juvenile court and provide more appropriate treatment for juveniles charged with less serious offenses. The Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program was developed in an effort to address these problems. Goals and Objectives The Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program is designed to provide youthful offenders wiih sentencing diversion as an option to formal adjudication in juvenile court. The program's primary purpose is to discourage juvenile crime and recidivism and teach meaningful lessons about accepting responsibility and developing self-esteem. Program Components The Pre-Charging Diversion Program is designed for youths ages 12 through 17 who have been charged with a non-violent misdemeanor or certain felony offenses in Pulaski County. The nature of the offense is reviewed by deputy prosecutors to determine whether basic eligibility criteria have been met. If the youth is eligible for the Pre-Charging Diversion Program, the parents are contacted and a meeting is arranged to enroll the juvenile in the 45-day program. Once enrolled, the youth is required to report to a peer group judgment panel for the purpose of alternative sentencing. The peer group judgment panel is made up of youths who have successfully completed the Pre-Charging Diversion Program and have been received appropriate training. The peer group judgment panel assigns a constructive punishment designed to cover the following areas: payback, new friends, education, and peer group judgment panel/respect for the law. The peer group judgment panels, held on the weekends, are sponsored by the Watershed Human and Community Development Agency, Inc. and Black Community Developers Program, Inc. The Watershed Agency's mission is to empower people through self-help. Watershed provides job 29 training, child care, and assistance with housing, food, transportation, and other necessities. In addition, Watershed has developed a number of services for at-risk youth, including the Get Ready Program, which provides youthful offenders with the tools and skills necessary to become responsible, productive members of the community. The Black Community Developers Program is a non-profit, non-sectarian, community-based program formed to work toward improving the quality of life for economically disadvantaged Arkansans. The juvenile is required to perform a certain number of hours of community service to be supervised by the community or a non-profit organization. These activities could include removing graffiti, cleaning up city parks, or washing police cars. Three to sixteen hours of community service must be performed, and tasks are designed to be performed on the weekend. On the second weekend, the juvenile is required to participate in area programs and presentations designed to acquaint the youth with constructive community relationships. In addition to interaction with the Watershed Agency and Black Community Developers, youths are referred to programs and services at New Futures for Little Rock Youth, Stepping Stone, Operation Safe Summer, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, the Boys Club, and other similar organizations. On the third weekend, the juvenile is required to utilize the library or other literar3; programs available to complete an autobiography or a book report. The youth learns firsthand about the consequences of criminal activity through presentations by Arkansas Department of Corrections inmates. Information on various vocational and educational opportunities is presented by the Watershed Agency and the Black Community Developers Program, Having successfully completed these three phases of the Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program, the juvenile learns the importance of accountability and responsibility by sitting in judgment over incoming youths who will be participating in the program. The juvenile sits as a member of a peer group judgment panel on three occasions and imposes alternative sentences as outlined above. This final portio n of the program is especially important because it gives the juvenile a sense of coming full-circle and helps him/her to perform the critical analysis process which is designed to result in the acceptance of responsibility for wrongful conduct. Failure to complete the program results in prosecution in juvenile court. Results and Impact Performance Measures To assess the success of the program, many performance measures will be utilized. The project will maintain records on the number of youth served by the project; the number completing the project who have additional charges filed with the Prosecuting Attorney's Office; and the number who continue to be involved in community service or formal community programs following their completion of the program. Changes in attitude and behavior of youths will also be measured through a survey administered to parents at three and six-month intervals following the 30 completion of the program. Implementation Problems and Successes The problem with the panel being composed of juveniles who are, or were, considered to be at- risk is that they are not always dependable. The success of this program depends on the reliability of the panel and the group that is putting the panel together. Follow-up on the punishment aspect of the program is imperative to the program's success. Because the Watershed Agency works on a limited budget, it is difficult to provide the necessary workers to ensure that all of the elements of the program are completed. It is important to this program that punishment is swift, just, and not a hollow threat. The solution to these problems is for the prosecutor's office to be associated with a dedicated community support group that has a staff that can satisfy the requirements of thee program. It is a time-consuming process to organize the panel and follow-up on whether the juvenile is completing his/her assigned punishment. Successes and Accomplishments Each year, approximately 3,500 cases are referred to the Pulaski County Prosecutor's Office for the f'lling of juvenile delinquency petitions. These cases involve approximately 2,096 Pulaski County juveniles. The prosecutor estimates that approximately 240 of these juveniles could be served per year by the Pre-Charging Diversion Program, and as many as 700 youths per year after future expansion. The success rate for the Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program is dramatically illustrated by statistics from the first year of the program at the Watershed Agency. Since July 1993, 120 youthful offenders have been diverted to the program. Only fourteen of those youths have been charged with additional crimes after completing the program, indicating a 12% recidivism rate. The vast majority of juveniles who have completed the Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program stay clear of further trouble with the law. Part of the success of the Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program has been that the peer group review panel typically comprises at-risk youth who have made strides toward turning their lives around. Youths who have been in trouble with the law are true peers of the juvenile referred by the prosecutor's office and relate more easily to the referred juvenile. This is supported by the success of this particular program and manifested in the candor displayed by the program's participants on both sides of the table and in the referred juvenile's willingness to follow through with the punishment assigned to him/her. Prospects for Replication The success of putting together the Prosecutor' s Pre-Charging Diversion Program depends largely on the dedication of a community support group, such as the Watershed Agency. This is because -f 'i \u00b8'~ \".; L :; 7 31 the community support group is responsible for the most essential elements of the program: the peer group review panel and follow-up on the punishment assigned by the panel. The prospects for success of the Prosecutor's Pre-Charging Diversion Program rely on the dedication of the prosecutor's office and the community support group. This community-based organization must be reliable, well staffed, and appropriately funded. Contact Information Mark Stodola Prosecuting Attorney Sixth Judicial District 122 South Broadway Little Rock, AR 72201 (501) 340-8000 (501) 340-8049 fax 32 Colorado The Emergency Courtroom: Denver County Court Protective Orders Court Statement of the Problem The most lethal time in domestic abuse cases is when a battered woman is leaving the relationship. This is also the most critical time for judicial intervention. In these cases, litigants in need of immediate individual attention are in a crisis situation, when a judge's decision can have life-saving consequences. In many courts, restraining order cases are squeezed between other matters on the docket and are often heard by judges who do not want to handle these cases but do so as part of a regular rotation. This can lead to irritations due to delays and interruptions of the regular docket and can result in untrained judges making mistakes in high-risk cases. The traditional dispersement of cases to judges leads to a lack of individualized service to the already traumatized victim, as well as delay and inconvenience for other litigants. Goals and Objectives Denver's Emergency Courtroom has two primary goals: (1) to improve judicial intervention in restraining order cases; and (2) to increase citizens' use of the courts when violence and threats are imminent. The objectives designed to meet these goals include the following: to protect victims from violence through court orders; to reduce violence by identification of high-risk cases, safety planning, and appropriate referrals; to humanize the process by providing a smaller and more user-friendly court; and to provide referrals and easy accessibility to outside services. Program Components Since April 1992 the Denver County Court has provided a dedicated Protective Orders Court, in which one judge presides over all restraining order cases and contempt ,hearings. Unlike the traditional system in which judges try to squeeze protective orders cases between regularly scheduled cases, this court provides ready access, court services, and trained personnel so that the court can intervene when violence is imminent. The courtroom is self-sufficient and the filing process is simplified, since the vast majority of the 33 parties represent themselves. The judge and all staff develop expertise through regular training in domestic violence matters and maintain close ties with related community agencies such as police, advocates, prosecutors, Legal Aid, and treatment providers. Ongoing training is also provided for police officers and the sheriff concerning the proper handling of domestic violence cases and restraining orders. Volunteer victim advocates as well as volunteer lawyers and guardians ad litem participate actively in the courtroom. The following community programs work in conjunction with the court to provide services to the victims, as well as to the victims' children. Project Safeguard is a domestic violence advocacy program that provides this court with victim advocates, whose function in the court is two-fold: to work with the court to conduct victim orientation, providing information on restraining orders and community services; and to assist the plaintiffs and watch for crisis situations such as high-risk victims who are indigent or have children who are victims. In such cases, the victim advocates refer clients to Legal Aid. Project PROP, which stands for \"Permanent Restraining Order Program,\" provides legal aid by linking volunteer attorneys with victims. These victims are frequently referred by the victim advocates from Project Safeguard. All services provided by the attorneys are free. Voucher Program is a child therapy program for children who have witnessed violence in the home or have been victims. In this program, the court, funded by a City Council grant, provides vouchers for child treatment services which amount to six therapy sessions at $20 each. GAL Program, or the GuardianAd Litem Program, is part of the Children's Legal Clinic, which recruits volunteer attorneys to represent child victims. GAL is the children's counterpart to Project PROP, in which all legal aid is free. At the beginning of each day in court, parties are assisted by the staff in filling out necessary paperwork. Victim advocates conduct an orientation and inform victims of community resources that are available to them. Next, the judge speaks generally to the public about the need for calling the police if there is trouble; returning to court to have the order made permanent; and getting additional help from the community, particularly if children are in trouble. Finally, the afternoon docket is heard. The court's philosophy is based on the belief that where the court is accessible, the public will resort to the use of the courts instead of taking the law into their own hands. Thus, the court's hours, ease, language assistance, clerk assistance, expertise, and emphasis on service all work towards making the Protective Orders Court a place where people are willing and able to go for help in a crisis involving threats, harassment, and violence. 34 Results and Impact Performance Measures The Urban Institute Study provided baseline data on the impact of and factors affecting the success of restraining orders. The study assessed the impact of retraining orders in domestic violence cases and provided information useful to judges who respond to petitions for protection. This study was instrumental at the inception of the Denver County Court Protective Orders Court. Court personnel designed a tracking system to identify outcomes of particular groups of cases. The National Center for State Courts selected Denver as one of three sites for its study of the effectiveness of civil protection orders. This study was funded by the National Institute of Justice and the results are forthcoming. Implementation Problems and Successes There was a problem overcoming resistance to change within the judiciary. The judge of the Protective Orders Court had to be more pro-active on behalf of victims, especially women, which could have been construed as gender bias against men. There was a need for additional resources outside of the courtroom to refer the victims. The staff had to be trained regarding the new court philosophy. Additional security measures had to be taken to protect the victims appearing in court. Lawyers had to be provided for the children who needed them. This was problematic because the lawyers were not experienced enough to handle these cases. As a result, the judge was making fewer and fewer referrals to them. The attorneys need training to become more skilled at working with traumatized children. Successes and Accomplishments The following is a list of selected accomplishments: an increase in the number of plaintiffs represented by a lawyer at Permanent Restraining Order hearings from 4% in 1991 to 30%; an increase in the percentage of police referrals to Protective Orders Court, from 56% in 1991 to 61% in 1994; successful staff training in domestic violence; training being given by the court clerk to clerks statewide; decreased homicides; 35 development of a judicial benchbook concerning protective orders, called The Purpose of Law is Justice; featuring of the court on \"The Killing Fields,\" a CBS 3-hour documentary reported by Ed Bradley in February 1995; and regular judge participation in training attorneys and other professionals about domestic violence issues. Prospects for Replication One key element to implementing a similar court is the judge. Judicial desire is Crucial, as there is little variety in the types of cases heard. The judge must be skilled in handling domestic violence, pro se parties, crisis intervention, stress management, gender bias issues, and public speaking and writing. The help of programs in the community, such as Legal Aid and victim advocacy programs, has also been crucial to the success of this court. It is important that any community desiring to implement a court such as this have a strong resource network in the community: Contact Information Jacqueline St. Joan Senior Judge Denver County Court 1339 Quince Street Denver, CO 80220 (303) 355-0504 (303) 355-0287 fax 36 Connecticut Alternative Incarceration Program Statement of the Problem. The State of Connecticut has faced unprecedented growth in its correctional system. During the 1980's, the total Department of Correction (DOC) population tripled from 5,500 to 16,000. This rapid growth in population outstripped the State's ability to add correctional beds and forced the DOC to rely heavily on early release programs. As a result, during 1989 most incarcerated offenders served only 10% of their sentences. The State's limited ability to incarcerate offenders sharply reduced the deterrent effect of sentencing. Offenders realized that the amount of time they would actually serve would be much less than the length of their sentence. In addition, the prison population growth caused serious disciplinary problems for the DOC. Offenders realized that they did not need to comply with DOC rules governing prisoner behavior, and they would still be released early, because the DOC did not have a sufficient number of correctional beds to hold them. Goals and Objectives Presently, the Connecticut Legislature appropriates $22 million to the Office of Alternative Sanctions (OAS) for the purpose of diverting approximately 4,000 jail-bound offenders each day. To acc6mplish this goal and the corresponding increase in time served for incarcerated offenders, OAS contracts private non-profit agencies. Connecticut's Judicial Branch has developed a unique set of objectives to reach its goal. The objectives are to: divert approximately 4,000 jail-bound offenders on any given day from incarceration to credible, structured, community-based sanctions; increase the length of time incarcerated inmates serve to at least 50% of the stated sentence; provide judges with a graduated sentencing structure which assists them in pronouncing \"sentences which make sense;\" accomplish these goals at approximately one-fifth the cost of incarceration, without jeopardizing public safety; and 37 gain public support of these programs through extensive and visible community service projects and a well planned public relations effort. Program Components In order to achieve its goals, Connecticut needed to balance a variety of contrasting issues. The State's judges needed programs that would provide meaningful, highly-structured sanctions. In addition to carefully supervising and monitoring the offenders, the programs had to provide feedback to the judges on the offenders' progress. At the same time, the programs had to be capable of encouraging the offenders to continue to participate, since they could only be successful in providing an alternative to incarceration if the offenders continued to attend. Keeping the offenders in attendance is a difficult task; many experts have noted that community- based sanctions are typically more challenging to offenders than prison. According to Jim Greene, Deputy Director of the Office of Alternative Sanctions, \"There are two things we can accomplish through AIC (Alternative to Incarceration Center) community service. We can try to move our clients a step forward in their lives, and we can try to move the offenders upward in the eyes of the taxpayers.\" To accomplish this, the programs seek to engage and coach the offenders and offer them educational and vocational assistance, job development, life skills assistance, housing assistance, and recreation. The programs also Seek to address the needs of Connecticut's communities. In order for the communities to embrace the programs, they must see the offenders involved in highly positive activities. Through constant involvement in community service activities, the programs have been able to demonstrate to communities that offenders can produce positive results. During fiscal year 1993-1994, AICs supervised over 200,000 hours of community service. The high level of visibility that is associated with the performance of community service makes it an excellent public relations vehicle. Connecticut has developed an extensive and innovative community service network. Examples of projects are: maintenance of State parks, campgrounds, beaches, municipal parks, and athletic facilities; painting of elementary school classrooms and courthouses; removal of graffiti from public buildings, and of debris at inner city illegal dumping sites; ticket collection and refreshment stand operation at Connecticut's annual statewide Olympic Festival; support services for the annual Connecticut Special Olympics; and building gazebos, playscapes, and wilderness trails for local communities. Connecticut's approach in providing community service has been to have all services delivered by crews consisting of one supervisor, one volunteer, and six offenders. Connecticut has expanded the role of community service into areas such as evaluation of offenders, job training, and drug and alcohol counseling. Community service provides a great opportunity and vehicle for impacting the behavior of the offenders. 38 All community service projects are well publicized through press releases which result in frequent newspaper and television coverage. Connecticut is well on its way to changing public opinion concerning the type of judicial sanction which is appropriate for a large group of non-violent offenders. In order to accomplish its strategy, Connecticut has developed a hierarchy of programs. Programs located at the base of the hierarchy need to be the most cost-effective, and serve the largest number of clients. Programs located higher up in the hierarchy serve offenders with special needs and are more expensive. The following programs are listed from the bottom of the hierarchy to the top. Alternative to Incarceration Centers (AICs) -- Currently, seventeen AICs are funded. On a daily basis the AICs serve approximately 1,500 clients. AICs are operated by private non-profit agencies that provide supervision, substance abuse treatment, education and vocational assistance, counseling, and community service. These agencies are selected through a competitive Request For Proposal process within the judicial branch. Panels composed of members from the probation, parole, and bail departments and the Office of Alternative Sanctions select the nonprofit agencies used. Providers must conform to the system developed by OAS, and OAS pays for the services rendered. -: Community Service Labor Program (CSLP) -- This program permits offenders charged with low-level substance abuse offenses to perform community service in lieu of prosecution. On a daily basis, there are approximately 1,200 active CSLP cases. Electronic Monitoring -- Electronic Monitoring permits the court to ensure that an offender remains in his/her home at night or during other specified time periods. On a daily basis, there are approximately 300 offenders who are electronically monitored. Day Incarceration Centers (DICs) -- Three programs are funded. These programs serve clients who are considered to be the most serious offenders in the hierarchy. Clients are supervised by the program during the daytime hours seven days each week. All of the clients are electronically monitored at night. Youth Confinement Center (YCC) -- This program is designed to meet the special needs of drug-involved offenders ranging in age from 16 to 21. The program, located in New Haven, is available to sentenced offenders. Proiect Green -- Two programs are funded, one in Hartford and one in New Haven. The programs provide substance abuse treatment. Offenders participating in the programs perform extensive levels of community service in State parks. Women and Children Offender Program -- This program provides the court with a community-based sanctions option that is directed at the special needs of female 39 offenders. The program permits the female offenders' children to live with them during their participation in the program. Traditional Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Programs -- Approximately 200 treatment beds are funded. Among the services provided are substance abuse treatment, work and education programs, and detoxification. The length of programs is different for each offender and can be as 10ng as five to six months. Clients are revoked from alternatives to incarceration on a case-by-case basis for consistently dirty urine specimens and failure to attend the program. Results and Impact Performance Measures The program has undergone two private evaluations by the Justice Education Center, Inc. in association with the Research and Evaluation Services, Child and Family Services, Inc. and Research and Planning Services, The Village for Families and Children, Inc. These evaluations measured the number of jail-bound offenders being diverted from the criminal justice system. They also investigated who appeared in court, attendees of the alternative programs or bail posters, and recidivism rates of both types of offenders. Implementation Problems and Successes A severe problem in the State of Connecticut is a lack of jobs. This affects the offenders because even if they learn new, productive skills, without jobs they cannot practice these skills and often return to crime to earn money. Initially, the probation, parole, and bail systems felt threatened by the OAS programs. Through meetings these fears were alleviated. Judges were unconvinced of the program's effectiveness. Program administrators talked to the judges and hold quarterly trainings to make them aware that using alternatives for jail-bound yet less dangerous criminals allows violent criminals to serve more of their time. This encouraged judges to be creative in sentencing these criminals. A potential problem was the continuation of gang behavior in the programs. Through a leadership model, offenders were taught that gangs would not be tolerated. In addition, the employees of the Alternative Incarceration Program are almost racially equivalent to the offenders in the program. Another potential problem is an offender being rearrested for violent crimes. This is avoided through screening. Violent offenders are incarcerated, and less violent offenders are accepted into the program. 40 Successes and Accomplishments The program has been able to meet, and, in many areas, exceed expectations. Currently, the program supervises over 4,200 offenders on a daily basis. These offenders would otherwise be incarcerated. The diversion of these offenders has allowed the DOC to hold incarcerated offenders for longer periods. Offenders with sentences of over two years currently serve at least 50% of their sentences. Offenders with sentences of less than two years serve at least 45% of their sentences. In addition, the Board of Parole is now able to use its discretion to grant early releases only to offenders who do not endanger public safety. Others will serve 100% of their sentences. Independent evaluations have shown the program's effectiveness. An evaluation of pretrial defendants showed that those released to the program were more likely to keep their court appearances than a similar set of defendants who were released to the more traditional mechanism of posting ball. Program participants were less likely to be arrested during the pretrial period than those in the bail release group. Additional prison and jail space has been saved by the fact that only 6% of offenders successfully completing the pretrial phase are sentenced to incarceration, while 20% of the offenders released on bail are sentenced to incarceration. An evaluation of sentenced offenders showed that 24% of offenders sentenced to participate in the program were rearrested within one year of entry into the program, while 30% of a similar group of offenders who have received a sentence of incarceration were rearrested within one year of their release. This longitudinal study will continue tracking both groups for two more years. The program has produced significant monetary savings. The average cost of a program slot is $5,000 per year, while the average cost of incarcerating an offender is $25,000 per year. Hence, use of the program for 4,200 offenders on a daily basis produces an annual cost savings of $84 million. In addition, use of the program saves the capital costs required to construct new prison space. Since the average capital cost for constructing a prison bed is $150,000, the use of the programs saves $630 million in capital costs. The program has won several awards. The program was selected for the Council of State Governments Innovations Transfer Program during December 1992. This award recognizes that the.program deals with a significant problem in an effective and innovative manner. The program was one of two programs selected for the award in the Eastern region of the United States. The program was also selected for the Excellence in State Government award by the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council (CPEC) in May 1993. Only one State government program is selected for this award each year. CPEC cited the cost savings generated by the program as a reason for the award. In 1993, the program was selected as the Volunteer of the Year by the Nutmeg State Games in recognition of the high level of community service work performed on behalf of the Games. 41 Prospects for Replication To be successful, programs must be useful to the offenders so that they will be compelled to participate. By creating user-friendly centers with recreational options after mandatory programming and using incentives like food to encourage participation, programs are more effective. Informing judges about their sentencing options is crucial to the success of the program. Impressing upon prosecuting attorneys that the length of time served for violent offenders is more important than a win/loss record is important so that they will accept alternatives to incarceration as a viable option. Maintaining a unified court, probation, and correctional system, without county or district systems creating interference helps in the implementation of the program.

In addition to the deaths, there are countless serious injuries that occur every day to women and children due to domestic violence. Many battered women attempt to secure protection, refuge, and economic support in order to live without the terror, threats, and intimidation they encounter with an abusive partner. Unfortunately, as these women go through the criminal justice system as victims, plaintiffs, witnesses, and defendants, there are multiple opportunities for confusion, uncertainty, disappointment, and disappearance. The challenge tothe community is to improve responses by social services to victims, strengthen the enforcement of existing laws by police and courts, and increase the bank of i'esources available to victims of domestic abuse. As the definition of domestic abuse has changed over the last 15 years, so has the utilization of community resources. What was once considered a mental health or an individual family problem is now recognized as a crime of violence. This necessitates intervention by the justice system. Judicial intervention has proven to be an essential deterrent to continued violence. Understanding the mechanics of the criminal and family law system with its complexity, language, and rules requires confidence and a level of knowledge that many victims do not possess. Often victims lack information about their legal rights and options. Without information about property rights, child custody, and legal protection, a woman may sacrifice what belongs to her and risk her safety and that of her children. The Domestic Violence Clearinghouse and Legal Hotline (DVCLH) is a program developed on the premise that the legal community has a great deal to add to the efforts being made to reduce the incidence of domestic abuse on Oahu: to interrupt the generational cycle of violence and provide legal information for those victimized by domestic abuse. Goals and Objectives This program has two primary goals: (1) to reduce the incidence of domestic abuse on Oahu, and (2) to interrupt the generational cycle of violence. There are several objectives designed to meet these goals, including the following: making legal information and referrals accessible to those suffering from the effects of domestic abuse; providing legal representation in divorce, restraining order, and post decree actions; developing and distributing materials fo~ enhanced professional and community awareness; consulting on 43 technical and policy issues for improved system response; and staying current on relevant issues and literature for the benefit of system and community education related to domestic abuse. Program Components The Domestic Violence Legal Hotline was incorporated in 1991, as a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide direct legal information, assistance, and referrals to those involved with domestic violence and improve the community response to the problem of domestic abuse. This is accomplished through education and outreach to community leaders, community service providers, and the general public. The Legal Hotline is dedicated to a vision in which people are free from violence, provided with the opportunity to make choices about their lifestyles and physical well-being, and ensured the right to become economically self-sufficient. The Board of Directors consists of 15 members of the community, including six attorneys, seven business people, one county government bureau chief, and a university dean. The staff of the Legal Hotline has grown from three part-time employees, providing legal hotline information and referral assistance, to 12 employees providing legal representation in complex divorce and custody actions; post decree and temporary restraining order matters; production of print and video materials for training and education purposes; composition and circulation of a quarterly newsletter to more than 1 ;700 people (Advocacy In Action); disbursement of emergency cash grants to battered women; technical assistance; events for community consciousness raising and professional development; and expert witness consultation. Direct legal services are provided to individual victims and their family members in two ways: legal services are offered over the telephone to callers needing specific information about their legal rights and options, how the system works, and the best ways to proceed toward safety; and legal services reach beyond telephone assistance to include representation in court proceedings. Education, consultation with private practitioners, technical assistance to system and program providers, and advocacy for system reform are also specialized services for which the Domestic Violence Legal Hotline has become known. Additional activities include the following: producing a quarterly newsletter containing information and analysis of substantive issues, community initiatives, and program developments; producing materials (print and video) for system and community education about domestic violence; * writing newspaper articles and Letters to the Editor; providing community education to community groups and program providers each month; 44 facilitating a countywide Domestic Violence Task Force with participation by representative system components; providing collateral consultation to professionals and community program staffs; providing system advocacy and technical assistance; attending personal and professional development workshops and seminars; and collecting and circulating resource materials from national and local programs and agencies. Results and Impact Performance Measures There are several ways in which the success of this program can be measured. Many of the measures are objective and quantifiable, such as the number of callers who are assisted with legal information each quarter or the number of staff training hours conducted. Other measures of success are more subjective, such as: questionnaires distributed to community providers for their input to assist in evaluating the accessibility of the program; client feedback surveys sent to each client whose case has closed with the agency; feedback forms sent quarterly to members of the Hawaii statewide coalition on domestic violence; and cases tracked monthly according to the stage of processing within the agency system: accepted, initial, active, ending, or closed. Implementation Problems and Successes The agency expanded from a very small operation with three part-time staff members and a limited mission tO a much larger organization with many new staff members. The roles of the staff members were different, which created some difficulty in terms of implementing new activities. Training and development of systems to accommodate the dramatic growth followed, but questions of board leadership, accounting procedures, and program characteristics presented some challenges in the beginning. The dimensions of each job description expanded with time, as more services were provided and outreach and referrals began. 45 The Domestic Violence Legal Hotline incorporated into a separate organization from Hawaii Women Lawyers. This necessitated the negotiation of a new contract with the State Department, the funding agency. A new Board of Directors was selected to guide the work of the new agency. Neither of these proved to be problems, but did require attention. The first newsletter was produced in a timely fashion. The Domestic Violence Task Force, which the Domestic Violence Legal Hotline convened, was formed shortly after program operations began, and answering the legal hotline callers' questions and making referrals were managed comfortably. Training a new attorney, developing and agreeing on criteria for case acceptance, and clarifying personnel matters were difficult. As a part of Hawaii Women Lawyers, the Hotline had no role in financial decision making or planning. All requests for funds were made through a volunteer treasurer on the Board of Hawaii Women Lawyers, and gaining autonomy was challenging. Once the program became known in the community for the services it provides, the requests for help exploded. It immediately became apparent that additional paralegal assistance was needed, and program staff wrote a grant proposal for funding for a second paralegal position. A tremendous program challenge that has not been resolved is the two-fold job responsibilities of legal staff, both answering a legal hotline and carrying a legal caseload. Interviewing clients and preparing documents for court filing while answering calls of a crisis nature is stressful. As a project of Hawaii Women Lawyers, the Domestic Violence Legal Hotline in its original form was staffed by volunteers. It was difficult to integrate volunteers into the system once a staff was hired who were also providing legal services. Staff members were too busy to devote the attention necessary to volunteers, and scheduling was a responsibility that was only half- heartedly assumed by the person in charge of that task. Additionally, volunteers came during their lunch hour, and the fewest number of calls came in during lunch, so volunteers did not feel they were making a difference. Successes and Accomplishments The program has had many accomplishments. Four years of operation have been filled with incredible successes for the individual clients and contributions to the community. Funding One major triumph was the transition from Federal funding to State support. Initially, the program began with funds from the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program appropriated from the Attorney General's Office. Those funds were available for three years, at which time the grant required that local funds be obtained to continue operations. With extensive effort and communication with policy makers and decision makers in Honolulu, last year the program received full funding from the State Legislature and the City Council. 46 Services Initially, the agency was a project of another entity, and the Hotline provided strictly telephone assistance. With the addition of staff and the identification of needs by domestic violence providers and judiciary in the First Circuit, the program expanded to include direct services, system advocacy, reform efforts, and community education. In .the three preceding years (1991-94), 10,940 phone calls were answered from the community, battered women, attorneys, service providers, family members, and system providers. Lawyers represented 296 battered women in Family Court proceedings. The caseload is currently 74 cases, and this year 353 children of battered women have been helped. The program has provided 691 hours of training in the community for professionals, civic groups, school students, and others. The program has provided 353 hours of technical assistance on domestic abuse issues, and 1,466 telephone calls related to technical assistance. This year more than 7,875 materials have been distributed about domestic abuse. Projects Over the last three years, the program has sponsored a small variety of very successful projects. They include local artists volunteering to assist survivors and victims to design a t-shirt for Domestic Violence Awareness Month; an art exhibit-fundraiser; a conference; a lecture on the defense of battered women; the screening of an Academy Award-winning documentary with two of the women featured in the film addressing the audience; a brunch with mayoral candidates; the production of two videotapes, Arresting Violence, featuring a batterer, and To Stay or Not To Stay, featuring the lives of four battered women; the development of two brochures, The Right-To-Know for battered women, and You Need To Know for batterers; and the development of a Cultural Belief Series for the program's newsletter and for separate distribution. Fundraising Fundraising efforts have been quite successful. This is the first domestic violence program to receive funds from the City Council. Last year the corporation was opened to membership. The program has received grants from ten local, private foundations and corporate support from 23 different corporate interests, in addition to individual contributions. Funds have been raised from the sale of the program's products and by events the program has sponsored. Miscellaneous Accomplishments Program staff developed for their clients a Women's Legal Defense Fund because there were no funds in the budget to cover the costs of litigation, only the salaries for professionals to provide services. In order to adequately represent battered women and be effective counsel, funds were needed for discovery costs and other evaluative initiatives on behalf of the clients. Funds from a local private foundation enabled the program to begin a fund for these costs. The Domestic Violence Clearinghouse and Legal Hotline was selected by the Hawaii Community Foundation to receive a lump sum from the Robertson Foundation to award Persons In Need (PINS) cash grants to battered women, since the program is equipped to evaluate the needs of battered women and is able to get the cash into their hands quickly. The Domestic Violence Clearinghouse and Legal Hotline is actively collaborating on projects with two domestic violence providers by serving their clients. The Family Peace Center and DVCLH joined together to provide Right-To-Know legal information sessions to participants in 47 group sessions. Staff members also are working with the DART team and the Family Visitation Center to provide Battered Women's Advocacy Project services directly to clients referred by the Parents and Children Together (PACT) agency. As part of the work with the Domestic Violence Task Force, the DVCLH is facilitating Professional Peer Discussion Groups for staff of all community providers to come together and discuss issues that they face in working with battered women or perpetrators. One of the sessions focused on Working with an Ambivalent Client. A second session focused on Safety Planning. Prospects for Replication This is a program which may be easily replicated in communities across the country. All battered women need legal assistance. With the assistance of the local bar and funds raised either privately or through public support, a program that addresses legal needs and system advocacy needs is a positive contribution to the community resource network. Private legal practitioners generally are not trained well enough or interested enough in the issue of domestic abuse to represent battered women adequately. Carrying a caseload with attorneys who are well trained and dedicated to protecting the life and property of women and children is desirable in every community. The combination of a legal hotline, a caseload, and system advocacy is a precious one. The DVCLH obtains material for reform directly from the clients and callers it serves. When a woman has a particular experience with the police and calls to ask about- it on the hotline, staff are informed that there is a problem existing in the system. Communication with the police to improve their response or their procedures is about the experience of people who have come to the DVCLH for help. Staff experiences providing these services have been gratifying and challenging. With a few ideas several years ago, the program has come to influence the policy makers in the community, to save the lives of women and children, and to keep the community alert to the problem of domestic abuse.

In 1975, 6,000 felony cases were filed in the Cook County criminal court system. By 1989, filings had increased to 28,000, half of which were narcotics filings. In 1994, 31,324 criminal cases were filed in Cook County. More than 17,000 were narcotics cases. Because of these increases, it was estimated that each criminal court judge in Cook County had an inventory of at least 500 cases on their docket at any given time. The increase in the number of indictments for drug-related crimes caused dangerous over-crowding in the county jail facilities. No additional funding was forthcoming. Therefore, the Cook County criminal court system was required to develop an alternative program to deal with the staggering number of drug-related cases. Goals and Objectives The Cook County Night Narcotics Court program, which began in October 1989, defined the following goals: to decrease the caseload-to-judge ratio in order to facilitate an effective and efficient adjudication of cases; to decrease the time spent by offenders incarcerated while awaiting trial (i.e. to decrease pretrial time); and to allocate appropriate attention to both narcotics cases and more serious crimes. Program Components On October 16, 1989, five narcotics courts were opened. Three additional courts opened one and a half years later. The Night Narcotics Court is conducted in an existing facility during idle courtroom hours, and is operated by current personnel. The court consists of eight judges who preside from 4:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Each courtroom is staffed with three Assistant State Attorneys, two public defenders, four probation officers, a clerk, and security personnel. 49 Activities conducted in the Night Narcotics Courts include assigning court dates, hearing motions, issuing warrants, monitoring probationers, hearing probation violations, presiding over bench trials, holding plea conferences, and sentencing offenders. In the event a jury trial is requested, the jury trials presided over by the night narcotics judges are held during the day division at the courthouse. The night narcotics judge is additionally responsible for conducting his/her docket for that night. The court is designed to hear drug-related cases dealing with sales, delivery, and possession. Attention is focused on probation possibilities and drug rehabilitative treatment programs. Results and Impact Performance Measures The success of the Night Narcotics Court can be measured both subjectively and objectively. The subjective measurements are based on reactions from individuals affiliated with the criminal court system, and objective measurements are based on statistical analysis. In addition, measures of court efficiency such as the amount of time between case assignment and sentencing, number of cases handled, and number of court dates per case may also be examined. Implementation Problems and Successes The Night Narcotics Court generated much controversy within the Chicago community. Judges, clerks, public defenders, Assistant State Attorneys, sheriffs, probation officers, and other court staff were concerned with the evening hours, the safety issues, and the likelihood of the program's success. Private attorneys voiced their concern over the requirement of having to work from 9:00 a.m. into the early evening in the event that they had a client in the Night Narcotics Court. Another problem that the narcotics court encountered was coordinating the various departments involved in the criminal court system. These departments include the County Board, the Chief Judge's Office, the Sheriff's Office, the State Attorney's Office, and the Public Defender's Office. This coordination involved alleviating the fears, through inter-departmental meetings,. surrounding the implementation of a new program within the criminal court system. The coordination required selecting judges from within the legal system as well as gathering volunteers from the various departments to work the night court division. Since night court starts at 4:00 p.m. each evening and goes until the court docket is finished, it was thought that using volunteers for the job was an unrealistic expectation. However, volunteers have come forward from each of the departments. When the departments do run short on volunteers for night court assignments, the departments have used primarily the seniority system for deciding who will work that shift. That system satisfies both the unions and the \"fairness\" issues that employees might raise. 50 Another initial obstacle of the program was the workload. Each night court staff member is expected to do roughly twice the number of cases of the day court personnel. However, a close look at each department and the responsibilities of those staff members illustrates that the sum may be greater than the whole. The attorneys are expected to carry roughly 100 cases at any given time in night court, but these are primarily drug offenses and, to a lesser degree, gun cases. The day court attorneys have every range of felony cases, from murders and criminal sexual assaults to thefts. The night court Probation Officers are carrying at least double the amount of probationers than the Probation Officers in the day court. However, the probation department is presently taking steps toward alleviating this overload by transferring probation cases from night court to.the day court probation officers and adding additional staff to the night courts. The work load of the night court sheriff has become more difficult than when the program began in October 1989, due to the steady increase in cases disposed of in night court. However, by all accounts the security for night and day Court are comparable. Initially, critics of this program characterized the program as punitive in nature and having very little rehabilitative potential for the defendants. These critics have failed to recognize that the same opportunities for rehabilitation are available to defendants in night court as are available to defendants in day court. Night court judges are encouraged and do add many rehabilitative conditions to the probation sentences. These conditions often include the successful completion of the following: T.A.S.C. (Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime), in-patient or out-patient care, enrollment in GED courses, successful completion of GED (which may cause probation to terminate early), intensive probation, intensive drug program (within probation department), acquisition of employment, skills training, and many other conditions which are individually tailored to the defendant. Successes and Accomplishments Since its inception in 1989, the Night Narcotics Court has succeeded in dramatically reducing the processing time of narcotics cases. In 1990, the Night Narcotics Court disposed of 9,700 cases. In 1994, 15,142 cases were handled. Additionally, a large reduction in time from case assignment to sentencing resulted. Prior to the opening of the night COUrtS, only 18% of narcotics cases were adjudicated and sentenced within 90 days of assignment. After the Night Narcotics Court opened, 52% were disposed of within 90 days in 1990, and 48% were disposed of within 90 days of assignment. Moreover, sharp declines were seen in the number of court dates per case. The mean number of court dates per case dropped from 11 in 1989 to only 6 in 1991. Changes in sentencing practices also occurred. In 1989, 55% of offenders were sentenced to prison and 45% to probation. After the Night Narcotics Court opened, the reverse was found to be true. In 1991, 33% of convicted offenders were sentenced to prison and 67% to probation. There has been evidence that the opening of the Night Narcotics Court has also seen an increase in offenders being sentenced to drug rehabilitation treatment programs. Finally, the Night Narcotics Court has made it possible to give violent felony cases more attention in the day division. 51 Prospects for Replication The Cook County Night Narcotics Court will adapt easily to a variety of settings across the country such as large, urban areas that have experienced a rapid increase in drug-related crimes. Any court system with a commitment to control the influx of narcotics cases can accomplish what Cook County has done. Cooperation by all court agencies, along with leadership from the presiding judge's office, are the keys to success.

Batterer's Education Program Statement of the Problem According to the Iowa Department of Public Safety, the number of incidents of domestic abuse reported to law enforcement increased from 3,501 in 1986 to 6,199 in 1990. The Iowa Judicial Department reports that the number of domestic abuse civil filings rose from 188 in 1990 to 2,677 in 1993. Based on national statistics, this figure is under-reported. In the last decade, advocates for victims of domestic abuse have increasingly viewed legal remedies as an appropriate vehicle to address domestic violence. Starting in 1979 with the enactment of the first protective order legislation, Iowa has been among the country's leaders in passing legislation mandating an increased role for the court and peace officers in criminal and civil domestic abuse cases. Comprehensive domestic violence legislation was passed in 1991 which mandated offender participation in a Batterer's Education Program (BEP). A multidisciplinary State steering committee was established to provide oversight. The main accomplishments of the legal reform have been to define domestic violence as a crime, not a private family matter; to increase public awareness about domestic abuse; to maximize victim safety; and to allow the opportunity for many victims of domestic violence to use the law to break free of abusive relationships. The most important aspect of changing the criminal justice system's response to battering is coordination to secure a consistent and uniform response. Equally important is that the community at large be engaged in addressing domestic abuse. Criminal sanctions for domestic assault send the important message to defendants, victims, and society that domestic violence is a crime and not a private, family matter. In addition to sanctions, a mandatory BEP referral provides defendants an alternative to violence and abuse. Since violent behavior is learned, BEP makes batterers accountable for their behavior. In order to ensure a coordinated community response to domestic violence, it is critical to include all criminal justice system components. When law enforcement, the judiciary, prosecution, and correctional services work together, victim safety and perpetrator accountability are maximized. Goals and Objectives The State of Iowa has established a comprehensive approach to domestic violence. The statewide effort includes the cooperation of domestic violence victim advocates, law enforcement, courts, prosecution, and the Department of Corrections (DOC) to address the escalating problem of 3 domestic violence. The main goals are (1) to maximize the safety of victims of domestic violence, and (2) to ensure accountability for the perpetrators of domestic violence. The objectives designed to meet these goals include the following: to fulfill the DOC legislative mandate by providing BEP to all court-ordered domestic abuse defendants; to ensure continuity of statewide programming by establishing State standards for Batterer's Education Programs; to ensure that BEP Facilitators have a thorough understanding of domestic violence issues, know how to maximize victim safety, and are able to facilitate BEP groups; to ensure that all State BEPs are in compliance with the \"State Standards for Domestic Abuse Batterer' s Program;\" to maximize victim safety by integrating and responding to feedback provided by local domestic violence projects; and to create a community response to domestic violence. Program Components Legislation The 1991 Iowa Legislature enacted the most comprehensive changes to the law of domestic abuse since mandatory arrest was implemented in 1986. The new law included enhanced penalties for repeat offenders including prior deferred judgments in Iowa or elsewhere; limitation of deferred judgment or deferred sentence for domestic abuse assault; mandatory minimum sentences for domestic abuse offenses and for violations of protective orders in criminal and civil cases; and mandatory.BEP provisions in sentencing orders. As part of the changes in 1991, the Legislature specifically required the Department of Correctional Services to provide or contract for the provisions of BEPs for domestic abuse offenders. Statewide Steering Committee To provide expertise and State/local coordination, a steering committee comprising DOC judicial districts, Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence, local domestic violence projects, county attorney, and mental and social service agency staff was established in June 1991. The committee has developed Program Standards and continues to meet on a quarterly basis to provide program oversight and insure program integrity. Program Standards Statewide standards have undergone revision. Several main elements are: requiring the use of the Duluth Men's Education Model for men and separate programming for women; requiring the establishment of local coalitions including, but not limited to, law enforcement, prosecution, judiciary, corrections, and local domestic abuse projects; establishing 54 staff selection and training requirements; and requiring the establishment of local policies and procedures. Program Accreditation A program of this magnitude which has been established in a relatively short time frame requires ongoing technical assistance and oversight to insure quality service. The Domestic Abuse Program Standards insure that programs do not work in isolation but that law enforcement, the courts, the Department of Correctional Services, local domestic violence projects, and the service providers work together to address the issue of domestic violence. The purpose of the accreditation process is to review the input of each of theseragencies in program development. DOC and service providers make site visits to review programs. It is critical that each of these perspectives be involved in the accreditation process so that an accurate evaluation of system response can be obtained. Facilitator Training To establish consistency and quality control, the program standards require all BEP facilitators to complete a 3-day pre-service training program. A State training curriculum and trainee handbook has been developed and printed for utilization in the training program. BEP Program Description Twenty-six agencies throughout the State have responded to the need for provision of BEPs and have contracted the District Department of Correctional Services in their area to provide programming for court-ordered offenders. Service providers include community colleges, mental health centers, domestic violence shelters, District Department of Correctional Services, and a variety of social service agencies. Services are provided through offender fees, agency contributions, and Federal grants. All batterers are charged for participation in the program. Institutional programs have also been developed and are operational at seven of Iowa's eight institutions. Batterer's Education Program Curriculum Design A BEP is an educational program designed to teach batterers how to stop using controlling and abusive behavior in relationships with their partners. Controlling and abusive behaviors include physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. The BEP Standards require the utilization of the Duluth Men's Education Program Curriculum in order to provide statewide consistency with the program's philosophy to: protect and keep victims safe; hold batterers accountable so they can effect personal change; reduce physical, emotional, and psychological abuse; and support a community response to end domestic violence. A separate curriculum has been developed for females which is tailored to the needs of women. BEPs' Databases The DOC has developed a data collection system to monitor the participation of each offender in the program. This system collects such information as demographics, type of offense, referral source, successful program completion, and reasons offender was terminated from program. This information, is collected on a monthly basis and placed in a' database by the Bureau of Planning and Research. The information allows the Department to review the program implementation on a statewide basis and to troubleshoot when data reflects unusual trends in various programs. 55 Community Response Model/Development of Local Coalitions The most important aspect in changing the judicial system's response to battering is the coordination of its many actors to secure a consistent and uniform response. Policies w.hich promote arrest, increase convictions, place legal sanctions on assailants, increase the incarceration of assailants, require education or rehabilitation for violent behavior, and protect victims from further contact with the assailant are effective only when they are uniformly and consistently applied. To this end, the IDOC standards require the development of a Community Response Model. Each judicial district is required to promote and participate in a coalition of agencies for the purpose of program planning, policy development, and oversight. A number of coalitions are now active in each judicial district. The coalitions include law enforcement, prosecution, judiciary, domestic violence projects personnel, corrections, survivors, substance abuse and social service agencies, and medical personnel. Results and Impact Performance Measures The following information is collected on a monthly basis and placed in a database by the Bureau of Planning and Research: number of BEPs already established by social service agencies, new BEPs each DOC Judicial District develops as a result of contracting with social service agencies, groups within each BEP to meet the demand of referrals, facilitators who are certified to facilitate the BEP curriculum, facilitators attending the statewide conference, BEPs receiving accreditation .~ visits or BEPs passing accreditation, victim, contacts, BEP groups monitored; BEP and'domestic violence projects meetings, local coalitions in each judicial district, and local coalition meetings; range of accreditation scores for all BEPs; quarterly reports generated by State BEP database; level of cooperation between BEPs and domestic violence projects through accreditation visits; - type of representation in each coalition; and individual performance evaluations of facilitators. Implementation Problems and Successes Because the program is a statewide effort, problems in implementing the design were different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The most commonly identified problems are: lack of education about the dynamics of domestic violence which effects how law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and clerks choose to carry out their responsibilities under the legislation; all members of the criminal justice system do not actively participate in coalitions and take responsibility for building a coordinated community response; laws are ignored or circumvented by recalcitrant law enforcement officers; prosecutors find it hard to convict without victim testimony; 56 cases are dismissed, allowing batterers to gain more power in their relationship with the victim; gaining access to necessary court information such as police reports is difficult for some BEPs; accurate statistics are not being kept statewide to assess impact/outcome; lack of response, slow response, or noncompletion with BEP; courts excusing offenders from BEP participation or allowing them to participate in alternative programs such as couples counseling; criminal justice system budgets/resources not keeping pace with the increasing workload necessary to comprehensively address domestic violence; lack of written protocol for responding to domestic violence; lack of prosecutorial communication with victims including unreturned phone calls often resulting in the prosecutor having no idea how serious the injuries were and plea bargaining or dismissing the case without conferring with or informing the victim;::, lack of interaction with victim advocates; domestic abuse charges being plea bargained to simple assaults, sometimes to preclude the offender's attendance in the BEPs; BEP ordered for the offender but charges are reduced to preclude further penalty enhancements; and cyclical problem which taxes the criminal justice system's resources when offenders who refuse to comply with BEP get dismissed and are sent back to court only to be sent back to complete BEP. Successes and Accomplishments Program successes include: the programs were established quickly and are now accessible statewide; civil and criminal filings have increased; referrals to BEP have increased from 339 in 1991 to 3,950 in 1994; programs are primarily dependent on client fees; increased public awareness; 57 a unique opportunity for men to address this problem with a prolonged period of monitoring, encouraging success; access to a whole pool of victims who previously were not receiving services; and swift and sure response to BEP dismissal for accountability and to increase compliance. Communities throughout the State have taken responsibility for actively working together to end violence in intimate relationships. Those coalitions diplomatically use the collective resources of the group to seek positive systemchange. They function as a \"watchdog\" to ensure that, in designing a response to the problem of domestic violence, three events occur. A coordinated community response is present which provides a safety net for the victim. A commitment from local law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges to enforce domestic violence laws every time they are broken is critical to any community effort to stop battering. Mandatory arrest occurs which takes the victim \"off the hot seat\" and sends a clear message to the perpetrator that he/she must stop the violence. The two-day mandatory jail sanction furthers the message from the community that they will not tolerate physical violence and will hold the perpetrator accountable. The mandatory BEP for perpetrators is predicated on the belief that people can change and that the individual perpetrator is responsible for the change. The united community response, mandatory arrest, and jail sanction tell the offender to stop the behavior. The education group tells them how to adopt new behaviors to change the previously developed destructive pattern. Overall accomplishments are: 36 BEPs throughout the State (approximately 87 groups/week); local domestic violence coalitions developed throughout the State; model protocols developed for prosecution and law enforcement; training developed at the local level for components of the criminal justice system; Statewide Steering Committee developments including: State standards in place; 20 BEPs accredited to date; standardized curriculum training manual developed; facilitator training available quarterly with over 400 facilitators trained; BEP Coordinator's meetings Facilitator Conference; BEP Process Evaluation to be completed; and Supreme Court Task Force on Courts and Communities' Response to Domestic Abuse. Prospects for Replication Many factors will facilitate successful replication of the program. Comprehensive legislation is recommended to guarantee an accountability model. Local community leadership and the 58 incorporation of the criminal justice system is necessary to ensure implementation of the laws. BEP curriculum is \"user friendly\" and can be easily implemented. Domestic violence experts should be available through local shelters and projects. No new agencies need to be developed. Coalitions are a collaboration of existing agencies. Local leadership is critical. Visionary leaders with tenacity, patience, diplomacy, and an understanding of how individual agendas play into the development of collaborative relationships are needed. Quality training for all players on the dynamics of domestic violence must be provided. A BEP Policies and Procedures manual must be developed. Client fees can be the primary support of the program. Community education is critical to heighten the awareness of domestic violence issues. This knowledge dispels the myths about domestic violence. The facts then prevail to change values and attitudes which have allowed domestic violence to flourish. There must be strong local leadership and participation from many other individuals including policy makers, health care providers, clergy, attorneys, employers, schools, and the public at large so that communities begin to develop proactive preventive strategies to address the issue.

The police would provide a disposition which consisted of speaking with the youth and calling his/her parents. Although well-intentioned, police were not equipped to provide continuous services or monitor high-risk juveniles in the community on a regular basis. The second option was the initiation of formal juvenile charges. Once in court, the youth may or may not have been referred to the Probation Department. The cases of first-time, non-violent juvenile offenders were usually dismissed or continued without a finding. These youth left the court with a record but without the benefit of services or supervision from the court system. Experience has shown that among this population there was a high incidence of recidivism. Research indicates an overlap in delinquency, substance abuse, early childbearing, and school failure. Official intervention is critical to effect any positive change in the lives of troubled youth. It was recognized that this revolving-door style of justice failed to serve the youth, their families, and society. Limited resources precluded the courts from becoming involved in every case. District Attorney Kevin M. Burke developed the Juvenile Diversion Program to fill this gap by offering official intervention. The program is based on the widely accepted belief that not all cases are best handled through a formal delinquency complaint and court hearing. The Juvenile Diversion Program is an innovative model which works with some first-time, nonviolent, juvenile offenders and their families by offering an alternative to the Juvenile Court System. If the youth successfully completes the program, the District Attorney will not prosecute the case, and the juvenile will not have a court record. Because the Diversion Program's mission is to serve this population, the program is able to respond promptly. This is especially important given the overwhelming caseloads most courts are faced with today. In 1994 over 750 juvenile cases were diverted, and the youth referred to services. This allowed Assistant District Attorneys to devote their time to more serious cases. Goals and Objectives The primary goal of this approach is to educate and empower the youth and his/her family to succeed in making positive changes. This goal is accomplished through services including counseling/education, community service, and payment of restitution. In addition, the program aims to: 60 hold youth accountable for their behavior; offer a first-time offender the opportunity to prevent creating a juvenile delinquency record; develop a system of individualized services for cases which can be handled more efficiently in the Juvenile Diversion Program rather than through the traditional court process; allow youth to avoid the stigma of delinquency by successfully completing the requirements of the program; reduce recidivism through early intervention; and provide services designed to discourage the abuse of alcohol and other drugs and promote positive decision making. The above goals are accomplished by maximizing the use of community resources in helping youth address their problems. The Juvenile Diversion Program seeks to support community resources. In addition, the program seeks to maximize the use of family resources in paying for counseling services and secure free services for youth and families who do not have the ability to pay. Program Components The Juvenile Justice Units, based in the District Courts, are charged with providing a consistent and appropriate continuum of responses to juvenile (ages 7-17) crime. Responses range from Juvenile Diversion to Priority Prosecution. The Juvenile Diversion Program is the first step in this comprehensive response. The purpose of the program is to prevent further problems With the criminal justice system by dealing early and in-depth with the causes of juvenile delinquent behavior. The Diversion Program has a specialized intervention component which works with local police departments to identify and serve juveniles who are involved in high-risk behavior including the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. The four to six-month Juvenile Diversion Program assists in reducing the overall risk encountered in high-risk environments by providing services aimed at empowering youth to become agents of positive change within their community. In order to ensure a comprehensive network of services for each youth, the program makes referrals to a wide variety of programs and services. Counseling/Education Based on knowledge of the various agencies and their programs, Juvenile Diversion Program staff refer youth and their families to the most appropriate community-based agency, including Department of Public Health-funded agencies and mental health agencies. Once a youth has connected with a counseling agency, the agency conducts a formal evaluation 61 to determine which mode of treatment will be most beneficial. The agency also determines the length of time a youth needs to be in counseling. The Juvenile Diversion Program maintains contact with all agencies where youth are seen to monitor their progress. If a youth enters the program and a counselor determines that he/she does not need individual/group counseling services, then he/she is placed in an educational group covering high-risk behaviors. Topics in these groups include substance abuse, tobacco abuse, and AIDS. Through involvement in the program, the juvenile and his/her family learn effective ways to alter delinquent behavior by using skills such as conflict resolution. Community Service The majority of youth Who enter the Juvenile Diversion Program are required to perform from 20 to 40 hours of community service. Diversion staff continuously network with area agencies to match the youth's interests and skills to needs found in the community. Agencies where community service is performed include hospitals, soup kitchens, and the recycling center. In general, agencies where supervision is already in place are used, or neighborhood clean-ups are supervised by Juvenile Diversion Program staff. This program component serves to enhance self-esteem, confirm competence, and reconnect the youth to his/her community in a positive way. Restitution In cases involving property damage, the Juvenile Diversion Program requires that the youth pay the victim if he/she requests restitution. The Program Coordinator sets'up a schedule for payment with the youth and/or the youth's family and forwards the money to the victim. The restitution component is highly successful. The Juvenile Diversion Program negotiates realistic~ adjustments with the victim.and the juvenile,based on his/her ability to pay., Even individuals from', the most economically~ stressed circumstances can: comply with this: part of their contract. Educational Groups and Workshops Youth in the rJuvenile Diversion Program who are not in need of treatment but are at risk for drug and alcohol problems participate in educational groups and workshops. These groups are provided by Diversion staff and other agencies in the community. Their focus is to inform youth and promote positive health behaviors. Some of the topics covered in these groups are: drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, peer relationships, decision making, and conflict resolution. The group format provides youth with positive peer interaction which motivates and encourages the individual in his/her effort to make positive choices. Outreach and Community Development The Juvenile Diversion Program meets the needs of high-risk youth through a strong outreach and community development component. In order to achieve this, Diversion Coordinators commit to learning about all services and resources dedicated to youth development, empowerment, and intervention in their communities. This commitment results in Juvenile Diversion becoming an integral part of a network which includes schools' substance abuse services, religious organizations, counseling services, community job training, and State agencies. The strength of this network enables Juvenile Diversion Coordinators to promote the needs of high-risk youth through appropriate referrals to community agencies and institutions. Coordinators also serve on a variety of task forces, community groups, and school groups. In this capacity, Juvenile Diversion Coordinators are able to assist in the 62 formulation of policies which support youth development and intervention programs. Juvenile arrests/summons are reviewed in each district court on a daily basis. Juvenile Diversion Coordinators attend Clerk's Hearings and arrive at a joint decision with the Clerk-Magistrate and police on which cases are divertable. These cases are then discussed with an Assistant District Attorney to decide which cases are appropriate for the Juvenile Diversion Program. Juveniles entering the Diversion Program meet with the Program Coordinator, who conducts an assessment to determine what services are needed. The assessment includes a history of drug and alcohol use, a brief family history, and discussion of other high-risk factors. The juveniles are given the option of participation in counseling, community service, and restitution in lieu of prosecution of their case. A contractual agreement is secured at intake, emphasizing the need for comprehensive assessment of the youth and his/her family. Families pay for program services on a sliding scale. Free services are arranged for families who are unable to pay. The Diversion Coordinator develops an individual service plan for the juvenile, identifies a network of community professionals to provide the necessary services, and monitors the youth's compliance with this program. This intensive supervision and support is essential to prevent further involvement with the criminal justice system. If the juvenile successfully fulfills all requirements of the program, the case is not brought to court. There is either no juvenile record or a record only of the issuance and dismissal of a complaint. However, if the youth fails to comply with the program, he/she is prosecuted. ? Results and Impact Implementation Problems and Successes Obtaining funding is a major concern. Also, selling the program to judges, police officers, probation officers, and all involved parties is difficult because the program is an alternative to the formal system, and some departments were nervous that money for their programs would be diverted to the Juvenile Diversion Program. When this did not occur, these agencies developed a positive attitude toward the program. Successes and Accomplishments Since its inception in 1981, the Juvenile Diversion Program has progressed from one court to seven of the eight District Courts in Essex County. Over 6,000 youth have been diverted from the court system and referred to services by the Juvenile Diversion Program. In 1994 over 750 cases were diverted. Over $15,000 in restitution was returned to victims in 1994. The Juvenile Diversion Program has worked collaboratively with community-based agencies to develop a number of services which meet the needs of high-risk youth. These services include the Smokeless Peer Leaders Program; the Youth and Family Program; the mentor program; the Memorandum of understanding; and the Young Adult Offender Program. ~i~ ~ ~ ~ 63 The Smokeless Peer Leaders is a program designed to prepare youth to train and educate their peers about the dangers of tobacco. Out of 35 similar programs in Massachusetts, Smokeless Peer Leaders is the only group composed of court-involved, high-risk youth. Another service is the Youth and Family Program, an educational group designed for both adolescents and their parent(s). This model consists of an educational group for adults and another for youth with certain activities combining the two groups. The Youth and Family Program is designed to identify areas of common interest to youth and adults, teach conflict resolution skills, and improve communications. Another component of the Juvenile Diversion Program is a mentor program with law students, at an area law school. This project involves educating the student volunteers regarding high-risk youth and monitoring the progress of the project. The Juvenile Diversion Program has developed a Memorandum of Understanding which documents and formalizes the relationship between schools, police, and the District Attorney's Office. This serves as a guideline for these entities when dealing with juvenile incidents involving alcohol, drugs, violence, and weapons on school grounds. A pilot Young Adult Offender Program has been developed in response to widespread concern about the effects of underage substance abuse. Under Massachusetts law an individual is considered an adult at age 17. Therefore, the original Juvenile Diversion Program is not available to anyone 17 or older. The Young Adult Offender Program is designed to provide young people between the ages of 17 and 21 the opportunity to participate in an educational group rather than have their cases go through the court system. This program targets five offenses::. Minor in:. Possession. of Alcohol;, Possession of Class. D.. Disorderly : Conduct; Public Drinking; and Disturbing'the. Peace: First-time. young, adult ,offenders .who:, choose to enter the program are required to attend a 12-week educational group. The group meets at a local counseling agency, and its focus is to educate participants about the dynamics of addiction. Successful completion of the program results in the youth not having an adult criminal court record. Prospects for Replication The program has been replicated six times in Essex County since its inception in 1981. Several factors are critical to successful replication. Staff must be designated to create and administer the program. Resources to address the needs of the juveniles must be brought to bear on the problem. The target population must be clearly defined. Participation and support by law enforcement personnel are essential to successful replication of the program. The program is built on the utilization of available community resources, making it very cost effective. Many of these programs have tailored their approaches in order to address the needs of youth referred from the Juvenile Diversion Program. The target group has been standardized with policies and procedures for law enforcement personnel in Essex County. All law enforcement personnel involved with ensuring public safety while responding to the needs of first-time offenders must accept the program in order for it to work. These include the 64 police, the District Attorney and the court. Each must see in the Juvenile Diversion Program the potential for a tangible contribution towards the achievement of their mission. Several measures may be taken to assist in replicating the program. First, an assessment must be made of the current decision makers within the local criminal justice system to determine receptivity to a Juvenile Diversion Program. Next, a list of tangible benefits for each decision maker can be developed and agreed upon. Professionals interested in more information with regard to replication of the Juvenile Diversion Program may find it beneficial to contact their counterpart in Essex County (e.g., police to police, district attorneys to district attorneys, and judges to judges). Meetings with each party should be held, and agreements defining roles, responsibilities, and procedures developed in writing. The Juvenile Diversion Program has proven to be an effective early intervention alternative to the criminal justice system. Not only does it serve as a vehicle for treatment for those youth who have already engaged in high-risk behavior, but as a means of identifying adolescents from high-risk environments who have not yet been reached by services. Because of the success of this program, judges, assistant district attorneys, clerk-magistrates, police officers, and schools are opting to refer some of the more serious offenders to this program. Through involvement with diversion, these juveniles experience a structure of consistent support and accountability and receive counseling aimed at family issues and the adverse effects of substance abuse. Thus, the Juvenile Diversion Program provides an important service to those juveniles at high-risk for substance abuse and serious delinquency by providing prevention, treatment, and education.- Contact Information Ruth Budelmann Director Juvenile Justice Program Essex County District Attorney's Office Museum Place One East India Square Salem, MA 01970 (508) 745-6610 (508) 741-4971 fax 65 Massachusetts Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program Statement of the Problem Increasingly, domestic violence victims are turning to the courts for assistance in ending the violence and terror being perpetrated against them. All too often the courts respond with confusing procedures, untrained personnel, and a lack of community coordination. Restraining orders are routinely violated and unenforced by the courts. The result is that too many abuse victims are intimidated, overwhelmed, and denied the remedies they desperately need. Close to 2,000 domestic violence victims come to the Quincy Court each year seeking legal remedies to provide safety for themselves and their children. Given the 35% increase in domestic violence petitions over the past two years and a similar increase in the arrest of male violators, the client population is expected to double every three to four years. Covering seven surrounding cities and towns, the Quincy Court serves a diverse population of about 200,000. The court coordinates the numerous police, corrections, and social service agencies, all facing budget cuts along with the increasing requests for assistance. The Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program attempts to combine innovative, integrated approaches that not only provide maximum protection and accountability, butalso assist victims in ending the:: violence. Goals and Objectives The program has two goals: (1) to control the abuser through focused prosecution, creative sanctions, intensive supervision, and specialized treatment; and (2) to empower victims by creating a user-friendly process, an array of comprehensive direct services, and referrals to provide support and assistance. To achieve these goals, the program has the following objectives: to make the process easier and assist victims in making use of the range of criminal justice interventions; to ensure that the cases are vigorously prosecuted, whether or not the victim is available to testify; to coordinate a community response, such that all parties work together to protect the victims and hold the offenders responsible for their behavior through tight supervision; and to ensure that victim safety is the first priority. 66 In this vein, the program attempts to return to court all offenders who do not adhere to court orders or who threaten continued harm to their victims. Program Components For the victim, the program has made the process user friendly with the following: (1) a private office at the court, staffed by women specially trained to assist the victims seeking restraining orders; (2) a daily briefing session for victims on civil and criminal options, community resources, support groups, and general guidance through the court; (3) two special court sessions held daily to expedite hearings; (4) ongoing educational and support groups for the victim, separate groups for adolescents and children from violent homes, and a parenting group run by two clinical social workers from the District Attorney's Office and the DOVE shelter; (5) two specialized domestic violence prosecutors, two specialized advocates, two experienced counselors, two law students, five student interns, and three volunteers to handle the cases, provide support, and ensure system accountability; and (6) an experienced domestic violence advocate in the Probation Department who makes contact with the victims of the probationers to ensure continued safety and offender compliance. The program has been successful in uniting the activities of the critical actors in the process including police, prosecutors, judges, probation, shelters, advocacy groups, batterers' services agencies, child protection services, and medical and mental health providers, and ensuring formal, ongoing training for a combined maximum response. As part of the coordinated community intervention plan, the day actors also participate in the Quincy Court Family Violence Roundtable, which meets once per month to identify problems and map out short- and long-range action plans. With the Police Tracking System, the victim advocates are able to immediately obtain police incident reports, whether ornot an arrest has been made, so that contact with the victim can be made as soon as possible. The police advise victims to go to court 45 minutes early to avail themselves of the briefing session, explain the 24-hour availability of restraining orders, and urge them to speak to the advocates about support groups and other resources. Additionally, many of the actors assist with in-service training and community education seminars for the relevant agencies, service providers, social organizations, the military, professional groups, and the community at large. \"~ZT.L72!:!! ~iLi, To better control the abuser, the program has: (1) tight pre-trail probation to ensure victim protection and decrease the likelihood of witness intimidation pending trial; (2) fast-track court scheduling to ensure speedy trials; (3) routine confiscation of weapons; (4) a trained, five-person probation enforcement team; (5) strictly enforced sanctions including saturation surveillance in the community, and mandatory orders of alcohol and drug abstinence monitored through random testing; and (6) speedy revocation hearings for violators, with immediate sentencing ranging from short shock to longer term incarceration. To increase child safety and stop the inter-generational cycle of domestic violence; the District Attorney's Office and the DOVE Battered Women's Shelter co-sponsor three Children's Support 67 Groups and a Parenting Group. Groups are offered for young children, adolescents, and teens involved in violent dating relationships. The focus is on safety planning, teaching the children to call \"911\" when in danger, how to identify warning signs, what to do if a fight starts at home or school, and related issues. Most of the children's groups run concurrently with the adult victim's support groups, thus providing child care while beginning to address the children's needs. Results and Impact. Performance Measures In an effort to increase victim safety, program staff wanted to determine what was helpful and what was not helpful about the program. A comprehensive court survey of victims was conducted, beginning in 1986 and repeated periodically, asking victims how the court could best ensure their protection and improve services overall. Implementation Problems and Successes Obstacles existed on two levels. First, more than any other violent criminal, male abusers are the most dangerous and tenacious in their pursuit of their victims, as well as the most resistant to court control and treatment. Although police enforcement models existed, their: were no models for effective sanctions and supervision of:these offenders. Court !personnel had to. develop' policies and programs,, including an array of mandated' treatments and' surveillance. Second, most women, 60% in the initial 1986 study, had histories of significant victimization from childhood, seriously compromising their coping skills to protect themselves and their children in abusive relationships, An array of services such as support groups, assigned advocates, special court clerks, and a private office and referral services such as AI-Anon for Women, Rape Crisis Centers, and Spanish-speaking support groups had to be identified and/or created. On a systemic level, given the extent of gender bias and resistance to change in the criminal justice system, sensitivity and reform training for all actors had to be developed and provided on a regular basis. Final challenges remain: to develop an abuser topology to better and more accurately predict lethality and utilize it within the constraints of a due process legal system; to create a new paradigm under which prosecutors and defense attorneys work more closely on family violence cases to ensure victim safety', to constantly ask \"How can we be doing this better?\" especially with regard to increasing victim safety; to expand safety planning for children; to increase community education and public awareness campaigns to re-enforce that domestic violence constitutes violent crime which must be treated seriously; 68 to establish a visitation center within the county to facilitate the safe exchange of children; and to increase the availability of emergency and transitional housing for abuse victims fleeing danger. One obstacle the program faced was some judges' reluctance to order batterers to attend counseling and specifically to attend a certified batterer's intervention program. This was due, in part, to the batterer's assertions that (1) they could not afford the time off work or money to travel (10 miles) to Boston for the programs; and (2) the batterer's program facilitators were too harsh in their expectations of participation, timeliness and attendance. In response, the court personnel arranged for a top Batterer's Program, Emerge, to hold several sessions per week at the Quincy District Court. This took away the need for travel and seemed to make the judges feel that it was part 0f the Court's intervention process, thus greatly increasing the participation rates. The on-site location also allowed staff to better monitor the program. Too many victims were reporting repeat violence, harassment, and/or stalking by batterers even after a criminal conviction, and sometimes by perpetrators in jail. Due to embarrassment, no phone access, transportation obstacles, and fear of retaliation, some victims did not inform the court of the new offenses. With over 300 batterers on probation, generally for at least one year, staff wanted to throw out a wide net to the victims of these perpetrators. First, as part of the briefing and the informational brochures, staff began including a message that they wanted to know when any problems arose, post-conviction or at any other time. Second, a Probation Revocation Session was established to expedite the process of bringing back before the Court those perpetrators violating the terms and conditions of their probation. Third, an experienced advocate was hired to work from the Probation Department as a Victim Contact Coordinator. That advocate's job is to immediately contact the victim of a batterer on probation and familiarize the victim with post-conviction services and the availability of help, including renewed safety planning. Successes and Accomplishments Victims overwhelmingly asked in the survey that the court increase the number of support groups being offered, both for themselves and their children. By not tying victim participation in support groups to any court involvement, even those who remain with the perpetrator are welcome and active members. Many victims begin the support group still living with the batterer and unsure as to the wisdom of obtaining a restraining order. By the end of the eight-week education section, most victims have obtained a restraining order, moved away from the batterer, and are beginning to understand that the abuse is not their fault. A twelve-week support group follows, with education networking, exposure to other victims and role models, and information on day care, job training, and other needs. To increase the number of victims obtaining permanent restraining orders, in 1987 the court began holding daily briefings to offer intensive support and relevant information. In the first six months of briefings, there was a 14% increase in the number of victims returning to court for 69 their permanent restraining order. Perhaps the greatest testament to the success of the coordinated community response has been the findings of a study comparing the Quincy District Court with two surrounding counties' courts. The study found that, of the domestic violence victims coming to Quincy Court for help, 87% of them followed through with permanent restraining orders and/or criminal prosecution. A similar size court in a neighboring county showed just 34% of their victims returning for continued assistance. Even as one of the highest issuing courts (almost 2,000 restraining orders in 1994), the Quincy District Court has the lowest restraining order drop rate in the State. Decreasing the domestic violence homicide rate has been an area of interest in the Quincy District Court service area, since the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has faced a steadily increasing number of battered women murdered by their partners. In 1986, the State found that a battered woman was killed by her husband or boyfriend every 22 days. By 1993, that number rose to one battered woman killed every 12 days, and during the first three months of 1995, every four days a battered woman was being murdered. Given the size and demographics of the court's service area, it should have produced similar statistics. However, over the last 16 years, the Quincy Court has had one domestic violence homicide in the town of Cohasset in 1979. After that homicide a death review was conducted by assembling all the relevant actors to determine what should have been done differently in that case and how victims could be better protected, in general. Keeping in mind that conviction rate is not the best indicator of success, court personnel were: determined to increase the prosecution rate as an additional ~means of hoiding offenders responsible for their actions: Since many victims were intimidated out,of testifying against their .... abusers, staff focused on learning how prosecutors could go forward with the trial, even absent ' the victim's testimony. This meant police had to be trained regarding comprehensive report writing, evidence collection, and investigation of domestic violence incidents. Utilizing the one- page Domestic Violence Incident Report Form, training was held for all police chiefs and most officers to share information and inform the police that they should document the victim's statements, injuries, and demeanor at the scene, as well as take photographs of the victim's injuries. By enlisting the assistance of the Polaroid Corporation, cameras, film, and a law enforcement photography seminar was donated. As a result, there is much more information in the police incident reports, more photographs for use at trial, and increased morale of both police and prosecutors. Law enforcement now knows that the prosecutors will make every effort to bring the case forward, utilizing the\"spontaneous/excited utterances\" of the victim at the scene. This enables the court to hold the offender accountable, while taking the victim out of danger. During the first quarter of 1995, 85% of the victims contacted were very receptive to the support, 10% were unreachable, and 5% declined services because they were still with the batterer. However, even the knowledge of the advocate's availability can serve as a deterrent to the batterer. This advocate has also forged a close relationship with the jail staff, resulting in much closer cooperation, sharing of information, and referrals. 70 Without providing specific guidance, it was unrealistic to expect police officers to produce comprehensive incident reports, complete with photographs and the necessary documentation for going forward even without the victim's testimony. Utilizing the Family Violence Investigation Checklist, copied from the San Diego Police Department, court staff conducted training all over the county, with mixed results. As the Quincy Police Department has received 40 hours of domestic violence training per year from the District Attorney's Office, their progress has been the most pronounced. However, police officers in general have welcomed the simple, one-page format of the Family Violence Investigation Checklist, which tells them exactly what information to collect at the scene. This has increased police morale and improved the police reports the court is receiving. In an effort to bring more actors to the table, the Quincy Court Family Violence Roundtable was started. At monthly meetings problems are raised and long and short-term Action Plans are designed. For example, there was much concern about court safety for victims and bystanders because even offenders coming from jail were found to be in possession of weapons. There is now a metal detector at the front door and in the court's lock-up, as well as a protocol for court officers or police officers to accompany victims to their cars, the subway, bus stations, or to the District Attorney's Office. Based on the fact that welfare is the primary safety net for abuse Victims and that 35 states pay less than $4,000 per year for a family of four on welfare, the Court knew that simply getting a victim on welfare was not any kind of solution. The primary reason that abuse victims return to the perpetrator is a lack of money, thus creating an obvious need to provide victims with information about job and educational opportunities. In working with a group of pregnant and parenting teens by helping each one devise an Individualized Action Plan, most have gone on to obtain their G.E.D. or high school diploma, Several are enrolled in community college, and several have graduated from technical school programs. These students have named this the \"What Is Your Dream?\" Project. ~\u00a3~L?=E, !LIL~' :;?',, \" ~ This is being expanded to the elementary and high schools. The Florida Department of Youth Services documented in their 1994 study that children who become delinquent begin disengaging at around third or fourth grade, in part because they have no sense of future, few role models, and little confidence. Program staff are training tenth and eleventh graders to go into the third grade and conduct \"What Is Your Dream?\" sessions, on a bi-weekly basis. The third graders listen much more attentively to the high schoolers than they would adults, the high school students get course credit for participation, and it gives Court personnel the opportunity to train the high school students about job and educational opportunities. A 1991 study by the American Nursing Association documented that pregnant and parenting teens were at the greatest risk for abuse in their relationships, and that teens in general experience tremendous abuse from their partners. Working with the DOVE battered women's shelter, court staff put together a teen dating violence brochure, hotline number, and support group for battered teens. An intervention program is being developed for teen batterers. Working with two top teachers at Quincy High School, the Quincy High Students Against Domestic Violence was 71 started. This work has taken on new meaning as in 1994 close to 80% of the civil restraining orders issued by the Quincy District Court were issued against men ages 18 to 24. Prospects for Replication Part of the ease of replication is that there is no separate budget for the Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program. To develop it, existing personnel and resources were utilized. Most of the efforts have focused on transferring and training existing personnel. Personnel includes members of the District Attorney's Office, judges, probation officers, and court clerks who are all funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, the program utilizes many volunteers, including Domestic Violence Victim Advocates, as well as individuals from colleges, shelters, and other community services. Abusers are required to pay for batterer and/or alcohol/drug abuse treatment and testing. In 1992, the Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program won a Ford Foundation-Innovations Award, and has been cited as a model program by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges in Family Violence: State of the Art Court Programs. In 1992, the program was featured on a \"60 Minutes\" episode. After being featured on the \"60 Minutes\" episode, the program was flooded with requests for information and technical assistance. The Court regularly hosts visiting public policy, law enforcement, and courtperform from around the United States and the World. Within Norfolk County, the District Attomey's Office has expanded this modelto all of the other COUrtS. In 1990, the Massachusetts Legislature appropriated' $150,000 to each District Attorney's Office to establish a Domestic Violence Unit and coordinate with their local courts, modeled on the Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program. For many years program staff have willingly, as time permits, traveled all over the State and to several others including Florida, Montana, Wisconsin, California, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maryland, and Washington, to provide training and technical assistance to those wishing to replicate the program. Many courts have been able to develop at least key components of the program. For example, there are currently about twenty Domestic Violence Court Roundtable operating in Massachusetts; each District Attorney's Office has specialized advocates and prosecutors; many courts have adopted specific protocols; and the probation departments are focusing on the monitoring of batterers. The Quincy Court Domestic Abuse Program is an extremely successful model of an integrated approach to addressing domestic violence. It shows that when all parties work together, an effective family violence intervention protocol can be implemented. Further, it reinforces the message that partner abuse is a crime to be taken seriously, not a private matter to be ignored by the system. This model has won widespread praise and support in the community. It has served to toughen State domestic violence laws, calling for mandatory arrest and treatment, a state registry of restraining orders, forfeiture of weapons, state wide training, ball reform and other measures to improve the response to domestic violence. 72 Contact Information Gwen DeVasto Community Education and Training Coordinator Norfolk County District Attorney's Office 360 Washington Street P.O.

These children must undergo the same procedures as adults who report crimes to law enforcement agencies. As a result, these victims of child abuse are frequently revictimized by the criminal justice system, which is insensitive to the needs of children and to the fragility of child abuse victims. f In addition to the problems that these children may initially encounter at intake, the services that are available to children and their families at that time are frequently overlooked. A law enforcement officer answering a call in which the victim is a child is often not aware of services which can meet the immediate needs of the victim and his/her family. Many crimes against children are not defined as \"child abuse,\" and these victims are not afforded therapeutic and compensatory services because they have not been informed of the availability of these services. To aid in the handling of these cases, it is imperative thatcoordination exist between Criminal Justice and Human Services investigators at an early stage. This collaborative community effort helps to ensure that the child victim receives all available and needed services within the community. Child abuse investigators and caseworkers are stretched to the limit in handling the overwhelming numbers of cases of crimes against children reported annually. Coordination among all involved agencies will help increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the investigation, as well as reducing additional pain and trauma inflicted on the children. Goals and Objectives The South Mississippi Family Child Center's Child Victim/Witness Program has three primary goals: (1) to reduce crime; (2) to improve the prosecution of child abuse cases; and (3) to ensure that the needs of the victim and his/her family are met. The first goal, the reduction of crime, may seem lofty for a small, non-profit agency. However, it has been well-documented and studied over the past several years that the present prison and youth correctional facility population reports profound abuse and neglect in their childhood. A child who is protected by a responsive judicial system is less likely to become tomorrow's threat to society. 74 The second goal of this program is to improve prosecution of cases of child abuse. It is imperative that the court be presented with a child witness that is able to testify and understand the roles of the various players in the criminal courtroom. A credible witness continues to be required for successful prosecution of crimes. The third goal is to ensure that the needs of the victim and his/her family are met. The center continues to enhance, refine, and provide services to child victims and their families. Every victimized child who does not receive needed medical treatment, mental health care, protection, and closure (by the criminal justice system) is at-risk of becoming a threat to society. The objectives of the South Mississippi Family Child Center's Child Victim/Witness Program are listed according to the three components of the program. The objectives of the Multidisciplinary Team Program are to: coordinate at least 600 investigations between law enforcement and the Department of Human Services during scheduled team meetings; provide community and professional referrals to 500 child victims of crime; provide documentation of team recommendations on at least 500 cases involving child victims and restaff cases periodically until all recommendations have been followed through; .... maintain case data on 800 child victims; attend and document 142 team meetings each year; and schedule an agenda and mail it to team members in order to inform members of felony child abuse cases to be staffed prior to the scheduled meeting. The objectives of the Court orientation Program are to: provide court education services to 200 child victims of crime and their families; decrease anxiety and fear associated with the criminal justice process for 300 child victims; provide pamphlets, coloring books, and literature on testimony and the courtroom experience to 450 individuals; recruit and provide tra!ning for six volunteers to work with the court orientation program; assign volunteers to accompany child victims to court in 200 pending felony child abuse cases; and provide pertinent information involving their cases to 300 victims and their families. The objectives of the Child Advocacy/Law Enforcement Training are to: provide an assessment of the victim's and family!s needs and to make appropriate referrals to community resources for the provision of treatment and personal necessities to 300 child victims within the first two weeks following a crime; ~/.i; ~, :;!~:,, :: ::~ 75 develop a community resource book and distribute to all police officers in the service area; develop a standardized protocol in cooperation with all local criminal justice agencies for law enforcement officers to use in the field when answering a call in which the primary victim ~d/or witness is a child; make available and assist in using the electronically equipped child victim interview in crime investigations in 200 instances; provide direct training to law enforcement officers at the area academy and continue in-service training concerning juvenile justice issues at police stations within the service area; assist the guardians Of child victims in the completion and filing of victim compensation applications; provide an initial assessment to ascertain the needs of the victim and supportive services in the form of weekly visits to the homes of 200 child victims of crime during their involvement with the criminal justice system; and provide an annual one-day conference for 500 area professionals who work within the Criminal Justice and Human Services fields Program Components Multidisciplinary Team Program The team meetings are held between one and four times a month. The actual duties performed by the Program Director and ~ Center Director for'the Multidisciplinary Team Programs are as follows: coordinate bi-monthly meeting in each county; plan with staff of each District Attorney's Office; prepare and disseminate weekly case dockets to be reviewed in each county; prepare written summaries of team meetings and disseminate summaries to each organization involved; maintain case summaries; maintain contact with the organizations involved; serve as a liaison between the team, law enforcement agencies, and the community; maintain a treatment resource list and invite therapists and law enforcement to present and discuss individual cases; perform victim advocacy tasks, such as the observation of criminal and family court hearings; participate in public awareness efforts; and provide an annual conference Court Orientation Each child is worked with an on individual basis as well as in group activity. The Court Education Program Director is responsible for the following duties: coordinating sessions with the District Attorney's Office; 76 facilitating interactions among involved area professionals; training and supervising program volunteers; maintaining pertinent program data and statistical information which measures or otherwise indicates program effectiveness and will serve as a statistical data base for similar programs as initiated; serving in a consultative capacity jurisdictions interested in initiating similar court education programs across the State; developing a tracking system for all participants completing the Court Education Program for the purpose of comparison to the general population in determining long- range effectiveness of the program; and planning and scheduling for a child advocate to be involved throughout the continuum of services. Child Advocacy/Law Enforcement Training The present procedure reflects that child victims do not come into contact with the Victim/Witness Coordinator until the case reaches the District Attorney's Office. This is sometimes months after the original trauma, long after intervention and therapy should have begun. By increasing and enhancing the child advocacy portion of this program, these problems can be avoided in the future. Additionally, this program provides training and support for the officer in the field who is often the first contact the child victim has with the criminal justice system. Program staff are responsible for the following child advocacy tasks: technical assistance to personnel regarding the use of the child victim interview room including how to conduct the interview; direct training to law enforcement candidates at the area police academies; development and implementation of continuing in-service programs to train law enforcement officers at their local stations; development, printing, and dissemination of a child victims protocol to assist law enforcement in conducting their investigation; intensive, in-home intervention to child victims and their families during the course of their involvement with the criminal justice system; preparation of victim compensation applications; initial visit, assessment and referral to mental health, medical, and human service agencies within the first month of the complaint; consultation services with law enforcement investigators actively involved in the on- going investigation of current child abuse cases awaiting presentation to the appropriate court; mediation between the victims and the criminal justice system, as needed; development of an evaluation of the program; and development of a community referral source book specific to the county for distribution to local law enforcement officers including all area human services, service organizations, private and public therapists, and financial resources including church organizations and other non-profit agencies that are available to provide assistance to people in need. 77 Results and Impact Performance Measures Statistics will be continually compiled during the course of 1995. This will enable measurement of program effectiveness. This will also serve to produce a data base for the innovative Court Education Program that has been developed for the South Mississippi area. Documentation will also be kept on all cases staffed through the Multidisciplinary Team to enable case tracking and measurement of re,victimization of child victims. A case file will be maintained to document each instance of early intervention. Statistics will be documented monthly. The Court Administrator's Office has offered technical assistance in measuring the successful prosecution of cases involving child victims that have been staffed by the Multidisciplinary Team. These statistics will give data as to the response time and treatment time involved in all staffed cases. It is the goal and plan of a team approach to shorten response time and the length of time between the crime occurrence and trial disposition. The Court Education Program is designed to make the process of going to court easier for child victims by educating them about the court process. Each child participant will be givena pre-test before beginning the program and a post-test at the conclusion of the program which will measure their increase of knowledge concerning the local court systems as well as the reduction of their anxiety about the pending trial. Court data will provide information on the number of children successfullytestifying in'court cases after completing the court education program. The child advocacy project will be evaluated using standard measures of increases in objective understanding of their role in the criminal justice system. This measurement to01 will be developed and enhanced during 1995. Subjective evaluations of decreased anxiety in both child victims and non-offending caretakers will also be used. A questionnaire will be developed to be completed by law enforcement officers receiving training or assistance from this program. An additional questionnaire will be developed for completion by the victim and his/her family to measure satisfaction with the responsiveness and services provided by this program. Statistics will be gathered on prosecution results and time frame between report and imposition of the case by the criminal justice system. Statistics will also be kept on successful prosecutions, guilty pleas to a lower charge, and exoneration. Implementation Problems and Successes The South Mississippi Family Child Center's Child Victim/Witness Program evolved slowly over a period of six years. Prosecutors were reluctant to try offenders because children were considered unreliable witnesses. Child victims were so traumatized by the repeated interviews by the various agencies involved with child protection that they often were unable to testify at trial. Law enforcement officers and Department of Human Services workers felt that the courts were not interested in these crimes, and so justice was withheld. Finally there was 78 acknowledgement that the needs of the child victims had to be discussed. In the past five years, these two components of the Child Victim/Witness Program have been in place, but it was still noted that the victims often did not get assistance from the Victim Compensation Program. In addition, there was not sufficient follow-up to determine whether or not the child victim actually received the supportive services required to overcome his/her trauma. In 1995 implementation of the Child Advocacy/Law Enforcement Training Program was begun to ensure that children's fundamental needs are met. This year the child advocacy tasks are performed primarily in Harrison County as a pilot project. Successes and Accomplishments Since its inception, the Child Victim/Witness program has expanded to encompass five circuit court districts in the southern region of the State. Over 600 children have attended the Court Orientation Program, and over 5,000 felony cases of child abuse have been staffed. This program has been pre.sented at the National Organization of Victims Assistance, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the Exchange Foundation's annual conference. The program has also been presented at three in-State conferences, one of which was the Mississippi Prosecution Association's annual conference. The program has additionally offered a regional Child Abuse Conference for the last two years and is in the midst of planning the third. Prospects for Replication .. The Court Orientation Program is adaptable to any court system. It is a program that could be easily established by an interested District Attorney and his Victim/Witness Coordinator. This center has acted in a consultative capacity to other jurisdictions, both within and outside Mississippi, that have desired to implement such a program. Development of this progra m requires the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies as well as Youth Court, Department of Humal~ Services, and area prosecutors. It is important to build a strong network of inter- agency cooperation, and a strong Multidisciplinary Team project is an excellent place to begin. .61 v '7 ~,~ Contact Information Susan. Richards Program Director South Mississippi Family Child Center's Child Victim/Witness Program 4803 Harrison Circle Gulfport, MS 39507 (601) 868-8686 (601) 868-8670 fax 79 Montana Victim~Witness Assistance Program Statement of the Problem In 1993 the Gallatin County Attorney recognized that his deputy county attorneys were unable to meet all the needs of crime victims, especially victims of violent crimes such as rape, assault, homicide, and domestic abuse. Because of their increasing caseloads, the deputy \"county attorneys were able to spend less time with victims, resulting in victims who did not fully understand their role in the court process, who were less prepared for court proceedings, and who were in some cases re-victimized by the system that was supposed to help them. A grant proposal was submitted to the Montana Board of Crime Control for funding from the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Assistance Formula Grant Program for a half-time Victim/Witness Assistant to remedy this situation. A half-time coordinator was hired in August 1993 to assist 80 victims of misdemeanor or felony cases involving injury or threat of injury at the justice court and district court levels during the first year. Demand for the services was greater than anticipated: 105 primary victims, 65 secondary victims, and 24 witnesses received services the first year. The Bozeman City Attorney's Office requested the program, and the second year (1994-95) a grant was submitted and approved for a full-time coordinator who assists victims of violent crime in the City of Bozeman as well as in the county. Goals and Objectives Four goals are identified for the joint city/county project. The first goal is to improve the involvement of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system by providing a full-time assistant to serve as a liaison between the victims and witnesses and the criminal justice igrocess. The second goal is to increase community awareness of the criminal justice system and the needs of victims and witnesses and their families, by providing education to law enforcement, judges, and other participants in the criminal justice process. The third goal is to expand the number of victims and witnesses being served by Gallatin County and the City of Bozeman through the recruitment and training of screened volunteers to work directly with victims and witnesses. The fourth goal is to encourage increased cooperation between Gallatin County and the City of Bozeman in the areas of law enforcement and the judiciary through joint sponsorship of the Victim/Witness Assistant. 80 To achieve these goals the Victim/Witness Assistance Program has established the following objectives: maintain the current Victim/Witness Assistant position full-time; assist the County Attorney's Office and the City Prosecutor's Office by keeping victims and witnesses informed of the judicial process; identify and prioritize the cases to be served by the Victim/Witness Assistant and notify all interested parties in the county of the benefits and opportunities of the program; assist 150 victims and witnesses in cases involving physical injury or the threat of physical injury such as homicide, assault, domestic abuse, stalking, and victims and witnesses of property crimes in cases when the services would be appropriate; recruit, screen, train, and coordinate volunteers as needed; secure an intern from Montana State University to work with the Victim/Witness Assistant to assist the Montana Board of Crime Control with developing a restitution program for victims in Gallatin County; train a minimum of 30 law enforcement officers on victims' issues and increase awareness of victims' needs; and train local city, justice, and district judges and Battered Women's Network volunteers on victims' issues and victim/witness services available. is Program Components A project team was formulated to review and monitor the program. The team has 12 members and includes the county attorney, the city prosecutor, the sheriff, a Bozeman Police detective, a county commissioner, a representative from Alcohol and Drug Services, a staff person from the Battered Women's Network, a former victim of stalking, and a homicide survivor. During the first year of the grant, the team met monthly and is now meeting every other month. This interdisciplinary approach to problem solving has led to greater cooperation between members of the criminal justice system. A full-time Victim/Witness Assistance Coordinator is available to victims and witnesses from an office in the County Attorney's Office in the Law and Justice Center in Bozeman. Services include: crisis counseling, information and referral, criminal justice advocacy, assistance with crime victim compensation, court escort and support, transportation to court, assistance filing temporary restraining orders, property recovery, assistance with victim impact statements, 81 providing witnesses with a secure waiting area during court proceedings, parole notification, and advocacy for victims on all levels. Services are provided at no cost and are voluntary in nature. Referrals are received primarily from prosecutors and law enforcement officers but are accepted from any source. An ongoing prosecution is not necessary for services to be offered. Five volunteers were trained in February and March 1994. A six-month commitment was requested, and all volunteers have continued with the program. An intern from Montana State University is working with the coordinator full-time for summer semester 1995 to help develop a restitution program for Gallatin County. The new State Restitution Officer from the Board of Crime Control is working with them to come up with a workable, creative system that will better meet the needs of victims. A Notice of Rights and Services form was created with input from the project team and is now given to each domestic violence victim at the scene by law enforcement officers. The Victim/Witness Assistance Program receives a copy of the form. The coordinator assigns a volunteer to call the victim within 24 hours to offer services. With this phone outreach, there has been a noticeable increase in victims obtaining restraining orders and supportive services that enable them to make positive changes in their situations. Mandatory Bozeman Police Department (BPD) training on victims' issues and the Victim/Witness Assistance Program was provided in January and March 1995. There has not been a mandatory Sheriff's Department training due to budgetary constraints for overtime for that department. Officers were invited to the BPD training sessions and a few attended. Twenty-four Bozeman police officers completed the initial two-hour training. More law enforcement training is planned for the next fiscal year. There has been no formal judge training initiated at this time. Informal one-on-one conversations with some of the judges has been somewhat productive. More work needs to be done in this area. The coordinator meets with the Battered Women's Network staff on a monthly basis to coordinate services. Training to Battered Women's Network volunteers is provided at training sessions twice each year. The coordinator has spoken to a number of different groups about the Victim/Witness Assistance Program and victims' issues. There were ten public speaking engagements during the first year, and there have been 12 so far in the 1994-95 year. A number of newspaper articles have raised public awareness of this issue. A member of the Project Team testified at the legislature about her experience in the criminal justice system prior to the availability of the Victim/Witness Assistance Program, and a new comprehensive victims' rights package was signed into law in Spring 1995. 82 Results and Impact Performance Measures Data is collected by the Victim/Witness Coordinator on an ongoing basis and is reported to the Montana Board of Crime Control in quarterly reports and an annual report. Data collected includes: 1) number of primary and secondary victims receiving services; 2) types of crimes; 3) contact hours spent with victims; 4) nature of contact; 5) types of services provided; 6) percentage of cases in which alcohol or drugs were involved; 7) demographic data on victims served; 8) types of training activities; 9) number of witnesses served; and 10) number of volunteer hours. An Evaluation Form for Victims and Witnesses is mailed to each person served when cases are concluded. This includes eight questions regarding service delivery that the victim rates on a five point scale, as well as two open-ended questions and space for additional comments. Implementation Problems and Successes The primary implementation problem has been effective use of the volunteers. There is limited space available so that much of what they do is phone outreach to domestic violence victims from their homes. It was difficult to have sufficient time for training and supervision when the coordinator was working half-time. It would have been more productive to work the volunteers into the program once it had been operating for two years rather than bringing them in during the disorganized, beginning stage. Another implementation problem occurred the first year when the Victim/Witness Assistant was only a part-time employee. The demand for services quickly overwhelmed the time available~to provide the services, and the Victim/Witness Assistant had to be hired full-time. Being located in the County Attorney's Office has been a mixed blessing. While the attorneys and their files are accessible, the proximity to the attorneys is intimidating to the victims and witnesses. Successes and Accomplishments The most successful component of the program is the Project Team, which has increased communication and cooperation between law enforcement, prosecution, and private human service agencies serving victims. It has turned into a creative forum for addressing victims' issues and ensuring that victims are allowed to take an active role in the criminal justice system. Law enforcement officers now ask the Victim/Witness Assistant for her help at the beginning of cases. Approximately 500 victims and witnesses of crime have received assistance since the beginning of the program. This includes 295 primary victims, 110 secondary victims, and 92 witnesses. Over 90% of these individuals were involved in a violent crime. Twenty-seven law enforcement . ~ ~.~,~L \u00b8 83 officers have been trained on the use of the victim/witness services available and on victims' issues. Five volunteers have been recruited, screened, and trained and now provide direct assistance to vi&ims and witnesses. At an awards luncheon during National Crime Victims' Rights Week, the volunteers with the Victim/Witness Assistance Program were recognized, and there was very positive press coverage which increased the public's awareness of this program and victims' issues. Prospects for Replication There have been several requests from other county attorney offices throughout the State of Montana for this program. The service has already been made available to the City of Bozeman. All of the data forms, training materials, and informational materials have been given to the Montana Board of Crime Control and disseminated when requested. Research is underway to sponsor legislation to add a victim fee to criminal charges which could conceivably pay for victim services in every court system in the State of Montana.

In New York City judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and court administrators confront hundreds of misdemeanants daily, many of whom have appeared before the court multiple times for similar offenses. Lacking available jail space or suitable alternative punishments, the court has difficulty demonstrating that crime has consequences. This is especially true for crimes like prostitution, shoplifting, low-level drug possession and sales, illegal peddling, and theft of services. In many urban courts, sentences of time served, bench warrants for non-appearance, and bail forfeitures constitute the normative response to minor offenses. Such dispositions rarely impress either the community, the victim, or the defendant that crimes are taken seriously and that the defendant is accountable for his behavior. Goals and Objectives In October 1993, the Midtown Community Court (MCC) opened to process low-level offenses arising in the Times Square area of Manhattan. A three-year demonstration project, coordinated and developed by planning staff at the Fund for the City of New York, in collaboration with the State Office of Court Administration and the City of New York, the court arraigns misdemeanor cases that arise in Times Square and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The Court was designed with the following goals: establish constructive and restorative responses to quality of life crimes including intermediate sanctions like community service sentences and drug treatment; engage defendants in treatment, education, and health services at the moment of arrest; enlist community members and local service providers to help solve problems; and make justice quicker and more visible in the same neighborhood where offenses occur. The MCC attempts to provide judges with a broad array of intermediate options, providing constructive responses to a high volume of quality-of-life offenses. Intermediate sanctions provide alternatives to a \"walk\" for some defendants and alternatives to incarceration for others. Since opening, the MCC has implemented key objectives including: 85 designing sentences that stress immediacy and certainty, to enforce the message that crime has consequences and to engage defendants immediately in education, treatment, and prevention; working with local residents, businesses, social service organizations, and law enforcement to forge creative, cooperative solutions to quality-of-life problems and provide services directly at the court; augmenting the city's community policing program by providing an array of problem- solving tools such as community work projects and services for addicts, prostitutes, and the homeless; o making justice accessible and visible to the community by assigning offenders to visible work projects carded out in the Midtown area; and bringing together social service agencies and criminal justice personnel under one roof to provide health, education, welfare services, and to craft solutions. Program Components The operations of Midtown Community Court are unique among New York City courts in several respects. Defendants are assessed before arraignment to determine whether they have a substance abuse problem, a place to sleep, or a history of mental illness. A Resource Coordinator, working in the courtroom, helps the court match defendants with drug treatment, community service, and other sanctions. Court hearings, social services, and community service punishments take place under one roof. Punishment begins immediately, increasing the likelihood that defendants will comply with alternative sanctions. Computer technology increases accountability and improves communication among the police, court, social service providers, and the community. Community members and community-based organizations are actively engaged with the court, providing community service supervision, on-site social service, and general feedback and guidance through the Court's Community Advisory Board. Arrest warrants are issued for offenders who fail to comply with their sentences. Because the police officers are so closely linked to the court, offenders are re-arrested quickly. Offenders are seen by the same judge who sentenced them the first time. The judge will either increase the length of the sentence, order more urinalysis screenings, more treatment sessions, or other appropriate sanctions. 86 Results and Impact Performance Measures Since June 1993, the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) has been serving as the independent evaluator of the Midtown Community Court. NCSC researchers are comparing the use of intermediate sanctions, compliance rates, and defendant arrest rates at the Community Court with those at Manhattan's centralized court. Focus groups and interviews with community leaders and residents will help researchers determine whether the Midtown Community Court is changing community attitudes toward the criminal justice system. Implementation Problems and Successes The Manhattan District Attorney and the Legal Aid Society both objected to the creation of the court. Due to New York City's scarce resources, the objections to the court are over funding. Opponents of the court feel that the money could be better used in courts that deal with more serious offenses. The Legal Aid Society is disturbed over the inconvenience of sending lawyers and investigators who are based in lower Manhattan to the Midtown Court. While these agencies denounce the program publicly, they do cooperate with the court. Successes and Accomplishments In its first year of operations, the Community Court established itself as a vital player in the Midtown community. Nearly 70% of sentenced offenders at the Midtown Community Court are ordered to work in the neighborhoods where they committed their offenses, more than twice the rate found in the centralized Manhattan Court. In the first year, defendants from the court provided almost $170,000 in labor to the community. The defendants have had a palpable effect on the streetscape and the community: over 530 tree pits were cleared and maintained, graffiti was removed from nearly 140 walls, and over 740,000 pieces of mall were sorted, stuffed, and labeled free of charge for local non-profit organizations. While the Midtown Community Court is not the nation's first court to require that defendants perform community service, its insistence upon their performing that work in the community where the crimes occurred is unique. The Midtown Community Court is the first criminal court in the country to co-locate and co- deliver case processing, social services, health care, education, and drug treatment within the court building itself. Substance abuse, unemployment, and homelessness, which are widespread among the defendant population, can contribute to continuing criminal involvement. The Community Court has forged new coalitions, bringing a wide variety of service providers together under one roof. The City's Department of Health, Board of Education, welfare agency, substance abuse treatment providers, homeless outreach workers, and youth service providers help respond to the defendants' underlying problems. 87 The Court has established a set of graduated social service sanctions ranging from single-session engagement groups such as health education groups for both prostitutes and \"johns,\" job readiness training sessions, and a counseling group for youth to long-term mandatory substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail. One unexpected result of the Court's under-one-roof service delivery approach is that many defendants, sentenced only to brief interventions, return to the Court after completing their sentence. In the court's first year, roughly 16% of defendants sentenced to intermediate sanctions take advantage of court:based services. The preliminary evidence of the Court's effects on case outcomes is encouraging. In nearly 80% of the cases disposed at the Court, defendants are sentenced to perform community service, participate in social service programs, or both. Community service sentences for convicted misdemeanants are handed out far more frequently at the Midtown Court (62%) than at the centralized Manhattan court (26%). Judges not only have constructive options, but when they impose sanctions they do so with confidence that they will be carried out. Preliminary evidence suggests that community service compliance rates are substantially higher in Midtown (75%) than at the downtown court (50%). While it is too soon to assess whether the Court has had an overall impact on street conditions, there is growing evidence of a reduction in street-level prostitution and the concentration of illegal vending on Midtown streets. During the Court's first nine months, prostitution arrests in Midtown fell by 31%, while increasing by 5% in the rest of Manhattan. After 15 months of operations, arrests for illegal vending dropped 26%. The drop in prostitution and illegal vending arrests in midtown came at a time of increased quality-of-life enforcement citywide. Research interviews with community leaders, residents, police officers, prostitutes, and street-vendors bolster the finding that the incidence of visible quality-of-life offenses in Midtown has decreased dramatically. Preliminary analysis also points to a transformation in community attitudes. Based on interviews with community leaders, residents, local police, and representatives of business groups, the National Center for State Courts reports that community attitudes have shifted from uncertainty about whether the MCC would work, to a recognition that the MCC experiment had important \"implications for the NYC Criminal Court system as a whole.\" Over the past year, the Court's physical presence in the community, adjacent to the Midtown North precinct house, has fostered closer communication between the police and court administrators. For the first time, individual patrol officers are receiving information about case outcomes of their arrests, and officers' attitudes toward the Community Court have shifted from skepticism to growing support. Prospects for Replication Planriing for New York City's second Community Court, to be located in Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood, where 70% of residents live in public housing, is currently underway. Replication of the Community Court model, or aspects of that model, are likely in other jurisdictions as well. 88 In the past year, representatives from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and California have visited the Community Court to observe operations and identify procedures for possible replication. Developing a Community Court requires assembling a broad coalition of support from community leaders, residents, social service providers, criminal justice officials, foundation and corporate supporters, and local politicians. Although community groups often band together to oppose community-based criminal justice initiatives, strong neighborhood support helped the Midtown Court find its home, overcome early opposition to court decentralization, and complete the complicated project in less than two years. Although specific issues may vary in other jurisdictions, the obstacles inherent in the process of assembling a coalition of divergent constituencies, each with a unique agenda or special area of interest, are likely to be encountered in other urban settings.

Providing more effective services to youth is a perennial goal in the field of juvenile justice, with the hope of reducing either the extent to which juveniles become involved in the system or recidivism. The initial task related to intensive services that was assigned to the Juvenile Services Division was to keep youth at highest risk for commitment to training school out of training school; and, later, to prevent additional unlawful acts by status offenders. Both tasks were to be addressed by undefined, undeveloped intensive services programs. These tasks presented a formidable challenge to serving notoriously difficult populations. Goals and Objectives The goals of this program are il) to prevent further unlawful behavior; (2) to identify the juvenile's needs; (3) to mobilize community resources to address the needs; and (4) to interact frequently and purposefully with the juvenile and family. Program Components The Intensive Services Program has evolved from two earlier efforts. There have been three major stages in the development of the current Intensive Services Program: Stage One - Intensive Probation (IP), Intensive Supervision, and Intensive Services. The first stage, Intensive Probation, provided assistance and counseling to youth adjudicated delinquent who were most likely to be committed to a training school (juvenile correctional institution). However, the initial premise of this program turned out to be false. Program developers felt that by focusing on the most extreme at-risk juveniles, they could keep them from ending up at the training schools. In fact, the opposite occurred. As they focused on more of these high-risk juveniles, more of them actually entered training schools. 90 In the second stage, Intensive Supervision, the problems that were found with the initial program were addressed, and the program was altered and adapted successfully. For this reason, the current Intensive Services Program (Stage Three) emphasizes the approach developed in Stage Two. The Intensive Supervision is the stage which demonstrated positive results through an experimental design with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The current Intensive Services Program is available at all points in the juvenile justice system following adjudication, from probation through aftercare. The concept of \"Step-down\" means a gradual transition to less intensive services, and \"Step-up\" incorporates the higher level of services inherent in the move from regular probation to Intensive Services. Treatment plans are determined by client behavior and needs rather than pre-set programs built around specific services. Interdisciplinary teams staff all cases. Family involvement is required, and counselors advise parents on how to set limits on their children's behavior. Counselor caseloads are limited in size to ten cases per counselor, less than one-third the average caseload of a regular court counselor. There is-an increased frequency of contacts with the juvenile and his/her family by the counselors compared with regular probation, including evenings and weekends. Program staff interact frequently with schools and other service providers to provide close supervision and work with families, school officials, and employers of juveniles in the course of treatment. The intensive work with the juvenile decreases the counselor's period of involvement. More frequent supervisory case reviews are provided in the Intensive Services Program than in regular probation. Results and Impact Performtmce Measures The Intensive Services Program, in its first two phases, underwent extensive evaluations. The original evaluation was conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institute of Government, who sought to determine two things as measures of the success of the program: (1) would intensive probationers have been committed to training school if IP had not existed.; and (2) how great was the recidivism of juveniles on IP? The unanticipated early results of the second question were that high-risk juveniles tended not to be helped by the program but to enter training schools anyway. The evaluators for Intensive Probation concluded that the practice of selecting the most intractable cases for that intervention probably explained the early results. They recommended that the client selection process be changed to address juveniles likely to be committed to training school, but not those who would almost certainly be committed. This adjustment was made following the evaluation report. 91 Implementation Problems and Successes A number of implementation problems were discovered. Veteran workers resisted moving into Intensive Supervision positions when they became available, resulting in inexperienced counselors assigned to the program and requiring additional training, supervision, and support efforts. Interdisciplinary teams were slow in developing in some districts and reluctant to use contract funds, even after the process was streamlined to make them easily accessible. Objections were raised to the random assignment procedures, as some juveniles who needed the program were not assigned to it. The procedures for monitoring control groups placed an extra burden on regular counselors who were assigned juvenile s from the control population. Special attention was required from managers in differentiating this program from already-existing Intensive Probation programs. The development of selection criteria was time consuming after the Experimental Phase ended, and random assignment was no longer the selection method used. Procedures for accessing contractual services funds were initially too complex, which discouraged their use, so few contractual funds were sought. The program also had many implementation successes. The integrity of the random assignment process was retained despite counselor and manager frustrations with it. Positive influences were provided for regular probation and supervision services in the eight district sites. A protocol was developed which represents the best effort in providing supervision, thereby serving as a model for other counselors in the districts. Other community agencies were involved on the interdisciplinary team, which often resulted in services being provided which otherwise would probably not have been funded. In other words, other organizations accepted the process which translated into additional services provided without extra cost to the program. Teamwork was increased in the districts. A planner-implementer partnership developed in assessing and adjusting the program between senior division and district staff, counselors, and supervisors who all participated in retreats to evaluate and improve the program. Successes and Accomplishments The ongoing systematic evaluation of Stage Two of the program indicated that for undisciplined youths with no prior history of court referrals for delinquent acts, the Intensive Supervision Program provided a reduction of 15 to 20% in the rate of progression to delinquent offenses during the supervision period and a cumulative (supervision period plus up to one year after supervision) reduction of 25 to 30%, relative to corresponding rates observed for'youths in regular protective supervision. Experimental results also indicate that: early intervention facilitates the reduction of subsequent delinquent behavior; the reduction occurs primarily in referrals for non-felony delinquent offenses; there also are intensive supervision effects on reducing the runaway and truancy offense recidivism rates; and intensive supervision has a longer lasting effect than regular supervision. Other accomplishments include: morale boosters for counselors who saw positive outcomes for a population exceptionally difficult to serve; broader thinking as to service options; reinforcement of the philosophy of intervening for as short a time possible with the least invasive procedure; 92 a growing commitment to the program by participating counselors and managers who believe that this is the best program currently available to provide services to juveniles and their families; and learning how to prepare managers and staff for implementing the program as well as how to provide ongoing supportive supervision for those employing it. The program has had a positive impact on other counselors. It is a mini-demonstration project within the district, embodying the client-centered approach rather than program-determined or counselor-determined plans. The perception of regular probation counselors concerning the referral of clients to Intensive Services has changed over time from a sense of professional failure at having to turn the juvenile over to another counselor to a sense of making a legitimate referral to another valuable resource. Prospects for Replication When the intensive probation project began nine years ago, expectations were high. The program's development led to modifications of the goals, and experience taught several lessons as to what Intensive Services is and is not. Intensive Services is not: a substitute for any institution traditionally associated with the socialization of children, especially the family; a replacement for skilled therapeutic intervention; offense-specific; the juvenile's needs and behavior carry more weight in the selection process than does the offense; properly used as a suspended commitment to training school; a substitute for needed out-of-home placements, group homes and residential treatment centers; a stand-alone option, but rather one option among an array of possibilities; for juveniles who are geographically distant from the court counselor; and a substitute for regular probation services, because some juveniles do not need the intensive approach and can thrive under standard probation services. Other lessons learned or affirmed are: independent evaluations, when done properly, are extremely valuable for effective program modification; .;2. 93 the interdisciplinary team is a key component as it recognizes all participants as having legitimate input and encourages teamwork by appreciating the contributions of all; lower caseloads provide opportunity for frequent and timely intervention; early evaluation by a qualified professional is essential to meet the treatment goals of the juvenile; the importance of sensitizing court counselors as to how to recognize juveniles who probably need intensive services; and the significance of early intervention in general.

Unfortunately, victims of crime often feel as though they slip through the cracks of the criminal justice system. It was evident that more needed to be done in North Dakota to assist victims/witnesses of crime. In 1986, the North Dakota Commission on Victims and Witnesses of Crime was established through the combined efforts of the offices of the Governor, Attorney General, and Supreme Court. Recognizing that victims and witnesses are an intrinsic part of the criminal justice system, the Commission's work concluded when the 1987 session of the North Dakota Legislature passed twenty-one bills that pertain to the rights of victims and witnesses of crime. The principal statute, \"Fair Treatment Standards for Victims and Witnesses of Crime,\" and the accompanying law \"Child Victim and Witness Fair Treatment Standards,\" focused on the fights of these individuals and placed certain responsibilities on each agency of the criminal justice system. In 1988, Stutsman County received a substantial private donation from a local woman' whose daughter and granddaughter were brutally murdered in Washington State. After receiving help from a victim assistance unit there, her wish was to make sure local crime victims were also cared for. With approval from the County Commission, a Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) grant proposal was submitted for the remaining funding, and a specialized program within the State's Attorney's Office was implemented in December, 1988 with the hiring of an advocate. In 1989 the Stutsman County Victim/Witness Assistance Program received a BJA grant which has since completed its funding cycle. However, BJA has lifted the four-year limitation on Victim/Witness programs and it is expected that the program will reapply for BJA funding next fiscal year. Goals and Objectives The goal of the Stutsman County Victim/Witness Assistance Program is to improve the treatment of victims and witnesses of crime. This is accomplished by: (1) providing victims/witnesses with the assistance and services necessary to speed their recovery from the criminal act; (2) and supporting and aiding them as they move through the criminal justice process. Specific program objectives include: insure victims'/witnesses' continued involvement throughout the criminal justice process; 95 help law enforcement, prosecutors and the courts in identifying and responding to the needs and concerns of the victims and witnesses of crime; increase the commitment of State and local governments to do all that is possible to help victims and witnesses of crime; increase the range and availability of services for victims and witnesses of crime; expand the victims' and witnesses' opportunity to participate at all critical stages of the criminal justice process, and to ensure consideration of the impact of the crime upon the victim in all major criminal justice decisions; increase coordination and networking of all appropriate agencies, organizations and groups providing services to victims/witnesses of crime in order to develop an integrated community support system. Program Components The Stutsman County Victim/Witness Assistance Program is 'staffed with one advocate and is a prosecutor-based program. The program is housed in the State's Attorney Office, located in the County Courthouse in the City of Jamestown. Two prosecutors are on staff; and two district judges are chambered there. Attached to the courthouse is the new combined Law Enforcement Center. Located within the Law Enforcement Center is the eight-member Sheriffs' Department, twenty-eight member Police Department, a district office of the State Highway Patrol, and two agents of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations. The advocate is considered a part of the criminal justice system, and the physical location of the program allows accessibility and collaboration with all personnel who may become involved the case. The current advocate is a licensed peace officer and former city patrol officer who receives excellent cooperation from these agencies. This greatly enhances the program, allowing it to help these agencies in their response to victims/witnesses of crime. Referrals are received from law enforcement, the courts and/or State's attorney, hospitals, schools, and various community agencies. Approximately 40% of these referrals are victims of domestic violence. The advocate engages in a variety of activities pursuant to the North Dakota Fair Treatment Standards statute, expanding the victim's opportunity to participate at all critical stages of the criminal justice process and ensuring consideration of the impact of the crime upon the victim in all major criminal justice decisions. This may include: helping to secure interviews of those required to testify at trial; maintaining contact with the victims/witnesses; offering emotional support and referrals to other agencies/organizations; notification of case status; familiarizing witnesses with the courtroom and courtroom procedures; and generating information and understanding of the criminal justice system and procedures as a whole. In effect, the advocate acts as the eyes, ears, and voice of the victim at each critical stage of the criminal justice process. This includes securing victim impact statements to present at sentencing and 96 speaking to the judge in court proceedings to express the wishes of the victims. Court related services include: acting as the support person and sitting on the witness stand with child witnesses; arranging child care and transportation; and affording secure waiting areas for the victimsfwitnesses and their families. Assistance is also provided to those seeking disorderly conduct restraining orders and child protection orders from the District Court, in debriefing jurors after a particularly stressful case, and in preparing child witnesses for court. Results and Impact Performance Measures The expected results are to see greater cooperation by victims and witnesses and insure their continued involvement throughout the process. The program attempts to generate a greater understanding and feeling of satisfaction about the criminal justice process in order to assist the victims/witnesses recovery from the criminal act. This is accomplished by helping the system respond more favorably to the victims rather than inadvertently re-victimize them. The stated outcomes/performance indicators are: number of victims served; number of hours of direct services provided; types of outreach services provided; cooperation received from other .agencies; and requests fo r presentations/training on victim services; Implementation Problems and Successes The biggest hurdle in implementing the program was having the agencies of the criminal justice system understand what services the program could offer to them and to the victims/witnesses with whom they come into contact. There was some initial confusion about the advocate being an investigator of the State's attorney and therefore ableto interview the potential witnesses. Conducting in-service training sessions about the role of the advocate cleared up this confusion. Judges needed to be educated that the position was not meant to supervise them and could help them in their responsibilities to victims/witnesses of crime. Having an advocate who was a veteran police officer and known to all parties involved did much to establish the cooperation necessary to make the Victim/Witness Program a success. Having the program as an extension of the State's Attorney's Office also increased the credibility of the program. As the program developed, the agencies became more dependent on the program to assist them in their response to victims/witnesses. Referrals are received from all agencies, including some defense attorneys. Requests for presentations continue, and training is provided to law enforcement locally and at the North Dakota Law Enforcement Training Center. Funding continues to remain an unstable issue. The budget reflects only salary and travel expenses for the advocate. The State's Attorney's Office handles other office-related expenses. Grants are continually sought, and the offender fee assessments are an important funding mechanism. However, without the cooperation and financial support of local governments, the program would probably not succeed. 97 Successes and Accomplishments Judges have been excellent at assessing fees on convictions to help fund the program. Judges began to see the program as directly related to the court system. The disorderly conduct restraining papers, which are prepared by the Advocate, have been a successful component because they have allowed the advocate to represent the victim's wishes concerning their preferred method of conflict resolution. Jury debriefings have had a slow start, but a grant will be written this year by the North Dakota Victim Assistance Association to begin a statewide plan and develop procedures on helping jurors in high profile and stressful cases. Judges have been requesting more Victim Impact Statements before accepting plea agreements and prior to sentencing. The Advocate is also taking a more important role at bond hearings, speaking to the judge on behalf of the victims. Law enforcement and the prosecutors believe the program assists them with their workload. A better understanding of the criminal justice process and more satisfaction with that system is seen by the victims/witnesses. Greater cooperation is achieved and, therefore, better cases are being tried in the courts. Approximately 150 victims/witnesses are served per year by the Victim/Witness Assistance Program. Many more inquires are received from persons currently not involved in a criminal matter but looking for referrals and/or advice. Prospects for Replication No area is too large or too small for this program. However, smaller communities make interagency cooperation easier to achieve. This program would be easy to implement in any agency of the criminal justice system. Office space, a telephone, and some, office furniture are all that is necessary to begin. As long as the agencies are ready to cooperate and the advocate has a good working knowledge of these agencies' policies and procedures, the program should be a success.

T. T.A.C.) and Drug Court Program Statement of the Problem In 1994, Payne County ranked first in Oklahoma for case filings per judge. A substantial increase in substance abuse-related offenses has pointed to a lack of treatment programs and offender accountability. There were 110 felony DUIs disposed of through Payne County courts in 1994. The total filing rates for Payne County increased from 501 in 1992 to 672 in 1993. In 1994, 399 offenders qualified for alternative sanctions and accountability programs. Payne and Logan County jails are overcrowded, and many violators wait 30 to 90 days before going to court. Logan County currently has severely limited resources to address its crime problem. Fortunately, Payne County has programs to address issues related to domestic violence, substance abuse, and misdemeanor crimes during such waiting periods. However, there is a program gap for felony offenders. Currently, Oklahoma is first in the nation per capita for the incarceration of men and women. As of February 1995, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections penal system had a total of 45,558 offenders under its supervision. The offender population has exceeded 97.5% of maximum capacity at least three times in the past two years. This has required the prematur e release of several hundred inmates. Without alternatives to incarceration programs, the State prison system will continue to grow uncontrollably. This will require it to take drastic measures and release inmates at an accelerated rate, jeopardizing the safety of Oklahoma's citizens and communities. Goals and Objectives The program's goal is to reduce population overcrowding in jails, provide treatment to offenders, and decrease crime. An objective of the program is to reduce population overcrowding in jails as well as reduce rearrest and recidivism rates in Payne and Logan Counties through incentive- based treatment opportunities. Another objective of the program is to address offenders' psychological, social, vocational, and educational needs through screening evaluations, recommendations, and referrals, giving special attention to histories of chronic substance abuse and social dysfunction. 99 Facilitating increases in social skills, moral reasoning, identity growth, and life purpose and decreasing sensat!on-seeking behaviors though the use of Moral Reconation Therapy is also an objective of the program. Other objectives are to decrease participants' involvement with drugs and reduce criminal activity. Increasing child support collections in Payne and Logan Counties is also an objective of the Alternative Training, Treatment, and Correction Program. The final objective of the program is to decrease the crime rate and repeat offenses on the campus of Oklahoma State University (OSU). Program Components The Alternative Training, Treatment, and Correction (A.T.T.A.C.) Program and its components, P.R.I.D.E., the Intermediate Sanctions Program, and the Drug Court Program all focus on cognitive-behavioral substance abuse counseling, training, and job-readiness for felony offenders deemed appropriate for probation by the District Attorney and the District Judges. Offenders pay for these services on a sliding scale. Federal grant funds make up any cost disparities. The A.T.T.A.C. Program is an intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment and alternative sentencing program in Payne and Logan Counties. It provides an innovative alternative for repeat nonviolent felony offenders with alcohol and/or drug abuse histories and is designed to fill the sentencing gap between probation and incarceration. A.T.T.A.C. was designed in September 1993 to meet the rehabilitative and accountability needs of approximately 150 of the district's 500 felony cases per year which involve substance abuse. A.T.T.A.C. pi-ovides assessed offenders with group drug and alcohol counseling using Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT). MRT is a systematic, step-by-step treatment system for resistant clients. The system is designed to alter how inmates think and make judgments and decisions about right and wrong responses to situations. MRT is designed to enhance ego, social, moral, and positive behavioral growth in a progressive, step-by-step fashion. MRT is provided by the Freedom House located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Since its onset, A.T.T.A.C. has developed three components to address the community's needs. The Parental Responsibility Involving Debt Enforcement (P.R.I.D.E.) Program was developed to sanction absent parents who are in contempt of court due to their failure to pay child support. This nine-week counseling program uses cognitive-behavioral introspection and group discussions addressing the issue of child support. The second component developed by A.T.T.A,C. to address community needs is the Intermediate Sanctions Program. This is a prevention and education program designed to intervene at the misdemeanor level in response to DUI offenses and fatalities. The third component is the Drug Court Counseling Program. The A.T.T.A.C. Drug Court Program meets the following offender treatment needs: 1) it immediately engages participants, after being ordered by Drug Court Judges, in intensive treatment; 2) it provides high 100 accountability for participants through frequent supervision contacts, drug testing, and reports to the judge; 3) it provides intensive, long-term treatment and aftercare, which includes drug treatment, specialized issues counseling, job readiness, and home-based case management; and 4) it provides A.T.T.A.C. staff who ensure consistency in decision-making and program implementation. An Associate District Judge is assigned special cases deemed appropriate for the Drug Court. The Drug Court is heard one night per week, giving the judge a more hands-on approach to accountability and rehabilitation of the offender. The Drug Court has three phases and is a t5-month program. Successful completion of the phase s results in a dismissal of charges. When offenders begin losing ground in treatment, prosecutors pull them from the program and charge them on a case-by-case basis. Phase I: Stabilization and Adjustment The purpose of the Stabilization and Adjustment Phase is to educate the client about the problems associated with drug use and how drug use affects interpersonal behaviors and family relationships. During this phase clients become acquainted with the types of dysfunctional behaviors, especially denial, associated with drug use. In the beginning of the program, clients undergo one-on-one therapy. As they progress, the treatment focus shifts to a group setting. Phase II: Recovery and Issues Resolution Phase II focuses on ways the client can begin to deal with restructuring his or her life. The Recovery and Issues Resolution Phase offers the client a method of systematically outlining a pathway towards reaching the goals of stability and improved lifestyle. Phase liar: Transitional Services This phase of treatment links the client to more community resources to maintain sobriety; focus on relapse prevention issues; begin Home-Based Case Management; and move toward termination of services from A.T.T.A.C. staff. Results and Impact Performa.,~ce Measures The impact of the program on jail overcrowding will be reviewed and documented based on reincarceration rates of participants versus nonparticipants. The impact of these activities is a projected savings of $15,000 per offender per year to the State of Oklahoma by finding appropriate alternatives to State incarceration. These activities will also save police time, District Attorney and District Court staff resources, and reduce personal and property damage within the targeted counties. Client evaluations will be done to assure that appropriate services are provided and that appropriate referrals are made. A.T.T.A.C. is establishing a baseline of progress by looking backwards at the inmate's social history and criminogenic factors. In addition, each client will complete a battery of pre-tests upon intake. Post-test data on all discharged clients will be collected and analyzed for behavioral level increases. 101 A.T.T.A.C. will utilize monthly random urine screens on all participants. This data will be documented and sent to the Probation Officer on a monthly basis. Child support collections will be tracked prior to and after the implementation of the P.R.I.D.E. Program. The student offenders referred to the Intermediate Sanctions Program will be tracked for rearrest rates after successful completion. Implementation Problems and Successes The alternative sentencing movement has been a tough idea to sell in Oklahoma. A.T.T.A.C. has shown how alternative sentencingis more effective, faster, has a better recidivism rate, and opens up more secure beds than traditional incarceration. A.T.T.A.C. has produced a sense of higher offender accountability in the community. Since its onset in Stillwater, the A.T.T.A.C. program has opened two other offices in the State, and judges and District Attorneys statewide have shown interest. The A.T.T.A.C. Program was also difficult to sell to offenders. In some ways, A.T.T.A.C. is more severe than probation because it involves dealing with personal problems. Offenders must be compelled to participate in the program. Prosecutors can help with this problem by being more aggressive in charging offenders and not offering deals so that the program is more attractive. Successes and Accomplishments The A.T.T.A.C. Program's treatment modality, MRT, has shown a 33 to 50% reduction in recidivism and rearrest rates. In eighteen months of operation, 150 drug-related offenders participated in intervention, accountability, and counseling through the A.T.T.A.C. programs. Of the 150, 122 have shown significant improvement in the reduction of addictive behaviors and improved social behavior. The preliminary evaluation of the first sixteen program graduates show that three women and thirteen men completed twelve steps of the MRT Program. Based on data compiled from pre- and post-testing, there was a 21% increase in life purpose, a 24% decrease in thrill seeking, and a 28% increase in self-esteem. None of the sixteen graduates have been rearrested for any offense. As previously mentioned, Payne County increased from 501 total case filings in 1992 to 672 in 1993. Since the onset of the A.T.T.A.C. Program in 1993, the total court filings of criminal offenses decreased in 1994 to 629. This statistical decrease is evidence of offenderrehabilitation and accountability. A.T.T.A.C. provides a missing service to a multitude of agencies. Within the Payne County Jail, trained counselors conduct group therapy. The Department of Corrections Probation and Parole Office receives services which include clinical assessments and drug screens. Defense attorneys receive assessments and recommendations concerning their clients. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections Academy for Development and Training received assistance in writing a script for a video on alternative sentencing. The OSU Discipline Committee has received assessments and 102 reports concerning the outcome of student offenders on .campus. The A.T.T.A.C. staff has provided public service to the Association of University Chiefs of Police, Greek and Residential Life Groups at OSU, and multiple civic groups through public speaking and substance abuse education training. A.T.T.A.C. Program staff is involved nationally in developing new and innovative sentencing policy and procedure for Oklahoma. Through building awareness in Payne and Logan Counties, A.T.T.A.C. targets not only its clients, but also the general public. In April 1994, the A.T.T.A.C. Program, along with the Intermediate Sanctions Program, received the Best Prevention Program of the Year award by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. Prospects for Replication A.T.T.A.C. has tripled in size and increased its ability to serve the community in its first two years. Currently, A.T.T.A.C. is opening its fourth office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A.T.T.A.C. can be easily replicated in any community and can be modified to meet the individual needs of any criminal justice system. The success of this service depends on the support of the judicial branch and the District Attorney's Office. It also relies on public acceptance of the alternative sentencing approach.

Goals and Objectives The goals of the program are resolution and healing for victims and protection of victims and the community. The objectives to meets these goals are: legally sound investigations; victim and family cooperation with prosecution; preservation of the family unit by maintaining the child victim in the home; offender accountability and acceptance of responsibility for criminal conduct; victim-sensitive investigation and law enforcement protocols; guilty pleas without trial; evaluation prior to sentencing for offenders; offender responsibility for restitution to the victim(s) and the community; community-based treatment which is reparative to the victim and ensures community safety; and reduction of recidivism. Program Components Malheur County has a Multidisciplinary Team which includes representatives from law enforcement, the juvenile department, prosecution, parole and probation, the Children's Services Division, Adult and Family Services, Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Program, the local ministerial association, public health, mental health, an offender treatment provider, and public schools. The protocol includes investigation, prosecution, sentencing and probation policies and procedures, child fatality review, and sensitive cage review. The Team meets weekly for two hours. In the investigation protocol, investigators are required to attend special training in legally sound interview techniques and adopt the \"Sixteen Steps\" interview protocol. Investigators are directed to use particular procedures to ensure the comfort of the child. Investigators work as a team and balance forensic needs with child safety and protection factors. Investigators are familiar with the treatment program and introduce the program to the victim's family and the offender in the 104 initial interviews. Referrals are made to appropriate resources in the community, and a safety plan is developed. Offenders are required to leave the home or are arrested, if possible. In the prosecution phase, several policies are in place to address the needs of victims. Defendants who are released prior to trial are restricted from any contact with their victims or other children. Offenders are not allowed to return to the home. Diversions, no contest pleas, and Alford pleas, pleas without admission of guilt based on acknowledgment by the defendant that the State's evidence is sufficient to convict, are not allowed. Defendants must enter a plea of guilty or admit to responsibility in a juvenile court to be considered for community programming. Offenders are not considered for community treatment after conviction at trial. Offenders must give a sound factualbasis for their plea at the time of the plea. Plea bargains onlybind the State to recommend probation if the offender is accepted for treatment in the court- approved offender program. Offenders must agree to pay all costs of their own and their victim's treatment and execute the treatment contract. Persons who are pedophiles or preferential to children are too dangerous to treat in the community, and no effective treatment is available for them. Persons with lengthy criminal histories, serious drug and alcohol abuse problems, mental deficiency (personality and mental disorders, low I.Q.), and prior sexual offenses are generally not appropriate for community treatment. Evaluation for acceptance in the program must include a full battery of psychological testing. Offenders who use force, who lack a relationship with their victim, or who are in denial are not appropriate for community treatment. The probation program includes intensive monitoring by a sexual offender probation and parole specialist. Polygraphs are required, at offender expense, on a quarterly basis. Offenders must agree to a strict \"no-contact\" provision which requires that offenders have no contact whatsoever with minors. Offenders must also complete a sexual history and make full and complete disclosure of all prior sexual victims. Victims disclosed in the history are contacted, if possible, and offered treatment. Most offenders begin probation with incarceration in jail, secure electronic confinement, and/or house arrest. Offenders must regularly attend all treatment groups, follow the contract and treatment plan, obey all conditions of probation, and complete any other treatment programs required, such as drug and alcohol abuse treatment. Arousal control is only offered upon completion of the clarification process. The offender prepares a clarification and delivers it to his victim, taking full and complete responsibility for his or her offenses. Preparation of a sexual history generally takes three to six months, and clarification 10 to 36 months. Strict compliance with all conditions is required, including payment of fees and court imposed financial obligations. Offenders must continue to provide for their families and abide by the no-contact provisions. Offenders and victims are tracked through probation by the Team. The District Attomey receives input from the Team regarding release decisions, plea bargaining, sentencing, and probation revocation. Team consensus and coordination of services to victims is generally achieved. Victims are notified of and consulted with regarding all phases of the prosecution and given the opportunity for input. 105 Results and Impact Performance Measures In cases handled according to protocol, the expected results are legally sound prosecutions and cooperation by victims and their families. Performance measures include an increased number of disclosures, a decrease in recantations, decreased foster and out-of-home placements, increased investigations resulting in prosecution, increased guilty pleas, fewer trims, successful completion of probation by offenders, and a lack of recidivism among offenders. Implementation Problems and Successes This program and prosecution philosophy has evolved over time, with continual adjustments and changes. The present protocol was revised in 1993 and is undergoing revision now. This concept is being expanded to families in crisis due to a variety of factors. The Juvenile charging protocol was implemented in early 1993 and is still in the experimental stage. Prior to 1989, the Team experienced two periods when the District Attorney's Office did not participate or cooperate with the Team, resulting in almost no prosecutions. This was probably due to the failure of the prosecutor to accept the immunity provisions necessary to effect the disclosure of all prior victims. This is generally viewed as a radical and foolhardy policy, but without it the program will not be fully effective for a variety of reasons. After 1989, the number of prosecutions increased dramatically, from less than ten a year to over thirty. In 1990, over sixty cases were prosecuted. The program has been affected by lack of jail space, resulting in offenders absconding prior to trial or during probation. Most program failures are contact or treatment contract violations. No adult offenders have failed due to re-offense, although some failures due to failure to polygraph or absconding are most probably due to new offenses. In cases where the needs and concerns of the victim and family are addressed, offenders are more likely to enter a plea, be successful in treatment, and achieve clarification. Victims have suffered less trauma in the legal process with this approach, and the program has never failed to bring a victim through trial successfully. Victims want accountability above all else in most cases, and in many cases the guilty plea is a giant step towards healing. With regard to offenders, their therapists cannot address treatment and community safety issues without knowing the full extent of the Offenders' deviancy, arousal pattems, and deviant thought processes. Prior to using polygraph tests, offenders in the program disclosed an average of 1.5 victims. After polygraph tests were required, the average went up to seven to nine victims. Other implementation problems include uncooperative judges who would either incarcerate all sexual offenders or put them all in treatment; a lack of competent offender treatment programs; a lack of evaluations prior to sentencing; and mandatory sentences of incarceration which foreclose community treatment. Program staff have worked actively with other jurisdictions to 106 overcome implementation problems. Successes and Accomplishments Since 1989, approximately 200 cases have been prosecuted. Of the cases prosecuted, about 75% have resulted in a plea. Since 1989, less than fifteen cases have been dismissed outright. Of the cases going to trial since 1989, only four have resulted in non-guilty verdicts. Since 1989, no offenders placed in community treatment have reoffended. No persons who successfully completed the present offender treatment program have been prosecuted. Most offenders who fail the program do so in the early stages, and all have been incarcerated as a result. Confessions are obtained in about 50% of the cases, and in most cases in which the offender can be interviewed. The program's protocol was recognized by the Governor's Task Force on the Sexual Abuse of Children as a model protocol. Other jurisdictions have implemented all or part of the protocol and programs, and several are now using the juvenile charging protocol and reporting data. Prospects for Replication This program can easily be replicated. The requirement of full and complete disclosure is necessary for both the victim and the offender to receive the best treatment possible. Inevitably, the offender will disclose far more than the victim. Child victims are often unwilling to disclose any more than necessary to stop the abuse, they may be non-verbal or disassociative, or may lack the developmental ability to understand what happened to them. Without full knowledge of what has happened to the child, the child's therapist is handicapped and spends a great deal of time trying to determine the extent and nature of the abuse, as well as the method used by the offender to gain the child's cooperation. In the case of offenders, their therapists cannot address treatment and community safety issues without knowing the full extent of the offenders' deviancy, arousal patterns, and deviant thought processes. The primary fear of prosecutors is that an offender who has been convicted of a relatively minor crime will then disclose a much greater crime which they would be unable to prosecute. Good screening and evaluation of offenders is necessary. It is important to remember that for the most part, these are unreported crimes. They would not be prosecuted without this disclosure. Victims suffer due to lack of disclosure. Victims want accountability and appropriate punishment. They generally do not want to participate in a public trial. The reasons for this vary, but the safeguards the program employs satisfy victims. Offenders have plead guilty, are facing prison should they fail to comply, and are in a strict program. They are required to pay for the victim's treatment, and if they fail probation, further prosecution will result. In order to break the cycle of child sexual abuse, intervention and treatment services must be offered to child victims. In order to implement the program, all participants must share the philosophy and abide by the protocol. Judges must support the concept of community treatment and evaluation of offenders, and must not allow offenders to enter nolo contendere or Alford pleas. Judges must also support the concept that offenders who go to trial are not eligible for community treatment. j,:\" 107 Contact Information Patricia Sullivan District Attorney Malheur County District Attorney's Office 251 B Street West 6 Vale, OR 97918 (503) 473-5127 (503) 473-5199 fax 108 Oregon Sanctions Treatment Opportunities Progress (STOP) Drug Diversion Program Statement of the Problem Probation intake data indicates that approximately 100 offenders per month or 33% of all new cases are convicted of drug felonies. The number of drug-involved offenders is almost twice that number. Drug Utilization Forecasting (DUF) data indicates that 63% of a sample of arrestees tested positive for controlled substances. While waiting four to six months after arrest to be adjudicated and referred to a drug treatment program, the defendant is likely to continue patterns of drug use and related behaviors. In January 1990, the Multnomah County Circuit Court, faced with an increasing backlog of drug cases, instituted a fast track trial docket. Although this strategy expedited case processing, it did not address treatment with the goal of reducing recidivism. Treatment capacity in the community is limited, and expedited court processing puts even greater pressure on resources. Early intervention is desirable but difficult to accomplish. Defendants are not being referred to treatment until adjudication of the charges and assignment of a probation officer, four to six months after arrest. Even when a defendant is referred to treatment, the average waiting period to enter outpatient drug treatment is several weeks in Multnomah County. State budget reductions in the wake of a property tax limitation measure have impacted local parole and probation operations. The Department of Corrections strategic plan calls for reducing the number of offenders supervised in the community by eliminating supervision for low risk clients. Multnomah County has been forced to reduce the number of probation and parole officer positions and prioritize services for the highest risk felons. Many substance abusers will not be eligible for supervision and treatment. Before the Sanctions, Treatment, Opportunities, Progress (STOP) Drug Diversion Program was implemented, most defendants were not being ordered to drug treatment until four to six months after the arrest. Now, defendants who choose STOP enter treatment three days after the arrest. Goals and Objectives The purpose of the STOP Program is to reduce the number of drug-related crimes committed in Multnomah County and their cost to the justice system, by curtailing the demand for drugs. This will be accomplished by reducing the demand for drugs through cost effective outpatient treatment and direct involvement by the court in managing the diversion process. The program 109 addresses the standards in the State of Oregon and Portland/Multnomah County regarding drug- free babies, index crimes rates, and drug use by arrestees/probationers/parolees. The program has several objectives including to: divert to treatment up to 700 clients per year from the court drug docket and treat an average of 300 Clients from the previous fiscal year; maintain a 65% graduation rate; keep 85% of program graduates felony-free for an additional twelve months, and 90% of program graduates felony-free during a one-year period; save $184,500 in indigent defense costs; save $150,000 in police overtime for the City of Portland each year; divert 450 defendants from probation sentences which will yield a savings of three caseloads; produce an evaluation of the effectiveness of a 12-month drug treatment program using acupuncture as a method for relieving withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings; reduce substance abuse by improving treatment outcomes; reduce recidivism by improving program impacts; and obtain and disseminate program evaluation information. Program Components STOP has been recognized as a national model that joins several government and private agencies together in an effort to reduce illegal drug activity. Cooperating agencies include the Multnomah County Circuit Court, the Multnomah County District Attorney, the Metropolitan Public Defender, InAct, Inc., and Multnomah County Community Corrections. STOP's program development has been consistent with five key points supported by the literature: (1) there is a strong relationship between drugs and crime; (2) the criminal justice system can improve treatment outcomes and reduce recidivism by mandating drug treatment and establishing links with the treatment community; (3) drug abuse is a chronic condition often marked by relapse; (4) the effectiveness of treatment can be enhanced by client-treatment matching within a continuum of interventions; and (5) acupuncture can be a valuable adjunct to drug treatment. 110 Upon entry into jail, the intake officer marks a defendant's file if he/she is eligible for the program. At arraignment, the defendant is advised of his rights and given an opportunity to apply for STOP. If the defendant is interested, he/she is released to meet with the Metropolitan Public Defender on the following day, when an orientation will provide the defendant with an overview of the program, court requirements, treatment components, legal rights, and waiver of those rights. On the third day following arrest, the diversion hearing takes place. If the defendant petitions the court for program entry and is approved, the defendant is referred to treatment that day. The defendant is charged a program fee of $300 dollars. All participants are expected to pay the program fee, but some payments are handled on a case by case basis. For the remainder of the twelve months of program participation, the defendant appears at least monthly before the judge at a status hearing. These hearings are a way to hold clients accountable for their behavior and encourage their progress in treatment. In some cases defendants need more exposure to the judge, and status hearings are increased accordingly. A report of each client's progress isprepared by the treatment provider and given to the judge prior to the hearing. Clients progress through STOP by achieving satisfactory performance according to the standards agreed upon when entering the program. These standards of achievement are linked to tasks that must be accomplished in order for gi'aduation to occur including: achievement of treatment objectives; clean urine analysis; and no new felony convictions. Clients who are non-compliant can be sanctioned in court to a brief period of custody, the Community Corrections Forest Project, residential treatment, detoxification, or set for stipulated fact trial as a consequence of program failure. -- Outpatient treatment is a four-phase, 12-month program using a holistic treatment approach including: alcohol, drug and health education lectures, process groups, individual counseling, internal and external support groups, mentoring, culture and gender-specific group therapy, acupuncture, urinalysis, life skills classes, stress reduction techniques, pre-employment and placement assistance, physical examinations, basic skills and/or vocational training, and leisure skills development. Results and Impact Performance Measures The performance measurements follow the State of Oregon standards outlined in the Governor's Strategy for reducing crimes and violence. Reduce substance abuse by improving treatment outcomes. The court and I~nAct, the treatment provider for STOP, will provide the Multnomah County Department of Corrections with monthly totals of defendants diverted. The information will be compiled and provided to the Criminal Justice Services in quarterly reports. Quarterly reports will include: number of active clients in each of the program's four phases; number of clients 111 on bench warrant status; number of clients in STOP but engaged in treatment in outside agencies; number of clients employed, in school, training, or other positive activities; number of drug-free babies born to participants; and number of successful completions and unsuccessful terminations. Reduce recidivism by improving program impacts. The Multnomah County Department of Community Corrections will run a program impacts study during the year to assess the recidivism rates of program participants. Obtain and disseminate program evaluation information. As part of the regular Criminal Justice Services reporting process, the Department will provide information regarding: number of cases diverted from the regular drug trial docket in Multnomah County; number of cases completing diversion; cost savings to indigent defense, police overtime, and probation officer positions; and number of drug-free babies born. The Department will produce an impact report in June 1995 documenting: rearrest and conviction rates for program graduates and participants who were unsuccessfully terminated from the program; number of days from program graduation or termination to arrest; cost per client completing STOP; and program impacts by race and gender. Program staff will work with Criminal Justice Services and the State Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs to provide technical assistance and workshops for other Oregon jurisdictions considering a drug diversion program. Implementation Problems and Successes The STOP Program experienced implementation problems which included: balancing the critical docketing and case processing versus providing quality treatment; maintaining ongoing communication between agencies; and maintaining accurate and timely feedback to the courts. Some problems were addressed through the development of criminal justice sanctions: accessing residential beds, the Forest Project, and community service. Treatment interventions were also developed to address these problems including: residential beds, in-house detoxification, and increasing program attendance. From program inception in August 1991 through March 1995, 2,000 cases have been diverted, for an average of 45 clients per month over the 44 month period. The average daily population is about 350 clients. Successes and Accomplishments A total of $108,000 in client fees have been collected. Since 1991, the justice system has benefitted from the following avoided costs: indigent defense: 2,000 cases multiplied by $246 overtime: 2,000 multiplied by $200 savings/case equals $400,000; and probation load: 2,000 multiplied 50% success equals 1,000 probation cases avoided, the equivalent of 3 casebanks ($150,000) or 10 mixed caseloads ($560,000). Twenty drug-free babies have been born to program participants. Through March 1995, 504 or 51% of enrolled clients graduated successfully. 112 The Multnomah County Department of Community Corrections recently completed an impact study of 54 program graduates and 50 unsuccessful terminations, comparing their rates of recidivism over a 12-month period (calendar year 1993). The findings indicate a significant program impact: 15% of the graduates had at least one arrest, compared to 54% of those who terminated unsuccessfully; there were a total of 11 graduates arrested, compared to 54 arrests of those who terminated unsuccessfully; the average number of arrests per graduate was .20,, compared to .92 for unsuccessful clients; \u00b0 9% of the graduates had at least one conviction, compared to 50% of those who terminated unsuccessfully; there were a total of eight convictions of graduates, compared to 33 convictions of those who terminated unsuccessfully; the average number of convictions per graduate was .15, compared to .66 per unsuccessful client; 64% of the arrests of graduates were from felony charges, compared to 93% of the arrests of unsuccessful clients; 63% of the convictions of graduates were for felony offenses, compared to 100% of the convictions of unsuccessful clients; and the average length of time to the first arrest for graduates was 162 days, compared to 132 days for the clients who terminated unsuccessfully. Prospects for Replication STOP has been recognized as a national model that joins several government and private agencies together in an effort to reduce illegal drug activity. The program is currently being evaluated by The American University through the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), U.S. Department of Justice. To replicate this program several important steps must be taken. First, collaboration between agencies is imperative. Communication is important, and monthly meetings are highly recommended. Second, it is vital that program services are made available to the defendant immediately after being charged. Third, once the defendant has entered the program, a program fee should be established. This is an important component because the fee makes the defendant more accountable for his/her actions. 113 Contact Information Valerie Moore Executive Director InAct, Inc. 310 Southwest 4th Avenue Suite 700 Portland, OR 97204 (503) 228-9229 (503) 228-9558 fax Cary W. Harkaway - Deputy Director Multnomah County Department of Community Corrections 421 Southwest 5th Avenue Suite 600 Portland, OR 97204 (503) 248-3039 (503) 248-3990 fax 114 Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV) Statement of the Problem Battered women and children are often uninformed about community and legal resources available to escape batterers and to safeguard themselves against recurring violence and enable them to achieve protected, independent lives. When battered women have evaluated their options and elected the legal remedy best suited to their needs, they often confront complex legal issues and proceedings without the benefit of counsel. Access to the courts may be constrained and outcomes deficient without the benefit of advocacy. Prosecution, court, and legal services staff have not been able to meet the demands of battered women for legal intervention. Demand has increased exponentially over the last decade, and it has far outstripped resources. Goals and Objectives The Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV) is a non-profit agency that has engaged in advocacy on behalf of battered women and their children in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for almost 20 years. The Coalition is committed to advocacy as a principal strategy to improve the justice system and community institutions to assure that battered women and children achieve safety, autonomy, health, well-being, restoration, and justice. Legal advocacy, as undertaken by the 60 local domestic violence programs and the statewide organization, is broadly defined. It encompasses individual advocacy and systemic advocacy. The objectives of legal advocacy are many: to assure that battered women are informed about the full array of legal options available to them; to assist battered women in developing safety plans; to enable timely, effective access to the justice system; to provide support and accompaniment for battered women as they proceed through the justice system; to enhance the quality of representation of victims; and to improve the outcomes for battered women participating in all aspects of the civil and 115 criminal justice systems. Program Components Individual and systemic advocacy occur in tandem. Advocates work with individual battered women and simultaneously work to reform and upgrade the legal system. Services are provided on a case-by-case basis and determined by PCADV advocates. Advocates ask police for expedited intervention in specific high-risk households and for a system for quick response to all high-risk households. Advocates seek expanded investigation by a prosecutor into a particular crime of domestic violence, including identifying additional sources of evidence, and seek substantial reformation of the system of investigation and preparation of cases of domestic violence for plea-negotiations or trial. Advocates assist battered women in securing protective conditions on release at bail hearings and ask arraignment judges to establish protocols for the routine imposition of conditions of release in domestic violence cases. Advocates transport battered women to hearings and insist that courts provide safe, secure waiting rooms for battered women and children. Advocates familiarize individual women with the courtroom or courtroom procedures and persuade the courts or the district attorney to convene a court school for all victims of violent crime or applicants for protection orders. y Advocacy often includes assistance in preparation of petitions for civil relief, enrollment in victim notification programs, development of victims' impact and risk assessment statements, and fine- tuning practice guides for court, jail, and prosecution personnel who are responsible for processing the documents filed by victims. It also entails verifying that a protection order has been filed correctly in the statewide protection order registry so that enforcement can be effected should an individual batterer violate an order/ It involves legislative initiatives to establish a statewide registry that is available 24 hours a day. Advocacy includes helping abused women determine a proposed visitation schedule and protective provisions for a custody conciliation conference and educating custody conciliators on the need for risk assessment and attention to protected custodial access in the context of domestic violence. J Advocates monitor the practice of individual judges who have been reported to be unresponsive to the applications of domestic violence victims for protective relief, offer those judges information about the impact of domestic violence, and devise domestic violence bench guides for dissemination to all judges. Advocates assist individual battered women in sensitizing the justice and human services systems to the dangers confronting them and the. requisite interventions to safeguard women and their children. Advocates convene multidisciplinary county task forces of justice system personnel and social and medical providers to establish protocols and interface procedures. Advocates assist battered women in constructing and rehearsing safety plans both to assure protected participation in the legal arena and to buttress the legal protection provided by the courts. 116 At the State level, the PCADV engages in many activities for systemic reform. PCADV is working with the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts to develop data systems and uniform rules to fully accommodate reforms in the civil protection order statute. The program recently orchestrated a Continuing Legal Education seminar on the amendments to the statute with the Pennsylvania Bar Institute, the bar, and the bench. PCADV has taken the initiative to implement the \"full faith and credit\" provisions of the Violence Against Women Act. This project involves advocates in consultation with courts, court administrators, the bar, and advocates across the country. PCADV undertook the first statewide project to eliminate stalking in the context of domestic violence. Activities included a pamphlet for victims, a police and prosecutor protocol, a law enforcement training curriculum, and training of advocates and police officers across the Commonwealth. PCADV provides technical assistance to attorneys, judges, court administrators, prosecutors, law enforcement, and others in the justice system related to practice and policy issues. PCADV participates in impact legislation to improve justice for victims of domestic violence. It regularly advises government agencies and legislators at the State and Federal levels on matters of public policy. PCADV attempts to evaluate and intervene in any systemic practice that impinges on the safety, privacy, and well-being of battered women and children. A portion of the advocacy that emerges may not appear to be directly related tO domestic violence services, but it is public policy that significantly impinges on battered women and children. Examples of these advocacy activities follow. Several years ago, PCADV concluded that the telephone technology being offered by the industry .. (caller ID) posed great risks to the privacy and safety of battered women. Thus, staff participated in administrative hearings and two appeals in Commonwealth courts, in which PCADV prevailed, and have been active in deliberations at the FCC on these issues. PCADV has prevailed in this matter, enabling telephone safety and privacy for all users of interstate telephone services. PCADV identified insurance underwriting standards and practices that discriminated against battered women, brought them to the attention of Congress and the Pennsylvania Legislature, and are currently working with lawmakers, insurance commissioners, and health advocates across the country to put an end to these unfair insurance practices. PCADV became concerned that policymakers in the country were advancing one strategy only for the coordinated justice and community intervention against domestic violence. Staff responded by authoring two papers that reflect the variety of effective strategies now employed. The papers were distributed broadly, encouraging communities to carefully evaluate and adopt the strategy most appropriate for their respective Communities. PCADV recently noted that many courts were interested in undertaking domestic violence death reviews in order to identify inadequacies in justice system response to victims and perpetrators of domestic violence. PCADV prepared a paper enumerating goals, activities, and processes for conducting domestic violence death reviews. 117 PCADV concluded that the research community across the country was not in dialogue with the domestic violence community about research questions, ethics, agendas, analysis, and dissemination of results. Thus, PCADV initiated a network among researchers and practitioners to enhance collaboration in scholarly inquiries about a broad range of issues related to domestic violence. Particular attention has been paid to evaluation research related to justice system interventions. While the network is informal, it models the collaboration envisioned and enriches the dialogue about research and its application to practice and policymaking in the field. To ensure that advocacy is informed and strategic, PCADV provides advocates at the local level with extensive training and technical assistance. A core 40-hour curriculum is in the developmental stages. A comprehensive manual on legal advocacy has been provided to every domestic violence agency in the State. Every six weeks advocates throughout the State are fumished with a day of in-service training and networking. Beyond this, each year PCADV offers a statewide two-day conference for advocates, with members of the bar and bench collaborating in this undertaking. Results and Impact Performance Measures Evaluation of advocacy on the local and statewide level is informal. PCADV hopes to be able to interest'researchers in investigation of the efficacy' of the numerous advocacy efforts in progress. Meanwhile, the apparent merit of the work of advocates can be measured by the responsiveness of courts and other justice system personnel, as well as governmental and legislative bodies. In many communities and at the State level, domestic violence advocates are sought out as partners in efforts to end domestic violence and offer remedies in its aftermath. Implementation Problems and Successes The lack of resources to employ the necessary advocates has created the most significant barrier to implementation. Domestic violence programs operate on very small budgets. They provide many more services for less money than other human services agencies. Yet, the needs for direct services including housing, food, transportation, childcare, clothing, and counseling are monumental and increase daily. Advocacy cannot be undertaken unless these vital supportive services are in place. Many battered women cannot safely seek justice unless these fundamental services are available to create a bridge to independent living and to provide shelter and protection until legal remedies Can be implemented. Funding remains insufficient. Most advocates have no formal education in the law, in community organizing, in negotiation, or in policymaking. Thus, upon employment, domestic violence programs have the substantial responsibility of training advocates on the fundamentals of these areas and building essential advocacy skills. This takes time and resources that are in scarce supply. 118 Successes and Accomplishments Domestic violence programs have been able to maximize resources by retaining and developing advocates. Increased State and local funding over the course of the last 20 years has enabled an expansion in. the numbers of advocates engaged in legal advocacy endeavors. PCADV has assisted by availing advocates of training, both formal and informal; providing technical assistance on practice problems and policy development; and brokering resources and relationships with justice system personnel. PCADV and local programs have established close working relationships with legal services offices, batterer intervention services providers, and justice system personnel. PCADV has promoted a coordinated, collaborative community response for more than 15 years. This serves as a model for jurisdictions or arenas which may resist embracing advocacy or making the changes requisite to the safety and well-being of battered women and children. PCADV has been active in promoting many different strategies to combat domestic violence and in enumerating goals, activities, and processe s for properly conducting domestic violence death reviews. PCADV initiated a network among researchers and practitioners to enhance collaboration in scholarly inquiries about a broad range of issues related to domestic violence. Currently, there are 58 domestic violence subcontractors operating 46 shelters and 13 counseling centers. Programs provide assistance in all 67 counties in the Commonwealth. Multicultural training has been given by the PCADV Multicultural Training Team to nearly 200 representatives from PCADV programs in a regional format and over 20 programs on an individual basis. PCADV staff participated in a think tank on prevention of drug addiction in women and girls. With scholars, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from across the country, staff deliberated on effective strategies to educate and advocate for girls and women at risk, focusing significant attention on the risk that domestic violence and child abuse plays in addiction. The PCADV provided consultation to the National Center for State Courts in the development of the research instruments and process for a study investigating the protection order process in three urban locations. PCADV staff served as faculty and experts at the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges' showcasing of the model code on domestic and family violence developed by judges, attorneys, advocates, legislators, healthcare providers, and other policymakers. The Children's Advocacy Task Force (CATF) of the PCADV coordinated the annual Children's Advocacy Conference which was attended by children's advocates from across the State. PCADV staff also coordinate annual statewide and national conferences to address issues and training related to legal advocacy, victims and witnesses, and health care. Prospects for Replication Much of the structure, process, and accomplishments of these advocacy initiatives can be replicated elsewhere. Essential to replication is a belief in the critical role of advocacy in the justice system. Sufficient resources must be directed to advocacy initiatives. To fully and 119 effectively accomplish these program activities, two full-time legal advocates would be required in a jurisdiction with a population of 250,000. Staff development and opportunity to network with other legal advocates throughout the State are necessary. Finally, there must be a statewide training and technical assistance center to support the work of local advocates and to engage in advocacy and policymaking at the State level.

O'Connor Program Assistant Andrea G. Richards Program Associate Andr6a Tisi Program Assistant About the State Evaluation Development Program The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) established the State Evaluation Development Program (SED), a State-based program with an orientation toward establishing Federal, State, and local partnerships, to assist in implementing the reporting and evaluation requirements of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Through SED, BJA provides technical assistance and training to the State and local offices and agencies responsible for implementing, monitoring, and evaluating violent crime and drug control programs funded under the Drug Control and System Improvement Formula Grant Program. SED is coordinated for BJA by the Justice Research and Statistics Association (JRSA). The SED project is designed to: meet States' needs for assistance in the development of violent crime and drug control strategies, and the development of State monitoring and evaluation plans; provide technical assistance and training on program performance monitoring, assessment, and evaluation; publish reports for State and local audiences on special topic areas related to programs that work and can be replicated in other jurisdictions; and facilitate training and technical assistance meetings and workshops for State and local planners and practitioners to produce and/or transfer methods, approaches, and programs. A National Planning Group, comprised of State and local representatives from the criminal justice community provides input to the project. The National Planning Group plays a critical role in the development and implementation of the SED projects, and also plays an integral role in the development of national indicators for performance monitoring. Since 1987, JRSA has worked with BJA and the States to establish data collection and analysis projects. JRSA and the States have produced numerous reports and technical assistance products covering many criminal justice programs and themes, including: multijurisdictional law enforcement task forces; innovative rural programs; crime laboratory enhancement programs; county-level trends in drug arrests, convictions, and sentencing; State citizen surveys on drug use and control; drug offender processing; treatment, rehabilitation, and education; understanding and combatting violence; preventing violence; youth, drugs, and violence; innovative courts programs; and successful collaborative programs. The State Evaluation Development Program is a unique program that focuses primarily on enhancing States' monitoring, reporting, and evaluation capacities. States participate in all aspects of the SED project from planning and development to the implementation and delivery of technical assistance and training services. The project is designed to provide a forum for States to share information and to receive the assistance they need to develop and implement effective monitoring, reporting, and evaluation systems.
