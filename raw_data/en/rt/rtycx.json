Monthly Subscription program! Detoxing is such a wellness-y topic and it's often over complicated and done incorrectly. The long-story-short of it all is this: detoxing isn't about deprivation. Instead, it's about supporting your body's natural ability to detox while also setting some barriers around potential toxins and emphasizing healthy foods. Because it can be confusing and convoluted, I've created a 10 Day Natural Detox system for you to follow! Each day is a new way to support your body's natural ability to detox and also builds upon itself in priority order. Some things help with detox for sure, but aren't as big of a priority. Follow each step day by day and if you're feeling extra dedicated, try to continue each habit from the previous days all the way through the 10 days as well. Each of these 10 habits (for the most part) can be sustained lifelong without feeling deprived or overbearing - and THAT is always the goal with health. Everyday wellness habits that provide health from the inside out without being complicated. The 10 Day Natural Detox Plan: Day 1. Eat 2 cups of veggies Yep, THIS is where you should start. ADD nutrients to your routine so your body is fueled at a cellular level. Often time people are over fed but under nourished. We combat this by providing the body with more nutrients, not taking foods away right away. Day 2. Cut out processed and packaged foods This is an important step in the process for sure because most processed and packaged items contain inflammatory oils, artificial ingredients, and substances that don't make you feel well and don't provide health at all. By starting to limit these in your routine, you'll naturally feel like you have more energy. Day 3. Hit your water goal Don't underestimate the power of water. Being adequately hydrated is so important! Shoot for half your body weight in ounces per day. This also helps support kidney functions (hello, detoxing organ) and supports regular bowel movements by being hydrated as well. Day 4. Increase fiber to at least 25 grams per day Increasing your fiber goal to 25 grams at least allows you to feel fuller longer, supports a healthy gut microbiome, and supports proper bowel movements. Bowel movements are THE best way your body naturally detoxes. Hands down. If you're not having daily bowel movements, you're reabsorbing toxins into your system rather than excreting them. Day 5. Skip the alcohol Can't avoid this one - avoiding alcohol or limiting the consumption of it is an excellent way to support your body. Let's face it, alcohol is a toxin. There's no way around that. By removing it, we obviously are supporting our body detox (since you're not adding that toxin in) Day 6. Get moving for 20+ minutes Movement is so important for health overall, but it also supports your body at a cellular level. It helps balance blood sugar and blood pressure and can even support regular bowel movements and proper sleep. Sometimes workouts also make you sweat a lot, which is a detoxing strategy as well. Day 7. Grab a green juice Fresh juice shouldn't ever be a meal replacement, but it can be a way to get in a nutrient boost! Stick to green ones mostly for the nutrients without all the sugar that comes from juicing fruits. Day 8. Swap cleaning and beauty products for non-toxic version Again, eliminating toxins is of course a large part of detoxing. There are so many toxins that come from our beauty and cleaning products overall. Swapping them for non-toxic items is a big way to lower your overall toxin load.

Add a turmeric supplement to your routine Adding turmeric supplements into your daily supplement routine can be a great way to further decrease inflammation in your body and support your body's natural ability to detox. Turmeric contains powerful antioxidant compounds called curcumins that have been shown to lower your body's inflammation. Day 10. Try an intentional sweat If you have access at a gym or sauna studio, or even a hot Texas outdoor day (if you know, you know), try to get an intentional sweat in! Sweating helps removes toxic metals from your system as well as regulates blood pressure and leads to overall better health outcomes! This can be an advanced strategy for supporting your body overall. This list should be a great way to start focusing on supporting your body and are tangible and powerful tools to incorporating to increase health. These natural steps are effective and science-backed and don't require you to do a juice fast or any other extreme measure in the name of \"detoxing\". Those methods are often unnecessary and lead to a messed up view of health overall. Always choose the balanced, sustainable option. "}
