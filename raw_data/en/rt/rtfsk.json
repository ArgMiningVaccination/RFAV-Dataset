We will start with an interactive class where we discuss a brief history of Chinese medicine and how it differs from Western medicine. You'll be able to ask questions and see how a typical treatment happens at a local clinic (our partner, Mend Acupuncture). You'll leave the class with tips, tricks, and tools to use in your own life to better live in harmony with the seasons. After the class portion, you will have the opportunity to experience the relaxing and balancing benefits of acupuncture for yourself. Age 15+ Choose to attend the class from 1-2PM ($10), sign up for a 30-minute community acupuncture ($35), 1:00-4:00PM $10 or $35 per person "}
