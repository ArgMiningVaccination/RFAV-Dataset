By [Laura Schwalm](/experts/laura-schwalm) \u2014 Written on Aug 06, 2022 Photo: mavo / Shutterstock.com The human body contains vortexes of concentrated energy between our physical and spiritual bodies. These energy centers [are called the chakras](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/annathea-fabricius/how-open-your-chakras-comprehensive-guide). The levels of life force in our bodies have an impact on our inherent healing ability, as chi, our life force helps to nourish organs and systems of the body, supporting them in their vital functions and contributing to the healthy growth and renewal of cells. However, the amount of chi isn't always sufficiently replenished. There are many impurities that can block energy channels known as [Nadis](https://www.yogiapproved.com/nadis-101/). Blocks and imbalances consist of energy forms we created from our own behaviors. [Spiritual imbalances](https://www.yourtango.com/2020333224/spiritual-practices-good-mind-body-and-spirit) of self-limiting thoughts and motives constitute the bulk of most energy blocks. The subtle and physical bodies are linked together by etheric matter. Virtually anything that affects one automatically affects the other; thus, physical impurities such as body toxins caused by an unhealthy diet, drugs, tobacco, alcohol, nervous tension, etc., cause corresponding obstructions in the subtle body as well.

This is when we become weaker and more susceptible to illness, disease, premature aging, and even physical death because our life force is low and not circulated properly throughout the body. This \"energy\" is the primal source of all forms of energy and manifests itself in various frequencies. Your level of consciousness (awareness) determines the frequencies of chi you are capable of receiving and storing. Every imbalance, disease, or disorder, a person manifests, feeds on negative thoughts and feelings. The more density there is in your mind, the more fuel your body has to degenerate. The first step towards healing is to set the intention that you are ready to get better. The next step is learning to understand your blocks and the behaviorisms which manifest from them. Healing should encompass every aspect of your being, including your physical health and fitness, emotional well-being, mental attitude, energetic welfare, and spiritual strength. It is important to understand that your body is self-healing and with the right knowledge and conscious action you can heal not just your physical body but your life.

To heal, you need to change your thoughts, feelings, and actions from sabotaging to fruitful and empowering. Whatever part of the body is experiencing a problem, needs to be looked at, as a metaphorical representation of the challenges you are dealing with in your life. As a master psychic healer, I see a lot of clients, who change their lives and let go of problems, when they begin to understand the interconnection between their ways of living and the problem they are experiencing. Your body is your teacher. It gives you opportunities to learn and expand. Once you have learned your lessons, it heals because there is no need to keep holding onto the pain any longer. Our bodies teach us spiritual lessons to evolve our consciousness into Christ's consciousness. Personally learning through intimate experiences of love, compassion, forgiveness, courage, and much more. [Healing takes you](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/polly-wirum/top-eight-practices-that-lead-to-spiritual-transformation) through many different stages and layers of discovering who you are. Sometimes, change happens quickly, at other times slower. Healing occurs on many levels; physically, mentally, emotionally, and energetically. So, be patient with your process.
