From that humble beginning, Buies Creek Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961), and Campbell Univers ity (1979). Throughout these transformations, the institution has remained true to its founding principles to address the most pressing needs of North Carolina and to educate men and women for Christian service and leadership around the world. The Univer sity enjoys an autonomous and voluntary relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. The founding principles still guide Campbell University today. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new medical school in over 35 years. In August 2016, the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing - housed within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences - welcomed its first cohort. Simultaneously, Campbell opened its School of Engineering , which was only the second engineering school at a private university in North Carolina.

Following review, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. If the test result is positi ve (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of members of the MSBS Admissions Committee to review the test results and the application for admission. Controlled substance screening results is viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in som e states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of Un iversity policy. By signing the attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in the CUSOM MSBS Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM MSBS promises he/she is not currently using, and that he/she will not use while a CUSOM MSBS student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina.

After -Care Process If the CUBIT -SOM decision is upheld or accepted by the student, the following procedures will occur: MSBS-1 and MS BS-2 Students: Will be followed by the Office of Student Affairs at CUSOM o Given the committee recommendations, Student Affairs will make contact once or more per month to ensure the student is in compliance Depending on recommendations, if the student is not in compliance (e.g., missing required appointments), they are given one warning and attempt to comply with the recommendations If the student is found in non -compliance again, the committee will be notified and will re -examine the case prior to the end of the block o Each month, a report is generated regarding progress , and kept in a secure file storage system that all committee members will be ab le to access. 4.5 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controlled substance screening is becoming mandatory at many healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care, either as a learner or as a staff member. In light of this development, a controlled substance screening test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substances , prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, is required before matriculation into CUSOM MSBS . Additional screening and/or confirmatory tests quired as determined by CUSOM MSBS. CUSOM MSBS reserves the right to require controlled substance testing and/or a psychiatric evaluation on any student when there is an incident of erratic or unusual behavior, or there is a reasonable concern due to a student's behavior, appearance or performance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, illicit substances , and controlled substances (defined as a drug or substance that is li sted in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medications without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Please note this also includes substan ces which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, but which may be legal in other states. 37 For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such , the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. 4.6 Exercise and Fitness CUSOM MSBS students have access to all Campbell University rec reational facilities, which include: Student Fitness Center, Aquatic Center, Running and Walking Track, Keith Hills Golf Course, Tennis Courts, Carter Gym, Cross Country Course, Disc Golf Course and other recreational facilities.

Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during your education is critical to the training of health professionals . It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM MSBS . All CUSOM MSBS students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM MSBS students speak or act as private persons, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University . As citize ns engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom .

The law states that a person with a \"disability\" is : \"Someone with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairment; or a person who is regarded as having such an impairment.\" (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973) 42 Equal educational opportunity means that a person with a disability who is qualified for admission must have access to the same university programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportunity, Campbell will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activit y or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . Under the provisions of Section 504, universities may not discriminate in the recruitment, admission, educational process, or treatment of students. Students who have self -identified, provided document ation of disability, and requested reasonable accommodations are entitled to receive approved modifications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educational programs and ac tivities. Section 504 specifies that universities may not limit the number of students with disabilities admitted, make preadmissions inquiries as to whether or not an applicant has a disability, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure th e academic qualifications of students with disabilities because special provisions were not made, exclude a qualified student with a disability from any course of study, or establish rules and policies that may adversely affect students with disabilities . In support of its commitment to provide equal educational opportunity, Campbell provides a variety of services and accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Campbell University's Student Guide for Accessing Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or comments about this manual should be directed to Laura Rich, Director of Student Success /ADA/504 Compliance Officer . Laura Rich Student Services, MSBS Students with Disabilities Section I - Who to Contact Students with documented disabilities who desire modifications or accommodations must contact the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs : Jennifer Parrish, MEd, LPCA CUSOM Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine Hall of Medical Sciences, Room 115 (910) -893-1846 jparrish@campbell.edu No accommodations will be made without approval through the University's process. A medical, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disability if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A disability may be temporary or ongoing . 43 Section II: How to Obtain Services General Proc edure for Receiving Accommodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Director of Student Affairs to request services as soon as possible . The University is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities and is not required to provide services unless proper procedures have been followed in making a request . Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Director of Student Affairs, who consults with the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer to provide documentation of the disability and to complete the appropriate paperwork . Step 3: The Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting documentation , if needed . The process of review depends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions regarding accommodations are made on a case -by-case basis. There is no standard accommodation for any particular disability. CUSOM will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . Step 4: If the request for accommodation s is approved, the Director of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) document ing the student's individual, approved accommodations. The Office of Students Affairs coordinates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accommo dations are not approved is encouraged to meet with the Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Director may discuss the grievance procedure with the student at this time . Additional Information Regarding Documentation and Accommodations For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provides accommodations and/or modifications to policies and practices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The purpose of accommodations is not to ensure success, but rather to provide access and equal educational opportunity . Accommodations are not provided retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date that approval is given. Even if the student can establish that he or she had a disability at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re - examine coursework completed before the student was reviewed and approved for accommodation . 44 No student is requir ed to disclose his or her disability to the university. However, as discussed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommodations after he or she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed b efore the approval for accommodations was made . Documentation of a student's disability is only shared with relevant CUSOM faculty, staff or administration on a need -to-know basis with a release of information signed by the student . Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, guiding individu als with impaired vision, alerting individuals to an impending seizure or protecting individuals during one, and alerting individuals who are hearing impaired to intruders, or pulling a wheelchair and fetching dropped items\". Providing comfort or support d oes not qualify an animal as a service animal. If there are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Complianc e Officer . In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and may attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable behavior while on campus. The owners of disruptive and aggre ssive service animals may be asked to remove them from university facilities. If the improper behavior happens repeatedly, the owner may be told not to bring the service animal into any facility until they take significant steps to mitigate the behavior . Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfort and relieve symptoms of mental health disorders. The CUSOM Director of Student Affairs can provide further information. Emotional support animals are not allowed in other campus buildings, includin g classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accommodation and will be included in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM . Cleanliness of any animal living or working on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean and dispose of all animal waste . 45 Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Fami ly Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information\", Campbell University wil l release information only with the student's written consent and will use \"Directory Information\" in the best interests of the student . CUSOM is committed to ensuring all information compiled concerning a student remains confidential as required by applic able law. Any information monitored or collected is used for the benefit of the student . Only those faculty and staff members of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accomplishing necessary tasks for the student. Any information gathered is not released to third parties except in accordance with state and federal law . A student must give written authorization to release information when he/she wishes to share it with others. The student must specify the information to be released, the purpo se of the release, and to whom the information is to be forwarded. This release may be handwritten, or a form from CUSOM Office of Student Affairs may be used . Section III: Student Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to t he Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accommodations. CUSOM MSBS is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities or for contacting such students to begin the accommodation request process . 2. Provide documentation which conforms to the university's guidelines. If the student's documentation is insufficient for any reason, the student is responsible for pursuing whatever additional documentation is required and to pay any costs thereof. CUSOM reserves the right not t o provide services or accommodations until all of the documentation specified in the guidelines is provided . 3. Any student approved for accommodations is responsible for retrieving his or her Letter of Accommodation (LOA) and Release of Information Form from the Director of Student Affairs or available at : https://cuweb.wufoo.com/forms/cusom -release -of-information/ 46 Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education. It is very important that testing information be shared with this office in a timely manner . At the beginning of the semester , and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education all approved testing accommodation s. This discussion should address the questions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education will provide the testing accommodations. The student should make sure to have a calendar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education of their need for accommodations at least one week prior to each test/exam . If at any time you feel that the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, or the Department of Cl inical Affairs is not adequately meeting your accommodations, discuss this with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or Department of Clinical Affairs and the Director of Student Affairs immediately . Remember, the Office of Assessm ent, Accreditation and Medical Education is only required to provide accommodations specifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation . Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maint ain state -issued handicap parking permits. The student is also required to purchase an appropriate parking sticker from parking administration . If a student has consistent problems finding necessary handicapped parking near his/her class buildings, notify the Director of Student Affairs and parking administrator immediately . 47 Section IV: Documenting a Disability General Documentation Guidelines To ensure that reasonable and appropriate services and accommodations are provided to students with disabilities, students requesting such accommodations and services must provide current documentation of their disability. Such documentation generally must include the following : a clear diagnostic statement of the disability prepared by a licensed professional a description of the manner in which the disability limits the student in a specified major life activity and the severity of the limitation It is the responsibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to document the disability. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursuant to these guidelines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current s upporting documentation for review at that time. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to supplement documentation, but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone . Guidelines for Documenting a Learning Disability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, and be comprised of the following elements : Evaluator Information : The name, title, and credentials of the qualified professional who conducted the assessment should begin th e report. Please note that members of the student's family are not considered appropriate evaluators . Recent Assessment : The report must provide adequate information about the student's current level of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or complete assessment. Testing : There should be a discussion of all tests that were administered, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), and/or a 504 plan may help to supplement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insuffi cient documentation when presented alone . 48 In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful. The summary should integrate the elements of the battery with background information, observations of the client during the testing situ ation, and the student's current academic situation. This summary should present evidence of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disability diagn osis. It should also demonstrate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning problem. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discussed. This summary may include recommend ed accommodations, but these are in no way binding to the University. CUSOM reserves the right to evaluate all documentation and determine appropriate accommodations in each case . Section V: Grievance Procedure All requests for accommodations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs. Problems with approved accommodations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs . If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs, the student and the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs should forward the complaint to the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer for an informal resolution. The Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Comp liance Officer will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Director of Student Affairs within ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint . In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint w ith the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer within ten (10) business days of rece iving the complaint . In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the issue involves denial of an academic accommodation . Students are al so encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed . 49 5. ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES 5.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM is a student -centered institution. As such, all administrators will be accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Additionally, the Director of Postba ccalaureate Studies programs will strive to have formal meetings on a regular basis. The Academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The advisor/advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. This relationship endeavors to create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. Significant personal or behavioral health problems are referred to the Behavioral Health Services for assessment and potential referral for counseling. Students on Academic Probation will meet with academic advisors or the Academic Center for Excellence at least twice a month, or as may be required by the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. Faculty also meet with non-assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty publish office hours , and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating at CUSOM MSBS , students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate advising effectiveness. 5.2 CUSOM Tutoring Program The program is to help students requesting tutoring service (tutees) become more proficient in subject materials and more efficient as independent learners across a broad range of courses through individual, peer tutoring sessions.

It is essential each student makes every effort not to miss any examination or quiz . Requests for make -up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with the instructor . With the exception of faculty lectures, students with approved absences must contact the Course Director(s) in a timely manner to 1) notify them of their absence and 2) arrange any necessary make -up requirements for missed course activities (e.g., labs, presentations, peer review sessions, etc.).An unexcused absence from an examination, quiz, laboratory, lecture or assignment may result in a grade of zero (0) for that exercise. Official Holidays CUSOM observes the following University holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas (Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. https://www.campbell.edu/faculty -staff/human -resources/university -perks/ Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM MSBS student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM MSBS student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he or she should advise the Office of Postbaccalaureate Studies as soon as possible. Consequences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee may be consider non-compliance of the Attendance Policy by MSBS students as a violation of CUSOM policy and result in disciplinary action. APPS actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organization or student government office . In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 54 Severe Weather Policy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules or dining option changes, a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and www.campbell.edu/cusom , Facebook, Twitter, and through our inclement weather line: On campus : dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: dial 910-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 5.4 Dress Code Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, or workshops. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for Gross Anatomy labs. Students do not need to maintain professional attire after the normal end of the school day, Monday through Friday, or on weekends, except when notified by the school administration . A clean and well-cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length (no higher than 2\" above the knee when sitting) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Hairstyles should be clean and neat, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unacceptable. Beards and mustaches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body piercings are not acceptable. Shorts, jeans, T-shirts are not permitted . Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students who have tattoos must ensure they are covered at all times on-campus, and during clinical experiences . Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus o r t h e i r c l i n i c a l r o t a t io n and not return until appropriately attired. Any class missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Postbaccalaureate Studies , whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. 55 Additional Dress Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended . Close -toed shoes and long pants are required. F lip- flops, open toe shoes, shorts or spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy labs. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where students may store their gross clothes. Students must provide their own locks. Leave all of your personal belongings in a locker versus stacking them in the 4th floor lobby outside the laboratory. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). The course syllabi may provide additional requirements. 56 5.5 Global Assessment Throughout the C U S O M M S B S curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. The Exec utive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 5.6 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine: -standards.pdf The Review Committee (IRC, a subcommittee of the CUSOM Curriculum Committee), the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM M S B S curriculum as part of the institutional approval process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award Associate, Baccalaureate, Masters, Education Specialist, and Doctorate degrees. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Board of Trustees of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges reviewed the materials seeking approval of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree program. It was the decision of the Board to approve the program and include it in the scope of the current accreditation and to advance the institution to Level VI.\" 57 Campbell University is one of only three private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC, the others being Duke University and Wake Forest University. CUSOM MSBS Credit Calculation The CUSOM M S BS curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Semester of study with a designated number of weeks per Semester . CUSOM M S B S assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours with 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards . Credit Review Process CUSOM MSBS assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM M S B S awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM MSBS reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee ( IRC), a subset of the Curriculum Committee, and also the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. 58 For proposed non-substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs , or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary and finally by the M S B S Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed change s are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree -granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. Grading CUSOM M S BS has developed and publicized a system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effective performance. Students must complete all required coursework with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review. CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale Year -1 and Year -2Courses QualityPoints Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 C*b 70 2.0 F <70 0.0 P 70 4.0 P*b 70 2.0 a The maximum percentage cannot exceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth f rom 0.50 upwards, therefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful remediation of an initial failing grade. 59 Remediation Students must compl ete all required coursework with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possi ble disciplinary action. Students who fail any part of the curriculum may be offered remediation . A student in the first or second year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportu nity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete . The student will receive a gr ade of C* for a graded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The * will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation . PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND I S A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION . Grade Point Average (GPA), Quality Points and Class Rank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. In both years of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum, most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA . No grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs c ertifies to the Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration of a grade change only after the APPS Committee has met . NOTE: \"F\" grades: A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs , however, maintains a listing of previously satisfied F grades in courses and will report such grades to the APPS Committee as needed for assessment of the student's overall academic performance and progress. Students who fail to su ccessfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be 60 given for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an aster isk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course . Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM MSBS is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and no (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three -hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points . Class Rank Students will be provided their class rank at the end of the first and second academic year. Class ranks are calculated at the end of each academic Semester after all final grades have been submitted in years one and two. Class ranks are provi ded for informational purposes only, and are only released to the student. The class rank has no direct correlation to the student's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all courses are calculated into the cumulative GPA throughout the program . Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across all four semesters . For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achieved higher numerical grade s in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in Anatomy while Student 6 earned a grade of 93% in Anatomy) . Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment Plan summarizes additional me thods and metrics that are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled and random intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, are in written and/or verbal exam format. Grading For Years One and Two Evaluation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM MSBS recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to : i. Integrated written examinations ii. Laboratory practical examinations iii. Quizzes iv. Other (e.g., Presentations , Projects) 61 Each category is represented within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A course can be comprised of any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Associat e Dean for Biomedical Affairs . Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified previously, yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM MSBS recognizes the following approach to testing and grading : Integrated exams typically occur four times in each Semester in years 1 and 2. Quizzes are typically administered each Monday of the MSBS curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lectures given in the specified preceding week . The total percentage value of quizzes towards the total grade should not exceed the maximum identified above . Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty; Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points possible . Grades are defined by the course -grading plan approved prior to start of the course. As such, bonus points are not permitted . In rare instances, there may be exc eptions to the established Grading Policy, which require justification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive thei r course grades . 5.7 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's grade status at any time within a given academic Semester of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM MSBS approved activities, such as confere nces, student organizations, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be considered . Academic progress for st udents in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Semesters , successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Semesters , passing all components of the end -of-year testing, and meeting the requirements as set forth by t he Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for students in a Modified Course of Study. Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and administration . 62 Students who experience difficulty successfully completing elements of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Course of Study) . Students plac ed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full -time status. Students who do not follo w the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modified Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or dismissal from CUSOM MSBS . 5.8 Modified Courses of Study A Modi fied Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing , individual ized study plan for students w ho require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as required remediation, illness, le aves of absence, or withdrawals. The Modified Course of Study will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and approved by the APPS Committee. Students on a Modified Course of Study must agree to and comply with the conditions and schedule of the Modified Course of Study . Students not follow ing the individualized plan may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student ) at any time. 5.9 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Co mmittee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM MSBS academic program . The APPS Committee meets at the end of any Semester to review students who have achieved a failing course, failed to successfully remediate a failed course , when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or when deemed necessary. The Chair of the APPS Committee or the appropriate Associate De an for the academic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by leaves of absence or other factors . Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situation s where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism ), violations of the Honor Code or Code of Misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. The APPS Committee is composed of following voting members: Associate Dean for Biomedical Af fairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Chief of Operations, Executive Director of Medical Education, Assessment and Accreditation, a minimum of four (4) faculty members appointed by the Dean (to include clinical and biomedical faculty) , and one Regional Dean if possible. This membership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar, Director of Student Affairs and the Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies participate as ex officio members. A quorum is defined as a simple majority of the members present. The 63 committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite non -voting members to attend. As this is not considered a legal hearing and is instead an academic proceeding, atto rneys or other representatives are not allowed . Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting APPS Committee meetings are held at the end of each Semester , after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades, or as needed. Reasons for an APPS Committee hearing include, but are not limited to, if a student has : Failed a course Attempted and failed to remediate a course Failed to pass any course while on Academic Probation Violated the CUSOM Honor Code Violated any CUSOM or Campbell University policy/procedure Failure to make academic progress , or follow directives set forth , in an assigned remediation plan, and/or any Modified Course of Study Failed controlled substance screening test Adverse findings on criminal background check . APPS Committee Procedures for Academic Performance Matters The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee have the following roles : The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary . The Associate Dean may submit a written or oral report documenting assistance that th e student has received or been offered, including but not limited to tutoring or advising . The Course Director, Department Chair, or the student's Faculty Advisor may be asked by the APPS Committee to comment on student performance and related topics, as n ecessary . The Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies may report on documentation that the Office of Postbaccalaureate Studies may have, and which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar will be available as ex officio to discuss th e academic record if needed . The APPS Committee Chair shall identify a recording secretary for minutes and to ensure all communication occur in a timely mann er. Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is given the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute presentation of any issues or considerations that they wish to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then direct questions to the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. In lieu of an in - person presentation, the student has the option to submit a written document, no more than two pages, single -spaced . All aspects of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential in perpetuity . 64 For students deemed to not be making academic progress including , but not limited to, multiple grades of IC in one semester or across more than one semester , failure of a course, or failure to successfully complete any curricular requirements, the APPS Committee may impose a sanction i ncluding , but not limited to , any combination of the following : Award a satisfactory grade (70%) and promotion to the next Semester following satisfactory remediation Require remediation, further coursework, or repeat of courses Place or extend the student's term on Academic Probation Remove a student from Academic Probation Remove a student from clubs/organizations or leadership roles Require more frequent meetings with A c a d e m i c C e n t e r f o r E x c e l l e n c e o r faculty advisors for students on Academic Probation Specify a timeline or manner in which any remediation must occur Request further assessment prior to making sure the student has the ability to make satisfactory progress including but not limited to, psychological evaluations, controlled substance or alcohol screening /testing, or other evaluations. Such testing will be at the student's expense. Require to repeat multiple courses in which the student initially earned a failing grade Assign a Modified Course of Study which may delay promotion and graduation until satisfactory progress through a directed remediation program has occurred Make a recommendation for removal of Suspension The APPS Committee may also recommend to the Dean Suspension or Dismissal with or without the option to repeat the academic year of a student when the student demonstrates that he/she is unable to make academic progress due to , but not limited to, any combination of the following : Multiple failures in a Semester A failing grade on a Modified Course of Study Failure of any course while on Academic Probation Any other issues deemed relevant. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the APPS Committee meeting and any applicable sanctions. Upon notification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decision , or signing the Notice of Decision to appeal the decision . An appeal must be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the heari ng, and be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of notification . The Dean will normally reply within fourteen (14) working days o f receiving the written appeal. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) calendar days of notifica tion, the APPS Committee recommendation is final. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern on the seventh (7th) day after notification will not be considered, and the decision of the APPS Committee is deemed final. 65 The Dean does not meet with the student prior to receiving the required written appeal material . The Dean's decision is final. Procedures for Non-Academic Matters Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, professor, adjunct profe ssor or preceptor. For issues arising from Honor Code or Code of Misconduct violations, a violation of any CUSOM policy, or professionalism violations, the person(s) identifying the issue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Director of Student Affairs and the respective Associate Dean (Biomedical or Clinical) in a timely manner, preferably within seven (7) calendar days of the incident. The Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies or Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will collect all documentation which m ay be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include a written report from faculty or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are reporting the suspected violation, unless required at a hearing, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained, and the Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies or Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will present the reporting student's testimony . Dated notes are taken to describe the discussion. The Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies or As sociate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected misconduct or violation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduc t, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. Ad Hoc Committee Procedures If referred to an ad hoc Committee , the Ch air of the ad hoc Committee will notify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") and schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee. This hearing typically is held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the ad hoc Committee. The Respondent(s) shall meet with the ad hoc Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain him/herself an d offer any mitigating factors. Although the hearing's purpose is fact -finding, the Respondent(s) shall have the right to solicit ad vice and to offer witnesses to support his/her position. All sessions of the ad hoc Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons pr esent at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. 66 The testimony of each witness is given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. After the ad hoc committee concludes the investigation, they shall provide a written report to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs in a timely manner, that shall include a recommended finding of facts, and if the finding of facts is that a violation occurred, a recommended sanction. If the recommendations are that: 1. No violation occurred, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs may accept the finding and so notify the Respondents(s); 2. No violation occurred and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees, he/she shall decide upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below and notify the Respondents(s), or forward the matter to the APPS for further consideration; 3. A violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs agrees with the finding and the sanction, so notify the Res pondents(s). 4. A violation occurred, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs disagrees with the sanction, he/she shall decide upon an appropriate sanction as set forth below and notify the Respondents(s), or forward the matter to the APPS for further consideration on the sanction only. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs notifies the student in writing of his/her decision and: 1. If the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is No. 2, 3, or 4 above without a referral to the APPS Committee, and the Respondents(s ) accepts the decision, the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs shall be final; or 2. If the decision of Vice Dean for Academic Affairs is No. No. 2, 3, or 4 above, and the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs has not referred the matter to the APPS Committee, the Respondent(s) has the right to appeal the decision to the APPS Committee. APPS Committee Procedures If there is a referral by the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs or an appeal by the Respondent(s) to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee will notify the Respondent(s), and schedule a hearing with the Committee. This hearing typically is held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the APPS Committee. The recommendations of the ad hoc committee and/or the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs are presented to the APPS Committee at the hearing. The Respondent(s), shall meet with the APPS Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him/herself. 67 All sessions of the Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committe e does in its official report on the case. The testimony of each witness is given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. The Committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided the evidence is relevan t to the question before the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with taking evidence. Timeframes for investigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstances w arrant. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. The decision of the APPS Committee shall be sent to the Respondent(s) in writing within seven (7) calendar days of the APPS decision. The Respondent(s) may accept the decision of the APPS Committee or appeal the decision to the Dean. An appeal to the Dean must be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the ad hoc Committee, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or the APPS Committee at the time of the hearing and be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of notification. The Dean will normally reply within fourteen (14) working days of receiving the written appeal. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) calendar days of notification, the decision rendered by the Vice Dean for Academic Affair s is final . An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern on the seventh (7th) day after notification will not be considered, and the decision rendered by the APPS Committee is final. The Dean does not meet with the student prior to re ceiving the required written appeal material . The Dean's decision is final . Rights of the Respondent With respect to an alleged violation of the student Honor Code or the Code of Misconduct, the Respondent(s) is guaranteed the right to : a prompt hearing if requested notice of the charges a reasonable amount of time to prepare for his/her hearing be presumed innocent until proven guilty solicit advice appeal expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential manner 68 Deliberation of the ad hoc Committee or the APPS Committee shall take place in private and remain confidential, and the standard for a decision shall based on be a preponderance of the evidence (whether a violation is more likely than not). If, based upon a preponderance of the evi dence, the ad hoc Committee recommends, or the APPS Committee determines, the student was in violation of the Honor Code or the Code of Misconduct, a CUSOM policy, or the professional standards of CUSOM, the ad hoc Committee may recommend or the APPS Commi ttee may render an appropriate sanction including, but not limited to: Admonition : A verbal or written warning. Admonitions will not become a part of the student's longitudinal record . Admonition may not be reviewed or appealed by the student . Academic Sanction : Writing a paper, reduction of grade on an examination, assignment, or course; repetition of a course(s); being assigned additional clinic or laboratory activities or coursework; repeating an exam, coursework or even an entire academic year or sem ester or other appropriate penalties . Academic Probation : Students may be placed on Academic Probation for a specified time period, until the deficiency is rectified , or otherwise designated by the Dean . The record of each student on Academic Probation is reviewed to evaluate the student's academic progress. Academic Probation appears on the transcript, along with the date the Ac ademic Probation was rectified. Conduct Probation : A penalty levied for a specified time period, determined by the circumstances of the case. It carries with it a warning that any further violations of CUSOM regulations will result in more serious disciplinary action . Students on conduct probation may be required to do all electives in the Cam pbell system. Disciplinary Probation : A penalty for a specified time period determined by the circumstances of the case. This is the most severe penalty under which a student may remain at CUSOM MSBS . Disciplinary Probation will result in a warning that fu rther violations may be cause for disciplinary Suspension or expulsion. A record of disciplinary probation remains part of the student's longitudinal record in the Office of Postbaccalaureate Studies. Suspension : This penalty may be imposed for continued o r flagrant violation of the Disciplinary Probation terms, or it may be imposed directly in first - offense cases that warrant such action. In the case of Suspension, the student is barred from all campus and non -campus activities . Ineligibility for election or removal from student office or organizational office for specified period of time . Withholding of official transcripts, barring re -admission to CUSOM MSBS if Dismissed , or prohibiting a student from enrolling for a specified period of time . Restitution, whether monetary or by specific duties, or reimbursement for damages to or misappropriation of CUSOM MSBS , student, staff or faculty property . Any student may be placed on Suspension pending an investigation into conduct violations, including Title IX violations . 69 Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student are also civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the studen t leaving CUSOM MSBS , grades are assigned in accordance with the CUSOM MSBS grading policy . In addition to sanctions described above, the following actions may also be taken by the Dean in an appeal : Withdrawal: Withdrawal is the administrative removal of a student from a class or from CUSOM MSBS and may be imposed in instances of unmet financial obligations to CUSOM MSBS. The withdrawn student may also be barred from re-enrollment until specific conditions have been met. Dismissal from the program without the option to return. Revocation of Degree: The revocation of the Master of Science in Biomedical Science degree may occur for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean . Special Meetings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, or has been on Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action is required . 5.10 Withdrawal/Leave Procedures All requests for withdrawal must be made in writing to the office of the Director of Postbaccalaureate Studi es and adhere to the following steps : A voluntary withdrawal is requested in writing through the Office of the Director of Postbaccalaureate Studies . The student must complete a Withdraw/Separation Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM MSBS issued items to the Office of the Registrar before the student will be considered Withdrawn in Good Standing . The date for a voluntary withdrawal is the date of the student's written request . Upon receipt of the completed Change of Status Form and CUSOM MSBS issued items, the student is voluntarily Withdrawn in Good Standing from CUSOM MSBS and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readmission or an official transcript if requested . A pre -approved leave of absence less than six (6) months in duration requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM MSBS issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the leave of absence . Addition ally, students on Suspension may not Withdraw. Students failing a course, though, may possibly be permitted to Withdraw prior to the start of the last exam or assessment event of the course they may be failing. A student may not Withdraw if a grade has b een assigned or if a final examination has been started. 70 The Dean makes the final decision regarding withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM MSBS , for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal/Separation Form. Medical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 ca lendar days. Decision s regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A medical leave of absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, after which it will become a medical withdrawal . A Medical Leave of Absence extending more th an 180 calendar days will require the student to file a Medical Withdrawal . In order to return from medical leave, the student must supply documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full time student in the curriculum. T he Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, withdrawal, or has been on suspension to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additiona l action is required . Medical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medical reason for medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. Students may apply for re -admission through the CUSOM MSBS Admissions process if granted a Medical Withdrawal, but are not guaranteed a seat in a future class. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academi c Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance . The committee will also determine the placement in the curriculum for all students who have withdrawn for medical purposes and are in good academic standing. All current or former students returning from an appro ved period away from CUSOM MSBS , such as a leave of absence or an offer to repeat an academ ic year, min imally must submit an updated resume , Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM MSBS , but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re -admi ssion. 71 Military Withdrawal Military Withdrawal is granted to students whose military orders may require a period of absence from the academic program when they are called to extended active duty. Readmission is guaranteed pending proof of compliance with the Technical Standards , background check, substance abuse screening, and the CUSOM Honor Code . If the student returns within two years, they will be placed in the curriculum as close to their current position as possible in order to provide them the appr opriate continuum in the curriculum and the training required to be successful, competent, and able to perform well in the remainder of the curriculum . For students with a military leave of two or more years, the request to return will be reviewed on a cas e-by-case basis. In any case, the student will not be charged any additional tuition from their original obligation. The Dean, Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will meet with the individual student to determine the appropriate curriculum to be completed in the remainder of the degree program that will bring the student to a competency level equal to his or her peers. Personal Withdrawal Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM MSBS for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM MSBS for personal reasons are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes and be in good academic standing, complete all paperwork and follow all CUSOM MSBS procedures during the withdrawal process . Administrative Leave of Absence An Administrative Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. An administrati ve leave may not last longer than 180 calendar days as deemed appropriate and necessary. An Administrative Leave of Absence is rare and is present to address such situations as a death of a spouse, child, or such other severe circumstance that would interr upt a student's education. The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who has taken an approved extended leave, withdrawal, or has been on suspension to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and t o determine if any additional action is required . Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution and during this period students are not considered \"active\" and may not be eligible for financial aid. The duration of the Sus pension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee. Students may be assigned independent studies during Suspension to remain current; however, these independent studies do not replace course attendance or other requirements. While on Suspension, students are 72 not eligible for financial aid and should not represent themselves as CUSOM MSBS students. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled and the period of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student may be dismissed from CUSOM MSBS . Students on Suspension may not Withdraw. Dismissal Dismissal from CUSOM MSBS is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean . Unofficial Withdrawal Any student who ceases to maintain adequate academic attendance in CUSOM MSBS or leaves without withdrawing officially will be considered for an Unofficial Withdrawal and receive a grade of \"W\" for each course . General Withdrawal Failure to complete a Change of Status Form and to obtain the required signatures will result in a hold placed on all academic records . o Tuition refunds will be based upon the schedule shown under the section on Refund Policy o For any withdrawal, voluntary or involuntary, CUSOM MSBS recognizes and follows the date of determination as defined by the U.S. Department of Education in its Code of Federal Regulations . For any withdrawal, voluntary or involuntary, the student must return the following to Student Affairs at the time of d eparture : o CUSOM MSBS Identification card o Campbell University parking decal o All CUSOM -supplied computers and peripherals including, but not necessarily limited to, laptops, and chargers o Any other CUSOM -supplied items Withdrawal must be completed no later th an two (2) business days prior to the end of a course or clinical rotation. Failure to withdraw by this date will result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Semester , or for that rotation, which will adversely affect the student's GPA . Withdrawal from a course after an exam or last assessment event has been administered and/or a rotation completed, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F . In instances when the Dean extend s an offer of readmission, that offer may be rescinded if the student fails to provide requested documentation and written acceptance of terms in a timely manner as defined in the offer . NOTE : Although different categories of Withdrawal are identified, th e student transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal . 73 5.11 Graduation Requirements The degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who : Have satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation ; Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character ; Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM MSBS and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic program .

The four (4 ) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or other leaves of absence . Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success . Students may be dismissed from CUSOM MSBS if any of these competencies are not met . In addition, the revocation of the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean . A CUSOM MSBS student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual course directors, and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the initial hearing and deliberation. The Dean makes the determination on any appeal of the Dean's recommendation, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the Dean at the time of his or her decision . Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit forms in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM MSBS students must attend the exit process and commencement program in order to receive a diploma . Upon passage of all requirements as delineated in the Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Master of Science in Biomed ical Sciences degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation . 74 5.12 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is Suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course fai lure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, they will be placed on a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) which delay s the student's graduation date. Voluntary course withdrawals, temporary leaves of absence or suspensions secondary to academic, admin istrative suspensions may also cause a delay in graduation . Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based financial aid. In addition, placement in a Modified Course of S tudy may impact the student's ability to participate in graduation . Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the Office of Postbaccalaureate Studies and the University's Office of Financial Aid for these or other indicated situations . 5.13 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedures Many students choose to engage in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the formal CUSOM MSBS curriculum such as during Semester breaks, summer break or weekends. Shadowing experiences can be extremely valuable and students may choose to include these experiences in their Curriculum Vitae, or personal statement. Shadowing ex periences can occur with CUSOM -appointed clinical faculty members or physicians not affiliated with CUSOM . Students choosing to engage in a shadowing experience acknowledge they will do so while adhering to the following principles . 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands - on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination only, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences , including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, b r e a s t , rectal and genitourinary systems. 2. Students are not protected by malpractice insurance provided by Campbell University, Incorporated while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM -appointed faculty member . Students are required to let non-CUSOM appointed physicians they are shadowing know that they are not covered by malpractice insurance provided by Campbell University, Incorporated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, or ambulatory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or health care system policies so it is the student's responsibility to make sure they review and comply with any applicable policies. 4. Individual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is therefore the student's ethical and professional duty to fully explain their level of training. 75 Shadowing with CUSOM Clinical Faculty Members 1. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty member must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , completed in its entirety, to the Department of Clinical Affairs. 2. In addition, the student must sign the form and initial all required attestations. 3. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing experience. Shadowing with non -CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow with non-CUSOM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obtain affiliation agreements with the sites in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will not provide the clinician or site with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and background checks, immunization records, academic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students or the physician they are shadowing are not protected by malpractice insurance . d. Students acknowledge that Campbell University, Incorporated will not be liable for any medical coverage if they are to be injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They also release Campbell University, Incorporated from any liability from any injury or illness that occurs on the shadowing experience . 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non -CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previously in this document . Violation of any co nditions of these Shadowing Guidelines is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee . 76 5.14 Academic Freedom Policy The teacher is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment . The teacher is entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment . The university teacher is a citizen, a member of a learned profession, and an officer of an educational institution. His/her primary loyalty is to his/her institution, his/her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. He/She possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her position as an employee of the Univ ersity; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that in his/her role as a citizen he/she is not an institutional spokesman. Moreover, he/she should allow for the fact th at many members of the general public will find it difficult to disassociate his/her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identification. He/She should not use official university stationery, logos, watermarks or his/her institutional title i n issuing public statements which he/she makes purely in his/her role as a citizen . 77 6.

HONOR CODE, GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES AND AOA CODE OF ETHICS 9.1 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University commun ities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust and that trusting a student is an integral component in making them worthy of trust. It is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic en vironment free from injustice caused by dishonesty . Further, students at CUSOM are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner befitting the honorable profession they are pursuing . Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM student. The following serves only as a guideline to students . In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior that may constitute a violation of the C USOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to the following : 1) Cheating: Providing, acquiring or receiving any unauthorized assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing information from testing/exams is also considered a form of cheating . 2) Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or computer code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof . 3) Falsification: Fabrication of information on a ny form of academic work or attempt thereof; including but not limited to , the following : a) Clinical requirements, b) Internships, and c) Assignments and projects . 94 4) Disruptive Behavior: Any inappropriate etiquette or inappropriate disturbance repeated often enough to establish a disrespectful trend. Inappropriate disturbances include but are not limited to the following : a) Arriving late for class, or leaving class while in progress . b) Disrupting class with pagers or cellular phones . c) Disrupting class with computer s or computer games . d) Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities that create a distraction . e) Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small group study rooms . f) Bringing food into unauthorized areas or hosting food functions without permission . g) Posting unapproved materials or approved posting materials in inappropriate areas . h) Parking in inappropriate or reserved space s. 5) Unacceptable use of technology: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as published by the CUSOM IT department.

Lecture materials, including PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confidential and proprietary information a nd material protected by intellectual property laws. Students do not have permission to share them . 6) Unprofessional or unethical behavior: Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, c olleagues, or the -community - at-large. Suspected violations in this category are referred, at the Dean's discretion, to the APPS Committee. If agreeable to the Dean, a student may request to waive a hearing by the APPS Committee for suspected violations in this category and have their case heard by the Dean, or his/her designee only . In such cases, the Dean, or his/her designee only must agree to hear the case, and must accept the student's waiving o f a hearing; the Dean, or his/her designee only decision is final and cannot be appealed. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include , but is not limited to, the following : a) Entering or using the facilities of the CUSOM community without appropriate au thorization or during inappropriate times . b) Knowingly and purposely disrupting teaching, research, administrative, or student functions of the CUSOM community . c) Abusive or disrespectful conduct toward members of the faculty, administrative or professional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM community . 95 d) Disclosure of privileged information from campus activities or patient care . e) Improper relationships or activities involving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requ irements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may include, but are not limited to, patients or other students under supervision . f) Screening tests w h i c h show abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine , o r s c r e e n i n g t e s t s w h i c h a r e positive ( i . e . , e v i d e n c e o f t h e s u b s t a n c e o r s h o w i n g p r e s e n c e ) for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina . Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. Another example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentration sample identifying levels of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Under the Infl uence charge. The presence of these substances, regardless of any legal considerations or adjudication by the courts, is considered unprofessional or unethical behavior by CUSOM. g) Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is considered a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community. Suspected violations in this category are referred, at the Dean's discretion, to the APPS Committee. If agreeable to the Dean, a student ma y request to waive a hearing by the APPS Committee for suspected violations in this category and have their case heard by the Dean, or his/her designee only . In such cases, the Dean or his/her designee only must agree to hear the case, and must accept the student's waiving of a hearing; the Dean's decision is final and cannot be appealed . h) A violation of any policy of the University or CUSOM, including but not limited to the American Osteopathic Association Code of Ethics . 9.2 Code of Misconduct Violations may include, but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, abuse, or damage to any person or property in the CUSO M community. This includes knowingly or purposely causing damage to or vandalizing CUSOM community property . Conviction of a criminal offense other than a minor traffic offense . Participating in academic or clinical endeavors in the CUSOM community while under the influence of alcohol, or controlled substances . Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit substances , prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Controlled substance s will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws 96 governing illegal substances. Please note this includes substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina, but which may be legal in other states. Communicating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including written or electronic/Internet communications, w hich would result in a loss of respect by patients or other members of the public toward the offending student or toward CUSOM . Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, including written reprimands, are securely maintained in a confidential file. Such actions become a part of the student's permanent education record but are only released at the written discretion of the Dean . 9.3 GRIEVANCE PROCESSES Resolution and Grievance Procedure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concerns in a profess ional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCOC) accreditation standards and procedures.

The student has thirty ( 30) calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the grievance to request such a hearing . The request must be in writing, signed by the student, and include the following information : A clear and precise statement of the grievance ; A statement explaining how the action is discriminatory or the decision unreasonable if it is a denial of a requested accommodation ; The name the respondent parties (the person(s)) against whom the grievance is filed); An explanation of each respondent is res ponsible for the action or decision ; The requested remedy ; and Identify whether a non -participating observer will be brought to the hearing .
