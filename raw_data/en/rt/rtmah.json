Have you ever heard someone blame their weight gain on a slow metabolism? In addition to factors like eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, your body's metabolism affects how quickly you lose weight. But how much effect does metabolism have on weight loss? Will a high metabolism help you start burning fat and calories faster? We'll walk you through the basics now. Metabolism 101 Your body's metabolism is what converts the calories you consume into energy. Your metabolism combines those calories with oxygen to release the fuel your body needs to function properly. Even when you're sleeping, metabolic processes still occur to provide energy for essential bodily functions, including: - Digesting food - Breathing - Repairing damaged cells - Regulating your body temperature - Circulating blood The rate at which you burn calories while resting is called your basal metabolic rate. Variables impacting metabolism speed include age, body composition, size, and gender. In addition, how much physical activity you get every day also affects your metabolism. You can get a general idea of your basal metabolic rate using a [ free online calculator](https://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/), although no 100% accurate formula exists. Metabolism and Weight Loss While a faster metabolism can help your body burn more calories, it's not the only factor contributing to weight loss or weight gain. In general, if you burn more calories than you consume, you'll lose weight. Of course, someone with a faster metabolism will burn calories more quickly, even while resting. However, having a slow metabolism means your body needs fewer calories to function. In fact, studies have shown that obese people often have a [ greater basal metabolic rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2750332/) than people who are a healthy weight for their body size. Essentially, your metabolism affects how fast you burn calories and lose weight. However, it may not have as big of an effect as people think. Focus on eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and burning more calories than you consume as the cornerstones of your weight loss goals. In the meantime, adding a metabolism booster to your health and fitness regimen is an excellent way to achieve your goals faster. How We Ranked the Best Metabolism Booster Supplements You're probably curious about how we ranked our top five choices. The five primary factors we used for our reviews are as follows. Quality of Ingredients Perhaps the most critical factor we used to judge each metabolism booster was the quality of its ingredients. All five supplements in this review have all-natural formulas with scientifically proven ingredients and research backing up their effectiveness. While we reviewed the official websites, we also found many links to studies and research proving how the formula's ingredients promote weight loss and speed up metabolism. Dosage The amount and dosage level of the ingredients in a metabolism-booster supplement directly impact its efficacy. For example, a supplement with dosage levels of, say, caffeine that are too high may cause unwanted side effects, like a racing pulse, headache, or jitters. User Reviews User reviews are an essential aspect of commerce in today's digital age, and dietary supplements are no exception. We read through testimonials and user reviews of all five metabolism-booster pills to get an idea of how effective each one is. Of course, not everyone experiences the same results. However, we saw overwhelmingly positive reviews for our five picks. Price and Value If you've been researching and comparing pills or supplements to boost your metabolism, then you know that many of them are not cheap. However, the old clich\u00e9 \"you get what you pay for\" rings true. The best metabolism booster supplements may be slightly pricey, but the results you can achieve are worth it. Fortunately, you have plenty of opportunities to save money on your purchase. All five metabolism boosters we reviewed offer bulk-buy discounts, with the best savings on the largest orders. Even better, most orders that qualify for bulk-buy discounts usually ship for free. We also checked for limited-time promos, which you can find on the manufacturer's website. For example, you might find a 10% off coupon or a voucher for free shipping. Refund Policy and Product Guarantee Another critical ranking factor we used to review the top metabolism boosters involved product guarantees and refund policies. Is there anything worse than trying to get a refund from a company that makes you jump through hoops just to get your money back? Fortunately, you're not likely to run into those problems with the five metabolism-booster brands we reviewed. Each manufacturer has a guarantee that makes it simple to get your money back. You just need to contact customer service, request your refund, and send back your unused and unopened bottles. However, be sure to check the fine print before ordering. Usually, the guarantee only applies to purchases of more than one bottle because it takes longer than one month to experience maximum results. How Do Metabolism Boosters Work? Now that we've discussed how your body's metabolic rate affects weight loss, let's dive deeper into how metabolism booster pills work. Essentially, increasing your metabolism can help you lose weight in three ways: - Burning fat - Increasing energy - Suppressing your appetite We'll give you a quick summary of how metabolism boosters work. Burning Fat The key to weight loss is burning fat, right? Fat oxidation, or the process of breaking down fatty acids, is one of the ways your body burns fat for energy. Thermogenic fat burners also assist in fat oxidation by increasing your body temperature, which in turn boosts your metabolism. Thermogenic agents take stored fat and release it into your bloodstream, allowing your body to metabolize the fat into fuel for energy. Many metabolism boosters contain thermogenic compounds, such as capsaicin, Garcinia cambogia, and caffeine. Increasing Energy Another way metabolism boosters work is by increasing your energy, usually with stimulants like caffeine. One of the biggest barriers to losing weight is the fatigue and physical exhaustion that often accompanies calorie-cutting and dieting. Using a metabolism booster with a stimulant like caffeine, green coffee, or green tea can help you increase those flagging energy levels that are detrimental to your weight loss goals. If you have caffeine sensitivity, [Leanbean weight loss pills](https://www.timesunion.com/marketplace/article/leanbean-reviews-17382796.php) are an excellent choice because they contain 11 low-stimulant alternatives from natural sources, such as turmeric, to give you a clean energy boost throughout the day. Suppressing Appetite Appetite suppression is another way metabolism boosters can help you lose weight and stay on top of your fitness goals. Glucomannan is one of the most effective appetite suppressants in many weight loss supplements and metabolism boosters. After you consume glucomannan, the fiber absorbs liquid and expands in your stomach, tricking your body into feeling fuller than you actually are. That false feeling of satiety makes it easier for you to resist those nagging hunger cravings. Another common appetite suppressant is caffeine. Many studies have shown that [ caffeine intake](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16076989/) can result in weight loss through fat oxidation and thermogenesis, making weight maintenance more manageable. The Best Ingredients to Speed Up Metabolism and Burn Fat So, what are the best ingredients for boosting metabolism and speeding up the weight loss process? Let's look at the five most effective natural ingredients in most dietary supplements for increasing your metabolic rate. Caffeine Perhaps the most common ingredient in dietary supplements for weight loss is caffeine. Why? It's simple: Caffeine works to stimulate weight loss and increase your metabolic rate, and you'll find plenty of studies and research backing up its effectiveness. One such example is a series of four trials that researchers completed to examine the [ effects of caffeine on metabolic rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7369170/) in lean and obese people. The results? Metabolic rate \"increased significantly\" during the three hours after the subjects ingested caffeine. The study concluded that caffeine sped up the metabolism in both \"normal\" and obese individuals and also resulted in greater fat oxidation in people who weren't overweight. L-Carnitine L-carnitine is a naturally occurring amino acid derivative in the kidney, liver, and brain that aids the body in transforming fat into energy. It's also essential for muscle function. So how can it help increase your metabolism and contribute to weight maintenance and fat loss? Researchers reviewed 37 randomized controlled clinical trials that looked at the [ effects of L-carnitine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/) on body composition and weight loss. The review found that L-carnitine reduced BMI (body mass index), body weight, and overall fat mass. Although you can find L-carnitine in metabolism supplements, you can also find it in plenty of natural sources, including poultry, meat, fish, and dairy. Green Tea Extract Green tea comes from the Camellia sinensis L leaf, a rich source of caffeine and polyphenol catechins. It's one of the most common ingredients in dietary supplements for boosting metabolism. It increases the levels of hormones that burn fat in your body and also decreases the number of carbohydrates your body absorbs. In addition, research shows that the [ catechins in green tea](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19597519/) have a positive effect on weight management. Green tea also has thermogenic properties and promotes the oxidation of fat within the body, transforming it into energy. While drinking a cup of green tea may provide a slight benefit, consuming diet pills containing a larger dosage will give the best results and boost your metabolism more effectively. Chromium Picolinate Chromium is an essential mineral that performs several critical functions in the human body. While several forms of chromium exist, chromium picolinate is the form that the human body has the easiest time absorbing. This essential mineral impacts weight management through its effect on insulin and blood sugar, especially for those with diabetes. In addition to its effect on blood glucose levels, chromium picolinate also may reduce hunger cravings. [ An eight-week study](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=41977X1601025&isjs=1&jv=15.2.4-stackpath&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fnutrition%2Fchromium-picolinate%23hunger&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F18715218&xs=1&xtz=240&xuuid=da757917a310b35d25771724027ec944&abp=1&xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D) found that healthy overweight women taking chromium picolinate experienced a reduction in hunger, cravings, and food intake. However, other studies have found that chromium may only mildly affect fat loss and weight management. You can find chromium picolinate in foods such as: - Red meat (beef in particular) - Poultry - Mussels - Broccoli - Apples - Oranges - Whole-grain products - Capsaicin Do you love to eat spicy foods? Are you one of those people who have to put hot sauce on everything you eat? If so, you may be helping your body burn fat and increase its metabolism. Capsaicin, the molecule that gives chili peppers their spicy kick, isn't just a metabolism booster. It's also an effective appetite suppressant that can help you reduce hunger cravings. It doesn't have any nutrients or calories, so there's no dietary influence on your body. Instead, consuming capsaicin increases your heart rate and boosts your metabolism so that your body burns fat stores for energy. Capsaicin plays a role in overall metabolic health and is particularly effective at helping [ obese people lose weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426284/). In addition, research has shown that consuming capsaicin doesn't produce any adverse side effects, making it a safe and effective method for increasing your metabolism and losing weight. Tips for Increasing Metabolism Naturally In addition to taking a dietary supplement, there are plenty of ways you can increase your metabolism naturally. Drink Cold Water One of the simplest ways to boost your metabolism is by drinking cold water. Eliminate sugary beverages (especially soda!) and try drinking ice cold, calorie-free water instead. How does it work? By drinking cold water, you force your body to use more energy than usual to heat the water and raise it to your normal body temperature. Research shows that drinking just a half liter of ice-cold water can [ boost your metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14671205/) by up to 30% for a full hour! Put down the Coca-Cola and pick up a glass of crisp, cool water instead. High-Intensity Interval Training High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is another way you can increase your body's metabolism. Let us forewarn you: HIIT isn't for the faint of heart. The core of HIIT is pushing your body to extreme exhaustion by alternating quick periods of intense physical exercise with light recovery periods, like sprinting for 20 seconds and then jogging for two minutes. By performing HIIT, you can increase your body's metabolism. In fact, you can burn as much as 450 calories in just 30 minutes of high-energy HIIT. For example, in one research study, [ overweight men with a metabolic disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694483/) performed HIIT routines for three months. The study's participants lost an average of 4.4 pounds and had 17% fat loss. HIIT may be a difficult workout, but the overall benefits are by far worth it. Load Up on Protein Eating protein-rich foods can effectively suppress your appetite and increase your metabolism, giving you some serious help along your journey to losing weight. This is because consuming protein has a thermogenic effect on your body, which must use extra calories to break it down and absorb the nutrients. You have plenty of options for loading up on protein: Look for nutritional shakes or go right to the source and eat foods like red meat, poultry, nuts, beans, shellfish, and more. Keep reading for a full list of foods that are chock full of protein. Eat Spicy Foods Supplementing your diet with plenty of spicy foods (like the capsaicin we mentioned earlier) is another way you can boost your metabolism. For example, adding capsaicin to a meal helps you burn an extra ten calories. To get the most out of your spicy diet, we recommend combining it with protein-rich foods like chicken, beef, shellfish, beans, nuts, and so forth\u2014all of which increase your body's metabolism. Start Lifting Weights Lifting weights is an excellent way to increase your metabolism and get the slim, trim, figure you want (or maybe you prefer the ripped look). The goal is to reduce fat and gain lean muscle mass, which aids your body in burning more calories. The more muscular your body is, the more easily it can burn calories and fat, even when you're at rest. Starting a weight lifting routine is an effective way to build stronger, larger muscles and reap the rewards of a faster metabolism.

Intermittent fasting has a direct impact on your body's metabolism. Typically, your body gains glucose for energy by breaking down the carbohydrates in your food. However, by fasting, your body must find alternative energy sources, known as glucogenesis. First, your body may use water stored in your tissues and glycogen reserves in your liver, then from amino acids. As you continue to fast, your body will increase its metabolic rate by searching for more ways to find glucose. It's a common myth that fasting intermittently will slow your metabolism when in fact, it raises it. How much body fat can I lose with diet pills? Unfortunately, no formula can calculate precisely how much fat you can lose by taking diet pills. Every supplement works differently, and some are more effective than others. For example, one study from the manufacturers of PhenQ had participants taking the supplement's primary ingredient, known as -Lacys Reset. They experienced a 7.24% reduction in overall body fat. However, your experience may vary. [Take a look at our in-depth PhenQ review](https://www.dallasnews.com/branded-content/2023/06/28/phenq-reviews-legit-diet-pills-or-fat-burner-scam/) to learn more about this diet pill. To get the best possible results, eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and make wise lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking or limiting alcohol consumption. Are metabolism booster pills FDA approved? No. Dietary supplements are considered food, so they aren't subject to FDA approval. Prescription medications require FDA approval; diet supplements don't. However, that doesn't mean pills for losing weight aren't safe. Granted, the FDA has banned some ingredients for use in diet pills, such as: - Ephedra - DMAA - Sibutramine - (Clen Fat Burner) - Synephrine - Fen-Phen Avoid these harmful substances, and instead, look for supplements with all-natural ingredients. How fast can I lose weight with metabolism-boosting supplements? Again, there's no direct formula for how fast you'll lose weight from metabolism-boosting supplements. Instead, it depends on several factors and variables, such as your diet, how much you exercise, and the lifestyle choices you make. One way to get an idea of how fast you may lose weight with a supplement is to read through testimonials from the official website, e-commerce sites, or any other website where you can find verified customer reviews. You can also check out the Better Business Bureau to verify a manufacturer's reputation. Are metabolic supplements safe? Yes, metabolic supplements are safe as long as they contain all-natural ingredients. However, before you start taking any supplements, you should always check with your primary care physician first. Seeking professional medical advice is especially important if you take other prescription medications or over-the-counter meds. In addition, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take any supplements. While most all-natural supplements don't have any adverse side effects, it's safer to err on the side of caution and avoid taking them if you're pregnant or nursing.
