Omer SB, etal. NEJM 2012; 367 Child vaccinations in Arizona declining, Arizona Department of Health Services fears outbreak - abc15.com, 1/4/2013 How frequently do parents refuse or delay vaccines? Majority of physicians report >1 vaccine refusal / month 13% children under -vaccinated Who chooses an alternative schedule? More likely to agree that delaying vaccination: Is safer Is associated with fewer side effects Allows parents to avoid unnecessary vaccines Allows parents to be in charge of child's care Dempsey A, etal.

Vaccine Acceptance Attitudes towards vaccination Intention to be vaccinated Personal Characteristics Communication regarding vaccine / vaccine -preventable disese Previous experience w/ vaccine and / or disease Vaccine Policies Perceived norms WHY PARENTS REFUSE OR DELAY VACCINES FOR THEIR CHILDREN: ADDRESSING COMMON MISPERCEPTIONS T oo many shots Isn't natural immunity better? Pharmaceutical companies are just pushing vaccines to make money T oo many preservatives We never see this disease anymore I want to decide what is best for my child A Close Examination of Dr. Bob's Message Recommended schedule exposes infants to too much aluminum Vaccine preventable diseases are not that serious It is okay to hide in the herd Natural infection is better than vaccination Suggests vaccines cause chronic diseases Vaccine safety testing is insufficient Natural infection comes at risk of disease that could be severe Herd immunity has eroded due to delay and refusal Misrepresents risk Confuses coincidence with causality Clear evidence that recommended vaccines are NOT associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes, eczema, or MS Offit P , Moser C. Pediatrics 2009 Are alternative vaccine schedules safer? Alternative schedules have NOT been evaluated for safety and efficacy IOM report supports safety of currently recommended schedule Delaying Vaccination Has Consequences Increases time a child is at risk for a preventable disease Delayed administration of MMR associated with increased risk of seizures Incidence Rate (per 1000 Person -years) of Fever (A) and Seizures (B) by Age During the Risk Interval (Days 7 -10) and Control Interval (Days 0 -6 and 11 -42) Following Immunization of these vaccines too much for the immune system, especially in babies? The schedule has changed... Year Vaccines # shots by 2 years of age # shots at one time 1900 Smallpox 1 1 1980 DT wP , Polio (OPV) MMR 5 Pneumococcal conj.

From birth, infants are challenged by bacteria in the environment (colonizing bacteria on intestines, skin, and throat; bacteria inhaled on dust). Vigorous sIgA responses within the first week of life keeps colonizing bacteria from invading. Are infants too young to be vaccinated? Excellent immune responses to HBV vaccines given at birth. About 95% of infants will develop protective immune responses to HBV, Hib, DTaP, polio, and pneumococcal vaccines by 6 months of age. Need to be fully immunized against certain infections (Hib, pertussis , pneumococcus ) by 6 months of age. Vaccine Immunology 101 Goal: induce protective immunity in a high enough proportion of the population to stop transmission Vaccine types and infant immune response Live attenuated viral (MMR, Varicella , Rotavirus) Mimics natural infection Higher antibody response but infants do not generate a long lasting response due to circulating maternal antibodies Inactivated or killed viral (influenza, hepatitis A, IPV) Activate T and B cells and induce memory Good immune response but need more than one dose T oxoid (diptheria and tetanus) Made from disease -causing toxins made by bacteria Antibodies against toxin prevent disease Polysaccharide ( pneumo - and meningococcus ) Induce antibody production but do not induce immune memory Protein ( pertussis , Hep B) and Conjugate (new Hib) Induce helper T -cells and memory Goebel and Avery (1929) show improved immunogenicity of carbohydrate antigens if coupled to an immunogenic carrier protein Conjugate vaccines Primary and Secondary Immune Response T odar's Online T extbook of Bacteriology, \u00a92005 Kenneth T odar , PhD What does this mean for childhood vaccines? An infant's immune system is immature but very robust and effectively responds to an onslaught of pathogens from birth onward Do not make as much antibody Inhibition from maternal antibody Antibodies to proteins do not persist as long May have shorter memory Goal- induce strong primary response to offer early protection Prime immune system for secondary response as immune system matures This just seems like too many shots at one time - why can't I spread them out? Spreading put shots does not reduce stress for infant Study showing that two shots are not more likely to induce cortisol (as a marker for stress) than one shot. Antigen load from vaccine is MUCH smaller than what an infant confronts every day in the environment Ramsay DS, Lewis M. Developmental changes in infant cortisol and behavioral response to inoculation. Child Development 1994;65;1491 -1502. What about all of the additives in vaccines? Aluminum? Thimerosal ? \"The alternative schedule suggests only one aluminum containing vaccine at a time in infant years. By spreading out the shots, you spread out the exposure so infants can process the aluminum without it reaching toxic levels.\" Robert Sears, The Vaccine Book , p. 239 Aluminum and Thimerosal Aluminum is the third most abundant element on the earth's surface and the most abundant metal Occurs naturally in teas, herbs, and spices Added to foods such as leavening agents, anti -caking agents, emulsifiers, and coloring agents Thimerosal contains mercury ( ethylmercury ) which is also everywhere including food and water sources Aluminum and mercury in food Aluminum and mercury are found in breast milk and infant formulas. By 6 months of age infants ingest: 10mg aluminum from breast milk and 30mg from infant formula compared to 4mg from vaccines 400\u00b5g mercury from breast milk compared to <200\u00b5g from vaccines Ethylmercury is readily excreted from body - breastmilk , fish and other food sources contain methylmercury which is more likely to accumulate \"The dose makes the poison\" Aluminum can cause encephalopathy, osteomalacia and anemia in severely premature infants and patients on chronic dialysis. Circulating levels of aluminum in those with symptoms between 100 -1,000 ng/ml. Typically, children and adults have between 1-5 ng/ml of aluminum in blood. Injected vaccines do not raise that level. \"The dose makes the poison\" Thimerosal removed from vaccines in 2001 Now only in multidose preparations of inactivated influenza vaccines No evidence of mercury toxicity among children who received thimerosal -containing vaccines in multiple studies Infants <6 months old who received thimerosal doses 8x greater than levels in vaccines showed no toxicity Everyone has small quantities heavy metals in body Can you really be sure that vaccines don't cause autism? Vaccines and autism Sparked by 1998 publication in The Lancet by Wakefield, etal linking autism and MMR Vaccine causes bowel inflammation letting brain - damaging proteins circulate Study retracted and findings refuted by multiple studies that have shown no evidence of this link1 Concern has shifted to thimerosal and mercury No link found in multiple studies AND even after thimerosal removed from vaccines, autism rates have Lancet 1999. Has evidence removed concern? HOW DO I ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT VACCINES? General Principles Majority of individuals look to their health care provider for reliable information and recommendations regarding vaccines Health care providers may also have questions and concerns about vaccines Parents want to make the best decision to keep their child safe and healthy Health care providers also want to keep children safe and healthy Role of the Provider Provider recommendation a key predictor of vaccine acceptance, but... Media and Vaccines Make it strong Help parents understand risk for diseases prevented by childhood vaccines Make it personal Let parents know that you vaccinate your children Know the diseases and the vaccines (or have readily available resources) so you can provide information to address questions and concerns Provider Recommendation Matters An approach Listen and acknowledge Find a common ground Use numbers to communicate risk and provide perspective 1 in 100 infants <2 months old infected with pertussis will die, 1 in 10,000 who receive DTaP will have moderate adverse event Talk about risk associated with other daily activities to provide context Use personal stories Healy CM, etal Pediatrics 2011;127 Suppl Daley MF, etal. Sci Am 2011;305:32, 4. What matters: providing information or making a recommendation? Different types of information had little influence on beliefs about vaccine side effects Likelihood of parental refusal of vaccination 17 times higher (aOR 17.5) in the participatory group 47% of parents with initial resistance accepted vaccination when providers pursued their initial recommendation Nyhan B, etal. Pediatrics 2014; Opel DJ, etal. Pediatrics 2013 Targeted Messaging Address specific concerns Consider hesitancy type Leask et al. BMC Pediatrics 2012, 12:154. Resources and T ools Easy to read and interactive vaccine schedule tools When questions arise, listen and acknowledge Parents and clinicians have same goal to keep child safe and healthy Personalize discussion Have some go -to resources for information about vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases Resources Offit PA, Moser, CA.
