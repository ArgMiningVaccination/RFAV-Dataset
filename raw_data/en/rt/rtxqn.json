Our nutritionist says it's unlikely. Q: Are there any benefits to taking large doses of vitamin C, say, five times the recommended amount? Vitamin C is an important nutrient that plays many roles in your health. It helps support your immune system, aids in iron absorption, and has antioxidant properties that help protect against damage from [oxidative stress](/health/oxidative-stress) ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29099763) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499877) In recent years, many people have started taking high doses of vitamin C in an attempt to improve their health and gain benefits beyond the amount obtained through their diet. However, high doses of vitamin C are unlikely to provide any additional benefit. This is because vitamin C is a [water-soluble vitamin](/nutrition/water-soluble-vitamins), which means it dissolves in water. Unlike [fat-soluble vitamins](/nutrition/fat-soluble-vitamins), water-soluble vitamins aren't stored in your body \u2014 instead, excess amounts get excreted through your urine ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24426232/) In addition, consuming excessive amounts of vitamin C through supplements may cause adverse effects in susceptible individuals. These include: - Kidney stones. Excess vitamin C is removed by the body as [oxalate](/nutrition/oxalate-good-or-bad), a waste product. In some cases, though, oxalate may form crystals and lead to kidney stones. Consuming too much vitamin C may increase the amount of oxalate in your urine and increase the risk of kidney stones ( , [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26463139) ). [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20818905) - Digestive symptoms. Consuming excess vitamin C through supplements may cause digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps ( , [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24426232/) ). [7](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/) - Iron overload. Individuals with [hemochromatosis](/health/hemochromatosis), a condition that raises the risk of iron accumulation in the body, may experience [iron overload](/nutrition/why-too-much-iron-is-harmful). This is a serious condition that may cause damage to various organs ( , [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430862) ). [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17299614) Vitamin C has a daily value (DV) of 90 mg per day, which is the recommended amount you should consume each day. It can easily be reached by consuming [vitamin C-rich foods](/nutrition/vitamin-c-foods), such as strawberries, citrus fruits, broccoli, and bell peppers ( [7](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) However, you can safely consume up to 2,000 mg of vitamin C per day without experiencing adverse health effects. This is the established tolerable upper limit for vitamin C intake ( [7](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/) It's important to note that it's nearly impossible to consume excessive amounts of vitamin C through foods. It's far more likely to happen through supplements. "}
