The tax results of other situations must be determined after a review of all facts and circumstances.(b) Other rules that may apply. Readers may also want to refer to other rules for additional information, including those in the following list: (( ())Hospitals, nursing homes, (( boarding homes )) assisted living facilities , adult family homes and similar health care facilities(( ))); (((c))) (iv) WAC 458-20-178 Use tax and the use of tan - gible personal property; and (v) WAC 458-20-18801 (( (Prescription drugs, prosthetic and orthotic devices, ostomic items, and medically prescribed oxygen); and (d) WAC 458-20-233 (Tax liability of medical and hos - pital service bureaus and associations and similar health care organizations) )) Medical substances, de vices, and supplies for humans\u2014Drugs prescribed for human use\u2014Medically prescribed oxygen\u2014Prosthetic devices\u2014Mobility enhancing equipment\u2014Durable medical equipment. (c) Definitions. For the purposes of this rule the follow - ing definitions apply: (i) Audiologists. \"Audiologists\" diagnose, manage, and treat a patient's hearing, bal ance, or related ear problems. (ii) Gross income. \"Gross income\" means compensation for the rendition of health care services, and includes any sep - arate charge for drugs, medicines, and other substances administered or provided to a patient as part of the health car e services delivered to the patient. Gross income also includes any separate charges for prosthetic devices, including dental prostheses and hearing aids that are provided as part of the health care services d elivered to patients. (iii) Health care provider. A \"health care provider\" is a person licensed under the provisions of Title 18 RCW to pro - vide health care services to humans in the ordinary course of business or practice of a profession.

(b) Sales of tangible p ersonal property (( apart from dental and other health care services )). A dentist , audiolo - gist, or other health care provider may make sales of tangible personal property such as hearing aid batteries, drugs, medi - cines, and bandages as a convenience to a buyer apart from any health care services provided to the buyer. These are sales of tangible personal property only when the dentist , audiologist, or other health care provider does not supply or administer the drug, medicine, or other item in the course of delivering health care services to the buyer. The gross pro - ceeds of these retail sales of t angible personal property are subject to the retailing B&O tax. In addition, the dentist , audiologist, or other health care provider must collect and remit retail sales tax, unless t he sale is specifically exempt by law. (( See WAC 458-20-18801 )) For detailed information regarding retail sales tax exemptions available for sales of items commonly associated w ith health care services refer to WAC 458-20-18801 . Adequate records must be kept by the dentist , audiologist, or other health care provider to distin - guish items of tangible personal property (( that are )) supplied or administered to patients as part of health care services from those (( that are )) sold apart from health care services delivered to the buyer. Purchases of tangible personal property for resale with - out intervening use are not subject to the retail sales tax. A dentist , audiologist, or other health care provider purchasing tangible personal property for resale must furnish a (( resale certificate for purchases made b efore January 1, 2010, or a )) reseller permit (( for purchases made on or after January 1, 2010, )) to the seller to document the wholesale nature of the sale (( as provided in WAC 458-20-102A (Resale certificates) and WAC 458-20-102 (Reseller permits). Even though resale certificates are no longer used after December 31, 2009, they must be kept on file by the seller for five years from the date of last use or December 31, 2014 )). For information on reseller permits, see WAC 458-20-102 . (c) Equipment and supplies used by dentists , audiolo - gists, and other health care providers. Purchases of equip - ment and supplies used by dentists , audiologists, and other health care providers in performing diagnostic, dental , or other health care services are p urchases at retail and subject to retail sales tax unless specifically exempt by law. If the seller does not collect retail sales tax, the dentist , audiologist, or other health care provider must remit the retail sales tax (commonly referred to as \"defe rred sales tax\") or use tax directly to the department unless specifically exempt by law. Deferred sales or use tax (( should be reported on the buyer's excise tax return. However, the excise tax return does not have a separate line for repor ting deferred sales tax. Conse - quently, deferred sales tax )) liability should be reported on the use tax line of the buyer's excise tax return. For detailed information regarding the use tax, (( refer to )) see WAC 458- 20-178 (( (Use tax) )). Dental prostheses are exempt from retail sales and use taxes if the dental prosthesis meets the definition of \"pros - thetic device .\" ((in subsection (2)(a) of this rule. RCW 82.08.0283 and 82.12.0277. )) Exempt items include, but are not limited to, full and partial dentures, crowns, inlays, fill - ings, braces, retainers, collars , wire, screws, bands, splints, night guards, gold, silver, alloys, acrylic materials, filling material, reline material, cement, cavity liner s, pins, and endo posts. (d) Itemization of gross income. Audiologists who itemize invoices to their patients showing charges for tests and evaluations separate from charges for sales of hearing aids may separately report their income under the service and other activities B&O tax classification and the retailing B&O tax classification, respectively. Audiologists who do not sep - arately charge for their services and sales of hearing aids must report their gross income under the service and other activities B&O tax classification. (e) Examples. ((The following examples identify a num - ber of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should be used only as a gener al guide. The tax results of other situations must be determi ned after a review of all of the facts and circumstances. )) (i) Example 1. Dr. A is a physician who specializes in the treatment of allergies. Dr. A treats many patients with injections of allergy extracts (antigens). Dr. A separately itemizes the charges for the antigen, the administration of the injection, and the office call in patients' billings. Dr. A is sub- ject to service and other activities B&O tax on the entire charge for the antigen, administration of the injection, and office call. Even though Dr. A separately itemizes the charges for antigens, these are not ret ail sales because Dr. A adminis - ters the antigens to the patients. (ii) Example 2. Dr. B made mail-order purchases of a computer, books, and magazines for use in Dr. B's dental practice. Dr. B did not pay reta il sales tax to the sellers on these purchases. Therefore, Dr . B must remit to the depart - ment deferred retail sales or use tax on the computer, books, and magazines. (3) Tax-reporting information f or dental laboratories and dental technicians. This subsection provides tax-report - ing information for dental laboratories and dental techni - cians. (a) Producing or fabricating dental prostheses for sale. The production or fabricati on of dental appliances, devices, restorations, substitutes, or other dental laboratory products by dental laboratorie s and dental technicians is a manufacturing activity. RCW 82. 04.120. Thus, dental labora - tories and dental technicians are subject to manufacturing B&O tax on the value of the dental prostheses they manufac - ture. The value of products manufactured is generally the Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-002 [ 23 ] Permanentgross proceeds of sales of suc h manufactured products. For additional information about the manufacturing B&O tax, ((refer to )) see WAC 458-20-136 (( (Manufacturing, process - ing for hire, fabricating) )). (i) Sales of dental prostheses manufactured by dental laboratories and d ental technicians. Dental laboratories and dental technicians (( who)) that make sales within this state of dental prostheses they have manufactured are subject to either the retailing or wholesaling B&O tax, as the case may be. In such cases, the dental laboratory or dental techni - cian must report under the m anufacturing B&O tax classifi - cation as well as t he wholesaling (( and/or )) or retailing B&O tax classification(( s)). However, a multiple activities tax credit (MATC) may be claimed. For detailed information about the MATC, (( refer to )) see WAC 458-20-19301 (((Multiple activities tax credits) )). Dental laboratories or dental technicians making wholesale sales must obtain a ((resale certificate (WAC 458-20-102A) for sales made before January 1, 2010, or a )) reseller permit (( (WAC 458- 20-102) for sales made on or after January 1, 2010, )) from the buyer to document the wholesale nature of the sale. As noted (( above )) in subsection (2)(c) of this rule, sales of dental prostheses including, but not limited to, full and pa r- tial dentures, crowns, inlays, fillings, braces, and retainers are exempt from retail sales tax if the dental prosthesis meets the definition of a \"prosthetic device .\" ((in subsection (2)(a) of this rule. RCW 82.08.0283. )) (ii) Dental casts, models, and other articles of tangible personal property manufactur ed by dental laboratories and dental technicians for co mmercial or industrial use. Dental laboratories and dental technicians may manufacture dental casts, models, or other articles of tangible personal property that they use (( in producing or fabricating )) to pro - duce or fabricate dental prostheses. In such cases, the dental laboratory or dental technician is manufacturing a product for commercial or industrial use a nd is subject to the manufactur - ing B&O tax on the value of the dental cast, model, or other article of tangible personal property. (( (See WAC 458-20- 112 (Value of products) )) For information regarding the value of products(( .))), see RCW 82.04.450 and WAC 458- 20-112. As the consumer of the dent al cast, model, or other article of tangible personal property manufactured for com - mercial or industrial use, the d ental laboratory or dental tech - nician is also liable for use ta x on the value of the dental ca st, model, or other article of tangi ble personal property, unless the use is specifically exempt by law. (b) In-house manufacturing of dental prostheses by dentists. As noted in this rule, the production or fabrication of dental prostheses by dental laboratories and dental techni - cians is a manufacturing activit y. However, the production or fabrication of dental prostheses by dentists in the course of providing dental care services t o their patients is not a manu - facturing activity under the law and, therefore, manufacturing B&O tax does not apply to (( this)) that activity. A dentist may personally produce or fabricate dental prostheses, or the den - tist may have an employee who is a dental technician produce or fabricate the dental prostheses. These dental prostheses are considered a tangible represen tation of professional services provided to the dentist's patients. Dentists who manufacture impressions, dental casts, models, or other articles of tangibl e personal property that they use (( in producing or fabricating )) to produce or fabricate dental prostheses should refer to sub - section (3)(a)(ii) of this rule for tax reporting instructions applicable to this activity. ((The following examples identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should be used only as a general guide. The tax resu lts of other situations must be determined after a review of all of the facts and circum - stances. )) (i) Example 3. Jane Doe, an employee of Dentist A, fab - ricates dental prostheses. Den tist A provides these products to patients in the course of rendering dental care services. Dentist A is subject to service and other activities B&O tax on the gross income received for providing dental care ser - vices, including any charge for the dental prostheses even if Dentist A separately charges patients for the dental prosthe - ses. (( (See subsection (2)( a) of this rule.) )) (ii) Example 4. The facts are the same as in the previous example except that Dentist A a lso sells to Dentist B dental prostheses produced by Jane D oe in the course of Jane's employment with Dentist A. For these sales of dental pros - theses to Dentist B, Dentist A i s acting as a dental laboratory and, therefore, is liable for both manufacturing B&O tax and retailing B&O tax with respect to the manufacture and sale of dental prostheses to Dentist B. Dentist A may also claim a MATC (( ()). See subsection (3)(a) and ( a)(i) of this rule.(( ))) The sales to Dentist B are exempt from retail sales tax under RCW 82.08.0283 if the items qualify as a \"prosthetic device \" as defined (( above )) in subsection (( (2)(a) )) (1)(c)(iv) of this rule. (c) Equipment and supplies used by dental laborato - ries and dental technicians. Purchases of equipment and supplies by dental laboratories a nd dental technicians for use in manufacturing dental prostheses are generally purchases at retail and subject to retail sales tax unless specifically exem pt by law. If the seller does not co llect retail sales tax, the de ntal laboratory or dental technician m ust remit the retail sales tax (commonly referred to as \"defe rred sales tax\") or use tax directly to the department unless specifically exempt by law. Deferred sales or use tax should be reported on the (( buyer's excise tax return. However, the excise tax return does not have a separate line for repor ting deferred sales tax. Conse - quently, deferred sales tax li ability should be reported on the)) use tax line of the buyer's excise tax return. For detailed information regarding use tax, (( refer to )) see WAC 458-20- 178. (i) Components of dental prostheses produced for sale. Purchases of supplies that become components of dental prostheses (( that are )) produced for sale are purchases at wholesale and are not s ubject to retail sales tax , if the buyer provides the seller with a (( properly completed resale certifi - cate (WAC 458-20-102A) for purchases made before January 2010, or a )) reseller permit (( (WAC 458-20-102) for pur - chases made on or after January 1, 2010, )) to document the wholesale nature o f the transaction. (ii) Example 5. ( (The following example identifies a number of facts and then states a conclusion. This example should be used only as a gener al guide. The tax results of other situations must be determi ned after a review of all of the facts and circumstances. )) A dental lab purchases equip -WSR 16-16-003 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 24 ]ment and supplies including gold, silver, alloys, artificial teeth, cement, and tools. The pur chases of gold, silver, alloys , artificial teeth, and cement th at become components of dental prostheses are wholesale purchases and are not subject to retail sales tax if the buyer provides the seller with a (( resale certificate (WAC 458-20-102A) f or purchases made before January 1, 2010, or a )) reseller permit (( (WAC 458-20-102) for purchases made on or after January 1, 2010 )). The tools are subject to retail sales or us e tax unless they qualify for the manufacturing machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption s. Additional information about (( this)) these exemption s is provided (( below )) in subsection (3)(d) of this rule. (d) Sales and use tax exemptions for manufacturing machinery and equipment. ((A)) RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565 provide retail sales and use tax exemption s ((is provided by RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565 )) for sales to or use by manufacturers of certain machinery and equip - ment used directly in a manufacturing operation. (( This exemption is )) These exemptions are limited to machinery and equipment used to manufacture products for sale as tan - gible personal property. Thus, dental laboratories and dental technicians manufacturing dental prostheses for sale may be eligible for (( this)) these exemption s. The (( exemption is )) exemptions are not available if these products are produced or fabricated by a dentist or an employee of a dentist and are provided to patients in the cour se of delivering dental care services to the patients (as is the case in (( the example pro - vided in subsection (3)(b)(i) of this rule). Refer to WAC 458- 20-13601 (Manufacturers and processors for hire\u2014Sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment) )) Example 3).

Kevin Dixon Rules Coordinator AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 10-10-030, filed 4/26/10, effective 5/27/10) WAC 458-20-190 Sales to and by the United States and certain entities created by the United States \u2014Doing business on federal reservations\u2014Sales to foreign gov - ernments. (1) Introduction. Federal law prohibits (( Wash - ington )) states from directly imposing taxes (( upon )) on the United States. Persons doing business with the United States , however, are (( nonetheless )) subject to the taxes imposed by the state of Washington, unless specifically exemp t. This rule explains the tax reporting responsibilities of persons making sales to the United States and to foreign governments. The rule also explains the tax reporting responsibilities of person s engaging in business activities within federal reservations and cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production fo r the United States.Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-003 [ 25 ] Permanent((Persons engaged in construction, installation, or improvement to real property of or for the United States should also refer to )) (a) Other rules that may be relevant.

(iii) WAC 458-20-178 Use tax and the use of tangible personal property. (iv) WAC 458-20-186 (( ())Tax on cigarettes(( ))). (b) Examples. This rule provides examples that identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These exam - ples should be used only as a general guide. The tax results of other situations must be determi ned after a review of all the facts and circumstances . (2) \"United States\" defined. (a) For the purposes of this r ule, the term \"United States\" means the federal government, including the executive, legis - lative, and judicial branches, its departments, and federal entities exempt from state or local taxation by (( reason of )) specific federal statutory exemption. The mere fact that an entity is a federal entity, such as an instrumentality or a federal corporation, does not mean that the entity is immune from tax. The taxability of a federal entity and whether (( or not )) the entity is required to collect and remit retail sales/use tax depends on the benefits and immunities conferred (( upon )) on it by Congress. Thus, to determine the current taxable sta tus of federal entities, the relevant portion of the federal law should be examined. (b) \"United States\" does not include entities associated with but not a part of the United States, such as the National Guard (an instrumentality of the state of Washington). Nor does it include entities contr acting with the United States government to administer its programs. (3) Prohibition against taxing the United States. The state of Washington is prohibited from imposing taxes directly (( upon )) on the United States. (a) This prohibition applies to taxes imposed for the priv - ilege of engaging in business such as (( the)) business and occupation (B&O) (chapter 82.04 RCW) and (( the)) public utility (chapter 82.16 RCW) taxes. It also applies to taxes imposed on a buyer or user of goods or services(( ,)) including, but not limited to, the: (i) State and local retail sales and car rental taxes (chap - ters 82.08 and 82.14 RCW); ( i i ) S t a t e a n d l o c a l u s e t a x ( c h a p t e r s 8 2 . 1 2 a n d 8 2 . 1 4 RCW); (iii) Solid waste collection tax (chapter 82.18 RCW); and (iv) Local government taxes such as the special hotel/ motel (chapter 67.28 RCW) and convention and trade center (chapter 67.40 RCW) taxes. (b) The state is also prohibited from requiring the United States to collect taxes imposed on the buyer (e.g., the retail sales tax) as an agent for the s tate. However, buyers must pay use tax on retail purchases fro m the United States, unless spe - cifically exempt by law. (c) In addition, federal law exempts certain nongovern - mental entities from state taxes (for which Congress has given specific federal statuto ry tax exemptions). These spe - cific federal statutory exemptions (( given by Congress )) may not be absolute and may be limited to specific activities of an entity. (d) The American Red Cross i s an instrumentality of the United States. As a federal corporation providing aid and relief, it is exempt from retail sales, use, and (( business and occupation )) B&O taxes under state law. RCW 82.08.0258, 82.12.0259, and 82.04.380. The Red Cross provides some victims of natural disas - ters assistance by check, vouc her, and/or direct deposits to the individuals' personal bank accounts. Assistance may also be provided with \"client assis tance cards\" that may be used by the recipients at locations where bankcards are accepted or at automated teller machines (ATM). The retail sales tax treatment of purchases made using these payment methods is: (i) Electronic funds transf ers and checks. Purchases made by an individual using fund s that have been transferred into the individual's bank account or received in the form of a check are subject to retail sales tax in the same manner as any other purchase made by that ind ividual, unless specifically exempt by law. ( i i ) V o u c h e r s . A v o u c h e r i s a certificate issued by the Red Cross to an individual that may be exchanged for a spe - cific good or service. As the go ods and services will be paid for directly by the Red Cross, the sales are not subject to ret ail sales tax. A vendor who accepts a voucher will send it and/or other proof of sale to the Red Cross, which will then send a check to the vendor to p ay for the purchase. (iii) Client assistance cards. Sales to individuals who use client assistance cards issued by the Red Cross, or who pay with cash withdrawn from an ATM using the card, are sub - ject to retail sales tax, unles s otherwise exempt from tax. These sales are not direct sales to the federal government or one of its instrumentalities. (e) The Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) is an agency of the fed eral government. As a federal corporation providing aid and relief, it is exempt from retail sales, use, and B&O taxes under state law. RCW 82.08.0258, 82.12.0259, and 82.04.380. FEMA provides some victims of natural disasters assis - tance by check, voucher, and/or direct deposits to the individ - uals' personal bank accounts. A ssistance may also be pro - vided with emergency debit cards that can be used by the recipients at locations where bankcards are accepted or at ATMs. The retail sales tax treatment of purchases made using these payment methods is: (i) Electronic funds transfer and checks. Sales are subject to retail sales tax as described in (d)(i) of this subsection. (ii) Vouchers. Sales are not s ubject to retail sales tax. As with the Red Cross, the goods a nd services will be paid for directly by FEMA. See (d )(ii) of this subsection. (iii) Emergency debit cards. As with the Red Cross, \"cli - ent assistance cards\" purchases made with these cards, or WSR 16-16-003 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 26 ]with cash withdrawn from an ATM using these cards, are subject to retail sales tax. Se e (d)(iii) of this subsection. (4) Persons doing business w ith the United States. Persons selling goods or services to the United States are sub - ject to taxes imposed on th e seller, such as the (( business and occupation ( ))B&O(( ))) and public utility taxes, unless a spe - cific tax exemption applies. Persons receiving income from contracting with the United States government to administer its programs, either in whole or i n part, are also subject to t ax, unless a specific tax exemption applies. (a) Certain invoiced amounts n o t i n c l u d e d i n g r o s s income. Persons who contract with the United States may, for federal accounting purposes, be contractually required to invoice goods or services provided to the United States by third parties. The purpose of the invoices is to match the expenditures with the appropriate category of congressional funding. (( These )) Amounts received under such invoices should be excluded from the person's gross income when reporting on the (( combined )) excise tax return if all of the following conditions (( exist )) are met with respect to the goods or services: (i) The third party directly invoices the United States; (ii) The United Stat es directly pays the third party; and (iii) The person has no liability, either primarily or sec - ondarily, for making payment to the third party or for remit - ting payment to the third party. (b) Tax obligation with respect to the use of tangible personal property. Persons performing services for the United States are also subject to the retail sales or use tax o n property they use or consume when performing services for the United States, unless specifically exempt. (i) Manufacturing articles for commercial or indus - trial use. In the case of products manufactured or produced by the person using the products as a consumer, the measure of the use tax is generally the value of the products as explained in WAC 458-20-112 (( (Value of products). How - ever, )). If the articles manufactured or produced by the user are used in the manuf acture or production of products sold or to be sold to the department of defense of the United States, the value of articles used is the value of the ingredients of such articles. The manufacturing B&O tax also applies to the value of articles manufactured for commercial or industrial use. (ii) Use of government provided property. When arti - cles or goods used are acquire d by bailment, the measure of the use tax to the bailee is the reasonable rental with the val ue to be determined as nearly as po ssible according to the rental price at the place of use of si milar products of like quality a nd character. For more information on leases or rentals of tangi - ble personal property s ee WAC 458-20-211 (( (Leases or rental of tangible personal property, bailments) )). Thus, if a person has a contract to provide services for the United States and uses government supplied ta ngible personal property to perform the services, (( then)) the person must pay use tax on the fair market rental value of the government supplied tangi - ble personal property. Persons who incorporate government provided articles into construction projects or improvements made to real property of or for the United States should refer to WAC 458-20-17001 (( (Government contracting, etc.) )) for more spe - cific tax-reporting information. (c) Exemption for certain ma chinery and equipment. Manufacturers or processors for hire may be eligible for the retail sales or use tax exemption provided by RCW 82.08.- 02565 and 82.12.02565 on machinery and equipment used directly in a manufacturing or research and development operation. For information on the sales and use tax exemp - tions s ee WAC 458-20-13601 (( (Manufacturers and proces - sor for hire\u2014Sales and use tax exemption for machinery and equipment) )). (5) Documenting exempt sales to the United States. Only (( those )) sales made directly t o the United States are exempt from retail sales tax or other tax imposed on the buyer. To be entitled to the exemption, the purchase must be paid for using a qualified U.S. government credit card, a check from the United States pay able to the seller, a United States voucher, (( or with cash accompanied by the federal SF (Standard Form) 1165 )) or by electronic funds transfer made by the United States . Sales to employees or representatives of the United States are subject to tax, even though the United States may reimburse the employee or represe ntative for all or a part of the expense. Purchases by a ny other person, whether with federal funds or through a reimbursement arrangement, are subject to tax unless specifically exempt by law. (a) Documenting tax-exempt sales. Sellers must docu - ment the tax-exempt nature of sales made to the United States by keeping a copy of the Unite d States credit card receipt, a copy of the check from the United States, a copy of the fed - eral government voucher, or a (( signed copy of federal SF 1165 )) copy of documentation clearly indicating payment was made by the United States through electronic funds transfer. For information on how to determine whether pur - chases made with a U.S. government credit card are exempt from retail sales tax, refer to the department' s web site at dor.wa.gov . (b) Payment (( occurring via )) made by government contracted credit card. Various United States government contracted credit cards are used to make payment for pur - chases of goods and services by or for the United States gov - ernment. Sole responsibility f or payment of these purchases may rest with the United States government or with the employee. The United States government's system of issuing government contracted credit cards is subject to change. For specific information about dete rmining when payment is the direct responsibility of the United States government or the employee, contact the departm ent's taxpayer services divi - sion at: ((Department of Revenue )) Taxpayer Services Department of Revenue P.O. Box 47478 Olympia, WA 98504-7478 or call the department's telephone information center at 1- 800-647-7706 or visit the web site at (( http:// dor.wa.gov )) dor.wa.gov . (6) Doing business on federal reservations. The state of Washington has jurisdiction a nd authority to levy and col -Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-003 [ 27 ] Permanentlect taxes (( upon )) from persons residing within, or with respect to business transactions conducted (( upon )) on, fed- eral reservations. The term \"federal res - ervation,\" as used in this rule, means any land or premises within the exterior boundaries of the state of Washington that are held or acquired by and for the use of the United States, its departments, institutions or entities. This means that a concessionaire operating within a federal reservation under a grant or permit issued by the Un ited States or by a department or entity of the United States is taxable to the same extent as any private operator engaging in a similar business outside a federal reservation and without specific authority from the United States. (a) Sales tax collect ion requirements. Persons making retail sales to members of the armed forces or others residing within or conducting business (( upon )) on federal reserva - tions are required to collect and remit retail sales tax from t he buyer. (b) C i g a r e t t e t a x s t a m p s . Washington cigarette tax stamps must generally be affixed to all cigarettes sold to per - sons residing within or conducting business (( upon )) on fed- eral reservations. However, su ch stamps need not be affixed to cigarettes sold to the United States or any of its entities including voluntary organizations of military personnel authorized by the Secretary of D efense or the Secretary of the Navy or by the United States or any of its entities to autho - rized purchasers, for use on such reservation. For additional information on cigarette sta mps, rates, and refunds s ee WAC 458-20-186 (( (Tax on cigarettes) )). (7) Sales made to authorized purchasers of the United States. As explained in subsection (3)(b) of this rule, while sales by the United States are exempt of retail sales tax the purchaser is generally responsible for remitting use tax directly to the department (( of revenue )). Federal law prohib - its the imposition of use tax on tangible personal property sold to authorized purchasers by the United States, its enti - ties, or voluntary unincorporated organization of armed forces personnel. 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(a). (a) Who is an \"authorized purchaser\"? A person is an \"authorized purchaser\" only w ith respect to purchases he or she is permitted to make from commissaries, ships' stores, or voluntary unincorporated organizations of personnel of any branch of the armed forces of the United States, under regu - lations promulgated by the departmental secretary having jurisdiction over such branch. 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(b). (b) What is a \"voluntary un incorporated organiza - tion\"? \"Voluntary unincorporated o rganizations\" are those organizations comprised of arme d forces personnel operated under regulations promulgated by the departmental secretary having jurisdiction over such branch. Examples of voluntary unincorporated organizations a re post flying clubs, officers or noncommissioned officers ope n messes, and recreation associations. (8) Purchases by persons using federal funds. Retail sales or use tax (( is applicable )) applies to retail purchases made by any buyer, other than the United States, including the state of Washington and all of its political subdivisions, irrespective of whether or not the buyer uses or is reimbursed with federal funds , unless the purchase is specifically exempt by law .(9) Cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-prod - ucts of weapons production and nuclear research and development. RCW 82.04.263 provides a preferential tax rate for the gross income derived from cleaning up for the United States, or its instrumenta lities, radioactive waste and other by-products of weapon s production and nuclear research and development. This tax rate applies whether the person performing these activities is a general contractor or subcontractor. (a) What activities are entitl ed to the preferential tax rate? Only those activities that meet the definition of \"clean - ing up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons production and nuclear research and development\" are enti - tled to the preferential tax rat e. The statute defines \"cleanin g up radioactive waste and other by-products of weapons pro - duction and nuclear research and development\" to mean: (i) The handling, storing, treating, immobilizing, stabi - lizing, or disposing of radio active waste, radioactive tank waste and capsules, nonradioactive hazardous solid and liq - uid wastes, or spent nuclear fuel; (ii) Conditioning of spent nuclear fuel; (iii) Removing contamination in soils and groundwater; (iv) Decontaminating and decommissioning of facilities; and (v) Services supporting the performance of cleanup. A service supports the per formance of cleanup if it: (A) Is within the scope of work under a clean-up contract with the United Stated D epartment of Energy; or (B) Assists in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy under a subcontract entered into with the prime contractor or another subcontractor in furtherance of a clean- up contract between the United States Departm ent of Energy and a prime contractor. (b) When does a service not assist in the accomplish - ment of a requirement of a clean-up project? Subject to specific exceptions provided by law, a service does not assist in the accomplishment of a clean-up project when the same services are routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities. The following exceptions are always deemed to contrib - ute to the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean-up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy: Information technology and computer support services; Services rendered in resp ect to infrastructure; and Security, safety, and health services. (c) Guideline examples. The following examples are to be used as a guideline when determining whether a service is \"routinely provided to businesses not engaged in clean-up activities.\" (i) Accounting services. The classification does not apply to general accounting serv ices but does apply to perfor - mance audits performed for per sons cleaning up radioactive waste. (ii) Legal services. The classification does not apply to general legal services but does apply to those legal services that assist in the accomplishment of a requirement of a clean- up project undertaken by the United States Department of Energy. Thus, legal services p rovided to contest any local, WSR 16-16-005 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 28 ]state, or federal tax liability or to defend a company against worker's compensation claim arising from a worksite injury do not qualify for the classification. However, legal services related to the resolution of c ontractual dispute between the parties to a clean-up contract between the United States Department of Energy and a prime contractor do qualify. (iii) General office janitorial. General office janitorial services do not qualify for the radioactive waste clean-up classification, but the speci alized cleaning of equipment exposed to radioactiv e waste does qualify. (d) Clean-up examples. ((The examples in this subsec - tion identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should only be used as a general guide. Sim - ilar determinations for other situations can be made only after a review of all fact s and circumstances. )) (i) Company C is a land excavation contractor (( who)) that contracts with Prime Contractor to dig trenches where waste will be reburied after processing. Company C's con - tract for digging trenches quali fies for the preferential tax r ate under RCW 82.04.263 because the activity of digging trenches is one of the physical acts of cleaning up. (ii) Company D contracts with Company C from the pre - vious example to provide pay roll and accoun ting services. Company D's activity does not qual ify for the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.263 because the activity of general accounting is not an activity involving the physical act of cleaning up, nor is it a service supporting the performance of cleanup as defined in (a) (v) of this subsection. (iii) Company E is an environmental engineering com - pany (( which )) that contracts with Prime Contractor to develop a plan on how best to decontaminate the soil at a tank farm and will monitor the clea nup/decontamination as it pro - gresses. Company E's activities qualify for the preferential tax rate under RCW 82.04.263 because the activities are ser - vices supporting the performance of cleanup. (iv) Company F is a security company that contracts with Prime Contractor to provide overall security to the federal reservation, including providing security at clean-up sites. Security services at clean-up si tes are services that support the performance of cleanup. (e) Taxability of tangible p ersonal property used or consumed in cleaning up radi oactive waste and other by- products of weapons produc tion and nuclear research and development. Persons cleaning up radioactive waste and other by-products of wea pons production and nuclear research and development for th e United States, or its instru - mentalities, are consumers of any property they use or con - sume when performing thes e services. RCW 82.04.190. Therefore, tangible personal pr operty used or consumed in the cleanup is subject to retail s ales or use tax. If the selle r does not collect retail sales tax on a retail sale, the buyer i s required to pay the retail sales tax (commonly referred to as \"deferred sales tax\") or use t ax directly to the department, unless specifically exempt by law. The \"(( combined )) excise tax return\" does not have a separate line for reporting deferred sales tax. Consequently , deferred sales tax liability should be reported on the use tax line of the buyer's (( com- bined )) excise tax return. (( Refer to )) For detailed informa - tion on the use tax, see WAC 458-20-178 (( for detailed infor - mation regarding use tax )).(10) Sales to foreign governments or foreign diplo - mats. Purchases by foreign governments are not subject to retail sales tax. Documentation, such as purchase orders and receipts, must be maintained by the seller to verify the exempt nature of the sale. Purch ases by foreign diplomats are generally not subject to retail sales tax if a valid Diplomatic Tax Exemption Card issued by the United States Department of State is used. For specific (( details )) information concern - ing the taxability of sales of goods and services to foreign missions and diplomats, contact the department's taxpayer services division at: ((Department of Revenue )) Taxpayer Services Department of Revenue P.O.

Prop - erty that is used more than fi fty percent of the time by a non - profit organization, association, or corporation that allows only members to attend its activities does not qualify for this exemption. )) (4) Examples. Examples found in this rule identify a number of facts and then state a conclusion. These examples should be used only as a general guide. The tax results of other situations must be determined after a review of all facts and circumstances. (a) Example 1. Prior to a me mber only meeting, a frater - nal organization hosts a dinner at its facility that is open to nonmembers. The fraternal organization advertised the din - ner on its web site and reader board, which clearly conveyed the public could attend. The dinner and the member only meeting are considered two separate events. The dinner is considered a publi c gathering because nonmembers are allowed to attend. However, the member only meeting fol - lowing the dinner is not c onsidered a public gathering. (b) Example 2. A boys youth organization hosts a spa - ghetti feed at its faci lity to raise money for a camping trip. The organization advertised the spaghetti feed in the local newspaper, which stated nonmemb ers are allowed to attend. The spaghetti feed is considered a public gathering. (c) Example 3. A girls youth organization has weekly club meetings at its facility. The weekly meetings are adver - tised on the organization's public web site as being open for nonmembers to also attend. The weekly club meetings are considered public gatherings.(d) Example 4. A member only organization allows its public assembly hall to be rent ed for wedding s, receptions, reunions, funerals, and other special events. The organization advertises the availability of it s facility for rental by the p ub- lic in a community newsletter. T here are no restrictions on who can rent the hall, so these events are considered public gatherings. However, if the abili ty to rent the hall is based o n membership in the owning organization or membership in an affiliate of the owning organization, then the events would not be considered public gatherings. (e) Example 5. A garden club offers horticultural work - shops for a fee at its facility one day each month. The work - shop is advertised in the comm unity newsletter as being open to anyone who wants to attend. The workshops are consid - ered public gatherings because members of the public can attend, even if registration and/or payment are required. Although a fee is charged, the monthly workshops offered by the garden club do not count towards the fifteen day pecuni - ary gain limitation described in subsection (5)(a) of this rule because the fee only covers the materials and supplies neces - sary to conduct the workshop. (f) Example 6. A member onl y organization rents a pub - lic assembly hall for its monthly board meetings. The board meetings are not open to the public. The organization that owns the facility advertises its availability to the public in the local newspaper. The two organizations are not affiliated with each other. Although the monthly board meetings are not open to the public, they are considered public gatherings for the purpose of this exemption because the rental of the facility is not being restricted to only members of the owning organization or to members of affiliates of the owning orga - nization. (5) Use of property for pec uniary gain or to promote business activities. If a public meeting hall, public meeting place, or community meeting ha ll exempt under subsection (3) of this (( section )) rule is used for pecuniary gain or to pro - mote business activities, the property tax exemption will be lost (( for the assessment year following the year in which the exempt property is so used )). However, the exemption will not be lost if: (a) The exempt property is used for pecuniary gain or to promote business activities (( seven )) fifteen days or less in an assessment year; (( or)) (b) In a county with a population of less than (( ten)) twenty thousand people, the exempt property is used to pro - mote the following business activities: Dance lessons; art classes; or music lessons(( ; or (c) The exempt property is inadvertently used by an indi - vidual, organization, associati on, or a corporation for pecuni - ary gain or to promote business activities if the inadvertent use is not a pattern of use. A \"pattern of use\" is presumed when an inadvertent use of the property for pecuniary gain or to promote business activities is repeated within the same assessment year or within two or more successive assessment years )). The rental income or donations, if any, must be rea - sonable and not exceed the m aintenance and operation expenses attributable to the portion of the property loaned or rented; (c) The exempt property is used to conduct a farmers market, as defined in RCW 66. 24.170, for fifty-three days or Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-014 [ 31 ] Permanentless each assessment year. The ren tal income or donations, if any, must be reasonable and no t exceed the maintenance and operation expenses attributable to the portion of the property loaned or rented; or (d) All income received from the rental or use of the exempt property is used for capital improvements to the exempt property, maintenance and operation expenses of the exempt property, or exempt purposes . (((5))) (6) Additional requirements. A n y nonprofit organization, association, or corporation that applies for a property tax exemption under this (( section )) rule must also comply with the provisions of WAC 458-16-165. WAC 458-16-165 (( sets forth )) provides additional conditions and requirements that must be (( complied with )) satisfied to obtain a property tax exemption pursuant to RCW 84.36.037.

The rule adopted on August 1, 2016, differs from the rule proposed on February 1, 2016 . Ecology made these changes: In response to comments we received during the formal comment period. To ensure clarity and consistency. To meet the intent of the authorizing statute. To consider new information. The following content describes the changes between the proposed and adopted rule language, and ecology's reasons for making them. New language is underlined, and deleted language is in strikethrough. Example: New language . Example: Deleted language . Change to WAC-173-201A-020: Ecology clarified the definition of \"intake credit\" to be consistent with language in WAC 173-201A-460 [(1)](a). Proposed rule language : [\"]\"Intake credit\" is a proce dure for establishing effluent limits that take into account the amount of a pollutant that is present in waters of the state, at the time water is removed from the body of water by the discharger or other facility sup - plying the discharger with intake water.\" Final rule language : [\"]\"Intake credit\" is a proce dure for establishing effluent limits that take s into account the amount of a pollutant that is present in waters of the state, at the time water is removed from the same body of water by the discharger or other facil - ity supplying the discharger with intake water.\" Change to WAC- 173-201A-240(5): Based on public comment, ecology moved language regarding criteria revi - sion from the section that addresses only aquatic life protec - tion ((5)(a)) to the more inclusive provision (5) that will include both aquatic life and human health. Proposed rule language : (5) The following criteria, found in Table 240, shall be applied to all surface waters of the state of Washington. Val -WSR 16-16-095 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 60 ]ues are \u00b5g/L for all substances except ammonia and chloride, which are mg/L, and asbestos which is million fibers/L. (a) Aquati c life protection . The department may revise the following criteria in Table 240 for aquatic life on a state - wide or water body-specific basis as needed to protect a quatic life occurring in waters of the state and to increase the technical a ccuracy of the criteria being applied. The department shall formally adopt any appropriate revised cri - teria as part of this chapter in accordance with the provisions establ ished in chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Proce - dure Act. The department shall ensure there are early oppor - tunities for public review and comment on proposals to develop revised criteria. Final rule language : (5) The following criteria, found in Table 240, shall be app lied to all surface waters of the state of Washington. Val - ues are \u00b5g/L for all substanc e s except ammonia and chloride which are mg/L, and asbestos which is million fibers/L. The department shall formally adopt any appropriate revised cri - teria as part of this chapter in accordance with the provisions established in chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Proce - dure Act.

The department shall formally adopt any appropriate revised criteria as part of this chapter in accordance with the provisions established in chapter 34.05 RCW, the Administrative Procedure Act. Change to WAC 173-201A- 2 40 Cadmium footnote indicators : Based on public comments, ecology corrected footnote indicators for cadmium. The proposed rule language included an incorrect aquatic lif e criteria footnote indicator due to a transcription error. Proposed rule language : Aquatic Life Criteria - Freshwater Chemical CAS# Acute Chronic Cadmium 7440439 (I, c, dd) (I, c, dd) Final rule language : Aquatic Life Criteria - Freshwater Chemical CAS# Acute Chronic Cadmium 7440439 (i, c, dd) (j, c, dd) Change to WAC 173-201A-240 Bis(2-Chloroisopro - pyl) Ether : After the rule proposal comment period closed, EPA notified ecology that information from EPA on which ecology had originally based the proposed criteria for Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) Ether was in error. Ecology corrected the error, which includes changing the CAS# and removing the criteria from Table 240. Pleas e see Key Decision Document (Publication no. 16-10-025) for documentation to support this change. Proposed rule language : Human Heath Criteria for Consumption of Chemical CAS#Water & Or ganisms Chronic Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) Ether108601 1,100 7,400 Final rule language : Human Heath Criteria for Consumption of Chemical CAS#Water & Orga nismsOrganisms Bis(2-Chloroisopropyl) Ether39638329 - - Change to WAC 173-201A-510 (4)(c) : Based on public comments, ecology removed r eference language from the proposed rule. This language was not needed and added con - fusion to this section. Additional ly, the word \"practicable\" to \"possible\" to make the state language consistent with lan - guage in the federal regulations found at 40 C.F.R. 122.47. Proposed rule language : (d) Prior to establishing a schedule of compliance, the dep artment shall require the discharger to evaluate the pos - sibility of achieving water quality standards via nonconstruc - tion changes (e.g., facility operation, pollution prevention). Schedules of compliance shall meet requirements in WAC 173-220-140 and shall require compliance with the specified requirements as soon as practicable . Final rule language : (d) Prior to establishing a schedule of compliance, the dep artment shall require the discharger to evaluate the pos - sibility of achieving water quality standards via nonconstruc - tion changes (e.g., facility operation, pollution prevention). S chedules of compliance shall require compliance with the specified requirements as soon as possible . Change to WAC 173-201A-510 (4)(b) : Based on public comments, ecology changed the w ord \"practicable\" to \"possi - ble\" to make the state language consistent within the rule, and also consistent with language in the federal regulations found at 40 C.F.R. 122.47. Proposed rule language : (b) Schedules of compliance shall be developed to ensure final compliance with all water quality-based effluent limits and the water quality standards in the shortest practicable time. Final rule language : (b) Schedules of compliance shall be developed to ensure final compliance with all water quality-based effluent limits and the water quality standards as soon as possible . Change to WAC 173-201A-510 (4)(e) : In 2009, the leg - islature directed ecology to a uthorize compliance schedules longer than ten years to implement TMDL requirements if certain conditions are met (RCW 90.48.605). Since the rule language no longer limits compliance schedules to ten years, Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-095 [ 61 ] autho - rizing Ecology reworded WAC 173-201A-510 ( 4)(e) to improve clarity. Proposed rule language : (e) When an approved total maximum daily load , or TMDL, has established waste load allocations for permitted dischargers, a longer period of time for a compliance sched - ule may be authorized if the department has determined that : Final rule language : (e) When an approved total maximum daily load has established waste load allocations for permitted dischargers, the department may authorize a compliance schedule longer than ten years if : A final cost-benefit analysis is available by contacting Becca Conklin, Water Quality P rogram, Washington Depart - ment of Ecology, P.O.

The following defi - nitions are intended to facilitate the use of chapter 173-201A WAC: \"1-DMax\" or \"1-day maximum temperature\" is the highest water temperature reached on any given day. This measure can be obtained using calibrated maximum/mini - mum thermometers or continuous monitoring probes having sampling intervals of thirty minutes or less. \"7-DADMax\" o r \"7-day average of the daily maxi - mum temperatures\" is the arithmetic average of seven con - secutive measures of daily maximum temperatures. The 7- DADMax for any individual day is calculated by averaging that day's daily maximum temperature with the daily maxi - mum temperatures of the three days prior and the three days after that date. \"Action value\" means a total phosphorus (TP) value established at the upper limit of the trophic states in each ecoregion (see Table 230(1)). Exceedance of an action value indicates that a problem is su spected. A lake-specific study may be needed to confirm if a nutrient problem exists. \"Actions\" refers broadly to any h uman projects or activ - ities. \"Acute conditions\" are changes in the physical, chemi - cal, or biologic environment which are expected or demon - strated to result in injury or death to an organism as a result of short-term exposure to the sub stance or detrimental environ - mental condition. \"AKART\" is an acronym for \"all known, available, and reasonable methods of preventio n, control, and treatment.\" AKART shall represent the most current methodology that can be reasonably required for preventing, co ntrolling, or abating the pollutants associat ed with a discharge. The con - cept of AKART applies to both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. The term \"best manag ement practices,\" typically applied to nonpoint source pollution controls is considered a subset of the AKART requirement. \"Background\" means the biological, chemical, and physical conditions of a water body, outside the area of influ - ence of the discharge under consideration. Background sam - pling locations in an enforcement action would be up-gradi - ent or outside the area of influence of the discharge. If sever al discharges to any water body exist, and enforcement action is being taken for possible viola tions to the standards, back - ground sampling would be undertaken immediately up-gradi - ent from each discharge. \"Best management p ractices (BMP)\" means physical, structural, and/or m anagerial practices approved by the department that, when used singularly or in combination, pre - vent or reduce pollutant discharges. \"Biological assessment\" is an evaluation of the biolog - ical condition of a water body using surveys of aquatic com - munity structure and function and other direct measurements of resident biota in surface waters. \"Bog\" means those wetlands that are acidic, peat form - ing, and whose primary water so urce is precipitation, with lit - tle, if any, outflow. \"Carcinogen\" means any substance or agent that pro - duces or tends to produce can cer in humans. For implementa - tion of this chapter, the term carcinogen will apply to sub - stances on the United States Environmental Protection Agency lists of A (known human) and B (probable human) carcinogens, and any substan ce which causes a significant increased incidence of benign or malignant tumors in a sin - gle, well conducted animal bioa ssay, consistent with the weight of evidence approach specified in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Guidelines for Carcino - genic Risk Assessment as set f orth in 51 FR 33992 et seq. as presently published or as subsequently amended or repub - lished. \"Chronic conditions\" are changes in the physical, chemical, or biologic environment which are expected or demonstrated to result in injury or death to an organism as a result of repeated or constant exposure over an extended period of time to a substance or detrimental environmental condition. \"Combined sewer overflow (CSO) treatment plant\" is a facility that provides at-s ite treatment as provided for i n chapter 173-245 WAC. A CSO treatment plant is a specific WSR 16-16-095 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 62 ]facility identified in a department-approved CSO reduction plan (long-term control plan) that is designed, operated and controlled by a municipal utility to capture and treat excess combined sanitary sewage and storm water from a combined sewer system. \"Compliance schedule\" or \"schedule of compliance\" is a schedule of remedial measur es included in a permit or an order, including an e nforceable sequence of interim require - ments (for example, actions, operations, or milestone events) leading to compliance with an effluent limit, other prohibi - tion, or standard. \"Created wetlands\" means those wetlands intention - ally created from nonwetland s ites to produce or replace nat - ural wetland habitat. \"Critical condition\" is when the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the receiving water environ - ment interact with the effluent to produce the greatest poten - tial adverse impact on aquatic biota and existing or desig - nated water uses. For steady-state discharges to riverine sys - tems the critical condition may be assumed to be equal to the 7Q10 flow event unless determ ined otherwise by the depart - ment. \"Damage to the ecosystem\" means any demonstrated or predicted stress to aquatic o r terrestrial organisms or com - munities of organisms which the department reasonably con - cludes may interfere in the heal th or survival success or natu - ral structure of such populations. This stress may be due to, but is not limited to, alteration in habitat or changes in wate r temperature, chemistry, or turbi dity, and shall consider the potential build up of discharge constituents or temporal increases in habitat alteration which may create such stress in the long term. \"Department\" means the state of Washington depart - ment of ecology. \"Designated uses\" are those uses specified in this chap - ter for each water body or segme nt, regardless of whether or not the uses are cu rrently attained. \"Director\" means the director of the state of Washing - ton department of ecology. \"Drainage ditch\" means that portion of a designed and constructed conveyance system that serves the purpose of transporting surplus water; this may include natural water courses or channels incorporated in the system design, but does not include the area adj acent to the water course or channel. \"Ecoregions\" are defined using EPAs Ecoregions of the Pacific Northwest Document No. 600/3-86/033 July 1986 by Omernik and Gallant. \"Enterococci\" refers to a subgroup of fecal streptococci that includes S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. gallinarum, and S. avium . The enterococci are differentiated from other strepto - cocci by their ability to grow in 6.5% sodium chloride, at pH 9.6, and at 10\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C. \"E. coli \" or \"Escherichia coli \" is an aerobic and facul - tative gram negative nonspore forming rod shaped bacterium that can grow at 44.5 degrees Celsius that is ortho-nitrophe - nyl-B-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) positive and Methylum - belliferyl glucuronide (MUG) positive. \"Existing uses\" means those uses actually attained in fresh or marine waters on or after November 28, 1975, whether or not they are designated uses. Introduced species that are not native to Washingto n, and put-and-take fisheries comprised of nonself-replicatin g introduced native species, do not need to receive full support as an existing use. \"Extraordinary p rimary contact\" means waters pro - viding extraordinary protection against waterborne disease or that serve as tributaries to ext raordinary quality shellfish ha r- vesting areas. \"Fecal coliform\" means that portion of the coliform group which is present in the intestinal tracts and feces of warm-blooded animals as detect ed by the product of acid or gas from lactose in a suitable culture medium within twenty- four hours at 44.5 plus or minus 0.2 degrees Celsius. \"Geometric mean\" means either the nth root of a prod - uct of n factors, or the antilogarithm of the arithmetic mean o f the logarithms of the individual sample values. \"Ground water exchange\" means the discharge and recharge of ground water to a surface water. Discharge is inflow from an aquifer, seeps or springs that increases the available supply of surface wate r. Recharge is outflow down - gradient to an aquifer or do wnstream to surface water for base flow maintenance. Exchange may include ground water discharge in one season followed by recharge later in the year. \"Hardness\" means a measure of the calcium and mag - nesium salts present in water. For purposes of this chapter, hardness is measured in milligrams per liter and expressed as calcium carbonate (CaCO3). \"Intake credit\" is a procedure for establishing effluent limits that takes into account th e amount of a pollutant that i s present in waters of the state, at the time water is removed from the same body of water by the discharger or other facil - ity supplying the discharger with intake water. \"Irrigation ditch\" means that portion of a designed and constructed conveyance system that serves the purpose of transporting irrigation water from its supply source to its place of use; this may include natural water courses or chan - nels incorporated in the system design, but does not include the area adjacent to the w ater course or channel. \"Lakes\" shall be distinguished from riverine systems as being water bodies, including reservoirs, with a mean deten - tion time of greater than fifteen days. \"Lake-specific study\" means a study intended to quan - tify existing nutrient concentrations, determine existing char - acteristic uses for lake class waters, and potential lake uses. The study determines how to protect these uses and if any uses are lost or impaired beca use of nutrients, algae, or aquatic plants. An appropriate s tudy must recommend a crite - rion for total phosphorus t that impairs ch aracteristic uses by causing excessive algae blooms or aquatic plant growth. \"Mean detention time\" means the time obtained by dividing a reservoir's mean annual minimum total storage by the thirty-day ten-year low-flow from the reservoir. \"Migration or translocation\" means any natural move - ment of an organism or community of organisms from one locality to another locality. \"Mixing zone\" means that portion of a water body adja - cent to an effluent outfall where mixing results in the dilutio n of the effluent with the receivi ng water. Water quality criteri a Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-095 [ 63 ] Permanentmay be exceeded in a mixing z one as conditioned and pro - vided for in WAC 173-201A-400. \"Natural conditions\" or \"natural background levels\" means surface water quality that was present before any human-caused pollution. When estimating natural conditions in the headwaters of a disturbed watershed it may be neces - sary to use the less disturbed conditions of a neighboring or similar watershed as a reference condition. (See also WAC 173-201A-260(1).) \"New or expanded actions\" mean human actions that occur or are regulated for the first time, or human actions expanded such that they result in an increase in pollution, after July 1, 2003, for the purpose of applying this chapter only. \"Nonpoint source\" means pollution that enters any waters of the state from any di spersed land-based or water- based activities including, but not limited to, atmospheric deposition; surface water runoff from agricultural lands, urban areas, or forest lands ; subsurface or underground sources; or discharges from boa ts or marine vessels not oth - erwise regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program. \"Permit\" means a document issued pursuant to chapter 90.48 RCW specifying the waste treatment and control requirements and waste discharge conditions. \"pH\" means the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. \"Pollution\" means such contamination, or other alter - ation of the physical, chemical, or biological properties, of any waters of the state, inclu ding change in temperature, taste, color, turbidity, or odor of the waters, or such dischar ge of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or other substance into any waters of the state as will or is likely to create a n ui- sance or render such waters harmful, detrimental, or injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare, or to domestic, com - mercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, or other legit i- mate beneficial uses, or to livestock, wild animals, birds, fis h, or other aquatic life. \"Primary contact recreation\" means activities where a person would have direct contact with water to the point of complete submergence including, but not limited to, skin div - ing, swimming, and water skiing. \"Secondary contact recreation\" means activities where a person's water contact would be limited (e.g., wading or fishing) to the extent that b acterial infections of eyes, ea rs, respiratory or digestive systems, or urogenital areas would normally be avoided. \"Shoreline stabilization\" means the anchoring of soil at the water's edge, or in shallow water, by fibrous plant root complexes; this may include lo ng-term accretion of sediment or peat, along with shoreline progradation in such areas. \"Storm water\" means that portion of precipitation that does not naturally percolate into the ground or evaporate, but flows via overland flow, interflow, pipes, and other features of a storm water drainage syst em into a defined surface water body, or a constructed infiltration facility. \"Storm water attenuation\" means the process by which peak flows from precipita tion are reduced and runoff velocities are slowed as a result of passing through a surface water body.\"Surface waters of the state\" includes lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, saltwaters, wetlands and all other surface waters and water c ourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington. \"Temperature\" means water temperature expressed in degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). \"Treatment wetlands\" means those wetlands inten - tionally constructed on nonwetland sites and managed for the primary purpose of wastewater or storm water treatment. Treatment wetlands are considered part of a collection and treatment system, and generally are not subject t o the criteria of this chapter. \"Trophic state\" means a classification of the productiv - ity of a lake ecosystem. Lake productivity depends on the amount of biologically available nutrients in water and sedi - ments and may be based on to tal phosphorus (TP). Secchi depth and chlorophyll-a measurements may be used to improve the trophic state classification of a lake. Trophic states used in this rule include, from least to most nutrient rich, ultra-oligotrophic, oligotrophic, lower mesotrophic, upper mesotrophic, and eutrophic. means the clarity of water expressed as nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and measured with a calibrated turbidimeter. \"Upwelling\" means the natural process along Washing - ton's Pacific Coast where the summer prevailing northerly winds produce a seaward transp ort of surface water. Cold, deeper more saline waters rich in nutrients and low in dis - solved oxygen, rise to replace the surface water. The cold oxygen deficient water enters Puget Sound and other coastal estuaries at depth where it disp laces the existing deep water and eventually rises to replace the surface water. Such sur - face water replacement results in an overall increase in salin - ity and nutrients accompanied by a depression in dissolved oxygen. Localized upwelling o f the deeper water of Puget Sound can occur year-round under i nfluence of tidal currents, winds, and geomorphic features. \"USEPA\" means the United States Environmental Pro - tection Agency. \"Variance\" is a time-limited designated use and crite - rion as defined in 40 C.F.R. 131.3, and must be adopted by rule. \"Wetlands\" means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground wate r at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and s imilar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetla nds intentionally created from nonwetland sites(( ,)) including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-li ned swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatme nt facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the con - struction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwet - land areas to mitigate the conv ersion of wetlands. (Water bodies not included in the definition of wetlands as well as those mentioned in the definition are still waters of the state .)WSR 16-16-095 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 64 ]\"Wildlife habitat\" means waters of the state used by, or that directly or indirectly provide food support to, fish, othe r aquatic life, and wildlife for a ny life history stage or activi ty.

The MCL for total arsenic is applied to sur face waters where consumption of organ - isms-only and where co n sumption of water + organisms reflect th e des - ignated uses. When the department determines that a direct or i ndirect industrial discharge to surface waters designated for domestic water supply may be adding arsenic to its wastewater, the department will require the discharger to develop and implement a pollution pre vention plan to reduce arsenic through the use of AKART. Industrial was tewater discharges to a privately or pub licly owned wastewater treatmen t facil - ity are considered indirect discharges. B.This criterion was calculated based on an additional lifetime c ancer risk of one-in-one-million (1 x 10-6 risk level). C.This criterion is based on a re gulatory level developed under t he Safe Drinking Water Act. D.This recommended water quality cr iterion is expressed as total cyanide, even though the integrated risk information system RfD used to derive the criterion is based on free cy anide. The multiple forms of c yanide that are present in ambient wate r have significant differences in toxicity due to their differing abilities to liberate the CN-moiety. Som e complex cyanides require even more extreme conditions than refluxing wi th sul - furic acid to liberate the CN-moi ety. Thus, these complex cyani des are expected to have little or no \" bioavailability\" to humans. If a substantial fraction of the cyanide present i n a water body is present in a complexed form (e.g., Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3), this criterion may be overly conser vative. E.This criterion applies to total P CBs, (e.g., the sum of all con gener or all isomer or homolog or Aroclor analyses). The PCBs criteria were calcu - lated using a chemical-sp ecific risk level of 4 x 10-5. Because that cal - culation resulted in a higher (le ss protective) concentration t han the cur - rent criterion concentr atio n (40 C.F.R. 131.36) the state made a chemi- cal-specific decision to stay a t the current criterion concentr ation. F.This criterion was der ived using the cance r slope factor of 1.4 (linear - ized multistage model with a two fold increase to 1.4 per mg/kg- day to account for continuous lifetime exposure from birth).

Variances for individual facilities, a group of facilities, or stretches of waters may be issued for the criteria and designated uses established in WAC 173- 201A-200 through 173-201A-260 and 173-201A-600 through 173-201A-612. The conditions apply when considering issu ance of a variance: (a) A variance may be considered when the standards are expected to be attained by the end of the variance period or the attainable use cannot be reliably determined. (b) The variance applies to s pecific parameters and all other applicable standards rema in in effect for the water body. (c) The modification must be consistent with the require - ments of federal reg ulations (currently 40 C.F.R. 131.14). (d) Reasonable progress mu st be made toward meeting the underlying standards during the variance period. (e) A variance renewal may be considered if the renewal request meets the above conditions. (2) Types of variances. Upon request or on its own ini - tiative, the department will consider granting the following types of variances to existin g water quality standards: (a) An individual variance is a time-limited designated use and parameter-specific chan ge to the standard(s) of the receiving water body for a specific discharger. The temporary standard(s) only apply at the point(s) of compliance for the individual facility. (b) A multidischarger variance is a time-limited desig - nated use and parameter-specific change to the standard(s) of any water body that receives discharges from a permitted facility defined within the scop e of the multidischarger vari - ance. Any permitted discharger that is defined within the scope of the variance may be covered under the variance that is granted by the department, provided all requirements of the variance for that discharger are met. (c) A water body variance is a time-limited designated use and parameter-specific cha nge to the standard(s) for a stretch of waters. Any discharger of the specific parameter that is defined within the geographic scope of the water body variance may be covered under the variance that is granted by the department, provided all requirements of the variance for that discharger are met. (3) Requirements. Any entity initiating a variance request or applying for coverage for an individual, multidis - charger, or water body variance must submit the following information to t he department: (a) The pollutant-specific crit eria and designated use(s) proposed to be modified by the variance, and the proposed duration of the variance. (b) A demonstration that attaining the water quality stan - dard for a specific pollutant is not feasible for the requested duration of the variance ba sed on 40 C.F.R. 131.14. (c) An evaluation of treatment or alternative actions that were considered to meet effluent limits based on the underly - ing water quality criteria, and a description of why these options are not technically, ec onomically, or otherwise feasi - ble. (d) Sufficient water quality data and analyses to charac - terize receiving and discharge water pollutant concentrations. (e) A description and schedule of actions that the dis - charger(s) proposes to ensure the underlying water quality standard(s) are met or the highest attainable use is attained within the variance period. Dis chargers are also required to submit a schedule for development and implementation of a pollutant minimization plan for the subject pollutant(s). (f) If the variance is for a w ater body or stretch of water, the following information must also be provided to the department: (i) The results from a pollu tant source assessment that quantifies the contribution of pollution from permitted sources and nonpermitted sources; (ii) All cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for permitted sources t hat address the pollutant the variance is based upon; and (iii) Best management pra ctices for nonpermitted sources that meet the require ments of chapter 90.48 RCW. (g) Any additional information the department deems necessary to evalua te the application. (4) Public review and notification. The decision to grant a variance is a formal rule making subject to a public and intergovernmental involvement process. (a) The department will provide notice of the proposed variance and consult with India n tribes or other states that have jurisdiction over adjacent and downstream waters of the proposed variance. (b) The department shall maintain and make publicly available a list of dischargers t hat are covered under the vari - ances that are in effect. (5) Period during which the variance is in effect. A variance is a time-limited des ignated use and criterion. (a) Each variance will be gr anted for the minimum time estimated to meet the underlying standard(s) or, if during the period of the variance it is determined that a designated use cannot be attained, then a use attainability analysis (WAC 173-201A-440) will be initiated. (b) The ability to apply a variance in permits or other actions may be terminated by th e department as a result of a mandatory interim review. (c) Variances are in effect a fter they have been incorpo - rated into this chapter and approved by the USEPA. (6) Contents of a variance. At a minimum a variance adopted into rule will include the following: (a) The time period for whic h the variance is applicable. (b) The geographic area or s pecific waters in which the variance is applicable. (c) A description of the permitted and unpermitted dis - chargers covered by the variance. (d) Identification of required actions and a schedule, including any measurable milestones, for all pollution sources (permitted and unpermitted) subject to the variance. Dischargers are required to us e adaptive management to fine- tune and update actions, schedule s, and milestones in order to achieve the goals of the variance. (e) A provision allowing the department to reopen and modify any permits and to revise BMP requirements for unpermitted dischargers as a result of the mandatory interim review of the varian ce (see subsection (8) of this section). (7) Variance permit conditions. The department must establish and incorporate into NPDES permits all conditions necessary to implement and enforce an approved variance, including:Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-095 [ 73 ] Permanent(a) Effluent limits that represent currently achieved or achievable effluent conditions, or effluent limits that are suf - ficient to meet the underlying water quality standard upon expiration of the variance; (b) Monitoring and repor ting requirements; and (c) A provision allowing the department to reopen and modify the permits based on the mandatory interim review of the variance. (8) Mandatory interim review. The department will conduct an interim review of each variance at least once every five years after the varian ce is adopted and approved to determine that conditions of the variance are being met and to evaluate whether the var iance is still necessary. (a) Review process for individual discharger and multi - discharger variances: (i) The review shall be coordinated with the public review process of the permit renewal if the variance is being implemented in a permit. (ii) The review will be focu sed on the discharger's com - pliance with permit conditions that are required by the vari - ance as well as an evaluation of whether the variance is still necessary. (b) Review process for water body variances: (i) Variances for stretches o f waters will be reviewed in a public process conducted by the department every five years after the variance is adopted into this chapter and approved by the USEPA. (ii) The review will evaluate whether the variance is still necessary, any new informatio n on sources of the pollutant that indicates that reductions could be made that would allow water quality standards to be met in a shorter time frame, as well as any new information th at indicates water quality improvements may r equire more time. (c) A variance that applies to a permit will be shortened or terminated if the r eview determines that: (i) The conditions and requir ements of the variance and associated permit requirements have not been complied with unless reasons outside the control of the discharger prevented meeting any condition or requirement; or (ii) Water quality standards could be met in a shorter time frame, based on new info rmation submitted to the department. NEW SECTION WAC 173-201A-460 Intake credits. (1) General pro - visions. The following provisions apply to the consideration of intake credits in determini ng reasonable potential and establishing water quality based effluent limits (WQBELs). (a) An \"intake pollutant\" is the amount of a pollutant that is present in waters of the state (including groundwater except as provided in (c) of this subsection) at the time water is removed from the same body of water by the discharger or other facility supplying the discharger with intake water. (b) An intake pollutant must be from the \"same body of water\" as the discharge in order to be eligible for an intake credit. An intake pollutant is co nsidered to be from the \"same body of water\" as the discharge if the department finds that the intake pollutant would have reached the vicinity of the outfall point in the receiving w ater within a reasonable period had it not been removed by the pe rmittee. This finding will be established if a discharger demonstrates: (i) The background concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water (excluding any am ount of the pollutant in the facility's discharge) is similar to that in the intake water; a nd (ii) There is a direct hydrological connection between the intake and discharge points. (c) An intake pollutant in groundwater partially or entirely due to human activity is not eligible for use of an intake credit. (d) Where intake water for a facility is provided by a municipal water supply system and the supplier provides treatment of the raw water that removes an intake water pol - lutant, the concentration of the intake water pollutant will be determined at the point where the water enters the water sup - plier's distribution system. (e) Where a facility discharges intake pollutants from multiple sources that originate from the receiving water body and from other water bodies, th e department may derive an effluent limit reflecting the flow-weighted amount of each source of the pollutant provided that conditions in subsection (3) of this section are met and adequate monitoring to deter - mine compliance can be established and is included in the permit. (f) The department may also consider other site-specific factors relevant to the transport and fate of the pollutant to make the finding in a particular case that a pollutant would or would not have reached the vicinit y of the outfall point in the receiving water within a reason able period had it not been removed by the permittee. (2) Consideration of intake pollutants in reasonable potential determination. (a) The department may determine there is no reasonable potential for the discharge of a n identified intake pollutant t o cause or contribute to an e xceedance of a narrative or numeric water quality criterion where a discharger demon - strates that all the following conditions are met: (i) The facility removes the i ntake water containing the pollutant from the same body of water into which the dis - charge is made; (ii) The facility does not alte r the identified intake pollut - ant chemically or physically i n a manner that would cause adverse water quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the pollutant had not been removed from the body of water; (iii) The timing and location of the discharge would not cause adverse water quality impacts to occur that would not occur if the identified intake pollutant had not been removed from the body of water; (iv) The facility does not inc rease the identified intake pollutant concentration at the edge of the mixing zone, or at the point of discharge if a mixing zone is not allowed, as compared to the pollutant concen tration in the intake water, unless the increased concentration does not cause or contrib - ute to an excursion above an a pplicable water quality stan - dard; and (v) The facility does not contribute any additional mass of the identified intake pollutant to its wastewater. (b) Upon a finding under (a) of this subsection that an intake pollutant in the discharge does not cause, have the rea - sonable potential to cause, or contribute to an exceedance of WSR 16-16-095 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 16-16 Permanent [ 74 ]an applicable water quality standard, the department is not required to include a water quality-based effluent limit for th e identified intake pollutant in the facility's permit. (3) Consideration of intake po llutants in establishing water quality based effluent limits. (a) This subsection applies only when the ambient back - ground concentration of the intake pollutant does not meet the most stringent applicable water quality criterion for that pollutant; (b) The requirements of subsection (2)(a)(i) and (iv) also apply to this subsection. (c) A discharger may add mass of the pollutant to its waste stream if an equal or gr eater mass is removed prior to discharge, so there is no net addition of the pollutant in the discharge compared t o the intake water. (d) Where the conditions of th is subsection are met, the department may establish effluent limits using an intake credit. The facility's permit must specify how compliance with the limits will be assessed. AMENDATORY SECTION (Amending WSR 03-14-129, filed 7/1/03, effective 8/1/03) WAC 173-201A-510 Means of implementation. (1) Permitting. The primary means to be used for controlling municipal, commercial, and indus trial waste discharges shall be through the issuance of waste discharge permits, as pro - vided for in RCW 90.48.160, 90.48.162, and 90.48.260. Waste discharge permits, whether issued pursuant to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System or other - wise, must be conditioned so the discharges authorized will meet the water quality standards. No waste discharge permit can be issued that causes or contr ibutes to a violation of wate r quality criteria, except as p rovided for in this chapter. (a) Persons discharging wastes in compliance with the terms and conditions of permits are not subject to civil and criminal penalties on the basis that the discharge violates water quality standards. (b) Permits must be modified by the department when it is determined that the discharge causes or contributes to a violation of water quality standards. Major modification of permits is subject to review in the same manner as the origi - nally issued permits. (2) Miscellaneous waste disc harge or water quality effect sources. The director shall, through the issuance of regulatory permits, directives, and orders, as are appropriate, control miscellaneous waste discharges and water quality effect sources not covered by subsection (1) of this section. (3) Nonpoint source and st orm water pollution. (a) Activities which generat e nonpoint source pollution shall be conducted so as to comply with the water quality standards. The primary means to be used for requiring com - pliance with the standards shall be through best management practices required in waste dis charge permits, rules, orders, and directives issued by the de partment for activities which generate nonpoint source pollution. (b) Best management practi ces shall be applied so that when all appropriate combinations of individual best man - agement practices are utilized, violation of water quality cri - teria shall be prevented. If a discharger is applying all best management practices appropriate or required by the depart - ment and a violation of water quality criteria occurs, the dis - charger shall modify existing pr actices or apply further water pollution control measures, selected or approved by the department, to achieve comp liance with water quality crite - ria. Best management practi ces established in permits, orders, rules, or directives of the department shall be reviewed and modified, as appr opriate, so as to achieve com - pliance with water quality criteria. (c) Activities which contribute to nonpoint source pollu - tion shall be conducted utilizing best management practices to prevent violation of water quality criteria. When applicable best management practices are not being implemented, the department may conclude individual activities are causing pollution in violation of RCW 90.48.080. In these situations, the department may pursue orders, directives, permits, or civil or criminal sanctions to gain compliance with the stan - dards. (d) Activities which cause p ollution of storm water shall be conducted so as to comply with the water quality stan - dards. The primary means to be used for requiring compli - ance with the standards shall be through best management practices required in waste disch arge permits, rules, orders, and directives issued by the de partment for activities which generate storm water pollution. The consideration and con - trol procedures in (b) and (c) of this subsection apply to the control of pollutants in storm water. (4) General allowance for compliance schedules. (a) Permits(( ,)) and orders(( , and directives of )) issued by the department for existing discharges may include a sched - ule for achieving compliance with effluent limits and water quality (( criteria contained in this chapter )) standards that apply to: (i) Aquatic life uses; and (ii) Uses other than aquatic life . ((Such )) (b) S chedules of compliance shall be developed to ensure final compliance with all water quality-based efflu - ent limits (( in the shortest practicab le time. Decisions regard - ing)) and the water quality standards as soon as possible. The department will decide whether to issue schedules of compli - ance (( will be made )) on a case-by-case basis (( by the depart - ment )). Schedules of compliance may not be issued for new discharges. Examples of s chedules of compliance that may be issued (( to allow for )) include : (i) Construction of necessa ry treatment capability; (ii) Implementation of necessary best management prac - tices; (iii) Implementation of additional storm water best man - agement practices for discharges determined not to meet water quality (( criteria )) standards following implementation of an initial set of best management practices; and (iv) Completion of necessary water quality studies(( ; or (v) resolution of a pending water quality standards' issue through rule-making action )) related to implementation of permit requirements to meet effluent limits . (((b))) (c) For the period of time during which compli - ance with water quality (( criteria )) standards is deferred, interim effluent (( limitations )) limits shall be formally estab - lished, based on the best profe ssional judgment of the depart - ment. Interim effluent (( limitations )) limits may be numeric Washington State R egister, Issue 16 -16 WSR 16-16-101 [ 75 ] Permanentor nonnumeric (e.g., construction of necessary facilities by a specified date as contained in an (( ecology )) order or permit) , or both . (((c))) (d) Prior to establishing a schedule of compliance, the department shall require the discharger to evaluate the possibility of achieving water quality (( criteria )) standards via nonconstruction changes (e.g., facility operation, pollu - tion prevention). Schedules of compliance (( may in no case exceed ten years, and )) shall require compliance with the specified requirements as s oon as possible. Compliance schedules shall generally not exceed the term of any permit unless the department determines that a longer time period is needed to come into complian ce with the applicable water quality standards. (e) When an approved total maximum daily load has established waste load allocations for permitted dischargers, the department may authorize a compliance schedule longer than ten years if: (i) The permittee is not able to meet its waste load allo - cation in the TMDL solely by controlling and treating its own effluent; (ii) The permittee has made significant progress to reduce pollutant loading dur ing the term of the permit; (iii) The permittee is meeting all of its requirements under the TMDL as soon as possible; and (iv) Actions specified in th e compliance schedule are sufficient to achieve water quality standards as soon as possi - ble. (5) Compliance schedules for dams: (a) All dams in the state of Washington must comply with the provisions of this chapter. (b) For dams that cause or contribute to a violation of the water quality standards, the dam owner must develop a water quality attainment plan that provides a detailed strategy for achieving compliance. The plan must include: (i) A compliance schedule that does not exceed ten years; (ii) Identification of all reasonable and feasible improve - ments that could be used to meet standards, or if meeting the standards is not attainable, then to achieve the highest attain - able level of improvement; (iii) Any department-approve d gas abatement plan as described in WAC 173- 201A-200 (1)(f)(ii); (iv) Analytical methods that will be used to evaluate all reasonable and feasible improvements; (v) Water quality monitoring, which will be used by the department to track the progress in achieving compliance with the state water quality standards; and (vi) Benchmarks and reporting sufficient for the depart - ment to track the applicant's progress toward implementing the plan within the designated time period. (c) The plan must ensure com pliance with all applicable water quality criteria, as wel l as any other requirements established by the department (such as through a total maxi - mum daily load, or TMDL, analysis). (d) If the department is ac ting on an application for a water quality certification, the approved water quality attain - ment plan may be used by the department in its determination that there is reasonable assuran ce that the dam will not cause or contribute to a violation o f the water quality standards.(e) When evaluating compliance with the plan, the department will allow the use of models and engineering esti - mates to approximate design success in meeting the stan - dards. (f) If reasonable progress toward implementing the plan is not occurring in accordance with the designated time frame, the department may declar e the project in violation of the water quality standards and any associated water quality certification. (g) If an applicable water quality standard is not met by the end of the time provided in the attainment plan, or after completion of all reasonable a nd feasible improvements, the owner must take the following steps: (i) Evaluate any new reasonable and feasible technolo - gies that have been developed ( such as new operational or structural modifications) to achieve compliance with the standards, and develop a new compliance schedule to evalu - ate and incorporate the new technology; (ii) After this evaluation, i f no new reasonable and feasi - ble improvements have been identified, then propose an alter - native to achieve compliance with the standards, such as site specific criteria (WAC 173-201A-430), a use attainability analysis (WAC 173-201A-440), or a water quality offset (WAC 173-201A-450). (h) New dams, and any modifications to existing facili - ties that do not comply with a gas abatement or other pollu - tion control plan established to meet criteria for the water body, must comply with the water quality standards at the time of project completion. (i) Structural changes made as a part of a department approved gas abatement plan to aid fish passage, described in WAC 173-201A-200 (1)(f)(ii), may result in system perfor - mance limitations in meeting water quality criteria for that parameter at other times of the year. (6) Combined sewer overfl ow treatment plant. The influent to these facilities is highly variable in frequency, v ol- ume, duration, and pollutant concentration. The primary means to be used for requiring compliance with the human health criteria shall be through the application of narrative limitations which include, but are not limited to, best man - agement practices re quired in waste discharge permits, rules, orders and directives issued by the department.

WSR 16-16-102 PERMANENT RULES DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING [Filed August 2, 2016, 7:43 a.m., effective September 2, 2016] Effective Date of Rule: Th irty-one days after filing. Purpose: This adoption will eliminate the fingerprint requirement for business principa ls where there is a change in motor vehicle dealer business structure or ownership. This change will streamline the application process without com - promising public protection, because the department is able to identify and qualify applicants through other means. Motor vehicle dealers reporting a ch ange in business structure or ownership will avoid the time and expense required to get and submit fingerprint cards for new principals, corporate officers, directors, managing partners, m embers or trustees. In addition the amendment replaces outdated wording \"and legal and financial history\" with the words \"a personal and criminal history statement.\" The intent is to use the same words in rule as are used to d escribe the form used by the department.
