But such services need energy and this comes at a price. Energy consumption has a significant impact on the cost of running treatment plants and on the environment, so plants must aim to reduce energy use while still meeting quality standards. A recent tour of six water and wastewater treatment plants in China, New Zealand and Australia showed me the five main ways in which these plants save energy. Water and energy resources are connected. Source: [Luojie](http://www.cagle.com/tag/world-water-day/). 1. Treatment plants take advantage of gravity. If a water treatment plant can use gravity to obtain water from the source and supply it to the customers, the energy savings are enormous. In Australia, Melbourne's water is largely gravity fed from reservoirs to treatment plants, then on to consumers. This means the city uses around eight times less energy than Adelaide to pump water, despite having more than three times the population (see [Kenway et al.](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clw.csiro.au%2Fpublications%2Fwaterforahealthycountry%2F2008%2Fwfhc-urban-water-energy.pdf&ei=zdfxVM7fF5S3oQS-yYKYCg&usg=AFQjCNGteXnITt2lJQ8XbrR1t4sS4JmzgA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.cGU&cad=rjt) 2008). Melbourne's [Winneke Water Treatment Plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlNjdrZjP4) is connected to the Sugarloaf Reservoir, which currently gets most of its water through an aqueduct from the protected Maroondah Reservoir. The water travels about 40 kilometres by gravity and only gets a boost to lift it the final 50-60 metres from the aqueduct to Sugarloaf Reservoir. Making use of gravity in water supply.

They transfer liquid from one place to another. This could be lifting water up to a higher level or moving water through a system of pipes. Pumps are chosen to handle 'worst case' scenarios. For example, if a water treatment plant needs to pump 1000 litres of water per second in cases of maximum demand, pumps must be chosen to meet this requirement. But maximum flows (or 'worst case' scenarios) only occur sometimes, so pumps are mostly working below their capabilities. Flow can be reduced in different ways, depending on the pump, but some of these waste energy. Certain pumps can only work at one speed. If single-speed pumps are used in treatment plants, flow can be controlled by a valve that can be opened or closed. Valves reduce flow by physically blocking or diverting it. Flow from a single-speed pump can be reduced by turning a valve. Source: [Budris](http://www.waterworld.com/articles/print/volume-27/issue-9/departments/pump-tips-techniques/selecting-the-best-most-efficient-centrifugal-pump-control.html). The problem is that this method does not change the pump speed, which makes it inefficient. The speed of a pump (measured in revolutions per minute or rpm) is related to the power provided to the pump (measured in watts) according to special laws called [affinity laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_laws). These laws tell us that when speed is greater, power is also greater. For example, according to these laws, if you increase the pump speed from 2400 rpm to 3450 rpm (30% difference), the power needed increases from 593 watts to 2000 watts (70% difference) [(Hunt and Easley 2012)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrel.gov%2Fdocs%2Ffy12osti%2F54242.pdf&ei=jt3xVPb7IsHboATO7IDoBQ&usg=AFQjCNGSO5tpbqlOne_vCaudpjtw-pXeYA&bvm=bv.87269000,d.cGU&cad=rjt). For single-speed pumps, speed cannot change and so power supplied is always the same. This wastes energy. Enter pumps with variable frequency drives. These are used by the BDA Reclaimed Water Plant (East) run by [Beijing Boda Water Company](http://www.bdawater.com/). They are also known as variable speed pumps because pump speed (rpm) is directly related to frequency (measured in hertz). These pumps can change speed according to how much flow is needed. This reduces energy use at times when less flow is required. Variable frequency drives reduce pump speed and save energy.

Single-speed pumps always run full-blast and need valves to physically reduce the flow by blocking it or changing its path. Variable frequency pumps slow the pump down to produce less flow. That's what makes them much more energy efficient than single-speed pumps. 3. Treatment plants generate electricity to offset what they use. Okay, so this is not technically saving energy. But when plants produce their own electricity, they take less from the grid. Water treatment plants can generate electricity if water travels to the plant under gravity. Palmerston North's [Turitea Water Treatment Plant](http://www.pncc.govt.nz/services/water-services/water-supply/) gets water from the Turitea Dam, which is located at a higher elevation than the plant. Water travels downhill to the treatment plant and generators create electricity from the movement of water. These generators currently produce enough electricity to totally offset the plant's yearly energy requirements and unused electricity is sold to the grid at a profit. Water taken from Turitea Dam generates electricity. Source: own photo. The wastewater treatment plants I visited did not generate electricity but it is common for wastewater treatment plants to take advantage of the biogas they produce for this purpose. Biogas is mainly made up of methane and carbon dioxide, and is let off when biodegradable material in the wastewater is broken down. If wastewater treatment plants capture this biogas, they can burn it to make electricity, which can then be used to power the plant. In the burning process, methane is consumed and carbon dioxide is produced. This has the extra advantage of cutting down the plant's methane emissions. Methane has 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. 4. Treatment plants reduce filter backwash and air scour times. Filters are used in wastewater and water treatment plants to remove particles from the water. A common type of filter for water treatment plants is a rapid sand filter, where water travels down through a bed of sand and/or coal by gravity. During this process, particles in the water get left in the filter. These particles build up and the filter must be cleaned by sending a flow of clean water through it in the opposite direction (i.e. from bottom to top). This cleaning process is called 'backwash'. Sometimes bursts of clean air are sent up to expand the filter bed and break up compacted particles. This 'air scouring' can speed up and improve the cleaning process while also saving water. The dirty water from backwashing spills over into troughs, which direct it out of the filter. Backwash of a rapid sand filter. Source: [Bungay](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/FILTRATION/sand.htm). Where does energy come into it? Pumping water up through the filter bed against gravity requires energy. So does blowing air up through the material. (Just think about the energy you put into blowing up a balloon). One way of reducing the energy used during the backwash and air scour process is to limit the time to only what is necessary. This reduces the time that pumps and air blowers have to run and saves energy. Palmerston North's water treatment plant is a good example. To work out the most effective backwash time, the plant supervisor tested the turbidity of water just above the filter bed throughout a 10 minute backwash cycle. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness or murkiness of water due to suspended particles. Five minutes after the start of the backwash cycle, turbidity above the filter bed had decreased to a stable value. It remained at this value until the 10-minute cycle was up. The lack of change in turbidity between 5 and 10 minutes showed that this part of the backwash was not helping to clear the filter of unwanted particles. It was just wasting clean water and energy. So the time was reduced. Turitea Water Treatment Plant also reduced the air scour time from 7 minutes to 2 minutes by measuring the head loss across the filter. When water flows down through the filter bed, it rubs against material in the bed and this friction causes the water to lose energy. This means the water leaves the filter with less pressure than when it entered. This reduction in pressure is called 'head loss' and it is measured in metres. Water flowing through a clean filter bed will have low head loss (e.g. 0.1 m) but as the filter becomes more clogged with particles the head loss will increase (e.g. to 1 m). Proper backwash of the sand filter should return the filter to the original (clean bed) head loss. In the case of Turitea plant, running the air scour for 7 minutes returned the filter to clean bed head loss. Running the air scour for 2 minutes also returned the filter to clean bed head loss, but any time under this did not. This meant that 2 minutes was as effective as 7 minutes at cleaning the filter bed. So the air scour time was reduced. Reducing the backwash and air scour times saved the plant a lot of clean water and energy. 5. Plants don't add air to the water when it's not needed. Wastewater treatment facilities often need to add a lot of air to wastewater so that microorganisms (like bacteria) have enough oxygen to break down organic matter in the wastewater. Organic matter is anything that contains carbon and was formed by a living thing, for example plant and animal waste. Microorganisms take the oxygen and the organic matter and turn it into carbon dioxide and other products. This process only works properly and quickly if the right amount of oxygen is available. Adding air to the wastewater using blowers requires a lot of energy. In fact, this process can be responsible for over half of a wastewater treatment plant's energy use ( [Energy Trust of Oregon](https://energytrust.org/library/GetDocument/3441)). So adding air as efficiently as possible is very important. This means adding less air to wastewater that has higher levels of oxygen and lower levels of organic matter. Air bubbles are added to wastewater at Altona Treatment Plant. Source: own photo. In an attempt to increase the efficiency of their aeration system, [Altona Treatment Plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dGcOntEkTY) in Melbourne has replaced one of their normal blowers with a blower that is able to run at only 16% of its capacity. This will help the plant control how much air they add to their wastewater. At times when the wastewater doesn't contain as much organic matter, the plant doesn't need to provide as much oxygen and the blower can be turned down from high to very low. Previously, all blowers had a minimum setting of 50%. Plant managers hope the change will make it easier to save energy. Providing too much oxygen doesn't help the breakdown of organic matter and wastes power. Lastly Altona Treatment Plant also hopes that changing the impeller of the wastewater pump at the entry to the plant will reduce energy. The impeller (the rotating blade part of the pump) currently gets clogged with waste, which increases friction and wastes energy. Turitea Water Treatment Plant saves energy by using baffles to create slow mixing of chemicals with water for treatment. Baffles are mini barriers that are carefully designed and placed to direct the water's flow. Energy for mixing is generated as the water changes direction and energy from a machine is not needed. Baffles (barriers) direct flow and cause mixing. Source: [Granite Environmental](http://www.erosionpollution.com/water_baffle.html). If you liked my post, please click the thumbs up icon and let "}
