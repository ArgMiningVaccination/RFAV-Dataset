The neutropenic diet is an eating plan for people with weakened immune systems. It involves choosing foods and preparing them in a way that lowers your risk of foodborne illness. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may recommend that you follow a neutropenic diet to limit your exposure to harmful microbes and bacteria. Are there other names for this diet? Another name for the neutropenic diet is the low-microbial diet. How does the neutropenic diet help people with cancer? Historically, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and other cancer centers recommended that people with cancer follow a neutropenic diet, which eliminates raw produce, soft cheeses, fast food, and other foods that may overwhelm a person's infection-fighting cells. To increase the variety of foods available to patients and also minimize risk of foodborne illness, MSK no longer prescribes a neutropenic diet and has instead focused nutrition education on [food safety practices](/news/how-people-cancer-can-decrease-food-poisoning-risk). What are the basic principles of the neutropenic diet? The basic principles of this diet involve practicing proper food safety and avoiding foods that are more likely to expose you to microbes and bacteria. People who've had a stem cell transplant typically need to avoid food prepared in restaurants or other establishments for 100 days. Guidelines can be broken up into three categories: foods to avoid, food preparation, and food storage. Food Guidelines - Avoid raw and undercooked meat, as well as deli, processed, and cured meats (including salami, bologna, hot dogs, and ham) unless heated until steaming hot. - Avoid smoked seafood, typically labeled as \"lox,\" \"kippered,\" \"nova style,\" or \"jerky.\" - Avoid raw fish and shellfish. - Avoid raw and undercooked eggs. - Avoid salad bars, buffets, and potlucks. - Avoid unpasteurized products, such as unpasteurized dairy items (like milk, cheese, and eggnog), as well as unpasteurized honey, juice, and cider. - Avoid fresh and packaged foods that are past their \"use by\" and expiration dates. - Avoid consuming raw sprouts of any kind, including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts. - Avoid leftovers older than 48 hours. It is important to follow proper food storage and reheating guidelines if you plan to prepare food ahead of time or save leftovers. Food Preparation Guidelines - Proper hand washing is the first important step in food safety. Wash your hands with warm soapy water for 20 seconds. - Thoroughly rinse fresh fruit and vegetables under warm running water. Scrub or brush produce to remove excess dirt. Even melon, oranges, and other thick-skinned fruits that are peeled before eating should be washed to avoid introducing bacteria into the fruit when cutting it. - Use separate cutting boards for meat and produce, and avoid wooden cutting boards. - Use clean dishes to serve cooked food. Never reuse a dish that has held raw meat or fish without properly cleaning it with soap and warm water. Food Storage Guidelines - Avoid keeping food on the counter longer than necessary. - Check that your refrigerator is set at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or below. - Bacteria grow best between 40 and 140 degrees F. - Refrigerate or freeze fresh or frozen food immediately after purchase. - Refrigerate or freeze leftover food within two hours of eating. - Leftovers must be eaten within 48 hours and reheated one time only. This includes open packages of commercially sold hot dogs, deli meats, cheeses, and other packaged items. - Refrigerate or freeze food immediately after purchase. - Defrost food in a refrigerator, in cold water, or by microwaving followed by immediate cooking. Do not defrost food on the counter. - Avoid putting hot food in a refrigerator, which can cause the temperature inside to rise. Place hot food in a shallow pan or dish to cool quickly. What are the foods you can eat on the neutropenic diet? |FOOD GROUPS||FOODS |Beverages|| | |Condiments and Miscellaneous|| | |Desserts|| | What are foods to on the neutropenic diet? |FOOD GROUPS||FOODS |Drinks|| | |Condiments and Miscellaneous|| | |Desserts|| | Are there medications to avoid while on the neutropenic diet? Don't take supplements, homeopathic remedies, or herbal products (such as St.-John's wort or traditional Chinese medicines) unless you've discussed it with your cancer care team. Because there are no federal standards for these products in the United States, the way they're processed and stored may pose health risks. Microbes in these items can also cause an infection. In addition, the products themselves could interfere with or change the activity of a prescription medication. What are some tips for people on the neutropenic diet? - Ask caregivers to prepare some of your favorite meals at home. - Try frozen, commercially packaged foods. - Although most people on the neutropenic diet are advised to avoid eating restaurant food, one exception is pizza. Ordering a fresh, uncut pizza poses little risk if you cut it yourself at home. - When you go out, you may want to pack snacks ahead of time, such as protein bars, packaged roasted nuts, and packaged crackers. Take along canned soda, seltzer, or juice too. What are tips for caregivers helping people who are on this diet? - Make sure that you have a good supply of containers for storing food. - Label leftovers with a \"use by\" date so you know to dispose of uneaten contents after 48 hours. - Consider taking freezer bags or other cooling containers with you to the grocery store to ensure that food stays cold. - Purchase a food thermometer to ensure that food is cooked to a safe temperature. This includes whole or ground meats as well as mixed dishes, such as casseroles. Do not rely on the color of the meat to ensure doneness. Here are some basic guidelines on the safe minimum internal temperature of common foods. |FOODS||SAFE MINIMUM INTERNAL TEMPERATURE| |Egg and Egg fresh)||145\u00b0 F (63\u00b0 C)| Where can I learn more about the neutropenic diet and how to prevent foodborne illness?
