Paediatric Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccinators must check the age of the recipient on the day they present at vaccination event regardless of whether that age will soon change, for example 1 week prior to 12th birthday.

Those aged 16 & 17 years, approved from minimum 6 months after primary course. Those aged 12-15 years, not currently part of the programme but new guidance is now a vailable to support prescribers. The vaccine used is mRNA-CV (30 m cg), the same vaccine as for their previous doses. In pregnancy: mRNA-CV vaccine is safe and recommended at all stage of pregnancy. Pre gnant women/people who already had two doses of vac cine p rior to pregnancy are recommended to receive a booster dose of mRNA-CV. Particularly recommended fo r individuals with high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or with significant medical issues that increase their risk fo r severe COVID-19. See here (tinyurl.com/3bc5m3rv) for consumer information about booster doses. Individuals, aged 18+, can ch oose to have an Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) boos ter instead of Pfize r/BioNTech vaccine (3 month gap). Nuva xovid is not approved as a booster but can be used off l abel. See here (tinyurl.com/23a2a4xf). M ore information about boost ers here (tinyurl.com/39vy 43s2) Vaccine spacing post COVID disease Although COVID-19 vaccines can be given any time following infection, an interval of 3 months after Nuvaxovid (Novavax) Standard schedule is 2 doses at least 21 days apart Note: 3rd primary dose and booster doses are currently not approved.

While this is currently not best practice and may be more uncomfortable for the patient, there is no danger associated with accommodating the consumers' requests. Post COVID-19 vaccination advice It is important that every consumer is given clear post vaccination advice verbally and in writing. This advice is needed for each dose of vaccine and for all ages and MUST include the following information: Discussion of potential minor side effects as well as the rare but serious ones . The advice should include expected side effect and how to manage them with the use of paracetamol or other analgesia for pain, or discomfort, and if unwell rest, drinking fluids and avoid vigorous activities, such as going to the gym. Awareness that anaphylaxis, although very unlikely, could occur within a few hours of vaccination and should they have any breathing difficulties, they should dial 111. Cardiac problems are extremely rare but can be serious , so ensure they understand the importance of seeking medical advice early for any out of character symptoms such as: chest pain, chest heaviness, discomfort or tightness, shortness breath or breathing difficulty, feeling lightheaded, faint or dizzy, heart palpitations, racing or fluttering heart, skipped beats. These symptoms should not be ignored. It is important that they seek advice from a doctor or Healthline. For those who are insulin dependent diabetics, discuss the need to closely monitor blood sugars for next few days , as high or low sugars can. occasionally be a side effect of the vaccine. For those who have had Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), the usual advice post COVID-19 vaccine applies, plus guidance on the need to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as a severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, confusion, seizures, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, leg pain, persistent abdominal pain or unusual skin bruising and/or petechia a few days after vaccination.

Can we shorten the spacing of the Pfizer/BioNTech Paediatric dose schedule from 8 weeks to 21 days?The recommended spacing is 8 weeks for 2nd dose for 5-11 year olds of mRNA-CV (10mcg) for an optimal immune response. This can be reduced to 21 days in situations where an earlier interval is important for quicker protection, eg, significant medical issues such as immunosuppression, or if delaying vaccine might cause access issues. Should vaccine doses be adjusted based on consumer's size?No, all vaccines doses are calculated based on age. Paediatric Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 5-11 year old criteria are by chronological age of the child's immune system not by the child's weight or size. What 2nd dose should be given to a child who turns 12 after dose 1?If the child starts with a paediatric dose they continue with that same schedule. If a patient had a booster, but is immunocompromised, can they have a 4th dose?See flow chart on page 6. Can I give booster doses in pregnancy?Comirnaty (30mcg) is recommended at all stages of pregnancy. Booster doses for those aged 18 and older can be given from 3 months after the second dose of the primary course. Booster doses are particularly recommended for individuals most at high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or with significant medical issues that increase their risk for severe COVID-19. Can we administer a booster dose earlier than 3 months?No, boosters are now given with a minimum spacing of 3 months after completion of primary course for 18+ years.COVID-19 IMMUNISATION CLINICAL TOOLKIT | APRIL 2022 (466 863) FOR CLINICAL ADVICE13 IMAC 06/04/2022SECTION 8 | USEFUL INFORMATION/CONTACTS/Q&A s (2) Help with cold chain What Do You Need?
