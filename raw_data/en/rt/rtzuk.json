Is it just too early?.. Did anyone else notice that there isn't a link to an application on the St. John's posting? I tried to find it online through their HR department and couldn't find it. There is a link on the Physical Anthropology website ( [http://www.physanth.org](http://www.physanth.org)) but it has a different due date. What's up with interview invites going out before the application deadlines? There's at least two this year that have done this (U of Miami and St. Johns'), and they seem to be happen well ahead (1-3 weeks) ahead of the deadlines. Miscellaneous Questions[ ] Hello All, Just want to ask your opinion on the following questions. I applied for several positions and they initially did not ask for the LOR. Some of them (2 weeks after the deadline) asked me to request my references to send them the LORs within two weeks. Some other just put a message on my dashboard (for the application website) that additional OPTIONAL documents are requested. It is weird because they indicated OPTIONAL while \"-Required\" is also added to each of those documents. So, my questions: 1. How large is this initial long list? Will they interview (Skype) all candidates (i.e. those asked for recommendation letters) at this stage? What is the main purpose of letters at this stage? 2. How long does it usually take for the SC to select the semi-finalists (Skype interview)? 3. Will they use the LORs now to make further shortlisting or will they look at the whole package again? (maybe they have just done an initial shortlisting and will check the whole package from this point and the initial shortlist is just based on some rough criteria such as having Ph.D., having the other requested documents, ... !!) Thank you for sharing your experience and opinion. --Unfortunately, there's not a straightforward answer to any of these questions. With #2, that's a question you can ask at the end of the Skype interview--they should tell you what next steps are. Overall, it's a good sign that they are asking you for other materials. If you have a question about optional/required materials, send an email to the search chair so that you're sure you're submitting what you need to. All of these questions are dependent on the department you're applying to, the HR department requirements at the institution (they often set when ref letters are required, not the departments), and the composition of the search committee. There's no one-size-fits-all search. The best you can do, if you have the time and the inclination, is to look back through the wikis for the last several years to see if the department has done a recent search and what the timeline looked like. Don't stress yourself out with too much over-analysis of what is a very arbitrary and opaque process.---->Re: I completely agree with you. Thank you for the answer. - Applications should be received by October 1, 2018 and should include a curriculum vitae, statements of research and teaching interests, and names and contact information of three references.

Each year the program selects six scholars from around the world to be in residence at Princeton for an academic year and to engage in research and discussion around a common theme. Candidates will be considered in three categories: (1) Four of the fellowships will be awarded to early-career scholars employed in the equivalent of tenure-track positions who are expected to return to their position. (2) One fellowship is set aside for a postdoctoral research associate who at the time of application does not have a tenure-track faculty appointment. (3) In addition, one fellowship will be awarded to a senior scholar. All candidates must be based outside the United States. - During the academic year 2019-20, the Fung Global Fellows Program theme will be \"Thinking Globally.\" How people have thought about the planet has informed the institutions, norms, and policies that have pulled it together and torn it apart. For centuries, ideas of free trade, human rights or global governance have framed cooperation and competition, order and disorder. Such ideas have also spawned border-crossing movements, from campaigns to end slavery to commitments to reduce carbon emissions. In turn, global thinking and action have often reinforced commitments to national ideas and efforts to curb global exchange. The goal of this research theme is to explore how ideas framed the understanding of interests and the making of institutions that have yielded commonness and conflict across and within borders. We also want to understand how these ideas and practices came into being through scientific networks, foundations, and think tanks. The Program will also examine rival world ideas that have challenged prevailing orthodoxies. Nowadays, with cooperative norms under challenge, global institutions under stress, and a century of guiding ideas about global convergence in doubt, we want to take a broad look at where these ideas came from, their effects, and the prospects for intellectual renewal or rethinking. The goal of the 2019-20 Fung Global Fellows cohort will be to explore the ways people learned to rely on or to reject strangers far away, as well as to imagine how global relationships came to be and could be different. We welcome applicants from all disciplinary and inter-disciplinary fields from the sciences to the humanities whose work addresses this set of themes in any historical period or world region. - All candidates must reside outside the United States. To be eligible, postdoctoral applicants must have completed all requirements for their Ph.D. before August 1, 2019 but cannot have received their degrees more than three years prior to the start of the appointment on September 1, 2019. Early-career fellows must have received their Ph.D. or equivalent no earlier than September 1, 2009. Senior scholars, who have received their doctorates before 2009, must have faculty appointments and a record of scholarly accomplishment in the designated theme of the program. Fellowships will be awarded on the strength of a candidate's proposed research project, the relationship of the project to the program theme, the candidate's scholarly record, and the ability to contribute to the intellectual life of the program. - - Postdoctoral applicants may apply at [https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7241](https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7241). - Early career fellows may apply at [https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7262](https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7262). - Senior fellows may apply at [https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7263](https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/7263). - Postdoctoral applicants may apply at - For more information on eligibility requirements and the application process, see [http://piirs.princeton.edu/funggfp/call-applications](http://piirs.princeton.edu/funggfp/call-applications). - - Applications are due on November 9, 2018. - Also posted at [Humanities and Social Sciences Postdocs 2018-2019](/wiki/Humanities_and_Social_Sciences_Postdocs_2018-2019), [Religious Studies and [Cultural Anthropology 2018-2019](/wiki/Cultural_Anthropology_2018-2019) - Review Begins On: 10/29/2018. - Are there any updates on this?

Have you heard anything? - It's still relatively early ... if you're looking at last year's page, bear in mind that represents a full cycle, whereas the current one is still in process. What this page looks like by mid-late October of this year will be more telling [9/8/18] - The deadline has been updated to November 30, 2018. This seems to be the correct [application link](https://stjohnsedu.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.jobInfo&version=1&jobid=218441&jobboardid=101). Also fixed deadline above. (posted 9/30/18). - -St. John's originally had an earlier deadline, they reposted it with the new later deadline. Could there be two rounds of preliminary interviews? - The St. John's posting has been odd. They moved their deadline and then also changed the ad to indicate they wanted someone with more medical anthropology/health focus. - I would also really like an update on this posting. I got an offer of a preliminary interview before the deadline changed, but it was never scheduled, and I haven't heard anything since. Did the criteria of the search change mid-year, and I was cut without the interview? Are they still just processing the more recent applications? - "}
