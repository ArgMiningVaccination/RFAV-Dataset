Introduction to and Forearm Injuries ................................ ................................ ..................... 14 B.1 History Taking and Associated Lacerations ................................ ................................ NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 7 A. GENERAL GUIDELINE PRINCIPLES The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatm ent required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesse s. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of m otion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatomic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well -defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or discontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks a fter the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherently mental health issues, and shorter for other non - musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic et c.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community should be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implemen t effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring information to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient e ducation as a means of facilitating self -management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. Time Frames NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 8 A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe following an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initia l encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnostic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific interventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized t hat treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delay ed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diag nosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessment for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing through out the care of the patient. At 6 -12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. Clinicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential me ntal health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), re ferral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recovery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The ev aluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. Treatment Approaches NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 9 A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresses. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strengt h, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specif icities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not requi red. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. physiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon document s that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure is permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be war ranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of sym ptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post -operatively to follow the healing process. Regarding serial imaging, (including x -rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized t hat repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and p romote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 10 A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical tre atment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical course and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specif ic diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the p atient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre-Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics within the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of t he Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not included on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these pro cedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical procedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre-authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evaluations In select patients, menta l health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health professionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the c laim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has be en made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues . Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, neither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made afte r careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. A professional fluent in the primary language of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental h ealth issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work -related, medical injury or NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 11 illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued b y the prior treating provider. If psychometric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central par t of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed in detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psyc hosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measurable behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to enhance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select pa tients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicated, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expected to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and continuous communications, in order to facilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), p ostural tolerance, specific range -of-motion, coordination and strength, worker habits, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; (b) cardiovascular job (f) (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 12 non-material and mate rial handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, when the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason inc luding one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of the individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Retu rn To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medica l care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide t he basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the pro gnosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker has been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the individual or specific demands of the patient's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, lo ad lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or sett ing is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activities, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluation may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that t his may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the employer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 13 Frequency: one or two c ontacts 1st contact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on the methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizing that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address s cope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 14 Hand, Wrist and Forearm Injuries Effective : May 02, 2022 B. Introduction to Hand, Wrist and Forearm Injuries This guideline addresses common work -related hand, wrist and forearm injuries/conditions and includes r ecommendations for assessing and treating these disorders . B.1 History Taking and Physical Exam B.1.a History Taking and Physical Exam History taking and physical examination establish the foundation/basis for and dictate subsequent stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluation s and those of other diagnostic procedures are not cons istent with each other, the objective clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should reasonably document the following: B.1.b History Of Present Injury (HPI) Age, h and dominance, gender. Mechanism of injury : includes details of symptom onset (date of onset), progression, triggering event (if present) versus gradual onset . Activity at or before onset of symptoms . Prior occupational and non -occupational injuries to the same area including specific prior treatmen t. Location of symptoms .

B.1.d Physical Examination Examination should include the joint above and below the affected area, including the o pposite side for comparison. Physical examination should include accepted tests and exam techniques applicable to the joint or area being examined, including: B.1.d. i Visual inspection - Examine both hands, wrists and forearms and look for and note asymmetries and for deformities suggestive of degeneration, malformation, fracture, or dislocations . Observe for signs of serious injuries, e.g., degloving injuries, lacerations, puncture wounds, open wounds and crush injuries The neurologic and vascular status of the hand, wrist, forearm, and upper limb should include peripheral pulses, motor function, reflexes, and sensory status. It should also describe any dystrophic changes or variation in skin color or turgor. Examining the neck and cervical nerve r oot function is also recommended for most patients. B.1.d. ii Palpation B.1.d. iii Range of motion/quality of motion (active and passive); The range of motion (ROM) of the hand, wrist and forearm should be determined both actively and passively. Compare mobility of the affected and unaffected side.

Examining the neck and cervical nerve root function is also recommended for most patients. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 16 Observe for signs of serious injuries, e.g., degloving injuries, lacerations, puncture wounds open wounds and crush injuries. B.1.e Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags,\" raise suspicion of potentially serious and urgent medical conditions. Assessment (history and physical exami nation) should include evaluation for red flags that require urgent/emergent assessment and treatment as clinically indicated . The Hand Wrist and Forearm MTG incorporate changes in clinical management as triggered by \"red flags\". See table 4 and each individual condition for condition specific physical examination guidelines. B.1.f Assessing Red Flags Potentially serious conditions for the hand, wrist, and forearm are listed in Table 3. Early consultation by a hand or upper limb specialist, rheumatologist, or other relevant specialist is recommended depending on the provider's training and experience in dealing with the particular disorder. Table 3.

Aggravating and alleviating factors (occupational and nonoccupation al) Difficulty picking up small objects Atrophy or decreased strength of abductor pollicis brevis, opponens (advanced cases) Decreased sensation (to light touch, pinprick two - point discrimination) in median nerve distribution (including monofilaments) . Moisture, temperature or color change. Electrodiagnostic studies NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 18 Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) Tears Acute discrete traumatic events and/or as degenerative cartilaginous changes Should include ulnar wrist joint pain and a catching snapping or popping sensation in the wrist with movement. The physical exam should reproduce these symptoms Ulnar deviation wi th axial loading tends to increase pain. A \"click\" or \"clunk\" in the ulnar wrist joint may be reproduced with forearm rotation (supination/pronation). X-rays Crush Injuries and Compartment Syndrome Crush injuries have clear mechanisms of injury on histor y. However, there are many causes of compartment syndrome Crush : specific acute injury Compartment Syndrome : trauma, excessive traction from fractures, tight casts, bleeding disorders, burns, snakebites, intraarterial injections, infusions, and high-press ure injection injuries. *Compartment syndrome is an emergency requiring emergent surgical evaluation and treatment Mild abnormalities with mild injuries (e.g., contusions) to severe with fractures, limited range(s) of motion and neurovascular compromise . Those with vascular compromise may have a cool extremity compared with the unaffected limb Progressive pain out of proportion to the injury; signs include tense swollen compartments and pain with passive stretching of muscles within the affected compartment . X-Ray MRI/CT Kienb\u00f6ck Disease There are multiple disorders that are thought to predispose to Kienb\u00f6ck disease . Complaints of increasing (non- radiating) wrist pain, pain with movement, pain with use, and limited range of motion. The physical examination may be normal early, but generally the patient has mild to moderate dorsal wrist tenderness while also having asymmetric, limited range of motion. Tenderness and limited range of motion tend to progress. X-Ray, CT, MRI Screening for systemic disorders that may predispose to Kienb\u00f6ck disease including: diabetes, glucose intolerance, alcoholism, and rheumatological studies Wrist Sprains Typically occur with acute traumatic events Occupational slips, trip s, and falls with forceful loading of the wrist joint in full extension May include wrist capsule tenderness. Deformity or scaphoid tubercle tenderness suggests (scaphoid) fracture X-rays CT MR Arthrography Mallet Finger Involves rupture of the extensor mechanism of a digit at the distal upper extremity joint with or without fracture of the distal phalangeal segment. The mechanism of injury most typically involves forcefully striking the tip of the extended digit on an object Striking tip o f extended digit on an object. Fall The patient is unable to extend the distal phalangeal segment. Swelling often signifies a fracture fragment, while most are extensor tendon ruptures and have no significant swelling. X-ray occasionally may show fracture, but usually normal. May not have fracture if extensor mechanism ruptured without fracturing bone NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 19 Mallet Finger (Continued) including balls, or from falls.

Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 22 C. Conditions This Guideline addresses the following hand, wrist, and forearm disorders which may present to the health care provider. C.1 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome C.2 Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex and Intersection C.9 Ulnar Nerve Entrapment at the Wrist (Including Guyon's Canal Syndrome and Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome) Arm Vibration Syndrome C.18 Laceration Management C.19 Human and Animal Bite s and C.20 Hand/Finger Osteoarthrosis C.21 Dupuytren's Disease NYS WCB Wrist and Forearm Injuries 23 C.1 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) CTS is the most common and widely known of the entrapment neuropathies in which the body's peripheral nerves are compressed or traumatized . CTS occurs when symptoms occur that are attributable to abnormal median nerve compression within the carpal tunnel .The median nerve supplies sensations to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle and radial half of the ring finger, as well as the dorsal segment of each of those four digits from the DIP distally . Tingling and numbness are essential symptoms. Pain is not an essential symptom and it may indicate other conditions, but if present, may also radiate proximally. Often, the condition arises without apparent cause. CTS may result from numerous conditions, including inflammatory or non - inflammatory arthropathies, recent or remote wrist trauma or fractures, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and genetic factors. In the unusual instance that CTS is acutely, traumatically induced, e.g. a patient has both CTS and concomitant trauma (fracture or dislocation), the treatment may require prompt carpal tunnel releas e. Patients who have open injuries, unstable fractures, wrist fractures that results in acute CTS require immediate referral to a surgeon since improvement may only be obtained through surgery. C.1.a Medical History A diagnosis of CTS requires symptoms s uggestive of median nerve entrapment at the wrist supported by physical examination findings. Prior to surgery, confirmation of the diagnosis by electrodiagnostic studies (EDX) is required. Typical symptoms of CTS may include numbness, tingling, or pain in the volar aspects of one or both hands, especially noted after work or at night. Nocturnal symptoms are prominent in a majority of patients. Patients frequently awaken at night or early morning and shake their hands to relieve these symptoms. The location of these symptoms may be reported as involving the entire hand or localized to the palmar surfaces of the thumb and first two or three fingers. A hand pain diagram may be useful in localizing sensory symptoms of CTS. Weakness of the hands or dropping obje cts are more ominous signs that may suggest muscle damage. Presence of such symptoms in the clinical context of a possible CTS diagnosis requires prompt consideration to EDX and surgical treatment. Medical conditions associated with CTS: The following are examples of medical conditions which have been commonly seen in association with CTS conditions. These require treatment and may impact the recovery of the work -related injury. a. Arthropathies including connective tissue disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, gout, osteoarthritis and spondyloathropathy; b. Diabetes mellitus, including family history or gestational diabetes; c. Hypothyroidism, especially in older females; d. Obesity; e. Pregnancy. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 24 C.1.b Physical Exam No single physical finding is diagnostic of CTS. Final diagnosis is dependent on a correlation of symptoms, physical exam findings, and EDX testing where appropriate, as any of these alone can be false positive or false negative. The evaluation of any patient with suspected CTS should begin at the neck and upper back and then proceed down to the fingers and include the contralateral region. It should include evaluation of vascular and neurologic status, and describe any dystrophic changes or variation in skin color or turgor. Additional physical exam components may be necessary based on past medical history. A neurological examination typically includes bilateral assessments of light touch sensation, pinprick, two -point sensation as applicable, motor strength, and reflexes. Similar assessments of the upper extremities, including a vascular assessment, may be performed. Special care to evaluate for polyneuropathic processes such as diabetic neuropathy is recommended. The clinical diagnosis should be suspected w henever the patient has: 1) a history of paresthesia in one or more of the following digits: thumb, index, and middle finger; and 2) at least one of the physical exam signs listed below. Provocative tests must recreate symptoms in the median nerve distribution. Phalen's sign/reverse Phalen's sign. Tinel's sign over the carpal tunnel. Compression test. Weakness of the abductor pollicis brevis (see discussion EDX studies). Thenar atrophy may be present, usually late in the course (see discussion of EDX stu dies). Sensory loss to pinprick, light touch, two -point discrimination or Semmes Weinstein monofilament test in a median nerve distribution. The performance of clinical exam tests for CTS may include the following . Monofilament test - A test involving nylon monofilaments that collapse at specific amounts of force when pushed perpendicularly against the palm or fingers. A positive test results when a filament of greater than normal size is required in order for its application to be perceived b y the patient. Vibration Testing - Diminished ability to perceive vibratory sensations using a standard vibrating tuning fork comparing the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger to ipsilateral fifth finger. Weak thumb abduction strength - Weakne ss of resisted abduction (i.e., palm horizontal, thumb lifted as vertically as possible, then patient resists examiner pushing the thumb down towards the index finger). Hoffmann -Tinel's Sign (\"Tinel's\") - Up to 6 taps of a reflex hammer or tip of examiner' s finger to the soft tissue overlying the carpal tunnel. A positive test occurs when the taps cause paresthesias or shooting pain in the median nerve distribution. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 25 Phalen Sign - As originally described, flexion of the wrist by having the examiner passivel y flex the wrists of the patient for up to 60 seconds. Clinically, this is more commonly performed by having the patient press the dorsal aspect of both hands together with approximately 90 of flexion for 60 seconds. It is unclear if these two means of pe rforming this sign result in different sensitivities and specificities. A positive test produces paresthesias in the distribution of the affected median nerve. Carpal Compression Test - The examiner holds the supinated wrist in both hands, flexes the wrist 45 and applies direct, even pressure over the transverse carpal ligament with both thumbs for up to 30 seconds. A positive test is indicated by tingling or paresthesia into the thumb, index finger, and middle and lateral half of ring finger within 30 sec onds. C.1.c Diagnostic Studies C.1.c.i Electrodiagnostic Studies In those cases where EDX studies are indicated, they should be conducted in accordance with the CTS practice parameters of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM). It is recommended and preferred that EDX in the out -patient setting be performed and interpreted by physicians board -certified in Neurology or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The EDX study is to include median motor and median sensory nerve conduction velocity results (NCV). If abnormal, then comparison to ipsalateral ulnar motor/sensory and contralateral median motor/sensory should be made. Needle electromyography (EMG) of a sample of muscles innervated by the C5 to T1 spinal roots, including paraspinal muscles and a thenar muscle innervated by the median nerve of the symptomatic limb, is required. EDX findings in CTS reflect slowing of median motor distal latency and sensory conduction (velocity) across the carpal tunnel region due to demyelination or axonopathy (axonal loss). Axonal loss, when present, is demonstrated by EMG abnormality in median -nerve - supplied thenar muscles. NCS and EMG may be normal particularly in some mild cases of CTS. If EDS are negative, tests may be repeated later in the course of treatment if symptoms persist. It is also important to recognize that electrodiagnostic studies are abn ormal in a large proportion of patients who are without symptoms an d thus without CTS. Thus, EDS testing in a patient with a low pre-test probability of CTS may result in inappropriate diagnosis of CTS. EDS has not been useful in diagnosing clear -cut CTS cases . Frequency of NCV/EMG Studies/Maximum Number of Studies 1) Indications for initial testing: a. Patients with clinically significant CTS who do not improve symptomatically or functionally with conservative measures for CTS over a 3 to 4 week period. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 26 b. Patients in whom the diagnosis is in question and who are symptomatic for at least 3 weeks. c. To rule out other nerve entrapments, or alternative radiculopathy. d. Patients for whom surgery is contemplated in accordance with Section F.1. 2) A repeat study may be performed: a. At 3 months or longer when the initial studie s were normal and CTS is still suspected. b. Postoperative 8 to 12 weeks for persistent or recurrent symptoms following carpal tunnel release, unless an earlier evaluation is required by the surgeon. In patients with CTS where electrodiagnostic confirmation would alter treatment plans, the foll owing EDS studies are recommended : 1) To ensure accurate testing, warm the hands if they are <30 C. If possible, it is best to keep the temperatures above 32 C as measured at the hand or fingers. 2) Perform a median sensory NCS across the wrist with a conduction distance of 13 to 14 cm. If the result is abnormal, compare the result of the median sensory NCS to the result of a sensory NCS of one other adjacent s ensory nerve in the symptomatic limb. 3) If the initial median sensory NCS across the wrist has a con duction distance greater than 8 cm and the result is normal, one of the following additional studies is recommended: a. Comparison of median -sensory - or mixed -nerve conduction across the wrist over a short (7 to 8 cm) conduction distance to the ulnar sensory -nerve conduction across the wrist over the identical 7 to 8cm conduction distance , or b. Comparison of median sensory across the wri st with ipsilateral radial or ulnar sensory conduction across the wrist , or c. Comparison of median sensory or mixed nerve conduction through the carpal tunnel to sensory or mixed NCS of proximal or distal segments of the ipsilateral median nerve. 4) Motor conduction study of the median nerve recording from the thenar muscle and of one other ipsilateral nerve with distal latency . 5) Optional comparisons may include ipsilateral median motor nerve distal latencies and median -ulnar motor conduction differences. 6) If abnormal in the index limb, then measuring the contral ateral limb is helpful for both comparison and for diagnosis of systemic disorders. C.1.c.i.a Electrodiagnostic Studies Not Recommended - for initial evaluation of most patients with a clear diagnosis of CTS (confirming history and correlating clinical signs) as it will not alter the treatment plan. Recommended - to assist in securing a firm diagnosis for those patients without a clear diagnosis of CTS and to identify the presence or absence of axonopathies . NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 27 Recommended - to definitively evaluate and objectively secure a diagnosis of CTS prior to surgical release . Rationale - to assist in the diagnosis, prognosis and management of CTS. Frequency - A repeat study at three months may be indicated if the first study was not diagnostic and CTS is still suspected. EDS is also indicated at 8 -12 weeks post -operatively in cases where results are inadequate and/or symptoms have recurred. Not Recommended - prior to glucocor ticosteroid injection as a good history and clinical suspicion is believed to be sufficient to warrant the intervention which would not likely be altered by EDS. Not Recommend ed - use of hand -held automated devices or portable automatic devices are not recommended and not acceptable to confirm a clinical diagnosis of CTS. Not Recommended - surface EMG not recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of CTS. C.1.c.i.b Ultrasound (Diagnostic) Not Recommended - for diagnosing CTS . Recommended in very select cases where a space occupying lesion is suspected and MRI is contraindicated. C.1.c.i.c Magnetic Resonance Imaging Not Recommended - for the evaluation and diagnosis of CTS Recommended - in very select cases where a space occupying lesion is suspected. C.1.d Initial Treatment Initial treatment of CTS should begin with conservative measures including: Medications such as over -the-counter nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other analgesics for symptomatic relief . Wrist splint at night. Restriction of activities such as forceful gripping, awkward wrist posture, and repetitive wrist motion. C.1.d.i Wrist Splinting NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 28 Splinting is generally effective for milder cases of CTS and can lead to more improvement in symptoms and hand function than watchful waiting alone. Splints may be effective when worn dur ing sleep hours or during portions of the day, depending on work activities. Splints should be loose and soft enough to maintain comfort while supporting the wrist in a relatively neutral position. This can be accomplished by using a soft or rigid splint w ith a metal or plastic support. Off -the-shelf splints are usually sufficient, although custom thermoplastic splints may provide a better fit for certain patients. Providers should be aware that over -usage is counterproductive and should counsel patients to avoid over -usage. Recommended - nocturnal wrist splinting for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Recommended - intermittent day time splinting for select patients depending on job activities. Indications - Symptoms consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. Frequency/Dose - Wrist splints are recommended to be worn while sleeping for 4 to 6 weeks. Depending on job activities, intermittent daytime splinting can also be helpful. The time to produce effect is 1 to 4 weeks. Discontinuat ion - Splints should be revaluated and re -adjusted as indicated if no response within 2 weeks of starting treatment, particularly to assure that the patient is wearing them properly as well as to assess fit. If symptoms persist or if there is no improvemen t, splints should be discontinued and glucocorticosteroid injection and/or electrodiagnostic testing may be considered. C.1.d.ii Patient Education Instruction in self -management techniques, including sleeping postures that avoid excessive wrist flexion; ergonomics; and a home therapy program . C.1.d.iii Continuation of Activities Continuation of normal daily activities is an accepted and well -established initial recommendation for CTS with or without neurologic symptoms. Complete work cessation should be avoided if possible. C.1.d.iv Work Activities All patients should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible. This process may be best facilitated with modified duty, particularly when the job demands exceed the patient's capabilities due to the workplace injury . It is recommended that work be restricted to those tasks that do not involve high -force combined with repeated hand gripping or pinching or the use of high acceleration vibrating hand -held tools . Recommendations NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 29 for ergonomic assessments to evaluate or reduce exposure may be of value for treatment and future intervention/prevention. Evidence for Work Restrictions C.1.e Diagnosis To establish a diagnosis of work -related carpal tunnel syndrome, all of the following are required: 1. Exposure: Workplace activities that contribute to or cause CTS, and 2. Outcome: CTS that meets the diagnostic CTS criteria as defined in this guideline. 3. Relationship to work: This includes a statement of the probability that the illness or injury is work -related. The presence of concurrent disease does not eliminate the po ssibility of work -relatedness of any specific case. Work -related CTS is most often associated with activities requiring extensive, forceful, repeated or prolonged use of the hands and wrists, particularly if these potential risk factors are present in comb ination (e.g., force and repetition or force and posture). Usually, one or more of the following work conditions occurs on a regular basis to support work -relatedness: 1. Forceful use, particularly if repeated. 2. Repetitive hand use combined with some element of force, especially for prolonged periods. 3. Constant firm gripping of objects. 4. Moving or using the hand and wrist against resistance or with force. C.1.f Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.1.f.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment o f Acute, Subacute, or Chronic CTS Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic CTS, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects that necessitate discontinuation. C.1.f.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 30 Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotectiv e medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump i nhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intol erance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.1.f.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have t he risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial eff ects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.1.f.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of CTS Pain Recommended - for treatment of CTS pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with CTS pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding fou r gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for CTS NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 31 C.1.f. v Systemic Glucocorticosteroids Recommended - in select patients for the treatment of Acute, Subacute or Chronic CTS among patients who decline carpal tunnel injection Indication - CTS unresponsive to splinting. Most patients should be injected rather than given oral steroids . However, for patients declining injection, oral glucocorticosteroids may be warranted. Frequency/Dose . It is recommended that one course (10 to 14 days) of oral glucocorticosteroid be prescribed rather than repea ted courses. Prescriptions of low rather than high doses are recommended to minimize potential for adverse effects. Evidence for the Use of Oral Glucocorticosteroids C.1.f. vi Diuretics Diuretics have been used to treat CTS, in part due to observations of swelling in some patients. Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS in the absence of fluid retention states. Evidence for the Use of Diuretics for CTS C.1.f.v ii Opioids Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic CTS Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatmen ts (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insu fficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post - operatively. C.1.f.v iii Vitamins (including pyridoxine) Not Recommended - for routine treatment of acute, subacute or chronic CTS in patients without vitamin dificiencies. Evidence for the Use of Pyridoxine for CTS C.1.f. ix Lidocaine Patches NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 32 Recommended in select patients for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS with pain when other treatable causes of the pain have been eliminated and after more efficacious treatment strategies, such as splinting and glucocorticosteroid injection(s), have been attempted and failed . Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a trial of at least two weeks. Evidence for the Use of Topical Lid ocaine Patches for CTS C.1.f. x Gabapentin Not Recommended - to treat carpal tunnel syndrom e. Evidence for the Use of Gapabentin for CTS C.1.g Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabi litation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.1.g.i Therapy - Active C.1.g.i .a Therapeutic Exercise Various exercise regimens have been utilized to treat patients with CTS. Recommended - for treatment of chronic CTS in the presence of functional deficits Recommended - for rehabilitation of post -operative CTS in patients with stiffness and significant deficits NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 33 Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As par t of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Evidence for the Use of Exercise for CTS C.1.g.i.b Yoga Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Yoga for CTS C.1.g.i.c Biofeedback Not Recommended - for the treatment of acute, subacute or chronic CTS.

Evidence for the U se of Magnets for CTS C.1.g.vi i Low Level Laser therapy (LLLT) Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Low -Level Laser Therapy for CTS C.1.g. viii Massage and Soft Tissue Massage Not Recommended - for most patients for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Recommended - for treatment of select patients with acute, subacute, or chronic CTS who have significant myofascial pain. Indications - Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome combined with forearm myofascial pain sufficient for the patient to require treatment. Generally, the patient should have failed other treatments including splints and glucocorticosteroid injection. Frequency/Dose - Three to four visits. Objective evidence of improvement shoul d be documented . Additional 3 or 4 treatments should be based on incremental improvement in objective measures. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 35 Discontinuation - Resolution, failure to objectively improve, or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of Massage C.1.g. ix Therapeutic Touch Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS Evidence for the Use of Therapeutic Touch for CTS C.1.g. x Ultrasound Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound for CTS C.1.g. xi Phonophoresis Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Indications - CTS that is sufficiently symptomatic to warrant treatment. Patients should generally be given splints and/or a glucocorticosteroid injection prior to considering phonophoresis as a splint or injection are believed to be more effective. Frequency - 5-15 sessions per week for 4 -8 weeks . Discontinuation - Resolution, failure to objectively improve or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of Phonophoresis C.1.g. xii Iontophoresis Not Recommended - for use for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Iontophoresis for CTS C.1.g. xiii Injection Therapy C.1.g. xiii.a Carpal Tunnel Steroid Injections Recommended - for the treatment of subacute or chronic CTS with mild EMG findings Recommended - in select patients with moderate to severe EMG findings for temporary relief while awaiting surgery. Indications - CTS unresponsive to nocturnal wrist splinting, generally with symptoms lasting at least three weeks. Frequency/Duration - An initial injection with documented improvement, even short -term is believed to have considerable prognostic significance. If the initial steroid NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 36 injection provides three to four weeks of partial relief or complete symptom relief but with recurrence of symp toms, a second injection may be indicated. If the second injection provides three to four weeks of partial or complete relief surgical release may be indicated. Failure to respond, particularly if the median nerve was successfully anesthetized by the injection, should result in a careful re -assessment of the accuracy of the diagnosis of CTS. Patients who respond to carpal tunnel injections, and develop recurrent symptoms are believed to be candidates for surgical release . If following the first injection, symptomatic relief is followed by recurrent symptoms, the decision to perform a second injection must be weighed against alternative treatments such as surgery. Surgical release may give more definitive relief of symptoms. C.1.g.xiii.b Carp al Tunnel Steroid Injections for Treatment of Acute , Traumatic CTS without Fracture Recommended for treatment of acute CTS (without fractures) unresponsive to conservative management with symptoms lasting at least 3 weeks . Acute CTS with fractures should be referred for potential emergent surgical release. C.1.g.xiii.c Carpal Tunnel Steroid Injections for Treatment of Non Traumatic CTS Due to Acute, Repetitive Overload Injury Recommended - for treatment of non traumatic CTS due to acute, repetitive overload injury. In patients who decline injection oral steroids may be an alternative (see C.1.f.ii Systemic Oral Steroids) Evidence for the Use of Glucocorticosteroids (Oral and Injection) for CTS C.1.g.xiii.d Intramuscular Injections Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Intramuscular Injections for CTS C.1.g.xiii.e Insulin Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic CT S. Evidence for the Use of Insulin Injections for CTS NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 37 C.1.g.xiii.f Botulinum Injections Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute or chronic CTS. Evidence for the Use of Botulinum Injections for CTS C.1.h Surgery Surgical consultation may be indicated for CTS patients who: Have red flags of a serious nature; Fail to respond to non -surgical management including worksite modifications; or Have clear clinical and special study evidence of a lesion that has been shown to benefit, in both the short and long term, from surgical intervention. Surgical considerations depend on the confirmed diagnosis of the presenting hand or wrist complaint. If surgery is a consideration, counseling regarding likely outcomes, risks, and benefits, and especially expectations is important. The single most important factor in predicting symptomatic improvement following carpal tunnel release is the severity of preoperative neuropathy. If there is no clear indication for surgery, the patient should be re ferred for conservative management. Surgery should be considered as initial therapy in the presence of 1. \"Acute Carpal Tunnel Syndome\" In patients who have open injuries, unstable fractures, wrist fractures that result in acute CTS require immediate referral to a surgeon since improvement may only be obtained through surgery , or 2. Thenar atrophy due to median nerve compressio n, or 3. In the presence of electrodiagnostic evidence of moderate to severe compressive neuropathy of the median nerv e. EMG findings showing evidence of acute or chronic motor denervation suggest the possibility that irreversible damage may be occurring . For cases with positive EDX findings and with a motor latency less than 5.0 ms, non-surgical treatment may be benefi cial in some cases; therefore, conservative management, including job alterations, should be tried over four to six weeks before surgery is considered. C.1.h.i Surgical Release Recommended - for patients with sub -acute or chronic CTS and moderate to severe EMG findings. Recommended - for patients with subacute or chronic CTS with mild EMG findings who / have recurrent symptoms after partial or complete relief of symptoms (3 -4 weeks) with glucocortiocosteroid injections. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 38 Rationale /Indications - Failure of non -operative treatment to include two glucocortosteroid injections. If the initial steroid injectio n provides 3 to 4 weeks of partial relief or complete symptom relief but with recurrence of symptoms, a second injection may be indicated. If the second injection provides 3 to 4 weeks of partial or complete relief surgical release may be indicated. Patients who initially respond to corticosteriod injections, and develop recurrent symptoms are believed to be candidates for surgical release. If following the first injection, symptomatic relief is followed by recurrent symptoms, the decision to perform a second injection must be weighed against alternative treatments such as surgery. Surgical release may give more definitive relief of symptoms. Recommended - patients who have emergent or urgent indications (e.g., acute compression due to fracture, arthritides, or compartment syndrome with unrelenting symptoms of nerve impairment) Rationale/Indications - Patients should have an electrodiagnostic study (EDS) consistent with CTS (see Electrodiagnostic Studies) . Mild CTS with normal EDS exists, but a clinical impression of moderate or severe CTS with normal EDS is very rare and generally indicates a mistaken diagnosis. Positive EDS in asymptomatic individuals is very common, is not CTS, and suggests the need to carefully select patients for EDS and properly interpret the results. Re-operation is potentially indicated if there is: (i) recurrence of symptoms after surgical release, (ii) electrodiagnostic findings are supportive at 8 -12 weeks after surgical release, (iii) re -exposure to work factors are not explanatory and remediable; those not improving after an initial surgery should undergo a thorough diagnostic workup. C.1.h.ii Open or Edoscopic Release Recommended - for treatment of subacute or chronic CTS . The procedure utilized is based upon the surgeon 's evaluation and discretion. C.1.h.iii Antibiotics for Patients Undergoing Carpal Tunnel Releas e Not Recommended - for routine use . C.1.h.iv Antibiotics For Post Operative Infection Recommended - as clinically indicated . Evidence for the Use of Carpal Tunnel Surgical Release C.1.i Other Adjunctive Procedures or Techniques for Subacute or Chronic CTS C.1.i.a Epineurotomy Not Recommended NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries Internal Neurolysis Bursal Preservation Not Recommended C.1.i.e Altering the Location of the Incision to \" Superficial Nerve-Sparing Incision\" Not Recommended C.1.i.f Ulnar C.1.i.h Biopsy of Abnormal Tenosynovium Not Recommended - for treatment of subacute or chronic CTS. C.2 Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) Tears Triangular fibrocartilage complex are frequent wrist injuries involving the cartilaginous meniscus between the radius and ulna with symptoms often described as occurring on the ulnar side of the wrist joint. C.2.a Physical Exam The exam may reveal dorso -ulnar wrist joint tenderness that is not focally tender over an extensor compartment. Swelling is generally not present, although it may be present with an acute, large tear. The examiner should generally attempt to reproduce catching or snapp ing in the ulnar wrist joint . C.2.b Medical History Patients commonly complain of non -radiating ulnar sided pain and clicking. It is important to correlate the symptoms with the physical examination and mechanism of injury since MRI studies suggest TFCC tears are both prevalent while also apparently frequen tly asymptomatic. Ulnar deviation with axial loading tends to increase pain. A NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 40 \"click\" or \"clunk\" in the ulnar wrist joint may be reproduced with forearm rotation (supination/pronation). occupational cases will tend toward symptomatic onset after a discret e traumatic event such as a slip and fall. The history should include ulnar wrist joint pain and a catching, snapping or popping sensation in the wrist with movement. The physical examination should reproduce these symptoms. C.2.c Initial Assessment A primary focus of the patient history is ascertaining whether the TFCC is significantly torn, and if so, whether it is sufficiently symptomatic to require intervention(s). Following the patient's symptoms for healing without immediate surgical intervention is generally the most common approach. Some do not heal, continue to be symptomatic and do well with surgical repair or removal. C.2.d Diagnostic Studies C.2.d.i X-rays Recommended - to diagnose triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. Indications - Suspected TFCC tear and/or to rule out other sources of wrist pain . Frequency/Duration - Obtaining x -rays once is generally sufficient. C.2.d.ii MRI Recommended - to diagnose Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) Tears C.2.d.iii Arthroscopy Recommened - In select patinets with continued wrist pain unresponsive to conservative management and the MRI does not reveal etiology. Diagnostic arthroscopy can be perfomed as a diagnostic procedure or as combined with surgical repair. C.2.e Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.2.e.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment o Acute, Subacute, or Chronic TFCC Tears NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 41 Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic TFCC tears. Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic TFCC tears. , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.2.e.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high ri sk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.2.e.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effe cts of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 42 C.2.e.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of TFCC Tears Pain Recommended - for treatment of TFCC tears pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with TFCC tears pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. C.2.e.v Opioids Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic TFCC tears. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day , then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, s elect use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post - operatively. C.2.f Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 43 The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabi litation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.2.f.i Therapy: Active C.2.f.i.a Therapeutic Exercise Recommended - for select patients Recommended - Recovery/Post -Operative Phase Rationale for Recommendation - Exercise is generally not indicated acutely; however, exercise may be needed in the recovery or post -operative phases. Functional goals should include increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities . Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing f unctional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.2.f.ii Therapy: Passive C.2.f.ii.a RICE (Rest , Ice, Compression , Elevation) Recommended - relative rest for treatment of acute, subacute , or chronic triangular fibrocartilage , Rationale for Recommendation -relative rest may preclude the need for surgical intervention. Ice and heat may help particularly with more acute symptoms. These treatments may help with symptomatic relief . C.2.f.ii.b Cryotherapy / Heat Recommended - Self-application of ice for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tears. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 44 C.2.f.ii.c Self-Application of Heat Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic triangular fibrocartilage complex ( TFCC) tears. C.2.f.iii Immobilization Recommended - Splinting for treatment moderate or acute triangular fibrocartilage complex ( , particularly to reduce forearm rotation . Rationale for Recommendation s - Wrist splints may help avoiding aggravating activities or actions that provoke symptoms and therefore, may be more appropriate for acute or moderate to severe injuries. Evidence for the Use of Initial Care C.2.g Surgery C.2.g.i Surgical Repair ( Arthroscopic or Open Surgical Repair ) Recommended - for select patients with instability, concomitant fractures, or symptoms that persist without trending towards resolution despite non- operative treatment and the passage of approximately 3 to 6 weeks. Rationale for Recommendation - Arthroscopic repair is most typically used although open repairs may be performed. C.2.g.ii Ulna Shortening and Wafer Procedures for Chronic Triangular Fibrocartilage Complex (TFCC) Tears Recommended - for select cases of chronic tears for which non -surgical treatment is unsuccessful and there is a demonstrable ulna positive variance. Rationale for Recommendation in select cases with ulna positive variance and without resolution of considerable or incapacitating symptoms or lacking trending towards resolution, this proced ure is recommended. Evidence for the Use of Surgery C.3 Crush Injuries and Compartment Syndrome NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 45 Crush injuries which include compartment syndrome are usually surgical emergencies. Mild cases of crush injuries , such as contusions may be treated similar to non -specific hand, wrist, forearm pain with particular emphasis on RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). C.3.a Physical Exam The physical examination ranges from mild abnormalities with mild injuries (e.g., contusions) to severe with fractures, limited range(s) of motion and neurovascular compromise C.3.b Medical History Compartment syndrome is an emergency requiring urgent evaluation. Those with vascular compromise may have a cool extremity compared with the unaffected limb. Crush injuries have clear mechanisms of injury on history. However, there are many causes of compa rtment syndrome including trauma, excessive traction from fractures, tight casts, bleeding disorders, burns, snakebites, intraarterial injections, infusions, and high -pressure injection injuries. C.3.c Initial Assessment Patients with more severe injuries present with severe pain and may have vascular compromise. Compartment syndrome is an emergency. The initial assessment should focus on the degree of injury severity and if the injury requires emergent surgical evaluation and treatment. Milder injuries may be managed non -operatively; however, the threshold for surgical consultation should be low. Those with milder injuries should be monitored for neurovascular compromise. C.3.d Diagnositc Studies C.3.d.i X-Rays Recommended - for evaluating patients with crush injuries or compartment syndrome. Rationale for Recommendation -X-rays are essential for evaluating the extent of injuries and identification of fractures. Evidence for the Use of X -rays C.3.d.ii MRI/CT Recommended - for select patients with crush injuries or compartment syndrome. Rationale for Recommendation - Initial evaluation of crush injuries or compartment syndrome generally does not require MRI or CT. However, some patients require MRI or CT for evaluation of symptoms and extent of injury and are recommended in select cases. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 46 Evidence for the Use of MRI/CT C.3.e Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog p aracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.3.e.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Crush injuries and Compartment Syndrome Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic crush injuries and compartment syndrome Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic chronic crush injuries and compartment syndrome , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over - the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation.

At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastroi ntestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 47 C.3.e.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed.

C.3.e.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Crush injuries and Compartment Syndrome Pain Recommended - for treatment of crush injuries and compartment syndrome pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with crush injuries and compartment syndrome pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. C.3.e.v Opioids - for Pain from Acute, Subacute, Chronic or Post -Operative Crush injuries Recommended - Limited use of opioids (not to exceed seven days) for the treatment of select patients presenting with severe pain related to acute, subacute or chronic crush injuries . Limited use of opioids for a few days (not to exceed seven days) is also recommended for select patients who have undergone recent surgical intervention. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Frequency and dose per manufact urer's recommendations; may be taken scheduled or as needed; generally taken for short courses of a few days, with subsequent weaning to nocturnal use if needed, then discontinuation. Total length of treatment usually ranges from a few days to one week. Ge nerally should be utilized to supplement pain relief in addition to an NSAID or acetaminophen to reduce total need for opioid and the consequent adverse effects. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 48 Indications for Discontinuation : Sufficient pain management with other methods such as NSAIDs, resolution of pain, intolerance, adverse effects, lack of benefits, or failure to progress over a couple weeks. C.3.f Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on res toring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.

C.3.f.i Therapy: A ctive C.3.f.i.a Therapeutic Exercise Recommended - for the treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, or post -operative crush injuries Rationale for Recommendation - Exercise is generally not indicated acutely; however, exercise may be needed in the recovery or post -operative phases. Functional goals should include increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities . Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mil d functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of function al improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed an d performed in conjunction with the therapy. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 49 C.3.f.ii Therapy: Passive C.3.f.ii.a Elevation and Relative Rest Recommended - for treatment of acute crush injuries without compartment syndrome. C.3.f.ii.b Self-Application of Ice Recommended - for treatment of acute crush injuries without compartment syndrome. C.3.f.iii Immobilization C.3.f.iii.a Splinting Recommended - after initial treatment for moderate or severe acute and subacute crush injuries when compartment syndrome has been ruled out. Rationale for Recommendations . The type of splint required depends on the type of injury and subsequent debility. Splints are recommended particularly for patients with moderate to severe injuries when compartment syndrome has been ruled out. Evidence for the Use of Initial Care C.3.g Surgery C.3.g.i Surgery Recommended - for treatment of acute or subacute crush injuries or compartment s yndrome depending on the nature of the injury. This frequently includes emergency fasciotomy for release of tension from compartment syndromes as well as other surgical procedures to address fractures and other remediable defects . Rationale for Recommendation - Fasciotomies are particularly essential for treatment of significant neurovascular compromise from compartment syndrome and is a surgical emergency . Other procedures may be required based on remediable defects such as fractures, ligament tears , or other injuries. Evidence for the Use of Surgery NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 50 C.4 Kienb \u00f6ck Disease Kienb\u00f6ck disease involves changes in the lunate that eventually lead to collapse of the lunate bone, which results in progressive pain and disability. Patients with Kienb\u00f6ck disease often develop chronic pain C.4.a Diagnostic Studies C.4.a.i X-Rays Recommended - to diagnos e Kienb\u00f6ck disease. Rationale for Recommendation , x-rays are used to confirm the diagnosis and should generally be taken of both hands. Evidence for the Use of X -rays C.4.a. ii CT Recommended - to diagnose Kienb\u00f6ck disease when xrays are negative or unclear and MRI is contraindicated . Rationale for Recommendation - CT is used to assist with diagnosis and management in select patients , where xrays are negative or unclear and MRI is contraindicated. Evidence for the Use of CT C.4.a. iii MRI Recommended - to diagnos e Kienb\u00f6ck disease when xrays are negative or unclear. Rationale for Recommendation - MRIs are used to assist with diagnosis and management, thus they are recommended. Evidence for the Use of MRI C.4.a.iv Screening for Systemic Disorders Recommen ded - for patients with Kienb\u00f6ck d isease. Rationale for Recommendation - There are multiple disorders that are thought to predispose to Kienb\u00f6ck disease. The threshold for evaluations of systemic metabolic issues (e.g., diabetes, glucose intolerance), alcohol ism, and rheumatological studies should be low, particularly as potentially modifiable risks may theoretically slow the rate of progression . Evidence for the Use of Screening C.4.b Medications NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 51 For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or t he analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.4.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duratio n: As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.4.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointes tinal bleeding.

C.4.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 52 Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial eff ects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.4.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Kienb\u00f6ck disease Pain Recommended - for treatment of Kienb\u00f6ck disease pain, particularly in patients wi th contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with Kienb\u00f6ck disease pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. C.4.b.v Topical Medications Recommended - In select patients for treatment of pain associated with acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease . including topical creams, ointments, and lidocaine patches Rationale for Recommendation - TOPICAL DRUG DELIVERY (e.g., capsaicin, topical lidocaine, topical NSAIDs and t opical salicylates and nonsalicylates) may be an acceptable form of treatment in selected patients. A topical agent should be prescribed with strict instructions for application and maximum number of applications per day to obtain the desired benefit and a void potential toxicity. For most patients, the effects of long -term use are unknown and thus may be better used episodically. These agents may be used in those patients who prefer topical treatments over oral medications. Localized skin reactions may occu r, depending on the medication agent used. Prescribers should consider that topical medication can result in toxic blood levels. Capsaicin offers a safe and effective alternative to systemic NSAIDs, although its use is limited by local stinging or burning sensation that typically disappears with regular use. Patients should be advised to apply the cream on the affected area with a plastic glove or cotton applicator to avoid inadvertent contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Long -term use of capsaic in is not recommended. Topical Lidocaine is only indicated when there is documentation of a diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In this instance, a trial for a period of not NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 53 greater than four weeks can be considered, with the need for documentation of function al gains as criteria for additional use. Topical NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac gel) may achieve tissue levels that are potentially therapeutic. Overall the low level of systemic absorption can be advantageous, allowing the topical use of these medications when systemic administration is relatively contraindicated (such as patients with hypertension, cardiac failure, peptic ulcer disease or renal insufficiency). Topical Salicylates or Nonsalicylates (e.g. methyl salicylate) overall do not appear to be more effec tive than topical NSAIDs. May be used for a short -term course especially in patients with chronic conditions in whom systemic medication is relatively contraindicated or as an adjuvant to systemic medication Evidence for the Use of Topical Medications C.4.b.vi Opioids Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck diseas e. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatmen ts (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insu fficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post - operatively. C.4.c Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e.

Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 54 The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabi litation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.4.c.i Therapy:Active C.4.c.i.a Therapeutic Exercise - Acute Phase Not Recommended - during acute presentations of Kienb\u00f6ck disease C.4.c.i.b Therapeutic Exercise - Post -Operative/Recovery Recommended - for patients post -operatively. Rationale for Recommendation - Exercise is generally not indicated acutely; however, exercise may be needed in the recovery or post -operative phases. Functional goals should include increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing work abilities . Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 t o 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific obj ective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.4.c.ii Therapy: Passive C.4.c.i Self-Application of Ice Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease . C.4.c.ii Self-application of Heat Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease . C.4.c.iii Splints NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 55 Recommended - for treatment of select patients with acute, subacute, or chronic Kienb\u00f6ck disease . Rationale for Recommendation s - A trial may be helpful to assess whether splinting provides symptomatic relief. However there are concerns over long term use regarding the potential for accelerated debility disuse and weaknesss of the wrist. Evidence for the Use of Initial Care Evidence for the Use of Exercise C.4.d Surgical Treatment Recommended - as an option for patients with moderate to marked impairment if not improved eight weeks post -injury or after six weeks of non -operative treatment due to Kienb\u00f6ck d isease. The choice of surgery is dependent upon staging of disease and discretion of the surgeon . Evidence for the Use of Surgery C.5 Wrist Sprains Wrist sprains (which are partially or totally disrupted ligaments) typically occur with acute traumatic events and comonnly result from slips, trips and falls. Wrist sprain is often a diagnosis of exclusion among patients with pain in the setting of trauma in the absence of a fracture. Sprains may also occur in conjunction with fracture. C.5.a Diagnostic Studies C.5.a.i X-Rays Recommended - to determine whether a fracture is present, particularly for patients with scaphoid pain or scaphoid tubercle tenderness . Evidence for the Use of X -rays C.5.a.ii CT Scan Recommended - to determine whether a fracture is present, particularly for patients with scaphoid pain or scaphoid tubercle tenderness with negative x -rays. Evidence for the Use of CT Scans C.5.a.iii MR A rthrography NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 56 Recommended - for patients without improvement in wrist sprains after approximately 6 weeks of treatment . Rationale for Recommendation s - MR arthrograms are especially helpful to identify ligamentous issues such as scapholunate, lunotriquetral, and TFCC tears that may be diagnosed as simple sprains . Thus, MR arthrography is recommended after approximately 6 weeks of clinical management without patient improvement . Evidence for the Use of MR Arthrography C.5.b Medic ations For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.5.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment o f Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Wrist Sprain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic wrist sprain Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic wrist sprain , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.5.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment i s contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequ ency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 57 Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.5.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effe cts of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.5.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Wrist Sprain Pain Recommended - for treatment of wrist sprain pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with wrist sprain pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. C.5.b.v Opioids Recommended - for the treatment of select patients with pain from severe wrist sprains. Indications Select patients with severe pain from severe wrist sprains with insufficient control from other means, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs or with contraindications for NSAIDs. Considerable cautions are recommended concerning opioids and minimum numbers of doses should be prescribed as duration of treatmen t for wrist sprains is usually limited. Frequency/Dose As needed dosing. Among the few patients requiring opioids, most require at most a few days to not more than seven days of NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 58 treatment and then generally have insufficient pain for further treatmen t with opioids. Indications for Discontinuation Resolution of pain sufficiently to not require opioids, consumption that does not follow prescription instructions, adverse effects. Rationale for Recommendation - Most patients do not require opioids. Some patients, particularly with more severe sprains may require opioids. They are recommended for limited duration (not more than seven days) use in select patients with wrist sprains. C.5.c Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury st atus in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are depe ndent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized ove r passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.5.c.i Therapy - Active C.5.c.i.a Therapeutic Exercise - for treatment of moderate or severe acute or subacute wrist sprains. Recommended - for the treatment of moderate or severe acute or subacute wrist sprains. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documenta tion of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 59 of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.5.c.i i Therapy - Passive C.5.c.ii.a Relative Rest Recommended - for treatment of acute wrist sprains. C.5.c.ii.b Ice - Self-application Recommended - for treatment of acute wrist sprain. C.5.c.ii.c Heat - Self-appliation Recommended - for treatment of acute wrist sprain. C.2.c.ii.d Mobilization / Immobilization Recommended - Splinting for treatment of moderate or severe acute or subacute wrist sprains. Evidence for Initial Care Evidence for the Use of Exercise C.5.d Surgery Not recommended - for treatment of acute or subacute wrist sprain in the absence of a remediable defect. Evidence for the Use of Surgery C.6 Mallet Finger Mallet finger is a common occupational injury, although it may occur with minimal apparent trauma. The injury involves rupture of the extensor mechanism of a digit at the distal upper extremity joint with or without fracture of the distal phalangeal segment Mallet finger is readi ly diagnosed based on the presentation of inability to extend the distal interphalangeal joint, generally in the context of trauma or interphalangeal joint arthrosis. C.6.a Diagnositc Studies NYS WCB Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 60 C.6.a.i X-Rays Recommended - in most cases of mallet finger to determine if a fracture is present . Evidence for the Use of X -rays C.6.a.ii Ultrasound Not recommended - to diagnose mallet finger. C.6.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.6.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) f or Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Mallet finger Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic mallet finger Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic mallet finger , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.6.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

C.6.b.v Opioids for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Mallet Finger Pain Not Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic mallet finger pain. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 62 Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, s elect use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post - operatively. Evidence for the Use of Medications C.6.c Rehabilitation C.6.c.i Therapy: Active C.6.c.i.a Therapeutic Exercise Not R ecommended - acutely and most patients with mallet finger do not require participation in an exercise program. Evidence for the Use of Exercise Recommended - In select patients with residual deficits, particularly post -operatively. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with docume ntation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased g rip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.6.c.ii Therapy: Passive C.6.c.ii.a Splints - Extension Splinting With the Joint in a Neutral Position Recommended - for treatment of acute or subacute mallet finger . Indications - Acute or subacute mallet finger. Frequency/Duration - Splinting for six to eight weeks, possible nocturnal use for an additional two to four weeks . Splints must hold the finger in continuous, full extension for a minimum duration of six weeks. Some protocols involve eight NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 63 weeks, while some involve nocturnal use for an additional two to four weeks. Evidence for the Use of Splints C.6.c.ii.b Instructions for Splint Wear Recommended - that careful instructions on splint wear be provided to patients. Evidence for the Use of Splint Wear C.6.d Surgery Not Recommended - In general Recommended - in select patients with displaced fractures when the DIP joint is subluxed. C.7 entrapment of the digits is a disorder characterized by snapping or locking of the thumb or fingers (with or without pain). Most cases are secondary to thickening of the digit's A1 pulley, but other pathogeneses are possible. C.7.a Diagnostic Studies There are no special tests that are typically performed . X-rays are usually not helpful. The threshold for testing for confounding conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and connective tissue disorders should be low particularly to prevent other morbidity. Evidence for the Use of Diagnostic Studies C.7.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medicat ions. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing.

The location of the lesion affecting the ulnar nerve as it crosses through Guyon's canal and the wrist is predictive of clinical symptoms . This canal is dissimi lar to the carpal canal in that the tendons and their tenosynovium do not accompany the nerve, thus most of the usual postulated causal mechanisms for carpal tunnel syndrome are not possible. However, use of the hypothenar area of the hand as a hammer is a postulated occupational mechanism. C.9.a Diagnostic Studies C.9.a.i Electrodiagnostic Studies Recommended - to confirm clinical suspicion of ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist. Rationale for Recommendation - studies need to be performed by well - trained electrodiagnosticians, preferably certified by the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine. Evidence for the Use of Electrodiagnostic Studies - Ulnar Nerve Entrapment at the Wrist C.9.a.ii MRI or Ultrasound Not Recommended - to diagnose ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist. Recommended - for a suspected soft-tissue mass . MRI is generally preferable for soft tissue masses such as ganglion cysts. Evidence for the Use of MRI and Ultrasound - Ulnar Nerve Entrapment at the Wrist C.9.a.iii CT Recommended - to diagnose ulnar nerve entrapment at the wrist if a hook of the hamate fracture is suspected based upon the history, a mechanism of potential fracture, focal pain at the hamate and where there are ulnar nerve symptoms.

NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 88 Evidence for the Use of Ice/Heat for Acute or Subacute Non - specific Hand, Wrist, or Forearm Pain C.12 Scaphoid Fracture Scaphoid fractures, also known as wrist navicular fractures, are among the most common fractures of the carpal bones , Most are not occupational, but some clearly are work -related. The primary mechanism of scaphoid injury is a fall on the outstret ched hand, or from axial loading with a closed fist such as grasping a steering wheel in an auto accident. Scaphoid fractures are prone to non -union and avascular necrosis, particularly those involving the proximal third of the navicular, and especially if displaced. Healing problems in the proximal third have been attributed to limited blood supply that is disrupted by the fracture plane . The main initial tasks are to confirm a fracture, identify those patients with fractures best treated with surgery, and treat those with a high clinical suspicion of fracture with appropriate splinting. Patients frequently complain of persistent swelling and tenderness near the thumb base in the area of the scaphoid. C.12. a Diagnostic Studies C.12. a.i X-Rays Recommended - for diagnostic purposes that include at least 3 to 4 views including a \"scaphoid view .\" C.12. a.ii X-Rays - Follow -up in two weeks Recommended - for evaluation of potential scaphoid fracture s,) particularly for patients with a high clinical suspicion of fracture , but negative initial x -rays.

Indications - At least 48 hours after the injury with continuing clinic suspicion of scaphoid fractur e. Rationale for Recommendation Bone scans are not required for evaluation of th e majority of patients with scaphoid fractures; however, in those patients with a clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, but negative x-rays, bone scans may assist in securing an earlier diagnosis that may obviate prolonged splinting in those without a f racture. Thus, bone scans are recommended for these select patients. Evidence for the Use of Bone Scans for Scaphoid Fractures C.12. b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective.

Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The p atient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.12. d.i Therapy:Active C.12. d.i.a Therapeutic Exercise - for Post -operative Scaphoid Fractures Recommended - for the treatment of post-operative scaphoid fractures Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional impr ovement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As part NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 93 of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Evidence for the Use of Physical Methods/Rehabilitation for Scaphoid Fractures C.12.e Surgery C.12.e.i Surgical Fixation Recommended - for displaced scaphoid fractures Rationale for Recommendation - Displaced fractures are believed to require surgical treatment with fixation. High-risk scaphoid fractures should be promptly referred to hand or orthopaedic surgical specialists for definitive treatment because of the higher risk of these fractures developing a nonunion, malunion, or degenerative joint disease. C.12.e.ii Surgical Intervention of Non-Displaced or Minimally Displaced Scaphoid Fractures Recommended - for select patients requiring earlier functional recovery. Not Recommended -in general, non displaced fractures are best treated with cast immobilization. Rationale for Recommendation -Surgical intervention may be appropriate in patients with non -displaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures who cannot or do not wish to be treated with an attempt at non -operative treatment. This includes athletes. It also may include patients who are unable to work until the fracture is healed . The decision to surgically treat a non -displaced scaphoid fracture is a decision between the ortho pedist and patient with a discussion suggested to include the benefits of earlier functional recovery versus the longer term risks of osteoarthrosis. Evidence for the Use of Surgery vs. Non -operative Treatment for Scaphoid Fractures C.12.e.ii i Hardware Removal Recommended - In select cases where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated, as per doctor / patient preference . NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 94 Indications: in cases as per doctor / patient preference where there is 1) protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging, and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response. C.13 Distal Phalanx Fractures and Subungual Hematoma Fingertip or distal phalangeal fractures are frequently cited as the most common fractures of the hand, with the tuft being the most common. Tuft fractures are most often usually due to a crush injury of the fingertip, resulting in comminuted or transverse fractures and are a common occupational injury. Often, they are accompanied with nail bed laceration and subungual hematoma. Tuft fractures are generally stable and heal uneventfully because of the soft tissue support of the fibrous septae and nail plate. Crush fractures or avulsion fractures involving the proximal base of the distal phalanx however may also involve flexor or extensor tendons and may require surgical intervention. Mallet fracture or mallet finger is a common fracture -dislocation injury of the distal phalanx involving loss of continuity of the extensor tendon over the distal interphalangeal joint. Subungual Hematoma , blood trapped under the nail after trauma. C.13. a Diagnostic Studies C.13. a.i X-rays Recommended - to diagnose tuft fractures. Frequency/Duration - Obtaining x-rays once is generally sufficient. Follow - up x-rays are rarely indicated aside from complicated healing. Evidence for the Use of X -rays for Diagnosing Tuft Fractures C.13. a.ii MRI / CT / Ultrasound / Bone Scan Imaging Not recommended - for diagnosing tuft fractures. Evidence for the Use of MRI/CT/Ultrasound/Bone Scan Imaging for Diagnosing Tuft Fractures C.13. b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 95 effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.13.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Tuft Fractures Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic tuft fractures pain. Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic tuft fractures pain , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.13.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and freq uency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.13.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommende d - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial eff ects of aspirin, the NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 96 NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.13.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Tuft Fractures Pain Recommended - for treatment of tuft fractures pain, particularly in patients wit h contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with tuft fractures pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Tuft fractures Pain C.13.b.v Opioids Limited Use of Opioids for Acute and Post -operative Pain Managem ent Recommended - for limited use (less than seven days) for acute and post-operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For acute injury and post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more effi cacious treatments (especially elevation, splinting) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for R ecommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post -operative patients with primary use at night to achi eve sleep post-operatively. C.13. b.vi Antiobioitic Prophylaxis Not Recommended - use of post -trephination antibiotic prophylaxis for open fractures. Evidence for the Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Open Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 97 C.13. b.vi Tetanus Immunization Recommended - that tetanus immunization status to be updated as necessary. Indications - Wounds that are not clean or burns if more than 5 years have elapsed since last tetanus immunization. Evidence for the Use of Tetanus Immunization C.13. c Treatments Tuft fractures associated with nail avulsion may require reduction of the nail plate under the eponychium, or re moval if reduction cannot be performed. Orthopedic assistance is usually not required for uncomplicated closures. Open fractures with extensive soft tissue damage frequently are associated with chronic pain and disability and generally require assistance from an orthope dic or hand surge on. C.13. c.i Trephination Recommended - for management of subungual hematoma. C.13. c.ii Nail Removal or Nail Bed Laceration Repair Not Recommended - for the management of subungual hematoma in the absence of nail bed laceration . Recommended - for the management of subungual hematoma associated with nail bed laceration to avoid future cosmetic defects . C.13. c.iii R eduction Of The Nail Plate Under the Eponychium Recommended - in select cases C.13. c.iv Removal of the Nail Plate Under the Eponychium Recommended - in slect cases if reduction of the nail plate under the eponychium cannot be performed. Evidence for the Use of Trephination and Nail Removal or Laceration Repair NYS WCB Injuries 98 C.13. c.v.a Protective splinting of the distal phalanx to the PIP Recommended - for fractures . Duration - Approximately 3 weeks. C.13. c.v.b Finger splinting of tuft fractures Recommended - splinting the finger to prevent further discomfort or injury . C.13. c.vi Reduction of (the relatively uncommon ) significantly displaced fractures Recommended - Reduction and splint immobilization In the small percentage of patients where reduction cannot be achieved , referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be indicated. C.13. d Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker t o pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.

C.13. d.i Therapy: Active C.13. d.i.a Therapeutic Exercise Recommended - in select cases for treatment of tuft fractures . Rationale for Recommendation - Joint mobilization therapy may be useful for complicated injuries or post surgical fixation. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 99 up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As par t of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. Evidence for the Use of Physical or Occupational Therpay for tuft fractures C.13. e Surgery C.13.e.i Recommended - for fractures that are extremely displaced, unable to be reduced or are unstable . Rationale for Recommendation - Distal phalangeal diaphyseal fractures rarely require operative fixation, except those that are extremely displaced, unable to be reduced or are unstable. Retrograde percutaneous Kirschner -wire fixation is the preferred internal fixation technique. C.13. e.ii Hardware Removal Recommended - In select cases where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated, as per doctor / patient preference. Indications: in cases as per doctor / patient preference where there is 1) protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging, and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response. Evidence for the Use of Surgery for Distal phalangeal diaphyseal fractures C.14 Middle and Proximal Phalangeal and Fractures Fractures of the proximal and middle phalanges repres ent approximately 46% of fractures of the hand and wrist. Fortunately, most are uncomplicated and are non -surgical cases. Metacarpal fractures comprise roughly 1/3 of hand fractures, with fifth metacarpal neck fractures (sometimes called \"Boxer's fracture \") accounting for 1/3 to 1/2 of these injuries, and fractures of the thumb constituting another 25%. Physicians who encounter hand fractures must be able to properly diagnose and manage these hand fractures, as improper management may result in permanent impairment and disability from bone shortening, permanent angulation, joint and finger stiffness, and loss of hand function. Proximal phalangeal fractures particularly have a significant potential for NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 100 hand impairment particularly if suboptimally managed because of the importance of this bone in longitudinal transfer of axial forces between the carpal and d istal phalangeal joints, and the PIP joint for digit mobility. Decisions for surgical intervention should be offered upon careful consideration balancing risk of superior radiographic reduction with higher risk of debilitating stiffness from the post -opera tive rehabilitative state, with confidence that non - operative therapy can be improved upon. C.14 .a Diagnostic Studies C.14. a.i X-Rays Recommended - for diagnosing phalangeal or metacarpal fractures and should include three projections , including a posteroanterior, lateral, and oblique view. A true lateral projection isolating the involved digit is required. Evidence for the Use of X -rays for Diagnosing Phalangeal or Metacarpal Fractures C.14. a.ii MRI, CT, Ultrasound , or Bone Scanning for Diagnosing Phalangeal or Metacarpal Fractures Not Recommended - for diagnosing phalangeal or metacarpal fractures.

C.14. b.vi Antibiotic Prophylaxis Not Recommended - for open phalangeal fractures . Evidence for the Use of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for open phalangeal fractures C.14. b.vii Tetanus Immunization Status for Open Fractures Recommended - status to be updated as necessary. Indication - Wounds that are not clean or burns if more than 5 years have elapsed since last tetanus immunization. Evidence for the Use of Tetanus Immunication f or Open Fractures C.14. c Initial Management Initial management should include treatment of soft tissue injuries and pain control following completion of physical examination. Regional anesthesia may be administered as clinically indicated to complete diagnostic assessment (passive range of motion, rotational alignment) and to perform closed reduction of the fracture, although not until neurovascular examination is documented. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 103 Evidence for the Use of Digital Block for Middle and Proximal Phalangeal or Metacarpal Fractures C.14. c.i Immobilizaiton Immobilization or fixation technique is dictated by the physical and radiographic findings. More than 90% of phalangeal fractures can be managed non -operatively. Non -operative management techniques include padded aluminum splints, buddy tape, functional splinting, and gutte r casting. C.14. c.i.a Immobilization Recommended - for treatment of middle and proximal phalanx fractures. Frequency/Duration - When percutaneous fixation with wire is used, supplemental stabilization with splint or casting for three to four weeks sho uld also be used as the wire does not provide sufficient rigidity. C.14. c.i.b Non-operative management (immobilization) of non - displaced and stable transverse diaphyseal fractures of the middle and proximal phalanges Recommended - as these fractures do not require fixation and can be managed without surgery. Frequency/Duration - Immobilization of the affected digit with neighboring digit in 70 to 90 of MCP flexion for three weeks Rationale for Recommendation - These fractures have good results with non -operative management. The tolerance limits for non -operative management after closed reduction are angulation of 10\u00b0, shortening less than 2mm, bone apposition of greater than 50%, and no malrotation. Displacement outside these limits should be evaluated for treatment with closed reduction and percutaneous fixation, or upon failure of closed reduction, open reduction and internal fixation. C.14. c.i.c Non-operative Management of Non -displaced Oblique Fractures of the Middle and Proximal Phalanges Recommended - as these fractures are usually stable and require rigid immobilization alone. C.14. c.i.d Closed Reduction with Splinting Recommended - for base phalanx fractures. Indications - Involvement of less than 40% of the middle phalanx base. C.14. d Rehabilitation NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 104 Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e.

C.14. e.i.b Surgical Management for Malrotated Phalangeal Fractures Recommended - if malrotation cannot be corrected and stabilized by closed reduction. Rationale for Recommendation - Surgical management for malrotated phalangeal and metacarpal fractures is recommended, to prevent or reduce rotational deformity that can result in fingers crossing over each other or interfering with hand function, if malrotation cannot be corrected and stabilized by closed redu e.i.c Metacarpal Fractures Non-Operative Treatment of Head Fracture using closed reduction and protective immobilization with radial or ulnar gutter splint Recommended - for fractures with less than 20% of joint involvement . Rationale for Recommendation - Cases with greater than 20% joint involvement likely require open reduction and internal fixation followed by nearly immediate motion. C.14.e.ii Non -Operative C.14. e.ii.a Non-operative Treatment of Distal Metacarpal Fracture with Acceptable Angulation Recommended - Degree of angulation 30 degrees in the ring finger and 10\u00b0 in the index and long fingers . C.14. e.ii.b Non-operative Treatment of Fifth Metacarpal N eck Fracture s (Boxer's Fracture) Recommended - before surgical treatment for most 5th metacarpal neck fractures (less than 45 degrees angulation). C.14. e.ii.c Use of Functional Therapies (including taping, functional bracing and strapping) for Fifth Metacarpal Neck Fracture s Recommended - rather than casting or ulnar splinting C.14. e.ii.d X-rays in Follow -up of Non-Operative Metacarpal Neck Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 106 Recommended for patients at risk for displacement after reduction Rational e for Recommendation -. Follow -up radiographs are indicated if physical examination suggests loss of reduction or instability . Radiographs may be indicated 7 to 10 days after injury to ensure no (further) displacement or malrotation . C.14.f Shaft Metacarpal Fractures Shaft metacarpal usually transverse, oblique, spiral or comminuted. . Decisions for non -operativ e versus surgical intervention balance acceptance of potential metacarpal shortening with risks accompanying surgical intervention. C.14.f.i Surgery C.14.f.i.a Surgical Management of Metacarpal shaft fractures. Recommended - fixation (pinning, wire, plate, lag screws). Indication: for fractures that cannot be reduced, are unstable, or have multiple neighboring shaft fractures C.14. f.i.b Surgical Management for Base Fractures of the Proximal Metacarpal Recommended - as these fracture s are rarely stable. C.14. f.i.c Surgical Management Bennett's Fracture and Rolando's Fracture Recommended - for Bennett's and Roland's fractures as these fracture types are unstable. C.14. f.i.d Surgical Management for Malrotated Phalangeal fractures Recommended - as deformity and impairment may result. C.14. f.i.e Hardware Removal Recommended - In select cases where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated, as per doctor / patient preference. Indications: in cases as per doctor/patient preference where there is 1) protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging, and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response. Evidence for the Use of Surgery for Malrotated Phalangeal Fractures NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Injuries i Non-Operative C.14. f.ii.a Non-operative Management of Metacarpal Shaft Fractures Recommended - Non-operative management of metacarpal shaft fractures is recommended in select patients . Indications : If adequate closed reduction is achieved and the fracture is stable, with cast immobilization C.15 Distal Forearm Fractures There are several types of distal forearm fractures in adults, the most common being Colles' fracture . The distinguishing feature for Colles' fra cture is that fracture fragments are displaced or angulated dorsally on a lateral view x -ray. Other adult distal radi al fractures include displaced fracture fragments that have an anterior angulation and displaced fracture fragments that are displaced palmarly and may have an anterior angulation. Despite the severity of these injuries, with proper diagnosis and managemen t most patients will have a satisfactory outcome. Distal radial fractures are the result of traumatic forces, most commonly related to falling on the outstretched hand. The typical mechanism for Colles' fracture is breaking the fall with the hand outstre tched and wrist in dorsiflexion, although a minority occur due to an impact on the dorsal aspect of the hand while the wrist is flexed (jam injury into the dorsum of hand) or a direct blow to the radial stylus. Wrist injuries associated with significant pain, swelling, ecchymosis, crepitance, or deformity should be considered to be fractured until proven otherwise. Forearm fractures may also result in concomitant vascular, neurological, ligament and tendon injuries. Further, as distal forearm fractures are the result of trauma, careful inspection for other traumatic injuries should be included, such as elbow, shoulder, neck, head, and hip. In general, most distal forearm fractures should be managed by an orthopedic or hand surgeon and consultat ion is recommended. C.15. a Diagnostic Studies C.15. a.i X-ray for Suspected Distal Forearm Fracture s Recommended - as a first -line study for suspected distal forearm fracture s; posterior -anterior , lateral and, if available , oblique views are recommended . Recommended - Contralateral wrist x -ray images should be considered as a comparison that may improve reliability of some radiographic measurements . Rationale for Recommendation Radiographic evaluation should provide the provider necessary information on location, configuration, displacement, subluxation, likelihood of stability, and concomitant NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 108 potential of soft tissue injury. Contralateral wrist x-ray images should be considered as a comparison that may improve reliability of some radiographic measurements, particularly for a more accurate determination of stability and provide greater guidance on indication for treatment. Evidence for the Use of X -rays for Suspected Distal Forearm Fractures C.15. a.ii MRI Recommended - to diagnose suspected soft-tissue trauma after x -ray images confirm a complex displaced, unstable , or comminuted distal forearm fractures. Indication - X-ray confirmation of complex displaced, unstable, or comminuted distal forearm fracture. Rationale for Recommendation - Upon confirmation of displaced, comminuted or unstable fracture, MRI may be an important diagnostic technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of soft tissues related to distal radius fractures, such as to the flexor and extensor tendons or the median nerve. Other potential indications include identification of triangular fib rocartilage complex perforations, ruptures of carpal ligaments, and demonstration of contents of the carpal tunnel . Evidence for the Use of MRI for Dia gnosing Distal Forearm Fractures C.15. a.iii CT Recommended - for investigation of occult and complex distal forearm fractures to gain greater clarity of fracture displacement, articular involvement, and subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint . Indication - Negative x -rays with occult fracture strongly suspected. Rationale for Recommendation - In contrast to MRI, CT shou ld be considered when x -ray image s are negative but on the basis of physical findings an occult fracture is strongly suspected. CT may also be useful for evaluation of complex comminuted fractures, providing superior depiction of distal radial articular surface involvement, fragment positioning, and diagnosis of subluxations of the distal radioulnar joint Evidence for the Use of CT for Diagnosis and Classification of Occult and Complex Distal Forearm Fractures C.15. b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 109 may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective.

C.15.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammator y Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Distal Forearm Fractures Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic distal forearm fractures pain. Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic distal forearm fractures p ain, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effe cts, that necessitate discontinuation. C.15.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, hista mine Type 2 receptor blockers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers.

Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Distal Forearm Fractures Pain C.15.b.v Opioids Limited Use of Opioids for Acut e and Post -operative Pain Management Recommended - for limited use (less than seven days) for acute and post-operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For acute injury and post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more effi cacious treatments (especially elevation, splinting) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for R ecommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achi eve sleep post - operatively. C.15. c Treatments Recommendations for treatment should be based upon the following criteria: is a fracture open or closed, stable or unstable, or likely to become unstable. Non Displsaced Distal Radial Fracture NYS WCB MTG - Hand Distal Radius Fracture s Recommended - Cast immobilization for 6 weeks. Evidence for Immobilization/Fixation for Non -displaced Colles' Fracture Displaced Distal Radial Fracture Distal radial fractures with radiogr aphic measurements of 10\u00b0 or more of dorsal angulation, more than 2 mm of radial shortening or with any degree of unstable fractures are defined as fractures with bone loss or bone involvement that will not allow for structural integrity without the use of internal or external fixation of the bone. C.15. c.i.b Closed Reduction and Casting for Displaced Distal Radial Fractures Recommended - reduction and casting of fractures which are stable on reduction Evidence for the Use of Closed Reduction Technique for Distal Radial Fractures C.15. d Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabi litation plan to facilitate functional gains. .

Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound for Evaluation of Chronic Wrist Pain with Suspected Occult Dorsal or Volar ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.16.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Wrist Ganglia Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic wrist ganglia pain.

At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastroi ntestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.16.b.iii NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effe cts of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin.

Rationale for Recommendation - In the asymptomatic patient, it is reasonable to provide patients reassur ance that the mass is benign, and that the natural course is for most to resolve without treatment, making waiting a reasonable option. Evidence for Non -Operative Management for Acute Asymptomatic Wrist and Hand Ganglia C.16.c.ii Aspiration (without Other Intervention) for Ga nglia Related Pain Recommended - as it may result in immediate of ganglia related pain. Duration - One aspiration is recommended . There is no recommendation on how many times aspiration should be attempted before advancing to other intervention s..

Evidence for Surgical Excision of Upper Extremity Ganglia Evidence for Arthroscopic versus Open Excision for Ganglia C.17 Hand / Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) The term \"hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS)\" has been used since the 1980s to describe the constellation of adverse physiological responses causally associated with high-amplitude vibratory forces, such as those experienced through the use of various hand tools including pneumatic drills, riveters and chain saws or from vibratory rich activities such NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 119 as driving off -road vehicles. Other terms commonly used to describe these responses include Raynaud's phenomenon of occupational origin, white fingers, dead fi ngers, traumatic vasospastic disease (TVD), and \"vibration -induced white finger.\" The adverse effects of HAVS are characterized by circulatory disturbances associated with digital arteriole sclerosis and manifest as vasospasm with local finger blanching; sensory and motor disturbances manifest as numbness, loss of finger coordination and dexterity, clumsiness and inability to perform intricate tasks; and musculoskeletal disturbances manifest as swelling of the fingers, bone cysts and vacuoles. There are a lso several reports of association of CTS with HAVS and exposure to vibration. Epidemiologic evidence indicates there is a latency period of from 1 to 16 years of exposure before onset of HAVS, with a trend for decreasing prevalence as changes in work -practice and anti -vibratory tools and dampening actions have been implemented.. The pathophysiologic changes related to vibration are initially reversible, but with increasing duration and intensity of exposure, the disorder may continue to progress or bec ome permanent.

C.19 Human Bites, Animal Bites and Associated Lacerations Although most bites occ ur from animals known to the victim, occupations that may be at higher risk for animal bites include veterinarians, animal handlers, police officers, utility services personnel who access private property, mail carriers, and other similar professions. Huma n bites are common in care givers, educators, law enforcement officers, NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 127 and in instances of accident or workplace violence that may involve the fist or hand being cut by contact with teeth. Other than deep destruction of tissue requiring reconstruction, r isk of infection is the primary concern for animal bites. There also are other zoonotic diseases such as rabies, cat scratch fever, and human blood borne pathogens exposures that should also be considered. Rates may be higher for wounds of the hand, depth of penetration into the skin, and length of time before wound is irrigated and cleaned. For purposes of this guideline, discussion and recommendations are made based on bites and/or contact with saliva regarding rabies risk to the extremities or trunk as w ell. C.19.a Physical Exam A careful history for time and location of the bite and/or contact with saliva should be obtained as it will help guide clinical decisions regarding prophylaxis. If possible, information about the type of animal and its health status as well as the circumstances related to why the bite occurred should be obtained. Tetanus and rabies immunization status should be established and prophylaxis given if indicated. A detailed medical history pertaining to tetanus and in the ca se of animal bites, exposure to saliva, rabies immunization status, and underlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus or other immune -compromising conditions is important. Tetanus immunization ( per CDC recommendations ) and rabies prophylaxis ( per CDC recommendations ) should be given if indicated. Most wounds are puncture wounds, but some wounds may be considered for suturing. C.19.b Diagnostic Studies C.19.b.i Routine Wound Culture and Sensitivity of Animal and Human Bites Not Recommended - as it has not been shown to be an effective predictor for infection or subsequent treatment of infected wounds.

In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effe cts of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.19.c.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Animal and Human Bites Pain Recommended - for treatment of animal and human bites pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with animal and human bites pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 129 Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. C.19.c.v Opioids Not Recommended - for the treatment of animal and human bites pain C.19.d Treatments C.19.d.i Initial Care C.19.d.i.a Blood Borne Pathogen Protocol for Human Bites Recommended - exposures that could be considered high risk for viral blood borne pathogen transmission be evaluated and treated according to blood borne pathogen protocols. Rationale for Recommendation - Exposures that could be considered high risk for transmitting viral blood borne pathogens (HIV, HBV, HCV), such as a traumatic bite lacerations should be considered for testing and prophylaxis according to standard protocols particularly as injuries with HI V contaminated blood carry substantially reduced risk of transmission if prophylactic anti -virals are administered in a timely manner . C.19.d.i.b Prophylactic Antibiotics for Dog Bite Wounds Recommend ed - for treatment of dog bite wounds. Indication - All dog bites. Dose/Frequency - Different antibiotics have been used in the quality studies, including penicillin VK, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, positive cove rage is required Evidence for the Treatment of Dog Bites C.19.d.i.c Prophylactic Antibiotics for Treatment of Human Bite Wounds. Recommended - for treatment of human bite wounds. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 130 Rationale for Recommendation - Given the reported higher incidence of wound infections related to human bites , the balance of evidence suggests prophylactic treatment is appropriate. Pathogens are usually gram -positive bacteria; prophylactic coverage from a broad -spectrum oral antibiotic is suggested to cover most typical staphylococcal and streptococcal species. Evidence for the Treatment of Human Bites C.19.d.i.d Prophylactic Antibiotics for Treatment of C at Bite Wounds. Recommended - for treatment of cat bite wounds. Rationale for Recommendation - Reported incidence rates of infections from cat bites is 20 to 40%, and complications related to cat bites may be more significant. Therefore, broad spectrum antibiotics that include coverage for Pasteurella multocida, which is the most common pathogen contracted from cat bites , may be indicated. Evidence for the Use of Prophlactic Antibiotics for Cat Bit e Wounds C.20 Hand / Finger Osteoarthrosis For most purposes, a history and physical examination is sufficient but sometimes x -rays are used. X -rays may be used to document the degree and extent of involvement. However, x -rays can be negative in those with symptomatic osteoarthrosis or may demonstr ate evidence of dis ease among those who are asymptomatic. C.20.a Diagnostic Studies C.20.a.i X-Rays to Evaluate Hand Osteoarthrosis Recommended - in select patients to define objective evidence of the extent of hand osteoarthrosis . Rationale for Recommendation - Most patients do not require x -rays for diagnosis and can be managed clinically. However, in select cases, x -rays are helpful and may assist in diagnosing and treating the condition . Evidence for the Use of X -rays for Hand/Finger Osteoarthrosis C.20.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 131 may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.20.b.i Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic upper Hand Osteoarthrosis Pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic hand osteoarthrosis pain. Indications - For acute, subacute, or chronic hand osteoarthrosis pain , NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms , lack of efficacy, or development of adverse effects, that necessitate discontinuation. C.20.b.ii NSAID s for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Recommended - for concominent use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor blockers, and p roton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term tr eatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommended. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAI D. C.20.b.iii NSAIDS for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 132 primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial eff ects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.20.b.iv Acetaminophen for Treatment of Hand Osteoarthrosis Pain Recommended - for treatment of hand osteoarthrosis pain, particularly in patie nts with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with hand osteoarthrosis pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose/Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as -needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effe cts or intolerance. Evidence for the Use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.b.v Topical NSAIDs May achieve tissue levels that are potentially therapeutic. Ov erall the low level of systemic absorption can be advantageous, allowing the topical use of these medications when systemic administration is relatively contraindicated (such as patients with hypertension, cardiac failure, peptic ulcer disease or renal ins ufficiency). Recommended - to control pain associated with hand osteoarthrosis. Indications - Mild, moderate, or severe hand osteoarthrosis. Frequency/Duration - See manufacturer's recommendation. Indications for Discontinuation - Resolution, intolerance, adverse effects, or lack of benefits. Evidence for the Use of Topical NSAIDs for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.b.vi Opioids - Oral, Transdermal, and Parenteral (Includes Tramadol) Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic hand/finger osteoarthrosis pain. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operativ e pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 133 Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for noctur nal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post - operatively. Complimentary / Alternative Therapies C.20.b.vii Complimentary/ Alternative Therapies Not Recommended - Glucosamine , chondroitin -sulfonyl harpagophytum, avocado soybean unsaponifiables, ginger, oral enzymes, and rose hips are often classified as complementary and alternative therapies that are sometimes used by patients for treatment of osteoarthrosis . C.20.b.viii Capsaicin Recommended - for treatment of chronic hand osteoarthrosis or acute flares of osteoarthrosis. Indications - Hand osteoarthrosis pain or acute flares (study has also included rheumatoid arthritis patients). Frequency/Duration - Up to 4 times a day. Dose - See manufacturer's recommendation. Indications for Discontinuation - Excessive burning of the skin or other intolerance. Not recommended for continual use, rather periods without use have been recommended. Evidence for the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.c Treatment C.20.c.i Splinting Recommended - for acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis. Indications - Hand osteoarthrosis symptoms insufficiently treated with NSAIDs, and/or topical Injections NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 134 Recommended - in select patients for the treatment of subacute or chronic hand osteoarthrosis. Indications - Moderately severe or severe hand osteoarthrosis pain with insufficient control with NSAID(s), acetaminophen, and potentially splinting and/or exercise. Its usual purpose is to gain sufficient relief to either resume medical management or to delay operative intervention. Frequency/Duration - One injection should be scheduled, rather than a series of three . Indications for Discontinuation - In patients who respond with a pharmacologically appropriate several weeks of temporary partial relief of pain, but who then have worsening pain and function, a repeat injection is an option. If the re has not been a response to a first injection, a second injection is not recommended. However, i f the physician believes the medication was not well placed and/or if the underlying condition is so severe that one steroid bolus could not be expected to ad equately treat the condition, a second injection may be indicated. There are not believed to be benefits beyond approximately three injections in a year. Rationale for Recommendations - Intraarticular Glucocorticosteroid Injections are a short to imtermediate intervention with approximately three months of benefit. They are recommended as an option for treatment of hand OA patients particularly after inadequate results from NSAID trials or other non -operative interventions. C.20.c.ii.b Intraarticu lar Hyaluronate Injection Recommended - in select patients for the treatment of subacute or chronic hand osteoarthrosis where other treatments have failed . Indications -Hand osteoarthrosis pain with insufficient control with NSAID(s), acetaminophen, and potentially splinting and/or exercise. Its usual purpose is to gain sufficient relief either to resume medical management or to delay operative intervention. Dose /Frequency - See manufacturer's recommendations. Indications for Disc ontinuation - Sufficient relief to not require additional injection(s), failure to improve, or allergic reactions. Evidence for the Use of I ntraarticular Injections for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.c.ii.c Prolotherapy Injections NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 135 Not Recommended - the use of prolotherapy injections for treatment of subacute or chronic hand osteoarthrosis. Evidence for the Use of Injections for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.d Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker to pre-injury status in so far as is feasibl e. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivere d by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabi litation plan to facilitate functional gains. C.20.d.i Therapy - Active C.20.d.i.a Therapeutic Exercise Recommended - for treatment of acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis. Frequency/Dose/Duration -Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for patients with mild functional deficits or up to 12 to 15 with more severe deficits with documentation of ongoing objective functional improvement. When there are ongoing functional deficits, more than 12 to 15 visits may be indicated if there is documentation of functional improvement towards specific objective functional goals (e.g., increased grip strength, key pinch strength, range of motion, advancing ability to perform work activities). As par t of the rehabilitation plan a home exercise program should be developed and performed in conjunction with the therapy. C.20.d.ii Therapy - Passive C.20.d.ii.a Self-Application of Ice NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 136 Recommended - for chronic hand osteoarthrosis. C.20.d.ii.b Self-Application of Heat Recommended - for acute flares or chronic hand osteoarthrosis. Indications - Hand osteoarthrosis symptoms insufficiently treated with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or topical medications. Frequency/Dose - Self-applications of heat, most commonly 15 to 20 minutes, 3 to 5 times a day. C.20.d.ii.c Low-level laser therapy Not Recommended - for treatment of hand osteoarthrosis. Evidence for the Use of Low -Level Laser Therapy for Hand Osteoarthrosis Evidence for Splinting and Exercise for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.e Surgery Various surgical procedures are utilized to treat patients with hand osteoarthrosis. Among these are arthrodesis, arthroplasty and various other reconstructive procedures . C.20.e.i Reconstructive Surgery Recommended - for treatment of select patients w ith trapeziometacarpal arthrosis. C.20.e.ii Trapeziectomy Recommended - for treatment of thumb CMC joint osteoarthritis. The alternative approaches are at the discretion of the surgeon . C.20.e.iii Fusion Recommended - for treatment of select patients with hand osteoarthrosis Rationale for Recommendation - Joint fusion is generally helpful for patients under age 40 with significantly symptomatic osteoarthrosis and vigorous work activities, who fail to achiev e sufficient relief from other treatments. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 137 Evidence for the Use of Surgery for Hand Osteoarthrosis C.20.e.iv Hardware Removal Recommended - In select cases where there is hardware placed, subsequent hardware removal is indicated, as per doctor / patient preference. Indications: in cases as per doctor / patient preference where there is 1) protruding hardware, (2) pain attributed to the hardware, (3) broken hardware on imaging, and/or (4) positive anesthetic injection response. C.21 Dupuytren's Disease There is insufficient evidence relating Dupuytren's disease to occupational activities Dupuytren's disease is a disorder of the hand involving the formation of fibrosis (scar tissue) in the palm and digits with subsequent contractures. It has strong age and inheritance patterns. Purported risks include the use of alcohol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and epilepsy. There are some reported associations with both heavy and manual work. To help provide improved care f or patients, this disorder is included as an appendix to the Hand, Wrist, and Forearm Disorders Guideline. C.21.a Treatments C.21.a.i Injection Therapy C.21.a.i.a Collagenase Injections Recommended - in select patients for treatment of Dupuytren's disease. Indications - Dupuytren's contractures sufficient to result in impairment, Frequency/Dose - Clostridial collagenase 10,000 U injection; repeat injection(s) at 4 to 6 week intervals for up to 3 injections . Discontinuation - Resolution of contracture, adverse effects . Evidence for the use of Collagenase Injections for treatment of Dupuyt ren's disease Evidence for the Use of 5 -Flourouracil for Dupuytren's Disease NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 138 C.21.b Medications For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs , although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. C.21.b.i Non -Steroidal Drugs (NSAIDs) Recommended - to treat post -operative swelling from surgery for Dupuytren's disease.

There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 139 Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. C.21.b.iv NSAID s for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effe cts Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain discussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first-line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse eff ects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspirin for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effe cts of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. C.21.b.v Acetaminophen for Treatment of Acute, Subacute or Chronic Dupuytrens' disease Pain Recommended - for treatment of Dupuytrens' disease pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with animal and human bites pain, including acute, sub acute, chronic, and post -operative.

Evidence for the use of NSAIDs and Acetaminophen for Post -Op Dupuytren's Disease C.21.b.vi Opioids Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post - operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatmen ts (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 140 Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post - operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep pos t- operatively. C.21.c. Other C.21.c.i Radiotherapy Not R ecommend - to prevent the progression of Dupuytren's disease. Evidence for use of Radiotherapy for Prevention of Progression of Dupuytren's Disease C.21.d Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker t o pre-injury status in so far as is feasible.

Patients who were older teneded to have severe electrodiagnostic findings (p = 0.0001). Significant association between gender and maximal electrodiagnostic findings (p = 0.02). Patients with severe CTS had highest incidence of muscle wasting (22%, p <0.02). \"[E]lectrodiagnostic studies in suspected carpal tunnel syndrome should be reserved for use in the patient with equivocal findings and should not be considered a necessary criterion when history and clinical examination provide this diagnosis.\" Approximately 13% of patients receiving electrodiagnostic studies only to diagnose CTS would be excluded and should be used only in cases of equivocal findings.

It is therefore not recommended to use a specific procedure for the evaluation of each patients suspected of CTS, but (i) to use only sensitive parameters with high specificity as an optimal routine for the investigation of the average CTS patient, (ii) to perform needle EMG in forearm and arm muscles for each patient suspected to have CTS with radiating pain to the arm, and (iii) to perform ulnar motor and sensory nerve conduction studies in order to exclude superimposed peripheral neuropathy.\" Data suggest median sensory nerve conduction studies appear abnormal compared to motor nerve conduction studies in CTS patients.

No significance between group diffe rence in EDS. \"Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with median nerve demyelination but not axonal degeneration may be treated with commonly used components of conservative medical or chiropractic care.\" Baseline did not exclude prior ibuprofen use or manipul ation, but prior use of these treatments is likely differential between the 2 groups and is a potentially fatal study flaw. Ibuprofen use PRN after 2 weeks and subject contact differed between groups, providing bias in favor of manipulation/ultrasound. High dropout rates. Study mainly compares variable dose ibuprofen vs. manipulation plus ultrasound as both splinted. Since ibuprofen not effective and evidence that ultrasound is, results suggest manipulation is not effective. Burke 2007 RCT Sponsored by t he TherapyCare Resources, Inc.

However, methods only defined above/below elbow conduction slowing, without inching technique Mean age: 49.2 years; 32 males, 22 females Endoscopic Neurosurgical decompression procedure (N =29) vs Standard Open Decompressio n procedure (N =27) Follow - ups conducted at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months There were no significant differences between both methods concerning numeric analog scale (P=.84) and Bishop -Score (early follow -up P=1.00, long -term follow -up P=.47). Additionally there was no difference between the methods concerning wound pain (P=.56) and the postoperative electrophysiological findings (P=.62). \"The endoscopic technique showed no additional benefits to open surgery. We could not detect relevant compressions distal to the FCU arch. Therefore, and extensive far distal endosco pic decompression is not routinely required. The open decompression remains the procedure of choice at our institution.\" Methods did not differentiate whether included only cubital tunnel or also condylar groove ulnar neuropathy. No meaningful differences between groups, both showed improvements in outcomes over time. Significantly more hematomas in the endoscopic treatment vs. open treatment groups.

Dias 1987 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 5.0 N = 187 (no mention of gender) patients with unilateral Colles' fractures that were older than 55; No mean age. Undisplaced fractures treated either with conventional 5 weeks cast (Group 1) or cr\u00eape bandage (Group 2) and early mobilization. Displaced fractures were treated either with conventional 5 week cast (Group 3) or modified 5 week cast (Group 4). Follow -Up at weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13. Early mobilization more resolution of wrist swelling first 5 weeks. At 9 an d 13 weeks, wrist girth was similar. Deterioration rate of radiological deformity was similar in conventionally treated groups as with mobilization groups. Grip strength recovery expressed as a percentage of strength of contralateral hand much better in early mobilization groups.

McAuliffe 1987 Prospective RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.5 N = 108 (All Women) who had a Colles' fractures. Plaster immobilization for 3 (Group A) or 5 (Group B) weeks. Follow Up baseline, 3 months, and 1 year. 72% of Group A reported good or excellent results relating to pain, disability, and range of movement at 3 months while 66% of Group B did; after 1 year 85% of Group A had a good or excellent result and 77 % did in Group B. Group A showed statistica l significance for pronation after 1 year, less pain at time of plaster removal, 3 months and 1 -year follow up as well as stronger grip strength after 1 year. \"Early mobilization produced less pain and a stronger grip. It did not lead to any greater loss o f reduction of the fracture. However, there was no significant improvement in the final range of movement of the wrist.\" In this elderly population, mobilization after 3 weeks may lead to less short -term disability. Millet 1995 Prospective Study No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 90 female with unilateral Colles' fracture; Mean age of 61 years. 5 week below elbow plaster cast (N = 45) vs 3 week plaster cast with 2 week flexible cast. Displaced fractures in both groups were manipulated. (N = 45). Patients followed for 3 years. All patients in early mobilization reported greater comfort after switching from plaster to flexible casting. Me an grip scores and joint mobilities higher at all time points with early mobilization, reaching levels of statistical significance at 6, (p < 0.01) months for grip score and 3 months for joint mobility, (p = 0.04). \"Early mobilization is a satisfactory tre atment option for Colles' fracture and may, in fact, hasten functional recovery.\" No significant clinical differences found between the treatment groups.

One -week group Cooney score generally higher at every re -evaluation period than 3-week plaster group. Differences, however, not statistically significant. \"No dislocations occurred. All patients experienced eventful healing with good or excellent r esults in 92% of cases. We believe, therefore, that only minimal immobilization is required in these fractures and that they should be mobilized as soon as comfort allows.\" Higher number of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) cases in 3 -week group than 1 -week group (5 vs.1). Casting/Bracing Wong 2010 Prospective RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 6.5 N=60 (Predominately female) elderly Chinese people with dorsal angulated fracture of the distal radius; Mean Age Group 1 71 (65 -76) Group 2 70 (66 -76) Group 1 (N=30) Patients given plaster of Paris cast preceded by closed reduction. Vs Group 2 (N=30) Patients were treated with K - Wire Follow up at 2 weeks prior to injury and then 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks, 3, 6 months and 1 year after assessment of radiographs. No statistically significant differences between the K -Wire treatment and the plaster of Paris group. \"Although our study showed that the 'tripod technique' [K - Wire] is safe without significant complications, there is an Cochrane review of wiring for distal radial fractures... We do not provide a biomechanical rationale to explain our 'tripod technique' but we feel that it is a better cons truct to prevent collapse of the fracture/\" Data suggest casting alone not better than pinning for extra -articular fractures of the distal radius in elderly Chinese (predominantly female) patients. O'Connor 2003 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 6.5 N = 66 (22 males/44 females) adult patients with minimally displaced radial fractures; Mean Age, Group 1: 56.6 (16 -81).

No significant differences in pain scores. Cast satisfaction higher in splint group at weeks 1, 2, and 6. No difference in anatomical outcome. Functional scores and wrist range of motion were better at 6 weeks, but the differences disappeared at 12 weeks. \"A lightweight splint provides an acceptable, comfortable and economic alternative to plaster of Paris and allows faster restoration of function without an increased risk of malunion.\" Patien ts in splint group were educated on rationale for splint use as authors found cultural bias toward the traditional cast.

Problems with cast answer (1 -10) Fiberglas s vs Quickcast: 1.0\u00b10.8 vs 0.5\u00b10.4 (p<0.001). Some cast complications within both groups, not significant. \"In sum, a short -arm cast constructed of the Quick -Cast does save approximately on cast change in the treatment of distal radius fractures with no a pparent effect on fracture healing. The QuickCast does, however, cost more in materials alone. This financial differential must be weighed against the labor saved of a single cast application with additional savings of time for he applier and patient.\" Small sample size, sparse methods. Data suggest Quick Cast eliminates approximately one cast change without compromise of fracture healing but Quick Cast is more costly. Cohen 2001 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N=200 (No mention of gender) patients who sustained arm or leg injuries required cast support (N=29 individuals with Radial Distal fracture); Mean Age (no Mention?)

Immobilization for 5 weeks with follow -up at 1 and 10 days and 5 weeks after reduction. Mean dorsal angulation 10 days after reduction: slightly better in the dorsal plaster splint group, p=0.04. R adial length at 5 weeks was better in the complete plaster group, p=0.02. \"[S]urgeons caring for such cases may choose the immobilization method for the first 10 days following reduction according to their individual preferences and those of the injured person.\" Data suggest dorsal splinting 10 days after Colles' fracture reductions resulted in a mean difference of n3.4 degrees of dorsal angulation but at 5 weeks, casting was better for a difference of 1.6 mm of radial length. Pain ratings between the two methods were comparable.

Data suggest both long and short arm splints are effective in maintaining the reduction of distal radius fractures but the short ar m splint was preferred by patients. Sarmiemto 1980 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 156 (50 male and 106 female) with Colles' fractures. A median age of 49 years. Bracing in either pronation, fractures were immobilized in a long -arm cast with the wrist at 20\" of volar flexion and ulnar deviation; the elbow at 90\" of flexion and the forearm in either pronation (N = 78) vs Supination the elbow at 90\" of flexion and the forearm in supination (N = 78). Follow -up for 15 weeks. In the Type II category, in the supinated fractures, there were 9 excellent, 4 good and no fair or poor results; in the pronated group, 9 excellent, 8 good and 1 fair result. In combining the results for all types of braced Colles' fractures, (I -IV) 93% of the supination group and 87% of the pronation group achieved excellent or good functional results. \"Treatment w ith functional bracing in supination position yielded 90% excellent or good functional results.\" This paper is quoted in most subsequent research pertaining to bracing.

Polyurethane casts (N = unknown) vs Traditional plaster -of-Paris braces (N = unknown). Follow -up at 6 weeks. No significant difference for secondary adjustment of casts between groups, (p > 0.90). No significant differences for failure of retaining fracture reduction, (p > 0.50). \"Polyurethane braces are a good supplement to plaster -of- Paris bandage in such frac tures and recommended in selected cases.\" Alternative to plaster of Paris in 1980s. Wahlstr\u00f6m 1982 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 42 (all women) with extra articular fractures. Mean age 65 years. Immobilization in pronation (N = 14) vs Supination (N = 12) vs Midway position (N = 16). Follow -up at 10 days and 1 -4 months after reduction. Five fractures had to be re - reduced, one from pronation, one from midway and three from supination group. Patients with redislocation position of the forearm during immobilization is of importance for the degree of redislocation. \" Applicable to cast application rather than long-term functional results.

Closed reduction and two crossed percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation combined with plaster cast support (Arm A, N=20) v. conventional method -reduction by closed manipulation and maintained by plaster cast immobilization (Arm B, N=20). Plaster was removed at week 6. K -wires were removed at 6-8 weeks. Rehabilitation was recommended until near or full functional recovery. Follow period was 6 -14 months. Anatomic end result of Arm A was better than Arm B, p<0.05. There was a significant Satisfactory result in Arm A compared Arm B, p<0.05. \"Closed reduction and Percutaneous kirschner wire fixation combined with plaster cast immobilization is better method than the conventional plaster cast immobilization - in restoration of p reinjury anatomical alignment and there by the functional outcome - in the management of colles' fracture.\" Data suggest percutaneous fixation group superior to cast alone group for maintaining radial length and angulation resulting in better function and also had less reported complications. Ismatullah 2012 Prospective RCT 4.0 (N=30, 13 males/17 females) adult with a comminuted distal radius fracture; Group 1 (N=15) Treated with plaster casting. Vs.

Mean age of 58.4 years. Conventional Colles' plaster cast (N = 163) vs Prefabricated functional brace or the Aberdeen Colles' fracture brace (N = 166). Follow -up for 14 weeks. Functional scores cast/brace non - manipulated group Week 8: 6.7/5.5; Week manipulated group 24: 5.4/5.8. Mean pain score cast/brace non - manipulated group 10 d: 2.2/2.4 p = 0.27; Week 24: 1.0/1.0 p = 0.96; manipulated group 10 d: 1.8/2.1 = 0.19; Week 24: 0.5/0.5 p = 0.043. \"There was no significant difference in the functional outcome between the two treatment groups.\" Author comment on younger patients having better functional results not presented in body of study result s. There appears to be no advantage to flexible brace over cast. Arora 2011 RCT No sponsorship or COI. 4.5 N = 73 (18 male and 55 female) with distal radial fracture; mean age 76.7 (65 -89). Group 1, operative group that underwent Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 12 weeks after injury (N = 36) vs Group 2, immobilized in short arm cast for 5 weeks (N = 37). Follow -up at baseline, 6, 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (DASH) at 6 weeks group 1 vs 2; 18.8\u00b117.9 vs 34.4\u00b122.5 (p = 0.00).

Patients in surgical group reported better grip strength throughout trial. B\u00fcnger 1984 RCT Sponsored by the Danish Medical Research Council grant, and the Medical Research Council for the countries of Sonderjylland, Ribe and 4.5 N = 145 (20 male and 125 female) with Colles' fracture. Age not given. Func tional bracing in supination or FUSU (N = 68) vs Dorsal Plaster Immobilization orDPI (N = 77). Primary treatment; end results (excellent/good)/total 65/72 vs. (p 62/72 vs. 59/62 (p <0.5) \"Functional bracing in supination provided superior results in the treatment of particularly displaced intra -articular Colles' fracture.\" Suggests the functional benefit from FUSU is primarily secondary to decreased fracture redislocation. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 407 Ringkbing grant. No mention of COI. Follow -up after 7 weeks and 3 months. Wik 2009 RCT No mention of sponsorship. No COI. 4.0 N = 72 females who sustained low -energy trauma and displaced Colles' fractures initially suitable for closed reduction and immobilization in plaster cast. Age >50. Reduction and a complete plaster cast (N = 34) vs Reduction and dorsal plaster splint (N = 38). Immobilization for 5 weeks with follow -up at 1 and 10 days and 5 weeks after reduction. Mean dorsal angulation 10 days after reduction: slightly better in the dorsal plaster splint group, (p = 0.04). Radial length at 5 weeks was better in the complete plaster group, (p = 0.02). \"[S]urgeons caring for such cases may choose the immobilization method for the first 10 days following reduction according to their individual preferences and those of the injured person.\" Data suggest dorsal splinting 10 days after Colles' fracture reductions resulted in a mean difference of n3.4 degrees of dorsal angulation but at 5 weeks, cas ting was better for a difference of 1.6 mm of radial length. Pain ratings between the two methods were comparable. Bong 2006 Prospective RCT No sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 85 (85 fractures, 26 male and 59 female) who were used had acquired a displaced distal radial fracture; mean age 64 (27 -91). Group 1 immobilized using short -arm radial gutter splint (N = 38) vs Group 2 immobilized with sugar tong splint. Follow -up 7-10 days after initial injury (N = 47). Radiographs taken in respective splint. No significant difference between loss of fracture reduction, volar tilt, radial height, radial inclination. Disabilities of the ARM, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, Group 1 vs group 1 at 1 week; 62\u00b119 vs 70\u00b115 (p=0.044). \"Based on our study we recommend that surgeons consider using a short - arm radial gutter splint for the initial immobilization of displaced distal radius fractures.\" Sparse baseline comparability details. Data suggest both long and short arm splints are effective in maintaining th e reduction of distal radius fractures but the short arm splint was preferred by patients. Millet 1995 Prospective Study No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 90 female with unilateral Colles' fracture. Mean age of 61 years. 5 week below elbow plaster cast (N = 45) vs 3 week plaster cast with 2 week flexible cast. Displaced fractures in both groups were manipulated. (N = 45). Patients followed for 3 years. All patients in early mobilization reported greater comfort after switching from plaster to flexible casting. Me an grip scores and joint mobilities higher at all time points with early mobilization, reaching levels of statistical significance at 6, (p < 0.01) months for grip score and 3 months for joint mobility, (p = 0.04). \"Early mobilization is a satisfactory tre atment option for Colles' fracture and may, in fact, hasten functional recovery.\" No significant clinical differences found between the treatment groups. Rosetzsky 1982 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 46 (15 male and 35 female) with Colles' fractures of the forearm. Mean age was 45 years. Polyurethane casts (N = unknown) vs Traditional plaster -of-Paris braces (N = unknown). Follow -up at 6 weeks. No significant difference for secondary adjustment of casts between groups, (p > 0.90). No significant differences for failure of retaining fracture reduction, (p > 0.50). \"Polyurethane braces are a good supplement to plaster -of-Paris bandage in such fractures and recommended in selected cases.\" Alternat ive to plaster of Paris in 1980s. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 408 Sarmiemto 1980 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 156 (50 male and 106 female) with Colles' fractures. A median age of 49 years. Bracing in either pronation, fractures were immobilized in a long-arm cast with the wrist at 20\" of volar flexion and ulnar deviation; the elbow at 90\" of flexion and the forearm in either pronation (N = 78) vs Supination the elbow at 90\" of flexion and the forearm in supination (N = 78). Follow -up for 15 weeks. In the Type II category, in the supinated fractures, there were 9 excellent, 4 good and no fair or poor results; in the pronated group, 9 excellent, 8 good and 1 fair result. In combining the results for all types of braced Colles' fractures, (I -IV) 93% of the supination group and 87% of the pronation group achieved excellent or good functional results. \"Treatment with functional bracing in supination position yielded 90% excellent or good functional results.\" This paper is quoted in most subsequent research pertaining to bracing. Gupta 1991 RCT No sponsorship. No mention of COI. 4.0 N = 204 (82 male and 122 female) with displaced Colles' fractures. Mean age 46 years. Plaster immobilization with either: Palmar flexion or PF (N = 60 vs Neutral or NP (N = 75) vs Dorsiflexion or DF wrist position (N = 69). Follow -up for 15 months. Functional results excellent or good/total: Type III PF 20/28; NP fracture, immobilization of the wrist in dorsiflexion would appear to provide better maintenance of reduction.\" Immobilization of wrist in palmar flexion had detrimental effect on hand function. Wahlstr\u00f6m 1982 RCT No mention of sponsorship or COI. 4.0 N = 42 with extra articular fractures. Mean age 65 years. Immobilization in pronation (N = 14) vs Supination (N = 12) vs Midway position (N = 16). Follow -up at 10 days and 1 -4 months after reduction. Five fractures had to be re -reduced, one from pronation, one from midway and three from supination group. Patients with redislocation position of the forearm during immobilization is of importance for the degree of redislocation.\" Appl icable to cast application rather than long-term functional results.

PEMF alone Vs Group D, Control (N=16) Sham PEMF. No Ice. Sham PEMF alone. All treatment were done for 5 consecutive days Visual analogue scale pain scores, volumetric measurements and ROM were measured on days 1, 3, and 5. VAS: The VAS score on day 1 was ranging from low to medium. On day 3, there was no significant drops between the groups. But the sham PEMF with no ice had the least amount of reduction. On day 5, the score for Ice plus PEMF was significantly higher than the other three groups. Volumetric Measurement: Day one, baseline, measurements were comparable between the groups. On day 3, the sham PEMF and no ice group decreased less than the others. Day 5 revealed that Ice plus PEMF was better than the PEMF/no ice and sham PEMF/ no ice group. Also the ice/sham PEMF group was better than the shame PEFM/no ice group. ROM: Flexion improved significantly in the two PEMF (ice/no ice) group compared to the sham PEMF on day 3. Day 5 yielded similar results, but the differences was not significant. Pronation \"The addition of pulsed electromagnetic field to ice therapy produces better overall treatment outcomes than ice alone, or pulsed electromagnetic field alone in pain reduction and range of joint motion in ulnar deviation and flexion for a dist al radius fracture after an immobilization period of 6 weeks\" Data suggest pain was significantly reduced via VAS as well as ulnar ROM deviation with the additition of PEMF to ice or PEMF alone compared to sham groups. NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 414 was the exact opposite. The difference between day 1 and 3 were not significant. But the difference between day 3 and 5 were.

NYS WCB MTG - Hand , Wrist and Forearm Injuries 466 Evidence for Special Studies for HAVS A recent rev iew of the literature concluded that there does not appear to be any single test with satisfactory diagnostic capability in d iagnosing HAVS (white finger), but supports the use of cold provocation testing (CPT) as reasonable. (1460) However, a large scale review of cold provocation testing in over 40,000 UK miners being evaluated for compensation claims fo und only slight correlation of self - reported clinical severity and CPT results, concluding that CPT should not be used for evaluat ing the vascular component of HAVS. (1461) There remains no established standard for CPT methodology, which makes interpr etation and comparisons difficult. While the test is relatively benign and inexpensive, the results are of unknown diagnostic utility. There is little information available supporting the utility of thermographic imaging. Most of the reports are of small populations. The most recent study (21 patients) concluded that none of the available methods is sufficient for arterial constriction testing, but may be useful in follow -up testing of individuals. (1462) A similar story exists for finger systolic blood pressure monitoring as a diagnostic test. A recent prospective study measuring the changes in finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) after segmental local cooling for vibration -induced white finger in vibration exposed vs. non -exposed populations showed a significant decrease in FSBP in the exposed group with reported HAVS vs. non -exposed as well as the exposed with no history of HAVS. The sensitivity and specifici ty of the FSBP test with a cut-off value of 75% of normal at 23 +/ - 1 degrees C, were 65.2 and 87.5%, respectively, and at 21 +/ - 1 degrees C, they were 73.9 and 82.5%, respectively. (1463) However, the study used self -report of HAVS and included retired (no longer exposed) persons in the exposed with HAVS group. Testing for neurological deficits may be slightly more beneficia l than vascular testing for confirming the severity of nerve damage associated with HAVS, although they are not definitive in objectively identifying HAVS. In a follow -up report of UK miners being evaluated for HAVS claims, 57,000 persons evaluated with vi brotactile threshold testing and thermal aesthesiometry showed some evidence that these tests are reliable indicators of underlying neurological damage. (1464) Thus, there is insufficient evide nce for making evidence based recommendations on the utility of each of the various tests currently available for the vascula r and neurological components of HAVS. Administering a combination of these tests may improve the diagnostic utility when considere d in context of the medical history and occupational exposures. Nerve conduction studies may also be indicated to rule out other associated or concomitant upper extremity disorders, although are not likely of useful benefit for diagnosi s of HAVS. In additi on to neurovascular physiologic testing, there are limited reports of serologic testing for HAVS.

Injury at home occurred in 18 cases and at work in 10 cases. Two patients were injured on the street. Penetrating object was glass in 17 injuries, knife in 7 injuries, metallic object in 2, human teeth in 2, machinery in 1, and a stone in 1. A complete US examination was performed in all 30 cases, despite moderate pain in two cases. Of 98 examined tendons, 81 appeared intact and 17 were damaged. Of 81 examined nerves, 63 appeared intact and 18 were damaged. Of 75 examined arteries, 61 appeared intact and 14 were damaged. The lesion path was visualized in 22 of the 30 injuries. In five injuries, the path did not extend beyond the fascial layer (superficial injury), and in two injuries, the path ended in the muscle. Foreign bodies were visualized in five injuries. \"In conclusion, US proved highly effective in detecting tendon and arterial lesions. The results were less reliable regarding nerve damage. US may be effective in identifying hand lesions that require surgical repair and in selecting patients who can be treated without surgical exploration, provided they undergo a second physical e xamination 72 hours after the injury. Further studies in larger numbers of patients are needed to evaluate this possibility.\" Data suggest US is effective in the detection of volar injuries without tendon or arterial leslions but not as good for detection of nerve leslions.

Ten cases had a history of surgical exploration without the use of USG examination, which had no foreign body detected. On USG scan, 100% of the foreign bodies were echogenic. USG revealed a foreign body in 50 patients. All patients underwent surgical exploration or USG - guided removal. Forty -six patients had a foreign body removed. One patient had a negative USG exam and surgical exploring revealed a 7 -mm thorn. USG was falsely positive in three cases with failed surgical manipulation due to the presence of air bubbles and scar tissue, as well in as one case with calcified granuloma. Foreign bodies were thorn, wood, glass, and plastic. The sites of the foreign bodies were foot, hand , leg, arm, forearm, ankle, wrist, knee, and thigh. Sizes of foreign body varied from 4-51 mm and in 50% of cases, the size of the foreign body was greater than 13 mm. \"Real-time high -frequency USG is a highly sensitive and accurate tool for detecting and removing the radiolucent foreign bodies, which are difficult to be visualized by routine radiography.\" Data suggest US can detect radiolucent - soft-tissue foreign bodies that radiographs can not.
