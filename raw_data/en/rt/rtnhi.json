While average mortality rates across the Regi on have decreased in recent years, health indicators for indigenous peoples (where available) demonstrate that urgent action is needed. In comparison with no indigenous communities, most indigenous communities suffer from illiteracy, higher levels of poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic health services. The Pan American Health Organization (P AHO) has supported a number of interventions regarding indigenous health. In compliance with Resolutions CD37.R5 (1993) and CD40.R6 (1997), PAHO launched the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative. Despite notable progress in many areas, achieving equity in health is still pending for most indigenous peoples in the Americas. Thus a strategy to promote and protect the health of th e indigenous peoples is of the utmost importance. This document lays out PAHO's strategy to promote indigenous health over a period of five years. Four strategic lines of action are proposed: (a) To ensu re incorporation of indigenous perspectives into the attainment of the MDGs and national health policies; (b) To improve information and knowledge management on indigenous health issues to strengthen regional and national evidence-based decision-making and monitoring capacities; (c) To integrate the intercultural approach into the national health systems of the Re gion as part of the primary health care strategy; and (d) To develop strategic alliances with indigenous peoples and other key stakeholders to further advance the health of the indigenous peoples. The Executive Committee examined the report and adopted Resolution CE138.R18 for the consideration of the Directing Council. CD47/13 (Eng.)

Between 45 and 50 million indigenous peopl e belonging to more than 400 unique ethnic groups live in the Americas today. Co mprising almost 10% of the total population and 40% of the rural population of Latin America and the Caribbean (Inter-American Development Bank 2003, PAHO 2004), indigenous peoples add considerable vibrancy and diversity to the 24 countries in which th ey live, and they safeguard much of the Western Hemisphere's cultural heritage and biodiversity (Annex A). Despite their invaluable contributions, indigenous peoples are highly vulnerable within the nations they inhabit, and their human rights, as well as their social, political, and economic equality, are compromised or denied. 2. The incidence of poverty and extreme poverty is much higher among indigenous groups in the Americas than among nonindige nous groups. This poverty is intertwined with other complicating factors such as significantly higher illiteracy levels, unemployment, lack of access to or availa bility of social services, human rights violations, displacements due to armed conflicts, and environmental degradation. 3. Traditionally, indigenous populations have suffered from disproportionately high rates of maternal and infant mortalities, ma lnutrition, and infectious diseases. However, as these populations become more mobile, le ss isolated, increasingly urban, and located in border areas, chronic disease and issues su ch as use of drugs and alcohol, suicide, sexually transmitted diseases, and loss of infl uence of traditional health practices have become increasingly important. 4. Although their disease burden and transitional-stage epidemiological profile is similar to other disadvantaged groups in the Region, their poor health status is compounded by discrimination and inequity within the health system. Indigenous populations comprise the majority in several countries and geographic areas, but 40% of the indigenous population lacks access to conventional health-related services and 80% rely on traditional healers as their principal health care providers. This situation is compounded by inequalities related to gender, a nd indigenous women in particular face challenges in obtaining quality health care regarding reproductive health. 5. Although low quality health service provisi on exists in many developing country contexts, these issues are more acute in ar eas inhabited by indigenous peoples. Persistent issues of poor quality service provision such as limited staff competency, noncompliance with evidence-based treatment protocols, medi cation shortage and poor staff retention are common in many of the remote locations in which indigenous peoples live. Additionally, geographic barriers prevent the indigenous fr om gaining access to health care due to distance, means and affordability of transportation, and seasonal geographic isolation. Although health care services are largely free to indigenous peoples, the real cost of care, CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 4 including the out-of-pocket costs of tran sportation, food, accommodation, family care, medication, and loss of workdays, poses a threat to health care access. 6. Cultural barriers present the most comp licated challenge since there is little understanding of the social and cultural factors deriving from the knowledge, attitudes, and practices in health of the indigenous peoples. The bias towards Western medicine and intervention can be offensive or inappropriate for practitioners of traditional medicine. Finding health staff that speak s and understands indigenous languages is difficult, and poor communication between providers and clients at all levels compromises access to quality care. Moreover, indigenous people are often discriminated against in health centers by nonindigenous sta ff; and both fear and distrust caused by the attitudes and behaviors of health care work ers prevent indigenous people from seeking the health care they need. For example, trad itional beliefs and practices related to child birth are frequently not respected in institutional settings. 7. At the policy level, consistent indige nous participation is not part of the formulation and implementation of these effo rts as stated, for instance, by Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (A nnex B). The lack of vital statistics or breakdown by ethnic groups, gender, and age makes the generation of policies and managerial processes based on evidence more difficult, which jeopardizes the formulation of priorities and appropriate monitoring and evaluation systems for indigenous populations. National policies and international agreements guide some countries in their development of indige nous-focused programs and designate funding specifically for indigenous social services. Ho wever, implementation of these policies is largely uncoordinated and does not include c onsistent indigenous participation in the formation or implementation of these efforts. Lack of communication, as well as the disintegration and duplication of efforts at all levels, impede the dissemination of lessons learned and restrict the systematization and us e of information to deliver end products to society. In addition, issues such as collec tive property rights, patents, biodiversity protection, and conservation have not adequately been addressed. 8. Aware of health disparities, countries committed themselves to reducing gaps through the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the year 2000. However, evaluations in the Americas and recent projections show that although there have been some gains in the health s ector, expected results will not be reached in time or form, especially among indigenous populations, unless certain current strategies are reoriented (Annex C). For instance, poverty reduction and economic development strategies do not consider indigenous identities, world views, and cultures; the right to self-determination; the right to control thei r territories and resources; and the indigenous peoples' holistic perspective of health. Curre ntly, the assessment of progress toward the MDGs is based on averages but not disaggregat ed data; the progress (or lack thereof) of indigenous populations is, therefore, lost in the calculations. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 5 9. The dynamic economic and social change s that transformed much of Latin America over the last decades largely ignored the needs of indigenous peoples, and both their health and socioeconomic development remain poor. As links between health and economic development are clear, interventions that increase access to quality health care for indigenous people should be prioritized and immediate action taken for both short- term and long-term improvements in their health and quality of life. Working with indigenous populations is sensitive in nature and requires that adequate respect be demonstrated towards indigenous societies and culture, especially regarding the legacy of both historical conflicts and colonization. History, Process, and Main Results of PAHO's Activities 10. In 1992, the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming proposed a more careful consideration of the health and we ll-being of the indigenous peoples in the Americas. Following a consultation works hop held in Winnipeg, Canada, with the participation of representatives of indige nous populations, governments and others from 18 countries, recommendations were incorpor ated into a proposal, the Health of Indigenous Peoples Initiative, which was s ubsequently presented to the Governing Bodies of the Organization and approve d at the 37th Directing Council (1993). 11. The recommendations of the Winnipeg workshop and Resolution CD37.R5, ratified in 1997, establish five principles fo r work with indigenous communities; these principles guided the work, provided criteria for monitoring, and established the basis for evaluation at the end of the Internationa l Decade of the World's Indigenous People (1995-2004) in 2004. The principles are: The need for a holistic approach to health The right to self-determination of indigenous peoples The right to systematic participation Respect for and revitalization of indigenous cultures Reciprocity in relations. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 6 A Summary of the Health of Indigenous Peoples Initiative Goal : To improve the health of the indigenous peoples. Purpose : In collaboration with the indigenous pe oples themselves, to find realistic and sustainable solutions to the serious problems of poor health and substandard living conditions that are the reality of many of the indigenous peoples throughout the Region. Lines of work : National policies and international agreem ents, networks of interinstitutional and intersectoral collaboration; primary health car e and intercultural approach to health; and information analysis, monitoring, and management. Strategies : (a) to promote joint efforts and shared responsibility by PAHO and its Member States and the indigenous organizations and communities, in conjunction with nati onal and international agencies and organizations (governmental a nd nongovernmental); (b) to develop adequate knowledge and information based on experiences, as well as making it possible to systematically store the knowledge and information gained thr ough experience; (c) to formulate proposals that respond both to particular situa tions and contexts which vary from country to country and develop approaches according to common issues at regional levels with the involvement of the entire Organization and all Member States in this process. Areas of Work : Building capacity and alliances; working with Member States to implement national and local processes and projects; projects in priority programmatic areas; strengthening traditional health systems; and scientific, technical, and public information. 12. Taking into consideration indigenous resources, perspectives, practices, therapies and medicine, as well as concrete experi ences in Member States, PAHO has been working to implement the above Initiative. Details of PAHO's technical cooperation actions are included in Annex D. 13. More recently, PAHO carried out several events which had substantial repercussions in the progress of the technical cooperation: (a) The evaluation of the Hea lth of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative within the framework of the International Decade of Indigenous Peoples of the World; (b) The Strategic Planning Workshop regardi ng Health of the Indigenous Peoples (held in October 2005 in Panama), where 19 experts from ministries of health, academic institutions, indigenous organizations, and PAHO reviewed the first version of the new lines of action, and (c) The Regional Meeting \"Health of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas: Achievements and Future Directives\" (held in December 2005 in Nicaragua), where experts presented the regional and national evaluations of the Initiative. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 7 14. The recommendations of indigenous expert s, public health officials, and PAHO advisors who took part in these processes resu lted in a reorientation of the strategic and programmatic lines of action of the Initiative. Evaluation of the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative within the framework of the International Decade of Indigenous Peoples of the World 15. The evaluation, in which 19 countries participated, displayed a range of achievements and challenges including (see Table 1): (a) Countries claim to have at least a genera l legal directive as a policy framework on the indigenous peoples. However, the pro cess and impact of implementing these policies is limited, particularly in relati on to compliance with the MDGs, as none of them take into account the social and economic disparities in areas where the indigenous peoples live. (b) Most countries have implemented policies or replicated experiences that promote the incorporation of indigenous perspectiv es, therapies, and medicines into the national health system. Several countries have considered the topic fragmentally, whereas others have undertaken a mo re widespread observation of the intercultural approach to health through specific projects. (c) Most countries report the existence of technical units dedicated to indigenous health affairs in their ministries of hea lth. However, several of these units do not have the political support, staff, or ad equate budgets to respond to the demands for technical cooperation. (d) All of the 19 participating countries report the presence of national programs/projects regarding the health of indigenous peoples. However, in general terms, these initiatives are mainly benefiting geographical areas that already have good access to health services. (e) Although studies and estimates have been set forth, there is not an adequate characterization of the indigenous peopl es of the Region, and certainly not a reliable system of information, monitoring, and evaluation of their health conditions. (f) When reporting on mechanisms for developi ng technical capacity in terms of the health of indigenous peoples, 6 particip ating countries report programs dedicated to research. Only 5 of the 19 countries report having scholarships specifically for indigenous students to pursue tertiary education. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 8 (g) Most countries describe the existence of local networks on malaria, children's health, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and water and sanitation. However, at subnational levels, coordination among diffe rent indigenous health networks and programs/projects is limited. (h) Despite laudable efforts, there is still little national or subregional coordination on indigenous health issues and initiatives.

In addition, the country evaluation reports reveal a number of barriers to PAHO's continued work to promote the health of indigenous peoples, including: (a) Lack of intercultural training for hea lth care workers and for other crucial decision-makers. (b) High level political and economic decisions made without participation of the indigenous peoples. (c) Persistent poverty and lack of access to land. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 9 (d) Stagnant economic development of the poorest nations, which impacts mainly the most vulnerable population groups such as the indigenous peoples. (e) Fragmentation, rivalries, and power str uggles among the different leaderships and organizations that represent the indigenous communities. 17. Because of their sustained struggle, the indigenous peoples are now more visible than before. PAHO has supported the integrati on of the voice of the indigenous into the policy-making arena, leading to increased pa rticipation of indigenous groups in a number of agreements, covenants, and articles of political constitutions. Indigenous participation in the democratic processes has resulted in the self-management of a few local governments, some of which are led by indi genous leaders and show a high level of popular participation. 18. Finally, and from PAHO's organizationa l and programmatic perspective, the lessons learned include: (a) PAHO has been able to build legitim acy among the indigenous peoples through work that has stressed close consulta tion and collaboration with indigenous representatives and communities. (b) Resource mobilization efforts have been less successful than anticipated. Emphasis by donors on vertical and progra mmatic interventions has inhibited funding for comprehensive and integrated projects to address the health needs of the indigenous communities. (c) The Initiative's lack of a specific organiza tional structure at PAHO has restricted not only the progress of developing t echnical cooperation at the pace it was needed but also its ability to mobilize additional financial resources. (d) Few countries routinely collect and anal yze vital or service statistics by ethnic group, so it has been difficult to develop good baseline data for countries and to have an adequate assessment of the health and living conditions of the indigenous peoples of the Region. This has limited the Initiative's strategic planning and processes reorientation. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 10 Proposed Strategic Lines of Action 19. In December 2004, the General Assembly of the United Nations Permanent Forum of Indigenous Issues adopted a resolution (A/RES/59/174) for a Second International Decade of the World's Indige nous Peoples (2005 - 2015). The objectives of this second U.N. decade are detailed in Annex E. 20. In this context, the growing demand fo r technical cooperation in the matter of indigenous peoples' health emphasizes the need for strategic restructuring. The health-related MDGs are now an integral part of PAHO/WHO's priorities and are connected with its commitment to health equity betw een and within countries, the provision of quality health services, the improvement of health conditions in vulnerable and underserved populations, and the development of health policies with measurable outcomes. They are part of the national h ealth development process and rely on the degree of extension of social protection in health (Resolution CE134.R8). The renewed approach to primary health care (PHC) is vi ewed as an essential condition for meeting the commitments of the Millennium Declarati on, addressing the social determinants of health, and achieving the highest attainable level of health for everyone (Document CD46/13). 21. Acknowledging the priorities of the i ndigenous peoples, PAHO recognizes the urgent need to identify innovative and respect ful ways of working with the indigenous representatives and to show clear results that can demonstrate the reduction of barriers of access to quality health care in the communities. In developing these strategic lines of action, PAHO has undertaken a careful and thorough consultative process with the indigenous peoples, national governments, academic institutions, public health professionals, and others. 22. Specifically, the following strategic lin es of action are proposed for PAHO's technical cooperation: (a) To ensure incorporation of indigenous pe rspectives into the attainment of the MDGs and national health policies; (b) To improve information and knowledge ma nagement on indigenous health issues to strengthen regional and national evidence-based decision-making and monitoring capacities; (c) To integrate the intercultural approach into the national health systems of the Region as part of the primary health care strategy; and (d) To develop strategic alliances with indi genous peoples and other key stakeholders to further advance the health of the indigenous peoples. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 11 23. The proposed strategic lines of action have a time horizon of five years, between 2007 and 2011. Annex F includes baseline and target indicators. Strategic Line of Action 1: To ensure incor poration of indigenous perspectives into the attainment of the MDGs and national health policies. Objective To support countries in implementing international agreements through the formulation, development, and evaluation of public policies for the benefit of the indigenous peoples and the strengthening of health systems oriented towards the achievement of the MDGs. Indicators (a) Number of countries with legislation a ddressing the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and h ealth related rights of the indigenous peoples consistent with WHO Constitution, interna tional and regional human rights treaties ratified by PAHO Member States and internationa l standards as applicable in the context of indigenous peoples' health. (b) MDG progress indicators for indigenous h ealth agreed upon with indigenous peoples and disaggregated by ethnicity, gender, and age at the national and subnational levels. (c) MDG progress indicators regarding the hea lth of the indigenous peoples implemented at the subnational, national, and international levels. Activities 24. Strategic Line of Action 1 will generate frameworks and instruments that incorporate indigenous perspectives and facilitate achievement of the MDGs and other directives. Specific activities will include: (a) Support the formulation of legislation that emphasizes indigenous peoples' health, consistent with international human rights treaties and standards. (b1) Develop a conceptual framework and tool s to incorporate the holistic perspective of the indigenous peoples in addressing the MDGs and national policies. (b2) Develop, in coordination with the indige nous peoples, a set of indicators to measure the progress of the execution of the MDGs. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 12 (c1) Promote dialogue among national aut horities, indigenous populations, and civil society concerning the effectiveness and cultural relevance of the policies and national programs toward the improvement of the health of the indigenous peoples. (c2) Promote the fulfillment of the decisi ons of the Permanent Forum of the United Nations on Indigenous Issues regarding the attainment of the MDGs. Strategic Line of Action 2: To improve information and knowledge management on indigenous health issues in order to st rengthen regional and national evidence-based decision-making and monitoring capacities. Objective To develop systems for managing and sharing quantitative and qualitative evidence-based information in order to foster dynamic learning, decision-making and the formulation of priorities, as well as systems for monitoring and evaluating actions for improving the health of indige nous peoples, with special attention to respect, understanding, and protection of ancestral knowledge. Indicators (a) Number of countries with indigenous populations having public health and vital statistics systems for monitoring and evaluating the health of indigenous peoples. (b) Availability of a regional virtual libra ry with data, conceptual frameworks, methodologies, and experiences relevant to the health of indigenous peoples and intercultural approaches to health care. (c) Number of countries with operations research projects on issues such as the harmonization of indigenous and conventiona l health knowledge and practices linked with official and academic institutions. (d) Availability of a training course on ine quity, equality and nondiscrimination in access to and use of health services due to ethnic ity consistent with international and regional human rights standards and treaties ratifie d by PAHO Member States such as the \"International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\", 2 among others. (e) Incorporation of health of indigenous pe oples into the next edition of the publication Health in the Americas (2007). Activities 25. Strategic Line of Action 2 will foster the systematization and analysis of available data for the incorporation of ethnicity, gende r, and age variables into the national and CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 13 subnational information, monitoring, and eval uation systems. At the same time cross- cultural skills and analytical and managerial skills will be promoted for health care professionals. An operations research agenda will be developed to contribute to better understanding of the health of the indigenous peoples using, whenever possible, ancestral knowledge, as a referent. Specific activities will include: (a1) Classify, update, and evaluate existing da ta on the health of indigenous peoples in order to develop a baseline with the current situation. (a2) Develop methodological approaches, inst ruments, and indicators that incorporate ethnicity and gender variables into the public health and vital statistics systems of the countries. (b) Develop a virtual library with data and publications on indigenous health. (c) Promote operations research on issues su ch as the harmonization of indigenous and conventional knowledge and practices in addressing the health of the indigenous peoples. (d) Develop and implement a training module on inequity and discrimination with regard to access to and use of health services due to ethnicity. (e) Write and incorporate a section on the h ealth of indigenous peoples into the next edition of the publication Health in the Americas (2007). Strategic Line of Action 3: To integrate the intercultural approach into the national health systems of the Region in accordance with the primary health care strategy. Objective To improve access to quality health care by indigenous peoples through the incorporation of indigenous perspectives, practices, and therapies into the national health systems in accordance with the pr imary health care strategy as well as principles of safety and efficacy of traditional practices in health. Indicators (a) Inventory of the Region's best practices for incorporating indigenous perspectives and practices into health systems.

Activities 26. Strategic Line of Action 3 will systematize and analyze ongoing experiences, generate instruments and guidelines for establishing culturally and linguistically appropriate health services and priority programs in areas with indigenous populations. Present methodologies will be analyzed in orde r to evaluate the safety and efficacy of indigenous traditional practices and to encour age a cultural exchange oriented toward open dialogue and the harmonization of the indigenous health systems with conventional medicine. Specific activities will include: (a) Develop an inventory of models of best practices concerning appropriate care to address the needs of indigenous populations, and highlight two of the models. (b) Develop a system for identifying, eval uating, and monitoring traditional health practices using PHC principles and intercultural approaches to health. (c) Develop and promote the use of protocol s for assessing the safety and efficacy of culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions in key areas. (d) Develop and evaluate indicators on access to quality health care services provided to indigenous populations. Strategic Line of Action 4: To develop strategic alliances with indigenous peoples and other key stakeholders to further advance the health of the indigenous peoples. Objective To develop networks that will benefit th e health of indigenous peoples, strengthen indigenous leadership, and optimize financia l and technical resources available in the countries through the development of advocacy strategies and negotiation techniques in order to improve public health among indigenous peoples.

(b) Number of countries with indigenous popul ations that receive technical cooperation from PAHO/WHO for capacity building and stre ngthening of technical units responsible for the health of the indigenous peoples. Activities 27. Strategic Line of Action 4 will support se nsitivity processes from the authorities and operative personnel; enhancing the technical, administrative, managerial, and political capacity of the countries so as to develop better health care in the Region; and incorporating indigenous health care in na tional and international political agendas. These activities will result in the establis hment of networks relying on the active participation from key stakeholders and indigenous institutions. Specific activities will include: (a1) Develop a Network on Indigenous Peoples ' Health with indigenous organizations. (a2) Monitor compliance of interinstitu tional activities among the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, Organization of American States, the Indian Health Service, Indigenous Fund, and other partners. (a3) Insert intercultural approaches in pro cesses of subregional and regional integration through the incorporation of indigenous health issues in the subregional and regional agendas. (a4) Establish advocacy processes for the promotion of public health and the protection of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and other related rights. (b1) Promote capacity building in the provision of health services for indigenous peoples. (b2) Promote Technical Cooperation among Countries projects and exchange of experiences regarding the health of the indigenous peoples. 28. Annex G summarizes the available budget fo r the implementation of the strategic lines of action at Headquarters in the Unit of Health Services Organization (THS/OS) and other regional programs as well as at Country Offices and subregional centers. CD47/13 (Eng.) Page 16 Organizational and Financial Implications 29. In 2005, consistent with PAHO's policy to foster the development of technical cooperation centered on the countries, a decentralized post of Advisor on Health of the Indigenous Peoples was created and the re gional work began in August from the PAHO/WHO Representative office in Ecuador. In addition, regular funds were allocated to carry on activities. 30. Over the course of the next five-year period, the implementation of the proposed strategic lines of action will cost a pproximately $4.9 million. In the PAHO 2006-2007 biennial regional program budget, $175,000 is available and approximately $1.7 million is unfunded. Currently, PAHO is developing proposals to mobilize additional extrabudgetary funding. Key Issues for Deliberation (a) To discuss the progress made and the eval uation of the Health of the Indigenous Peoples Initiative within the framework of the International Decade of Indigenous Peoples of the World. (b) The need for political commitment and the allocation of adequate resources to support the local, national, and regional e fforts to improve the health of the indigenous peoples. (c) The adequacy of the proposed lines of ac tion for future work and the role of PAHO in its implementation, including th e opportunity for developing a Regional Plan on Health of the Indigenous Peoples. Action by the Directing Council 34. The Directing Council is invited to consider the resolution proposed by the Executive Committee (Annex I). Annexes CD47/13 (Eng.)

Annex H Glossary Indigenous Peoples ILO Convention 169, Article 1, concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989) recognizes as indigenous that distinct section of the national community which is understood to c onsist of: \". . . peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or coloniza tion or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural, and political institutions.\" The concept of a people refers to the set of traits that characterize a human group in territorial, historical, cultural, and ethnic terms and give it a sense of identity. Holistic Approach to Health Indigenous peoples have a holistic view of the wo rld; thus, they define health in terms of complete well-being, represented in the \"the harmony of all the elements that comprise health\"; that is, the right to have thei r own understanding and control over their own lives, and the right \"of human beings to liv e in harmony with nature, with themselves, and with each other to achieve complete well-being and individual and collective spiritual fulfillment and peace.\" In other words, the holistic approach assumes th at the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. By incorporating several paradigms based on indigenous perspectives, health finds expression through the dynamic relationships and equilibrium among the inseparable components of the individual (physical, me ntal, emotional, and spiritual) and the collective (ecological, political, economic, cultural, social and, once again, spiritual). This holistic conception of health encompa sses the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of an individual and his or her social community under conditions of equity. Intercultural Approach to Health The intercultural approach to health is understood as a balance among different knowledges, beliefs, and cultural practices regarding health and disease, life and death, as well as biologic and social issues, expresse d not only through visible manifestations but under a spiritual cosmic dimension. CD47/13 (Eng.) Annex H - 2 - Traditional Medicine Traditional medicine is the sum total of th e knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement, or treatment of physical and mental illness. Complementary/Alternative Medicine (CAM) The terms \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition. Conventional Medicine Medicine based in biomedical principles a nd practiced by holders of a medical degree (M.D.) or doctor of osteopathy degree (D.O.) and by their allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, dentists, psychologists, and nurses. Other terms for conventional medicine include allopathy a nd allopathic medicine; Western medicine, mainstream medicine, orthodox medicine, and regular medicine; and biomedicine. ) Traditional Healers Traditional healers are local health specialists whose abilities to heal are said to be their birth right. Generally these individuals start training and working at an early age. The abilities of others may be revealed later in lif e as a result of a severe illness or a near- death experience. Some may go on fasts or on a vision quest where their gifts and their responsibilities are revealed and explained to them by the spirits. Some may work with plants, some may counsel, and some may heal with their hands and through ceremonies. Traditional healers are diverse and are na med according to their skills and special knowledge. For instance, on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua, they are called obiaman, sukias , dopi; in the Amazonian region, the spiritual leader is the shaman ; in the Andean region, traditional healers are called hierbateros, fregadores, hueseros, etc . Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services Health care services that ensure that patients/consumers receive effective, understandable, and respectful care that is pr ovided in a manner compatible with their cultural health beliefs and practices and pr eferred language. Culturally and linguistically appropriate services should be integrated throughout an organization and undertaken in partnership with the communities being served.
