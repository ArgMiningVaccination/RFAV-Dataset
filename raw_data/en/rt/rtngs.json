The Sanskrit word Ayurveda translates to yuh, life, and veda, knowledge or science. It is an ancient healing system rooted in India that has been practiced for thousands of years. Ayurveda's scope encompasses all realms: physical, mental/emotional, and spiritual, and thus addresses the whole person, body, mind and consciousness. The universe is composed of five elements: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. These five elements combine in varying proportions to create the three doshas: Vata, the principle of movement, Pitta, the principle of transformation, and Kapha, the principle of cohesion or building block material.These elements and doshas that comprise the macrocosm also make up our individual constitutions. The purpose of Ayurveda is to bring balance to these doshas and elements amidst the changing times of day, seasons, and phases of our lives, in order to promote and maintain quality and longevity of life. From Our Clients... See what people are saying about our AyurPrana team and course offerings! \"I feel like not just my work as nurse but also my life in a human body has become so much more fluid, translucent and trusting. There is so much more that I need to learn before I'll be able to effectively support others with the introduction you gave here, but every time I apply some of it already the results are so confirming and sometimes like magic.\" - Anka Hoerster \"Overall, I cannot thank enough Dr. Lad and entire AyurPrana team for this amazing process and support. In nearly 14yrs, this is the longest spell of feeling better without dreading the next relapse. This has also allowed me to reap the benefits of my sadhana to remain in awareness. I am beating up myself for not doing this sooner! Will continue this journey.....\" - Pavani \"I want to thank you both for your magnificent teaching and your dedication to our needs. It has been the most wonderful course. After 20 years of doing the other style of Pranayama, I feel such a difference in my practice and the effects in my life - more energy, more connection to Prana and so much more... amazing! With deep gratitude to you two magnificent beings, you have been an inspiration.\" - Rapha\u00ebl Alkombre \"I love the live sessions with Sneha & Vrinda - thank you so much for providing such helpful communication on all levels regarding content, questions, examples of various applications and explaining things from different perspectives helping us to understand - it is a joy to listen and you make it easy for us to focus on what is important!\" - Marma Participant \"I'm always just soo HAPPY after sessions with you both (I smile for no reason for a longtime).
