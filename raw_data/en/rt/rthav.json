Since the implementation of routine vaccination of children, the incidence of childhood disease and mortality has reduced significantly (1) . Vaccination has a long history . In the 7th century, Indian Budd hists drank snake venom in an attempt to become immune to its effect (2). The work of Edward Jenner in the 18th century represents the first scientific attempt to control an infectious disease by the deliberate use of vaccination, whic h created the basis for the development of the current immunization practices (3) . Jenner demonstrated that inoculation with pus from cowpox protected against smallpox, a serious disease which caused 400.000 deaths per year in Europe in the 18 th century (2). In the 19th century, more vaccines were developed. Louis Pasteur was the first to develop attenuated viral and bacterial vaccines (4) . His research resulted in a breakthrough in the prevention of infectious diseases by establishing the basis of vaccinology, which is founded on the principle of isolation, inactivation, and administration of disease causing pathogens. In developed countries, national immunization programs have drastically reduced the incidence of many of the viral and bacterial infections that traditionally affected children. Vaccination has played a key role in the eradication of smallpox in 1979 and this was the first great success in global infectious disease control. In the Netherlands, the National Immunization Program (NIP) started in 1957. At the onset of the program, children were routinely offered vaccination om a voluntary basis against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and poliomyelitis. Ov er the years, this program developed into a general vaccination program for children with vaccinations scheduled between the ages of two months and 12 years (5) . Currently, this vaccination program entails vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, meningococcal disease type C, Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) hepatitis B, pneumococcal disease, and human papillomavirus. In the Netherlands, participation in this program is high (around 95%), resulting in low incidences of most diseases included in the NIP (6) . New target groups for vaccinations and criteria for expanding vaccination programs Forty years after the introduction of the Dutch NIP for children, a new target population for vaccination received increased attention in the Netherlands. I n 1997, the National Influenza Prevention Program was implemented, offering influenza vaccination to persons aged 65 years and older and certain other risk groups to prevent associated complications and mortality of influenza (7) . Influenza vaccination is offered on a voluntarily basis. Other European countries recommended influenza vaccination to their older citizens as well . Between 1997 and 2007, vaccination uptake in the Netherlands was estimated to be around 74%, almost reaching the target set by the World Health 11 1 Organization of 75% (8) . Uptake of influenza vaccination in the Netherlands was the highest in Europe (9) . In 2007, the age threshold for influenza vaccination was lowered to 60 years because influenza vaccination was also considered cost- effective for this population (7) . From 2007 onwards, accepta nce of the influenza vaccine gradually decreased to 65.7% in 2013 (8). In response to discussions regarding vaccination against influenza of healthy elderly aged 60 years and older, the Health Council (Gezondheidsraad) concluded in her advice in 2014 that there is sufficient evidence that influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza and its complications in this age group (10) . Also in 2007, the Health Council of the Netherlands introduced a 'vaccination throughout life' -concept and identified older adults in general as a target group for expanding vaccination. At that time, several new vaccines had become available to protect against diseases prevalent in the older age groups such as pneumococcal and herpes zoster (11) . However, none of these vaccines were part of a routine vaccination program in the Nethe rlands. In 2013, awareness on the underutilization of these available and registered vaccines was raised as their increased uptake may unlock further potential health benefits. The Health Council of the Netherlands concluded that a single assessment framew ork should be used to assess all vaccinations for implementation to improve the organization of vaccination care and make registered vaccines more accessible for all ages (12) . The need for vaccination of the elderly The potential health benefits of vaccination among the older adult population become even more important with the shifting global demography and ageing of populations worldwide. The prognosis is that the median age of the world population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 45.6 years by 2100 (13) . For the Netherlands specifically, by 2040, 26% of the Dutch population will be aged 65 years and older, compared to 16% in 2012. Of this group, two million people will be 80 years or older by 2055 (14) . Age-rela ted conditions such as immunosenescence (the gradual deterioration of the immune system), general frailty and the potential presence of co -morbidity are projected to result in up to 3500 fatalities a year due to infectious diseases and a strong increase in hospital admissions among persons aged 65 years old by 2040 (15) . Vaccinating against infectious diseases other than influenza could reduce this burden of disease and therefore contribute to healthy ageing and reducing healthcare costs. Currently, healthcare costs rise steeply with age and are highest for the very old , translating into 45.000 euro per capita for people aged 95 and older for the year 2007. Over the period 1999 -2010, general healthcare expenditures have risen 7.2% per year. The estimation is that about 15% of this rise can be attributed to ageing. In 2007, 1.4% of the costs of the healthcare was the result of infectious diseases and parasitic diseases. Almost 50% of these cost s were incurred by persons aged 45 years and older. However, respiratory infections such as influenza and pneumonia were not included in this General introduction 1 12 calculation, causing an underestimation of the healthcare costs for this group of infectious diseases (16) . Introd ucing or adapting any vaccination program must be supported by scientific evidence. The Health Council of the Netherlands composed an assessment framework of seven criteria (Table 1) to decide whether, based on the available scientific evidence, vaccinatio n is justified (11) . Table 1: The 7 criteria of the assessment framework to decide on the implementation of new vaccines. Criteria 1. The infectious disease causes con siderable disease burden within the population. 2. Vaccination may be expected to considerably reduce the disease burden within the population. 3. Any adverse reactions associated with vaccination are not sufficient to substantially diminish the public health benefit. 4. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connection with his/her personal vaccination is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual concerned and the population as a whole. 5. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connection with the vaccination program as a whole is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual concerned and the population as a whole. 6. The ratio between the cost of vaccination and the associated health benefit compares favorably to the cost -benefit ratio associated with other means of reducing the relevant disease burden. 7. The provision of vaccination may be expected to serve an urgent or potentially urgent public health need. Influenza vaccination and other preventive strategies in older adults In the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport decides which risk groups are eligible for the National Influenza Prevention Program , as advised by the Health Council of the Netherlands. The general practitioner's office is the central location for organizing these immunization campaigns and the general practitioner (together with the practice nurse) selects, invites, and vaccinates th e target population, accounting for 95% of all vaccinations administered to risk groups (18) . 13 1 Vaccination is part of (disease) prevention. However, it is not the only type of prevention that is implemented for older adults in the Netherlands. Over the years, prevention has become more important in the Dutch national healthcare. The aim of these preventive interventions is to keep elderly independent, autonomous and healthy for as long as possible, thereby achieving healthy ageing (19) . Examples of prevention programs other than the influenza vaccination program implemented in the Netherlands concern breast cancer screening, fall p revention programs, prevention programs to prevent loneliness, pressure ulcers prevention, healthy diet and general health check - ups (20) . Aim of this thesis Recent pleas for older adult vaccination have been published, summarizing the benefits of an extended adult vaccination program (21, 22). In order for vaccination in older adults to be as successful as childhood vaccination, a crucial factor is the accep tance of this way of prevention. This is emphasized by the decrease of the influenza vaccination uptake. The aim of this thesis is to identify prominent factors that play a role in the vaccination accepting process. We devised an experiment in order to determ ine the relative importance of these identified factors. The ultimate goal was to build a model that would be able to predict the willingness to accept vaccination against different vaccine preventable diseases among various age- groups of older adults (50 years and older). Dissertation outline We first updated the scientific evidence regarding other vaccinations than influenza to older adults using the evaluation model of Kimman (Chapter 2). Vaccines included in this review were herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis, and hepatitis A vaccination. In Chapter 3, we present a disease burden study among older adults regarding influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and pertussis. In this study Disability -Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated for each of the four infectious diseases for the older adult population to compare the burden of disease. Chapter 4 and 5 address the relevant determinants for older adults to accept vaccination. In Chapter 4, a literature review is presented to identify potential factors important in the vaccination evaluation process in the international literature. Chapter 5 describes a focus group study performed with Dutch older adults a iming to identify determinants of vaccine acceptance relevant for the elderly Dutch population. Chapter 6 describes a discrete choice experiment that was conducted based on the information from chapter 4 and 5 to determine the relative importance between the most important determinants. This thesis focusses on the older adults and their considerations for (and against) vaccination. Yet, it is known that the general practitioner (GP) and particularly the message they convey as professionals plays an important role in the vaccination process General introduction 1 14 of older adults. Notably, as medical professional s they currently act as (responsible) administrator of the influenza vaccination in several countries. Therefore, we conducted an interview study (Chapter 7) that explores the attitudes and intention of GPs towards vaccination of older adults in general as well the possible implementation of more vaccines. In chapter 8, we conducted a survey among Dutch GP's to quantif y the results found in the chapter 7. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes the maj or findings of the studies and the practical implications of the results are discussed, as well as challenges that remain. Finally , suggestions for future research are presented. 15 1 References 1. van Wijhe M, McDonald SA, de Melker HE, Postma MJ, Wallinga J.

BMC Geriatrics 13:3 Assessment of vaccine candidates for older adults 18 Abstract Background The increasing life expectancy in most European countries has resulted in growth of the population 50 and older. This population is more susceptible to infectious diseases because of i mmunosenescence, co- morbidity and general frailty. Thus, to promote healthy aging, vaccination against vaccine- preventable- diseases could be one strategy. In addition to its possible individual benefits, vaccination may also yield social benefits, such as a lower overall cost of healthcare. Most European countries, however , offer only influenza vaccine although vaccines for pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis, and hepatitis A are also available. Our aim is to review the knowledge of these vaccines for persons aged 50 and older and explore the arguments for expand ing current vaccination programmes beyond just influenza. Methods The evaluation model of Kimman et al. was used to assess herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A in terms of four domains: pathogen, vaccine, disease outcomes and cos t-effectiveness. The sources were Dutch surveillance systems, seroprevalence studies and the international literature. Results Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis are prevalent among persons aged 50 and older. Vaccines vary in effectiveness and have mild and self -limiting side effects. Vaccination against pneumococcal disease and pertussis causes adaptation of the responsible pathogen. For pertussis and hepatitis A, the vaccine is not registered specifically for the elderly population. Vaccina tion against herpes zoster and pertussis could improve quality of life, while vaccination against pneumococcal disease and hepatitis A prevents mortality. However, only vaccination against herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease appear to be cost- effective. Conclusions Vaccination can improve the health of the elderly population. As our review shows, however, the data are too incomplete to accurately judge its potential impact. More research is needed to determine how vaccination can most effectively improve the health of the growing population 50 years and older. 19 2 Introduction Background The increasing life expectancy in most European countries has resulted in the growth of the population 50 years and older. Although this population will continue to increase, it may not age healthily [1, 2]. It is estimated that by 2060, persons aged 65 and older will account for 30.0% of the total population of the EU- 27 (the 27 Member States of the European Union), compared to 17.0% in 2008 [3]. As a result of i mmunosenescence (the gradual deterioration of the immune system), co-morbidity and general frailty, this population is more susceptible than younger persons to infectious diseases [4], resulting in higher mortality and morbidity rates in older persons than in young adults [5]. Infections may lead to irreversible frailty and, thereby, more dependency on long -term healthcare [6]. Vaccinating persons aged 50 and older against vaccine- preventable diseases (VPDs) may be one strategy to promote healthy aging. Apart from possible benefits to individuals in this age group, vaccination may yield social benefits, such as lower overall costs of European healthcare. Most European countries offer influenza vaccine to this population, and some countries also offer pneumo coccal vaccine [7]. However, vaccination against other VPDs is not common, despite initiatives to update the programmes [8]. The aim of this review is to evaluate the vaccines available for persons aged 50 and older and to explore the arguments of programm atic vaccination for herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A. For each of these infectious diseases, we review the current knowledge of these vaccines as specifically applied to this population and describe each of four domains (path ogen, vaccine, disease and cost effectiveness), according to the model of Kimman et al [9] . Rationale for vaccine choice Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A were chosen for this review because a vaccine for each is registered in Europe. Furthermore, a report by the Dutch health council on the future of the national immunization programme focused on the possibility of persons aged 50 and older as a target group for vaccination against herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis. Their report considered vaccination for hepatitis A to be universal [10] . Beyond the Netherlands and Europe, the consensus in the United States is that these four vaccines are important throughout life. Vaccination for herpes zoster is recommended from the age of 60 and for pneumococcal disease from 65 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, a combined vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis is recommended every 10 years. For hepatitis A, two doses in a lifetime are recommended when any risk factor is present [11] Assessment of vaccine candidates for older adults 20 Methods Evaluation model Vaccines against herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A were reviewed according to the criteria for adding new vaccines to the national immunization programme [9]. These criteria help in collecting relevant scientific information necessary for evaluation and decision making. The four domains of the model (pathogen, vaccine, disease and cost- effectiveness, as proposed by Kimman et al.) are presented as crucial elements of an adapted national immunization programme (Figure 1). Figure 1: Considerations in adapting the national immunization programme [9] Data source To determine the incidence of herpes zoster during 1998 -2009, information was assembled from the Continuous Morbidity Registration (CMR: 1998 -2001) and the Netherlands Information Network of General Practices (LINH: 2002 -2009), as well as the Dutch Institu te for Health Services Research (NIVEL). The CMR and LINH are nationally representative networks of general practitioners (GP's) that report the incidence of infectious diseases weekly. We determined via notifications the incidence of pertussis since 1975 and hepatitis A since 1950 [12] . The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was based on isolates collected by The Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis, a 21 2 \"laboratory -based surveillance system that collects nationwide pneumococcal isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid\" that represents 25% of the Dutch population [13] . Information on hospital admissions for pertussis and herpes zoster was drawn from the National Medical Registration. Registration coverage of this system fluctu ates around 90%. Mortality rates were obtained from Statistics Netherlands, which registers mortality data from death certificates on a statutory basis. Seroprevalence data to estimate prevalences of varicella zoster, pertussis and hepatitis A were availab le from two cross -sectional, population- based serosurveillance studies carried out in 1995 -1996 and 2006- 2007 among persons aged 0 to 79 years [14, 15] . The international literature was searched for additional information on the four domains of the evaluation model for each of the infectious diseases in the study population. Results Pathogen Pathogenicity Nearly 100% of the Dutch population aged 7 and older is seropositive for varicella zoster virus and thus at risk for the later development of herpes zoster [16] . The occurrence of herpes zoster and its recurrence is also elevated in persons with an immune deficiency [17] . For pneumococcal disea se, the different serotypes vary in virulence, invasiveness and their potential to colonize. Of the more than 90 identified pneumococci serotypes, about 20% are responsible for more than 70% of the cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in all age groups [18] . By age, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease displays a parabolic pattern; the incidence is highest in children and persons aged 60 and older [19] . Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae was found to be low in non -institutionalized older persons (aged 65 and older) [20] . However, for certain serotypes, carriage was higher in older persons with much exposure to children compared to older persons with no exposure to children [20] . For pertussis, the incidence among persons aged 50 and older is rising. In 2006- 2007 the reported incidence in persons aged 50 to 64 years old was 6 times higher than it was in 1995 -1996, and the incidence was 8 times higher in those aged 65 to 79 years old in 2006 -2007 compared to 1995 -1996 [21] . Serolog ical studies showed that between 6000 and 8000 per 100,000 persons aged 50 to 60 years old and between 4000 and 6000 per 100,000 persons aged 60 to 79 years old showed evidence of a recent (< 6 months) pertussis infection [22] . Pertussis is often atypical in adults. In the Netherlands, only 17% of persons 50 to 64 years old and 36% of those aged 65 to 79 years old who showed serological evidence of a recent pertussis infection had reported coughing in 2006- 2007 [21] . For hepatitis A, it was estimated in 20 12 that in the next 10 years 60% of the population 60 and older may be susceptible to that disease in the absence of vaccination or natural exposure [23] . Meanwhile, the average age of individuals who become Assessment of vaccine candidates for older adults 22 infected is rising. Also in 2012, 12% of the par ticipants in a seroprevalence study had been vaccinated against hepatitis A owing to travel. Because such a vaccination induces possible lifelong immunity, this group could be considered protected against hepatitis A even as they age [15] . The course of infection is more severe in persons aged 50 and older, and patients with chronic hepatitis B and C infections are at risk of more severe disease if they contract hepatitis A [24] . Infectiveness and transmissibility Herpes zoster is a reactivation of the dormant varicella- zoster virus in the central nervous system due to a diminished cell -mediated immunity. The vesicle rash specific to herpes zoster is contagious for non -immune persons until have crusted; transmission occurs sporad ically [25] . The transmission of pneumococci and pertussis is airborne, and both pathogens are contagious. Pneumococci are transmitted by nasopharyngeal carriers [26] . The infectiveness and transmissibility of pertussis is probably related to coughing, which makes pertussis highly contagious [27, 28] . During an outbreak of pertussis in a Dutch religious institution, the attack ratio was 42% among the elderly [29] . Hepatitis A is transmitted by the f ecal -oral route, by person -to-person contact or by ingestion of contaminated food or water [24] . Hepatitis A is also highly contagious due to the long survival period of the virus in the feces [24] . Community outbreaks in Latvia, Slovakia and in the Czech Republic showed a low attack rate among the elderly population [30- 32]. To date, no outbreaks of hepatitis A have been reported among the elderly population in the Netherlands [33] . However, with the changing immunity profiles in the elderly population reflecting a decline in natural infection due to improved hygiene, these attack rates are expected to be higher in the future because of the diminishing of natural immunity. Antigenic variation Varicella zoster and hepatitis A are stable viruses. Whereas several genetic variations exist, all belong to the same known serotype [34, 35] . Many different serotypes of pneumococci are associated with invasive disease. A phenomenon called serotype replacement has been seen after routine pneumococcal vaccination. Although herd - protection benefits for adults have been reported after the implementation of the 7 - valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV -7) for children, there has been a rise in pneumococcal disease in the study population. Its higher incidence is caused by non-vaccine PCV -7 serotypes. The phenomenon of serotype replacement depends on age, geographic region and the development of antibiotic resistance [18] . Similarly, for pertussis, there is evidence that antigenic changes have occurred as a result of mass vaccination [36] . 23 2 Disease Burden of disease Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis are highly prevalent among persons aged 50 and older in the Netherlands [16, 19, 22, 37] . Herpes zoster will develop in 23% to 30% of the European population [38] . It causes a painful and itchy rash that proceeds to p ost herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in 9% to 34% of the elderly population who have the disease [39] . The pain associated with the rash and PHN is neuropathic and therefore less sensitive to painkillers, and there are no effective treatment options [40] . In the Netherlands, on average per year, 717 per 100,000 persons aged 50 and older consult a general practitioner because of herp es zoster, and 9.4 per 100,000 are admitted to the hospital. The number of hospital days increases with age. Herpes zoster has been reported to lead to a decrease in quality of life (health -related quality of life, HRQoL), with an impact on the activities of daily living (ADL) [41- 44]. The total number of quality -adjusted life years (QALYs) lost because of herpes zoster has varied between 1060 and 3024 for persons aged 60 to 80 years old [45] . Pneumococcal disease can lead to various clinical syndromes in older persons, such as invasive pneumonia (the most common), bacteraemia and meningitis [19] . The yearly average incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is 54 per 100,000 persons aged 50 and older. For pneumonia, the incidence in general practice has been established at 17.5 per 1000 patients aged 65 to 74 old and 31.4 per 1,000 patients aged 75 and older [46] . However, this overview included all causes of pneumonia, not just pneumococcal infection. It has been estimated that 30% to 40% of all pneumonia cases are caused by pneumococcal infection [47] . On average, 590 per 100,000 persons aged 50 and older are admitted to the hospital yearly for pneumococcal disease. The number of admissions to the intensive care unit are highest for meningitis, with 58% fo r persons aged both 50 to 64 years old and 65 and older, and lowest for bacteremia, with 18% for both age groups. The average duration of a hospital admission was reported to be 13 days. Bacteraemia and meningitis were associated with the highest fatality rates, 40% and 39%, respectively, for persons aged 65 and older [19] . It is estimated that 648 QALYs are lost due to pneumococcal disease in the elderly population [48] . Pertussis causes symptoms similar to a common cold, but it can also lead to a prolonged chronic paroxysmal cough [39] . From 2004 on, a rise in the number of notifications has been observed for persons 50 aged and older. From 2002 to 2005, 4,963 cases were reported among persons aged 45 and older. In the same period, 10,338 GP consultations and 28 hospital admissions were reported among persons aged 45 and older [49] . Figure 2 shows an increase in the notifications of pertussis for persons aged 50 and older in 2000- 2011. The complications of pertussis reported in adults are urinary incontinence, pneumonia, rib fractures, fainting, sinusitis and otitis media [50] . A pertussis outbreak in a monastery in the Netherlands showed the potential severity of the impact in the deaths of 4 persons aged 55 years and older [29] . Pertussis also has an impac t on the Assessment of vaccine candidates for older adults 24 ADL [44] . We estimate that a symptomatic and an asymptomatic case represent a loss of 50 and 25 QALYs, respectivelya. Hepatitis A causes jaundice, nausea, fever and infection; very rarely it can lead to liver failure [24] . The severity increases with age, leading to a higher number of hospitalizations and to longer hospital stays [33] . The case fatality rate in persons 50 aged and older was reported to be 1.8% [51] . In total, 436 cases were reported among persons aged 50 and older from 2003 until May 2012. On average, the disease burden, as expressed in disability -adjusted life- years (DALYs), for all patients with notified cases of hepatitis A was estimated at 17 for 2005 -2010 [33] . Figure 2: Notifications for pertussi s from 2000 to 2011 for persons aged 50 years and older . The dots on the black line represent the number of notifications of pertussis per 100.000 persons 50 years and older for 2001 to 2012. Use and cost of healthcare Most of the cost of healthcare for the diseases under review is due to GP visits, hospital admissions, laboratory tests and medication such as antiviral medication for herpes zoster and antibiotics for pertussis and pneumococcal disease. For hepatitis A, there is no cure, but the symptoms c an be controlled; additional expense is incurred to vaccinate the close contacts of those with hepatitis A. For herpes zoster, it is estimated that the total cost in the Netherlands for GP consultations and drugs is \u20ac72.05 per case and \u20ac101.10 per case of PHN [45] . For pneumococcal disease, it is estimated that the mean direct cost per case (meaning the direct medical costs as registered by the Statistics Netherlands [CBS] ), depending on the outcome of the infection, can vary from \u20ac17.10 (pneumonia requirin g GP consultation) a Based on cases reported in CMR during the period 2002 -2005 and the weight estimates given by Lee et al., 2007 (72). 25 2 to \u20ac15,255.00 (meningitis). The mean indirect cost (meaning indirect costs of productivity losses registered by the CBS) per case varies from \u20ac6.50 (pneumonia requiring GP consultation) to \u20ac302.00 (meningitis) [48] (Table 1). For pertuss is, it is estimated that the cost of healthcare was \u20ac75 per case for persons aged 45 and older in the Netherlands from 2002 -2005. The largest contributing expenses were GP consultations and laboratory diagnostics [49] . For hepatitis A, no studies have been conducted on costs associated with the study population. The cost per patient, with an average age of 30 years, has been estimated at \u20ac1,579 [33] . Table 1: Use and costs of healthcare for pneumococcal disease by disease outcome per case [48] a The main direct and indirect costs were calculated by taking the age -related resource information published in Jansen et al. [19] and the direct medical costs and indirect costs of productivity losses registered by the Central Office for Statistics Netherlands (//statline.cbs.nl, in Dutch) Work absenteeism The cost of absence from work is a growing concern in this age group. Accord ing to the CBS, 45% of the persons aged 55 to 65 years old were working in 2008. However, the proportion of persons who continue working has increased during recent years and will continue to grow [52] . Becoming infected while employed can lead to an emplo yee's loss of productivity. A study to estimate the productivity loss related to herpes zoster calculated that 64% of the persons aged 50 and older who had a job when they contracted the disease missed on average 43 hours of work; 76% reported on average 3 4 hours of decreased effectiveness [53] . For hepatitis A, the incidence is too low to account for lost productivity; no data on productivity loss was found for the other infectious diseases. Alternative preventive measures No alternative measures are kno wn to prevent herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease or pertussis; only vaccination is effective. Practicing basic hygiene is important for preventing hepatitis A infection because of its f ecal -oral transmission route, and post- Healthcare costs Disease outcome Mean direct costs per casea Mean indirect costs per casea Meningitis candidates for older adults 26 exposure vaccination of patients' close contacts has also proved effective in preventing hepatitis A [54] . Vaccine Availability of vaccines The European organization for the registration of vaccines in Europe is the European Medicine Agenc y (EMA; http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/ ). Vaccines are available for herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A. Both Zostavax (for prevention of herpes zoster) and Prevenar13 (for prevention of pneumococcal disease) are registered in Europe for persons aged 50 and older. Pneumo23 is used in high -risk groups in the Netherlands [55] . Boostrix has been registered as a booster combination vaccine (DTaP- IPV) for the prevention of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (aP) and polio (IPV). Epaxal, Avarim and Havrix have been registered for the prevention of hepatitis A. The vaccines to prevent pertussis and hepatitis A have been licens ed in Europe for the general adult population, not especially for the elderly population, although no upper age limit is given. In the United States, Boostrix was recently approved for use in persons aged 65 and older [56] . Effectiveness Zostavax has reduced the burden of herpes zoster by 61.1%, the incidence of PHN by 66.5% and the incidence of herpes zoster by 51.3%. These results were observed in persons aged 60 and older during five years of follow -up [57] . This vaccine's effectiveness against herp es zoster was less in persons aged 70 and older than in those aged 60 to 69 years old. The prevention of PHN was not age- dependent [57] (Figure 3). Vaccination has also been shown to reduce the negative impact of herpes zoster on the daily activities of persons aged 60 and older [58] . A single shot was found to confer protection for approximately six years, but more research on the duration of protection is needed [59] . Currently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is being performed to determine the effectiveness of Prevenar13 (a 13 -valent conjugated vaccine) among persons aged 65 and older in the Netherlands [60] . This vaccine includes 65% to 77% of the serotypes responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease in Europe, whereas Pneumo23 covers 81% to 91% of the serotypes causing the disease in European adults [18] . Strong evidence of efficacy of a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine like Pneumo23 against invasive pneumococcal disease has been found, but the antibody levels in persons aged 65 and older seem to decline in three to five years [61, 62] . Data are lacking on the effectiveness of pertussis vaccination in persons 50 aged and older. The risk of pertussis was reduced by 92% in patients aged 15 to 65 years old after acellular pertussis vaccination [6 3, 64] . Since a single dose of Boostrix induced an effective immune humoral response against pertussis, it is likely to protect persons aged 55 and older. However, the immunogenicity in persons aged 75 and older was not clear because of the low number of s ubjects in the study [65] . Immunity in children after 27 2 vaccination wanes within several years. This implies that one dose might lead to reduced transmission, but not to long -term individual protection [66] . Booster vaccinations may therefore be necessary. One study was conducted on the immunogenicity of the hepatitis A vaccine in persons aged 50 and older. In this prospective uncontrolled study, an effective immune response was induced after two doses, achieving a protection of 98% [67] . Antibodies remain in vaccinated adults for 12 to 25 years, but their presence is potentially lifelong [68] . Figure 3: The effectiveness of Zostavax for preventing HZ, burden of illness and PHN among different age groups [38]. The light grey bar represents the vaccine effectiveness on the incidence of herpes zoster, the burden of illness and post herpetic neuralgia of the total study population The white bar represents the vaccine effectiveness on the incidence of herpes zoster , the burden of illness and post herpetic neuralgia for those aged 60 -69 years. The dark grey bar represents the vaccine effectiveness on the incidence of herpes zoster, the burden of illness and post herpetic neuralgia for those 70 years and older. Adve rse events, safety considerations Adverse events following vaccination against herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A are commonly mild and self -limiting. More serious and long - term complicatio ns are rare (reported by http://www.fk.cvz.nl/ ). Herpes zoster vaccine is contraindicated in persons with a hypersensitivity (allergy) to an active substance, immune deficiency, or untreated active tuberculosis or those who are being treated with immune su ppressors or high doses of corticosteroids. The pneumococcal vaccine is contraindicated in people who are hypersensitive to the active substances, to any of the other ingredients or to diphtheria toxoid. People who have a high fever should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. The pertussis Assessment of vaccine candidates for older adults 28 vaccine is contraindicated in persons aged 50 and older who have an infectious disease at the time of vaccination. Hepatitis A vaccine is contraindicated in those who have a high fever as a consequence of disease, and Epaxal must not be given to persons aged 50 and older with a sensitivity to eggs and chicken protein. Herpes zoster, 13-valent pneumococcal and pertussis vaccine have been given concomitantly with influenza vaccine and were well tolerated [69 -71]. Boostrix has also been given concomitantly with Havrix and was well tolerated [72] . To achieve an optimal benefit, pneumococcal vaccination and herpes zoster vaccination must be given four weeks apart [73] . Costs of the vaccine and the vaccination programme Market prices for the vaccines range from \u20ac14.98 (Pneumo23) to \u20ac137.33 (Zostavax) [74] . The prices are likely to be lower when the products are used in a vaccination programme. In addition, the number and frequency of doses as well as the expense of administration will influence the costs of a vaccination programme. The estimated cost of im plementing a vaccination programme, including administration costs, in the Netherlands for herpes zoster within the current influenza programme ranges from roughly \u20ac14.7 million for persons aged 60 and older to \u20ac4.9 million for persons aged 80 and older (assuming an uptake of 75%). Furthermore, once-only costs total \u20ac0.3 million [45] . For hepatitis A, the costs of a vaccination programme, including a catch -up programme for all persons aged 60 and older performed by general practitioners, would be \u20ac210 mill ion in the first year and \u20ac13 million in subsequent years (indexed for 2009 for all persons aged 60 and older). We estimated the annual costs of pertussis (with Boostrix) and pneumococcal vaccination (with Prevenar13), assuming an uptake of 75% among pers ons aged 60 and older and at the retail price b. For pertussis vaccination, an indication of the annual costs would be \u20ac65 million; for pneumococcal vaccination, it would be \u20ac190 million. This estimate does not include additional costs, such as the fee for general practitioners or the potential need for revaccinations. Cost -effectiveness A Dutch cost -effectiveness study found that herpes zoster vaccination for persons aged 70 years old was marginally cost -effective (\u20ac21,716 per QALY, based on the reductio n in burden of disease). Vaccination of other age groups was not cost- effective owing to the vaccine's cost and lack of effectiveness [45] . The cost -effectiveness of the 13 -valent pneumococcal vaccine was demonstrated in different scenarios [48] . No cost -effectiveness study is available on pertussis vaccination b Retail price Boostrix: \u20ac23.29 Retail Prevenar13: \u20ac67.72 Assuming uptake of 75%: 3,700,000 x 0.75 = 2,800,000 persons aged 60 and older (Central Office for Statistics Netherlands) 29 2 of the study population. A world -wide review of economic evaluations of booster vaccination against pertussis for adults concluded that many studies were strongly affected by the lack of reliable input data on real incidence and by the number of unreported cases [75] . A study from Germany concluded that vaccinating adults with a booster vaccination (>18 years old) would be cost- effective when the incidence is greater than 120 per 100,000 population [76] . It was found unlikely that vaccination of the study population against hepatitis A in the Netherlands would be cost- effective due to the currently low incidence rates. Moreover, most cases in the Netherlands are related to travel, and an increasing nu mber of persons are being vaccinated against hepatitis A [23] . A summary of the results discussed above is given in Table 2.

Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis are common among persons aged 50 and older in the Netherlands. In the future, this study population will become more susceptible to hepatitis A, because fewer persons will have acquired natural immunity through exposure. For each of these infectious diseases, a vaccine is available, although its effectiveness varies. Whereas vaccination might have consequences for the virulence and prevalence of pneumococcal disease and pertussis, it could lower the disease burden and reduce healthcare costs. Only vaccination ag ainst herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease currently appear to be cost- effective. Routine vaccination in childhood has been extremely successful in reducing the health burden, as shown in numerous studies. Our review suggests that, although vaccination can improve the health of persons aged 50 and older, the data, even on available vaccines, is still far from sufficient to judge the full potential impact. Besides, the vaccines against pertussis and hepatitis A have not yet been registered for the study population in Europe. Vaccination against certain types of pathogens will prevent mainly severe disease and death, such as in invasive pneumococcal disease, where mortality is the main concern. Vaccination against other types (with low case fatality rates ) will increase a person's quality of life by limiting functional loss, reducing frailty and preventing the exacerbation of the underlying disease, such as in herpes zoster and pertussis, where loss of quality of life is most prominent [9]. The effect of v accination can also differ across age groups. For the herpes zoster vaccine, persons aged 60 to 69 years old profit more from a decrease in the incidence of the disease and its burden than persons aged 70 to79 years old. However, the effectiveness of the v accine in regard to the incidence of PHN hardly differs between persons aged 60 to 69 years old and those aged 70 to 79 years old. In considering the incidence and the crude estimated burden of the various diseases, prevention of pneumococcal disease and h erpes zoster might warrant higher priority than prevention of pertussis and hepatitis A. The study population will become more susceptible to hepatitis, yet they might avoid it by being vaccinated for travel. This protection is possibly life long, thereby making vaccination of the s tudy population against hepatitis less of a priority. In the seroprevalence report of 2005 -2006, already 23% of the persons aged 0 to 79 years old had been vaccinated against hepatitis A. For pertussis, however, there may be much underreporting, which is s uggested by the difference between notifications and serological incidence, so the burden of disease is unclear. Lack of information on the disease burden makes it hard to compare pertussis to influenza, which is already in the vaccination programme for th e study population in some European countries [7]. Vaccination of persons aged 50 or older is important, considering immunosenescence and the fact that infections frequently lead to irreversible frailty and thereby to more dependency after recovery [6] . Therefore, insight into the optimal Assessment of v accine candidates for older adults 32 timing of vaccination is essential. Vaccination at the age of 50, before immunosenescence occurs, might provide increased protection [77] . For that reason, we took 50 years old as the minimum age for this review. Of note, the lowest age at which most European countries offer influenza vaccination is 60. Thus, a possible reduction of the age for access to the influenza programme might be beneficial; that possibility is being considered by the health council of the Netherlands [78] . Furthermore, decisions on vaccination in childhood should take into account the potential change in disease dynamics in the study population and vice versa. For example, routine vaccinations against varicella in children could have implications for the occurrence of herpes zoster in persons aged 50 and older [79] . Other questions remain about the effectiveness and duration of protection of the candidate vaccines in the study population. In one trial involving herpes zoster vaccine, its efficacy was the lowest for persons aged 70 and older; this was the group with the highest incidence and disease burden [57] . For pneumococcal disease, clarification of the effectiveness of the 13 -valent conjugated vaccine in persons aged 65 and older are pending the results of an RCT [60] . Furthermore, questions remain about the number of doses needed to obtain an optimal and lasting immune response and the necessity of repeating the vaccination. One of the major questions concerning potential improvements through vaccination in the health of persons aged 50 and older is whether they would accept such an intervention. This population may perceive the situation differently from younger individuals. For example, in the United States, vaccination against herpes zoster is recommended, but the uptake is low in persons aged 60 and older [80] . Before the implementation of new vaccination strategies for the study population, it is of utmost importance to gain more knowledge about acceptance of new vaccines, its uptake and the determinants that influence the uptake. Research should also address the preferences of the study group with respect to the effects and implications of primary prevention for VPDs. Conclusion In the field of primary prevention for persons aged 50 and older, vaccination against herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease are potentially effective. It should be kept in mind that, although we have mainly used Dutch data, certain aspects of vaccination are not limited to a specific country. Therefore, we believe that the results of this review are also relevant to other Western European countries. More research would ensure the best possible improvement in health for the growing population of persons aged 50 and older. 33 2 Competing interest G.A. van Essen recei ved travel costs for a speech for Abbott.

When considering the added value of such preventive measures, insight in the current disease burden will assist in prioritization. The aim of this study was derive the first estimates of the disease burden in adults aged 50 years or over in the Netherlands for influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster. Methods The average annual disease burden for these four diseases in the Netherlands was calculated for the period 2010 -2013 using the disability -adjusted life years (DALY) measure. Disease models and parameters were obtained from previous research. Where possibl e we adapted these models specifically for older adults and applied age- specific parameters derived from literature. The disease burden based on these adapted models and parameters was compared with the disease burden based on the general population models . Results The estimated average annual disease burden was from high to low: pneumococcal and pertussis (812 DALYs/year). The adaptation of models and parameters specifically for the elderly resulted in a higher disease burden compared to the use of general population models. Conclusions Among older adults, the disease burden in the period 2010 -2013 was highest for pneumococcal disease, mostly because of high mortality, followed by influenza. Disease burden of herpes zoster and pertussis was relatively low and consisted mostly of years lived with disability. Better information on the course of infectious diseases and long -term consequences would enable more accurate estimation of disease burden in older adults. 43 3 Introduction Life expectancy in western countries has increased, resulting in a proportionally larger aged population which will continue to expand over the coming decades. This will result in high disease burden in aged persons and higher medical costs for society [1, 2]. Infectious diseases play an important role in the burden of disease in the frail aged [3, 4] . The natural deterioration of the immune system caused by ageing that is often called immunosenescence, results in an increased susceptibility for infectious diseases and a decreased ability of aged persons to mount an effective immune response to infections [5]. Immune modelling is relevant for vaccination response. Individual variation that exists in the ability to respond well after vaccination, i.e. , some older adults might adequately respond , whereas others - sometimes at younger ages - might fail to mount a protective response [6] . Vaccine- induced immunity as well as naturally acquired immunity can wane over time, allowing for reactivation of virus es such as varicella zoster virus (VZV) [7] . In addition, comorbidity and general frailty, also lead to higher susceptibility of aged persons to many infectious diseases [3] . During infection the incidence of serious complications and mortality is often higher in the aged population than in the other age groups [3, 8, 9] . Vaccines for influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster are available, but currently only influenza vaccination is routinely offered to people older than 60 years of age in the Netherlands. Implementation of additional targeted vaccinations in order to prevent infectious diseases in older persons is under discussion both in the Netherlands and elsewhere [10- 12]. In case of pneumococcal vaccination it is relevant to consider the indirect impact on older adults as a result of routine childhood vaccination with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (2006 -2010: 7- valent 10- valent pneumococcal vaccine [13] ). Another option would be to improve se condary prevention, for example by accelerating the response of general practitioners on certain conditions (e.g., prescription of appropriate antibiotics against pneumococcal pneumonia). When considering the added value of preventive measures against infectious diseases, insight into the current burden of these diseases will assist in prioritization. With this objective in mind, the Burden of Communicable Diseases Europe (BCoDE) project developed methodology and software to calculate the burden of infectio us diseases [14, 15] . This method was used to calculate the burden for 32 infectious diseases in the general population in the Netherlands in the period 2007 - 2011 [16] . In this study, however, no separate analysis of the disease burden in older adults was performed. Herpes zoster was not included in this study and for pneumococcal disease, only the burden of invasive disease was calculated. Estimation of disease burden in aged persons presents additional challenges due to a higher prevalence of multi- morbid ity in this population. In the current study we compute disease burden using a consistent methodological approach, and in the interests of simplicity in model specification and interpretation, we do not address the potential complications of multi -morbidity. Burden of disease in elderly 44 Thus, the aim of the present study was to provide preliminary estimates of the disease burden in adults aged 50 years or over for influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster, with the goal of making comparisons between the disease burd en of these four vaccine- preventable diseases in the older adult population. Rather than emphasizing absolute estimates of disease burden, our study focusses on comparing the relative burden due to these diseases by using disease models and parameters that are similar in completeness. Furthermore, we investigated whether the use of age- specific parameters, as opposed to parameters based on the general population, gives rise to a difference in the estimated disease burden. Methods Study population and data sources The population for which disease burden was estimated consisted of all cases of incident infection (of each of the four diseases considered) estimated to have occurred within the period 2010- 2013 in the Netherlands, restricted to persons aged 50 years or older. Data on the incidence of the various diseases were obtained from the NIVEL Primary Care Database [17, 18] of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), which is based on GPs' clinical diagnosis (herpes zoster, pneumonia) , the Dutch registration system for notifiable diseases (OSIRIS) with case definitions including a specific clinical definition as well as laboratory confirmation (pertussis), and the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis (NRBM), whic h includes laboratory data of S. pneumoniae isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., invasive pneumococcal disease (Table 1). The incidence data for influenza, herpes zoster and non- invasive pneumonia (we assumed that 30% of all pneumonia is caus ed by S. pneumonia based on previous research [8, 19] ) were obtained from the primary care setting, and the incidence data for invasive pneumococcal disease from the hospital setting. Incidence data for pertussis were obtained both from primary care and fr om the hospital setting. For influenza, the annual incidence of influenza- like illness (ILI) from sentinel GP data was used as a proxy, which was adjusted for the estimated proportion of ILI that is virologically confirmed influenza. 45 3 Table 1: Reported number of new cases in the years 2010 -2013, multiplication factors (MFs) chosen to adjust for under -estimation, and the estimated annual number of symptomatic cases (averaged over the period 2010 -2013 and adjusted for under -estimation), per disease Disease Reported number of new cases* MF(s) chosen Estimated annual number of symptomatic cases 2010 2011 2012 2013 Influenza All ages 18,868 93,225 pneumococcal disease, (N)IPD = (non - )invasive pneumococcal disease or all pneumococcal disease * Data sources: - Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL): influenza, non -invasive pneumococcal disease (NIPD; we assumed that 30% of all onia is caused by S. pneumoniae), and herpes zoster - Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis (NRBM): invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) - Dutch registration system for notifiable diseases (OSIRIS): pertussis ** For NIPD and herpes zoster i t concerned number of new episodes and not number of new cases (1) Bijkerk P, van Lier A, McDonald S, Kardamanidis K, Fanoy EB, Wallinga J, et al.

Clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster in family practice. Ann Fam Med. 2007;5(4):305 -9. Burden of disease estimation The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) was used as a composite measure to express the burden of disease. DALYs consist of years of life lost because of premature death (YLL=Years of Life Lost) and of years of life lost due to living in less than optimal health (YLD=Years Lived with Disability). To estimate the burden of disease for influenza, pertussis, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster in older adults, the methodology developed by the BCoDE project was applied [14, 15] . The primary input is the annual number of incident cases. The original disease models used in the previous Dutch study for the general population [16] (further Burden of disease in elderly 46 referred to as the 'general population model' = GPM ) were adapted to estimate the disease burden specifically for older adults, in our study defined as adults aged 50 years or older, and new disease models for pneumococcal disease (both non- invasive and invasive) and for herpes zoster were developed (further referred as the ' older adult model' = OAM). To determine which health outcomes and sequelae to include in each OAM diseas e model a literature search was conducted and experts were consulted, extending the process already carried out for the GPM study. Transition probabilities between the various health outcomes (including sequelae), multiplication factors to correct for unde r-ascertainment and under -reporting of the incidence, disability weights (ranging from 0=perfect health to 1=death), and the durations of the various health outcomes, when available specifically for the persons aged 50 years or older, were also obtained from the literature (Table S1 -S4, supplementary materials). To calculate YLL we used the remaining life expectancy based on a standard life table (West Level 26) [20] (Table 2). Table 2: Life expectancy in years by sex and age group Age Female Male 3.54 Source: World Health Organization (WHO). Global Burden of Disease. Health statistics and health information systems. National tools: standard life table. WHO; 2015 [07 -09-2015]; Available from: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/tools_national/en/ . 47 3 Disease specific models The principal differences in the outcome trees and parameter values between the OAM and GPM for each of the three diseases in common are described below. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Materials. Influenza The OAM for influenza was based on the GPM [21] . The most important changes that were made to the parameters compared with the GPM were a higher risk of pneumonia as a complication in people aged 65 years (1.10% vs 0.36% in the GPM ), and a higher case fatality r ate in this age group (0.85% vs 0.13%). Pertussis The OAM for pertussis was based on the GPM [21] . Notable changes to model parameters compared with the GPM were a higher risk of pneumonia in people aged 50 years (17% vs 5.2%), and a higher case fatality rate due to pneumonia in persons aged 60 years (10.3- 11.0% vs 7.7%). Pneumococcal disease The GPM estimated the disease burden for invasive pneumococcal disease only [16] . We used this model [21] as a basis for the OAM estimation, but expanded it to inc lude non - invasive pneumococcal disease (consisting of the health outcomes non- invasive pneumonia and otitis media) (Figure S3, supplementary materials), as non- invasive pneumococcal disease is responsible for a large part of the total pneumococcal disease burden [22] . No long -term sequelae were included for non- invasive pneumococcal disease because information was scarce. Herpes zoster Herpes zoster was not included in the burden estimation of the GPM . Therefore, a new OAM was developed which included the health states uncomplicated herpes zoster, and complicated materials). Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) was also included, as a long -term sequela following acute disease. Computation of disease burden The average annual burden of disease was calculated for the period 2010 through 2013. The disease burden was calculated in two different ways. First, the burden of disease for pertussis, influenza, invasive pneumococcal disease, all pneumococcal disease (including invasive and non- invasive pneumococcal disease) and herpes zoster, was calculated using our adapted OAM models with age- specific parameters. Secondly, the models from the GPM were used to calculate the burden of disease for pertussis, influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease for the population older than 50 years using the Burden of disease in elderly 48 incidence data for 2010 to 2013, to see whether the use of our age- specific parameters, as opposed to parameters based on the general population, gives rise to a difference in the estimated burden for these diseases. Calculation of the burden of disease was carried out using the toolkit (version 0.94) developed for the BCoDE project [14, 15, 23- 25]. This s oftware allows the user to supply either a point estimate or a distribution for each input value. Uncertainty intervals around the DALY estimation were obtained by Monte- Carlo sampling methods; 5000 iterations were run for each disease. Results The disease burden as estimated using the OAM and GPM is shown in Figure 1 and 2. In Figure 2, the DALYs per year are shown on the horizontal axis and the DALYs per 100 cases on the vertical axis. The size of the bubbles represents the amount of cases per year. Her e the results of the OAM will be discussed and then compared to the disease burden as estimated using the GPM .

Most of this disease burden consists of YLL. The disease burden for pneumococcal disease was highest in the 65-74 years age group, because premature mortality at a younger age leads to higher YLL, compared with mortality in persons aged 75 y ears or older (Table 3). The disease burden for influenza (7941 DALYs) was slightly higher than that of invasive pneumococcal disease (6061 DALYs), even though influenza had a much higher incidence (Figure 1). The average burden per person for influenza is largest in the 85 years age group, in which most of the mortality occurs (Table 3). For herpes zoster the disease burden was estimated at 942 DALYs/year, which consisted of a large part of YLD, mostly caused by PHN. Although the total 10000 100000DALYs/100 cases DALYs/year Burden of disease in elderly 50 highest in the 50 -64 years age group, the burden per 100,000 population was highest for the 75 years age groups, for which PHN occurs more frequently. The disease burden of pertussis in older adults was the lowest (812 DALYs/year) mostly because of the low pertuss is incidence in this age group (Table 1), but also because of a relatively low disease burden per case. The burden of pertussis decreased with age, also mostly because of an age- related decrease in incidence. Older adult model (OAM ) compared to the genera l population model (GPM ) The estimation of the disease burden of the GPM for invasive pneumococcal disease was somewhat lower than that of the OAM (5144 vs 6061 DALYs) (Table 4). This difference can be explained by a slightly higher mortality in the 65 years age group (10- 20% vs 22.8%) (Table S3, supplementary materials). For influenza the estimated burden of the GPM is less than one- third of that of the OAM . This is because the OAM specifies a case- fatality rate of 0.85% for the 65 years age group, hig her than the case- fatality rate of 0.13% used in the GPM . The disease burden of pertussis calculated with the GPM was 491 DALYs/year, which is also lower than the burden calculated by the OAM (812 DALYs/year). For the OAM the risk of pneumonia is higher (1 7% vs 5.2% for 50 years), as well as the case fatality rate due to pneumonia (10.3 -11% vs 7.7% for 60 years). 51 3 Table 3: Estimated annual disease burden per age group in the period 2010 -2013 calculated using the older adult model ( OAM ): mean (with 95% uncertainty intervals) YLD/year, YLL/year, DALYs/year, DALYs/1000 cases, and group YLD/year YLL/year DALYs/year DALYs/100 0 cases -113) (17-18) 11 65-74 15 -)invasive pneumococcal disease or all pneumococcal disease YLD = Years Lived with Disability, YLL = Years of Life Lost, DALY = Disability Adjusted Life Years Burden of disease in elderly 52 Table 4: Disease burden comparing the general population model (GPM) and older adult model (OAM) in the period 2010 -2013: mean (with 95% uncertainty intervals) -)invasive pneumococcal disease YLD = Years Lived with Disability, YLL = Years of Life Lost, DALY = Disability Adjusted Life Years Discussion We computed first estimates of the disease burden of influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis in the Netherlands using disease models and parameters specific to older adults. Within this population and among the diseases considered, the highest disease burden was estimated for pneumococcal disease, mostly because of high mortality, followed by influenza. In contrast, the disease burden of herpes zoster and pertussis was relatively low and consisted mostly of years lived with disability. Although age-specific parameters were only available to a limited extent, the disease burden calculated with the OAM for three diseases (influenza, pertussis, and invasive pneumococcal disease) was higher than that calculated with the GPM ; this difference was most pronounced for influenza. Through incorporation of more fine- grained age- specific parameters, the OAM arguably provided more precise burden estimates. Challenges of disease burden estimation for older adults One of the methodological challenges in disease burden estimation in older adults is dealing with comorbidity. Ignoring comorbidity can easily lead to an overestimation of the burden of disease [26] . Moreover, as multi -morbidity becomes more prevalent with older age, its effect on the estimated burden will be larger when looking specifically at this age- group [27] . For instance, evaluation of the effectiveness of preventive measures such as vaccination using a composite disease burden metric can be influenced by how competing causes of death are handled when computing YLL, and how comorbidities are 53 3 dealt with when calculating YLD [28, 29] . Haagsma et al. compared different methods of dealing with comorbidity when estimating burden of disease [26] . However, all of these methods require knowledge of the extent of comorbidity present, which is usually unavailable. Even if this information were available, it would still be unclear what would be the best way of correcting for comorbidity, as no consensus has thus far been reached. When interpreting o ur results, it should be kept in mind that co -morbidity has been ignored. Estimating the burden of infectious diseases in older persons is further complicated by the fact that some of the long -term consequences of disease, such as decrease in functional status, are difficult to describe in terms of specific diagnoses and causality. The GPM did not include any sequelae subsequent to pneumonia [21] . However, Jansen et al. found that 2.6% of people aged 65 years or older are admitted to a nursing home after pneumonia [30] . This might indicate an overall decrease in physical condition or self-dependency. High et al. reviewed the relation between infectious diseases and functional status in the aged, which showed that after suffering from an infectious disease, aged persons living in long -term care facilities have an increased chance of a long -term decrease in functional status [31] . Although it is difficult to incorporate such a decrease in disease burden estimation, neglecting it might lead to underestimation of the burden of infectious disease in aged persons. The general problem of dealing with disability and/or mortality that are not causally related to the infection itself, but that may not have occurred if the patient had not acquired the infection, is a considerable challenge for the burden of disease framework. The extent of this causally -unrelated morbidity/mortality is especially of relevance when estimating the burden of infectious diseases in the frail aged population. The difference in the influenza disease burden estimated by the OAM and GPM models can largely be explained by the difference in mortality. The national death registration of the Netherlands recorded between 24 and 262 deaths annually between 2010 and 2013 of which influenza (ICD -10 code J 10-J11) was listed as the underlying cause of death [32] . Our adapted model predicted 900 deaths annually in the 50 years age group. Statistical models based on excess mortality have also estimated a much higher number of influenza deaths than was reported in the national death registration [33, 34] . Van Asten et al. found between 803 and 3961 deaths per influenza season year between 1999 and 2007 in people aged 65 years in the Netherlands, suggesting a consistent underreporting of influenza mortality. One reason for this could be comorbidity such as heart failure or COPD, to which death due to influenza might be instead attributed. Dutch death registration allows for only one primary underlying cause of death, and one secondary cause of death. This may no t do justice to the current complex reality of multi -morbidity in many aged persons. Burden of disease in elderly 54 Strengths and limitations A strong point of this study was the consistent use of identical methodology for the four diseases investigated, enabling valid comparisons between the diseases covered by the current study, and the same diseases covered by previous studies (but not restricting by age-group) such as the GPM . In this way the burden of various diseases in older adults could be compared, and it was also possible to explore the effects of applying age-specific parameters. A limitation of this study was the unavailability of a number of age- specific parameters in the literature. Transmission probabilities and disability weights specifically for older age -groups ofte n could not be found in the literature. It would be more appropriate to use age- specific parameters, as infectious diseases can lead to different symptoms and complications for different ages. Pertussis infection, for instance, leads to a higher risk of pneumonia in the aged compared with the general population [35, 36] . It is also difficult to find other parameters specifically relevant to older adults, such as the duration of a health outcome. In these cases we used parameters appropriate for the general population. If parameters for older adults were available in the literature, they were often based on broad age groups, such as people older than 60 years. In reality there is likely to be a considerable difference in the risk and duration of illness between a 60 year -old and a 90 year -old person. Because of limitations regarding parameter availability, we emphasize that comparisons of disease burden are most valid among the set of four diseases considered here; comparisons with diseases outwith this set sh ould be made with caution. The remaining life expectancy we used was also grouped per five years. This led to less precise estimation, especially for the 75 years age group, where the incidence of influenza and pneumococcal disease increases strongly with age. In general, little research on the course of illness has been conducted specifically for aged persons. A further limitation concerns the estimation of incidence for the oldest age groups. For estimation of the incidence of influenza, herpes zoster and pneumonia, we used surveillance data from primary care. However, people who live in nursing homes do not go to a general practitioner and are therefore missed by this surveillance system. Surveillance of infectious diseases in nursing homes has been established recently, but these data have not been included in the current study [37] . Especially for the 80 years age group, this underrepresentation in primary care might have led to an underestimation of disease burden. However, even in the 80 years age group, 86% still live independently [38] . Finally, for non -invasive pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster, the incidence data concerned the number of registered ep isodes and not the number of cases. Because a small part of the patients have more than one registered episode in the same year, the disease burden might have been slightly overestimated. 55 3 Implications When considering policies to improve the health of the aged population, pneumococcal disease would be a good candidate for prioritisation, because of the relatively high burden of disease it causes. However, vaccine implementation should not be based solely on the burden of disease, but also depend strongl y on other considerations including vaccine efficacy, herd effects, effects on other age groups such as infants, the willingness of older adults to be vaccinated, and financial aspects. Bonten et al. found a vaccine efficacy the for 13 -valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine of 31% (per - protocol analysis) or 22% (modified intention- to-treat analysis) in preventing pneumococcal community -acquired pneumonia caused by any strain, although this might decrease in the near future because of herd effects of pneumoc occal childhood vaccination [39] . For pneumococcal community -acquired pneumonia caused by vaccine strains, the vaccine efficacies amounted to 46% (per protocol analysis) and 38% (intention to treat analysis). The vaccine efficacies against invasive pneumococcal disease against any type and against vaccine types were 52% (per protocol analysis) and 49% (intention to treat analysis) compared to 75% (per protocol analysis) and 76% (intention to treat analysis) Regarding the willingness of older adults to accept vaccination, interestingly, a recent Dutch study including the same vaccines showed the same prioritization found in this study based on disease burden, with the highest acceptance for pneumococcal vaccination and the lowest for pertussis vaccination [40] . It is striking that influenza, for which there is a consistent high vaccination coverage among people eligible for vaccination, including those aged 60 years, still causes the second highest disease burden. For herpes zoster, implementation of v accination should focus on specific age groups, keeping in mind that the disease burden per 100,000 population is highest in people over 75 years. Further analysis should be done to determine the cost- effectiveness of vaccination among the aged, and re- evaluate this over time. The dynamics of these infectious diseases will be affected both by ageing of the population [4, 41 ], as well as by also continual change of the public health situation due to factors such as migration and vaccination. Although it is d ifficult to predict how public health will change over the next decades, it seems inevitable that the burden of infectious disease will increase significantly in the absence of interventions. More insight into the future burden of infectious disease seems vital when discussing implementation of new vaccines or other interventions. Conclusion Pneumococcal disease caused the highest disease burden in older adults of the diseases included in this study over the period 2010 -2013. Influenza also caused a considerable disease burden, but the burden of herpes zoster and pertussis was relatively low. Using parameters specifically for older adults does affect disease burden estimates and conceivably provides more accuracy. However, for many parameters no estimates specific older adults are available from the literature. Better information on the course Burden of disease in elderly 56 of infectious diseases and long -term consequences will lead to improvements in the accuracy of disease burden estimates in older adults and the aged.

Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 62 Abstract Objective: To present the results of a literature review on factors related to vaccine uptake by elderly persons. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using Medline, Embase, and SciSearch to collect all publications available on factors related to vaccine uptake from 1966 until October 2012 for West European and North American societies. In total, 1001 articles were identified and 60 were included in the review. Results: We identified six main themes that influence the willingness to be vaccinated: 1) attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination in general including positive and negative attitudes and beliefs; 2) perceived risk and severity including knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity and personal experience; 3) vaccine characteristics including side -effects, effectiveness, content of the vaccine and knowledge; 4) advice and information including influence of the healthcare worker and relatives and the information source and format; 5) general health -related behavior including previous vaccinations, visiting GP or senior center and other preventive behavior; and 6) accessibility and affordability including logistics, combinations of vaccines and cos ts. Conclusion: The most important factors related to vaccine uptake are people's attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination (especially their negative attitudes), recommendations of healthcare workers, side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine, and perceived susceptibility. 63 4 Introduction The world is ageing. It is estimated that the proportion of the world's population over 60 years of age will have doubled between 2000 and 2050. Rising from 11% to 22%, this reflects an increase from 605 million to 2 billion (World Health Organization (WHO), 2013)). As a result of immunosenescence, co -morbidity, and general frailty, the elderly are increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases (Mathei et al., 2011). They are also more actively engaged in society, leading to a greater likelihood of disease transmission (de Boer, 2006) . Consequently, infectious diseases will become ever more prevalent among the elderly. Vaccination is one of the most successful interventions to prevent infectious diseases, as proven for children (WHO, 2014). People of 60 years or older are commonly offered vaccination against influenza but less so for other diseases (WHO, 2011; Eilers et al., 2013). As in any population, a high acceptance rate is crucial for the success of vaccinatio n in the elderly. Their rates for influenza v accination vary substantially across Europe, with most countries not meeting the WHO target of 75% (VENICE Consortium, 2011). To address this shortfall, it is important to know which psychosocial factors have most effect on vaccine uptake by the elderly. The psychosocial factors could be addressed and act upon with interventions. This topic has been the subject of several literature reviews, though only covering quantitative studies (Richardson and Michocki, 1994; Mieczkowski and Wilson, 2002;Ward and Draper, al., 2007; Baeyens et al., 2009) . These reviews have identified lack of awareness and knowledge, fear of side- effects, low perceived effectiveness, low perceived susceptibility, and logistic reasons as being important factors in the vaccination uptake. However, since vaccines and vaccination practices have changed over time, reviews including qualitative research would have added value. During the last decade, a shift has been observed in medicine, from cure to prevention. This has led to increasing attention for preventive measures such as vaccination. For example, the Dutch health council released a report on vaccination programs for all ages (Health Council The Netherlands, 2007). This shows that vaccinations are becoming more prominent in life. It is therefore important to act upon these developments and to stay updated on the beliefs and attitudes on vaccinations of the different target groups. At the same time, the role of the general practitioner becomes less prominent for the younger target groups and people gather their own information from for example the internet. This was shown during the pandemic influenza outb reak in 2009 in the Netherlands. The internet was used as an informatio n source by 56% of the acceptors of H1N1 influenza vaccine and by 75% of decliners (Bults ,2011). This is another reason why it is important to be updated on the beliefs and attitudes concerning vaccination. In order to update the literatur e reviews and, this study presents a complete and updated systematic overview of the factors related to vaccine uptake by the elderly in Western countries based on qualitative and quantitative data. Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 64 Methods Search strategy A systematic computerized search of the literature on vaccine acceptance by persons aged 50 years and older was performed by an information specialist (Appendix A). The databases used were Medline, from 1966 onwards, and Embase and SciSearch, both from 1981 onwards. The search yielded 1001 articles dating from 1966 through October 2012. Articles were removed if deemed irrelevant in light of title words (#6 in the search strategy) but then manually checked to ensure no relevant articles were missed. All checked articles were indeed irrelevant and therefore excluded. Study selection Of the 1001 retrieved articles, a selection was made by applying the following inclusion criteria (Appendix B). The article: 1) reports qualitative or quantitative research with original data; 2) examines factors influencing vaccine uptake of persons of 50 years or older; 3) describes research on the general population of community -dwelling elderly; 4) is written in English. Five double references were identified and removed. One article was unobtainable. For ten others, only the abstract was available. A manual search of reference lists yielded five more acceptable articles. In total, 60 were included (Table 1). Forty -two considered influenza vaccination, while the other 18 examined vacc ination for other infectious diseases (pneumococcal pneumonia, herpes zoster, and pertussis (whooping cough). Identifying themes Themes, factors, and elements were extracted from an inventory of the determinants named in the literature. While themes, f actors and elements were derived primarily from quantitative studies, qualitative studies either confirmed or added a perspective to a theme or factor. Factors from the different quantitative articles were included in the review if they were reported to be significantly associated with the vaccination uptake. For studies that only presented frequencies, the factors presented in the papers in the top three of the frequency rankings were included in the review. We extracted the different elements from the data of the retrieved studies and via an inductive process we identified factors and eventually created themes. The constructing of the themes followed therefore a bottom -up or data- driven approach to make sure every relevant factor would be included. A theme consists of a bundle of factors that captures a specific subject related to accepting vaccination. The factors, in turn, consist of elements that represent the data in 65 4 the identified articles. In order to serve as a label for a theme, a factor had to be mentioned in at least 10 articles. Also, consensus among the authors on the theme and its constituent factors was a requirement. The elements were classified by subject, not by the type of information (for example, belief or advic e). Consequently, attitudes and beliefs will be presented throughout different themes.

In some instances, these themes or factors are expressed by wording in quotation marks, denoting literal renditions of the elements found in the studies, such as certain statements. 1) Attitudes and beliefs on vaccination in general Both positive and negative attitudes and beliefs were identified with regard to a particular vaccine or to vaccination in general. These constitute the first theme. A. Positive attitudes and beliefs The elderly made their decision to accept or refuse vaccination by weighing the perceived advantages and disadvantages (Evans and Watson, 2003; Zimmerman, 2003; Nowalk et al., 2004; Cameron et al., 2009). In qualitative studies, vaccination was considered as a preventive strategy to improve their health (Daniels et al., 2004; Harris et al., 2006). An important predictor of accepting a vaccine in the future was agreement with the statement, \"I would recommend everyone over 65 years of age to be immunized against flu\" (Evans and Watson, 2003). Similar attitudes that positively influenced or predicted vaccine uptake were considering vaccination as wise, important or beneficial. Acceptance was also related to knowledge about the vaccine and a wish to try it (Hayes -Bautista et al., 1997; Ehresmann et al., 2001; Zimmerman, 2003; Daniels et al., 2004). Other predictors were akin to protecting others (Carter et al., 1986; Skowronski et al., 2004; Da niels et al., 2004; Harris et al., 2006; Kwong et al., 2010) and living together with people who might be exposed (Nexoe et al., 1999; Burns et al., 2005). Some elderly persons wanted to avoid having to ask other people for help if they would fall ill (Car ter et al., 1986) or anticipated regret if they were to suffer from or transmit illness after refusing vaccination (Gallagher and Povey, 2006). B. Negative attitudes and beliefs Vaccine uptake was negatively associated with the opinion that vaccination w eakens one's natural defenses and that it is painful, causes disease or is irrelevant to health (Nexoe et al.,1999; Sotnik et al., 2001; Ehresmann et al., 2001; Zimmerman et al., 2003; Zimmerman, Harris et al., Chi and 2006; Mangtani et al., 2006; Gallagher and Povey, 2006). Furthermore, a fear of needles or a memory of discomfort caused by needles prevented some people from accepting vaccination (Carter et al., 1986; Schler et al., 1987; Drociuk, Sengupta et al., 2004; Mangtani et al., 2006). Others did not get a vaccination because it wasn't a priority for them, they did not have the energy or health to obtain one, or th ey considered it Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 70 inconvenient for other reasons (Schler et al. 1987; Nicholson, 1993; et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Funovits et al., 2012). Other negative attitudes that induced lo wer uptake w ere distrust of health services or modern medicine (Telford and Rogers, 2003; Daniels et al., 2004; Harris et al., 2006; Nowalk et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2007) or fear of contra- indications (Nicholson, 1993). Last, some behavioral factors were negatively associated with vaccine uptake, notably not being motivated, not thinking of it, forgetting it, not having the time, and having to make a special appointment (Drociuk, 1999; Pregliasco et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2007). 2) Perceived risk and severity The second theme concerns whether the elderly perceive sufficient risk of contracting an infectious disease to make vaccination seem important. This depends on their knowledge of a vaccine's importance, perceived susceptibility, perception of the severity of a disease, and their personal experience with it in the past. A. Knowledge Not believing or not knowing that a vaccine is needed or recommended was a reason (sometimes the most important one) for not accepting the vaccine (Bloom et al., 1985; Schler et al., Adler and 2004; Hebert et al., 2005; Mangtani et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2011). On the other hand, having a prescription for a vaccination promotes acceptance (Burns et al., 2005). B. Perceived susceptibility Perceived susceptibility refers to the extent to which an elderly person feels at risk for an infectious disease. Perceived need showed high effect sizes in several studies. A high perceived susceptibility to influenza was associated with vaccination (Madhavan et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007). The perception that declining the offer will lead to developing the flu was associated with a higher likelihood of being vaccinated against and influenza and also against pneumococcal disease (Zimmerman, 2003; Nowalk et al., 2004; Nowalk et al., 2006). The fear of developing disease or the perception of being at high risk of getting an infectio us disease were also reasons to take the vaccine (Hayes -Bautista et al., 1997; Brunton et al., 2005; Mangtani et al., 2006). Conversely, one reason why some healthy elderly people were unwilling to be vaccinated is that they did not perceive a threat. They felt they would not get influenza, or they felt it was unlikely they would get an infectious disease (Frank et al., 1985; Nicholson, 1993; Gianino et Santibanez et Zimmerman et al., al., 2003; Brunton et al., 2005; Mangtani et al., 2006). A low risk of contracting shingles was found to be associated with refusal of the herpes zoster vaccination by persons of 65 years or older (Opstelten et al., 2009). Qualitative studies also sugg est that perceived 71 4 susceptibility is related to vaccination (Telford and Rogers, 2003; Evans et al., 2007, Cameron et al., 2009; Kwong et al., 2010; Mortensen, 2011). Perceptions that elderly persons hold about their health status are important to their perceived susceptibility to infectious disease. Those who felt susceptible rated their health status as lower, and vice versa. The perception that one's own health was good was strongly associated with vaccine non- compliance (van Essen et al., 1997; Nowalk et al., 2006). The elderly were more likely to be vaccinated when they perceived their health status as poor (Canova et al., 2003, Evans and Watson, 2003). The latter association was also observed in qualitative studies (Cornford and Morgan, 1999; Kwong e t al., 2010). C. Perceived severity The perceived severity of an infectious disease can be described as the perceived impact of its consequences. A larger perceived impact and \"being concerned about getting influenza and its complications\" (Brunton et al ., 2005) were identified as predictors of acceptance or reasons to take the vaccine (Nexoe et al., 1999). Those elderly who did accept influenza vaccination reported a higher perceived severity and a higher rating of discomfort from previous influenza than those who didn't (Carter et al., 1986). The perception that influenza is not dangerous was associated with vaccine non- uptake (Opstelten et al., 2001; Opstelten et al., 2009). Likewise, doubting the danger of possible complications was correlated with no n-uptake (van Essen et al., 1997). A person's perception of or knowledge about specific symptoms of an infectious disease also plays a role in one's willingness to receive vaccination. For instance, more people aged 65 years and older (54%) accepted pertus sis vaccine after they had read about its symptoms in the elderly (Skowronski et al., 2004). On the other hand, the perception that herpes zoster causes only short- lasting pain was associated with less chance of being vaccinated (Opstelten et al., 2009). According to qualitative data, one of the main elements of vaccination behavior is the perceived seriousness of the target disease. However, there was no consensus among the elderly on whether influenza and its complications are dangerous (Cornford and Mor gan, 1999; Cameron et al., 2009; Kwong et al., 2010). Being unaware of the severity of an infectious disease was seen as a major barrier to uptake of its vaccine (Sengupta et al., 2004). The perception that an infectious disease is more serious for the elderly than for others was positively associated with receiving an influenza vaccination (Pianko et al., 1981). That belief was one of the variables that distinguished the vaccinated elderly from the unvaccinated (Cameron et al., 2009). D. Personal experience A major factor in the non- uptake of influenza vaccine is the absence of this disease in the past (Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Daniels et al., 2004; Mangtani et al., 2006). Conversely, a major reason to be vaccinated was the experience of getting very sick from influenza. Furthermore, a positive association was found between a history of influenza or pneumonia and vaccination (Pianko et al., 1981; Bloom et al., 1985). For Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 72 pneumococcal vaccine, it was also found that a history of pneumonia was a predictor of obtaining the pneumococcal vaccine (Nowalk et al., 2004). The personal experience of herpes zoster motivated even the most skeptical to consider accepting vaccination (Mortensen, 2011). 3) Vaccine characteristics This third theme refers to the real and perceived characteristics of a vaccine. These include side effects, effectiveness of the vaccine, and content of the vaccine. A. Side effects Many studies have found that uptake is negatively influenced by side effects or adverse reaction to a vaccine. Particularly influential are the fear or the perceived risk of side effects and the perception that the vaccine has side effects (Frank et al., 1985; Bloom et al., 1985; Carter et al., 1986; Schler al., 1987; Ni cholson, 1993; Pregliasco et 1999; Watson, 2003; Zimmerman, 2003; Adler and Winston, 2004; Hebert et al. 2005; Small et al., 2005; Burns et al., 2005; Brun ton et al., 2005). In addition, one's personal history or a report on side effects was negatively associated with vaccine uptake or was mentioned as a reason to refuse vaccination (Armstrong et al., 2001; Santibanez et al., 2002; Chi and Neuzil, 2004). Elderly persons with the perception that vaccinations have no side effects were more likely to have undergone influenza vaccination. In addition, a predictor for accepting the offer of a vaccine was the perception that its side effects are less risky than the target disease (Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Evans and Watson, 2003). Qualitative studies showed that real or perceived side effects are taken into account by the elderly when deciding to be vaccinated or not (Evans et al., 2007; Cameron et al., 2009). Side effects were seen as a barrier to influenza vaccination. Those who held negative views about vaccination often stressed the side effects of a vaccine or were more likely to think that there were side effects (Cornford and Morgan, 1999). Prior experiences with side effects, whether serious or not, were also important in decision-making (Telford and Rogers, 2003). B. Effectiveness The assumption that both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are effective in preventing these diseases was positively ass ociated with their uptake (Frank et al., 1985; Bloom et al., 1985; Honkanen et al., 1996; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Zimmerman et al., 2003, Chi and Neuzil; 2004). This assumption was also a reason for accepting the influenza vaccine (Brunton et al., 2 005; Ehresmann et al., 2001). It was the most important factor among the clusters of unvaccinated elderly persons who were studied to develop targeted messages (Bardenheier et al., 2006). The converse was also found. Not believing in a vaccine's effectiveness or harboring a negative attitude about vaccine effectiveness in general was a reason not to accept it (Sievert et al., 1988; 73 4 Nicholson, 1993; Nichol Drociuk, 1999; Pregliasco et al., 1999; Evans and Watson, 20 03; Burns et al., 2005). Doubt about the effectiveness of the vaccine was also associated with non- compliance (van Essen et al., 1997). In qualitative studies too, the effectiveness of a vaccine was shown to influence decision- making. The assumption that the influenza vaccine is ineffective was a factor in deciding to refuse it (Evans et al., 2007). In one study, the predominant perceived benefit of influenza vaccination was that it prevents individuals or communities from getting sick (Sengupta et al., 20 04). The assumption of the vaccine's capacity to effectively prevent influenza was also noted in focus groups (Cameron et al., 2009). People who refused the vaccine mentioned its poor efficacy as the most important factor (Telford and Rogers, 2003). C. Assumptions regarding the content of the vaccine Concerns about a possible drug interaction or an interaction with other vaccines led people to refuse a vaccine (Nicholson, 1993; Santibanez et al., 2002; Funovits et al., 2012). Concerns about the safety of the vaccine were also associated with refusal (Nichol et al., 1994; Ehresmann et al., 2001; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002). Believing there is something in the vaccine that you are not aware of contributed to the differentiation among the unvaccinated pers ons (Bardenheier et al., 2006). In addition, \"mistrust of shot contents\" was associated with a possible reduced acceptance of the influenza vaccination (Armstrong et al., 2001). In a qualitative study, half of the participants feared the herpes zoster vacc ine. These people believed that this vaccine could produce viral resistance or be unsafe when used in large numbers of people (e.g. , if other vaccines are introduced, besides influenza vaccine, for adults) (Mortensen, 2011). On the other hand, older people were more likely to be immunized if they expressed confidence in the safety of vaccination (Evans and Watson, 2003). D. Knowledge Knowledge about the characteristics of a vaccine also influences the decision on whether to be vaccinated. Persons of 50 years or older who refused to accept the herpes zoster vaccine said they would first like to inform themselves about it (Funovits et al., 2012). Lack of information on the effectiveness and safety of the influenza vaccine was the most frequent reason given f or its low uptake (Pregliasco et al., 1999). 5) Advice and information The fourth theme concerns the influence that physicians and other healthcare personnel, as well as relatives or others, have on vaccination uptake. Influence can take the form of personal or professional recommendation, personal examples of compliance, or information obtained from healthcare workers, the media, or other channels. Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 74 A. Influence of healthcare workers A recommendation or advice from a healthcare worker was positively associated with vaccination status (Pianko et al., 1981; Sievert et al., 1 988; Honkanen et al., 1996; Armstrong et al., 2001; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Evans and Watson, 2003; Burns et al., 2005; Mangtani et al., 2006; Francisco et al., 2011), reporting odds ratios up to 41. Furthermore, healthcare providers had a facilitating effect on the vaccination status of older adults and also influenced their vaccination intentions and uptake (Zimmerman, 2003; Nowalk et al., 2004; Gallagher and Povey, 2006; Nowalk et al., 2006). Vaccination rates were significantly higher am ong people aged 65 years and over who received a professional recommendation than among those who did not (Brunton et al., 2005; Lindley et al., 2006). Studies of pneumococcal vaccination found that predictors ranged from \"anyone in the patient's doctor's office recommending they should receive the shot\" (Zimmerman et al., 2003) to \"thinking that the doctor wanted them to be vaccinated\" (Nexoe et al., 1999 and \"a physician ever offering a pneumococcal vaccination\" (Ehresmann et al., 2001). Regarding pertuss is, 81% of those aged 65 and older would accept vaccination if a doctor or nurse recommended it to them (Skowronski et al., 2004). Older adults also accepted vaccination upon the personal recommendation or advice of a doctor or receipt of a letter from a doctor (van Essen et al., 1997; Canova et al., 2003; Burns et al., 2005). Qualitative studies likewise show the positive influence of professionals on the decision (Daniels et al., 2004; Sengupta et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2007; Kwong et al., 2010). Some older people refused any vaccination other than for influenza because they had not received or did not recall getting a recommendation from a healthcare worker, or because they had been advised against vaccination (Pianko et al., 1981). Two studies demonstrated the power of provider recommendations among respondents who were negative about vaccination. The first found that uptake was twice as high for those with a provider recommendation than for those without one (Lindley et al., 2006). The second found that a recommendation by the primary care physician could be persuasive, even given an initially negative attitude (Nicoleau et al., 2001). The provider- patient relationship is certainly influential. In one study, a disturbed relationship was found to be a risk factor for refusal of the pneumococcal vaccine (Miller et al., 2005). Although most studies confirmed the important role of the healthcare worker, a few showed that some people refused vaccination despite the advice of their doctors (Nichol et al., 1994; Gianino et al., 1996; Opstelten et al., 2001; Chi and Neuzil, 2004; Opstelten et al., 2009). Most older persons refused the herpes zoster vaccination even though their physician had strongly recommended it (Funovits et al., 2012). B. Influence of relatives and others Relatives and others also influence uptake, though less than healthcare providers, by offering advice, making recommendations, or sharing their personal experience with vaccination. Several studies showed a positive association between their encouragement 75 4 and the decision to comply (Sievert et al., 1988; Drociuk, 1999; Adler and al., 2006; Opstelten et al., 2009; Kwong et al., 2010). Some elderly took such suggestions as a reason or a cue to get vaccinated (Drociuk, 1999; Zimmerman, 2003). However, the advice of friends or family was more highly valued among the vaccinated elderly than among those not vaccinated (Zimmerman, 2003). In one study, knowing someone who had experienced pneumonia or influenza was a predictor for accepting vaccination for these infections (Madhavan et al., 2004). A qualitative study showed that the decision to be vaccinated was reinforced by a higher perceived risk of contracting the illness. The perception of increased personal risk could change one's attitude; the same study showed that social networks reinforce the decision to be vaccinated ( Kwong et al., 2010). One explanation could be that older people perceive influenza as dangerous, having observed its effects on others (Telford and Rogers, 2003). While advice from a doctor or nurse had a positive influence on vaccine uptake, advice from r elatives and friends could also have a negative effect (Evans and Watson, 2003). Some people might refuse the influenza vaccination after being told about a friend's bad experience or that the vaccine does not work or has unpleasant side effects (Sotnik et al., 2001; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002; Sengupta et al., 2004; Burns et al., 2005). C. Information source and format Another factor is the source of information and its format. In a study on influenza, both vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents rep orted that only information provided by a healthcare professional affected their decision (Lewis -Parmar and McCann, 2002). In addition, not being informed or advised by a physician or other healthcare provider was associated with refusing influenza and pneumococcal vaccination (Nicholson, 1993; Hayes -Bautista et al., 1997; Drociuk, 1999). In one study, information from the GP on influenza vaccination was shown to be positively associated with vaccine uptake (Honkanen et al., 1996). Besides healthcare profes sionals, information from the media can facilitate vaccination uptake (Zimmerman, 2003; Nowalk et al., 2004; Sengupta et al., 2004; Kwong et al., 2010). 6) General health- related behavior The fifth theme concerns health behavior in general. It covers vaccinations received previously and other preventive behaviors related to general health, such as regular visits to the GP or senior center. A. Previous vaccinations refused or accepted Stud ies showed high effect sizes for prior immunization relating to vaccination uptake. \"Vaccinated in previous influenza seasons\" was found to be a predictor for vaccination(Nexoe et al., 1999). Another was accepting vaccinations in the past (Nichol Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 76 et al., 1 994; Bedford et al., 2000; Lewis -Parmar and McCann, et et 2003; Miller al., 2005; Nowalk et al., 2006; Gallagher and Povey, 2006). A positive experience induced people to accept subsequen t vaccinations, whereas a negative experience led to refusal. This association was also shown in two qualitative studies (Kwong et al., 2010; Sengupta et al., 2004). B. Visiting the general practitioner or senior center Older adults who did not have a regular physician were immunized significantly less often than those who did have one. Preventive healthcare that is irregular or absent formed a barrier to getting the influenza vaccine (Sengupta et al., 2004). People between 50 and 64 who were regularly se en by a physician were likely to have received a pneumococcal vaccination (Fowles and Beebe, 1998; Nowalk et al., 2006). In addition, going to an old -age social center or general practice also had a positive influence on vaccine uptake (Ehresmann et al., 2 001). The structure of primary care influenced the likelihood of vaccination. Patients going to a small group practice were less likely to be vaccinated than those visiting staff -model clinics and multi -specialty groups (Fowles and Beebe, 1998). C. Practicing other preventive behaviors to maintain or improve health A positive association was found between vaccine uptake and preventive behavior such as wearing a seatbelt, getting enough exercise, and having regular physical examinations (Fowles and Beebe, 1998; Nowalk et al., 2006; Francisco et al., 2011). However, a qualitative study found that some elderly persons attributed such high value to these behaviors that they did not see any need to get vaccinated (Kwong et al., 2010). 7) Accessibility and affordability Last, acceptance is also influenced by the accessibility and affordability of a vaccine. This theme concerns whether the elderly are able to visit the clinic (logistics), whether multiple vaccines can be combined in a single vaccination (cocktail vaccine), and how much the vaccine costs (affordability). A. Logistical reasons Inadequate mobility or transportation was associated with non- uptake of the influenza, pneumococcal, and 2002; Zimmerman, 2003; Opstelten et al., 2009). Waiting time at the clinic was also a barrier in both quantitative (Fowles and Beebe, 1998) and qualitative studies (Daniels et al., 2004; Sengupta et al., 2004; Cameron et al., 2009; Kwong et al., 2010). 77 4 B. Combination of vaccinations The convenience of getting influenza and pneumonia vaccinations on the same visit had a positive association with uptake (Ehresmann et al., 2001; Santibanez et al., 2002; Zimmerman et al., 2003; Zimmerman, 2003; Nowalk et al., 2004). Most (71%) respondents were likely or very likely to accept a pertussis vaccination when combined with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (Skowronski et al., 2004). C. Costs Costs were a barrier in both qualitative and quantitative studies (Pianko et al., 1981; Fowles and Beebe, 1998; Mortensen, 2011). Coverage by one's insurance was positively associated with receiving the vaccination (Ehresmann et al., 2001; Zimmerman et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2007). Fewer elderly people (59%) would accept pertussis vaccine if they had to pay 40 Cdn dollars (Skowronski et al., 2004). Affordability was also mentioned in some qualitative studies; the likelihood of being vaccinated was greater if available at little or no cost (Cameron et al., 2009). Moreover, offering a free or low -cost influenza vaccine was seen as a way to facilitate its acceptance (Sengupta et al., 2004; Mortensen,20 11). Figure 1: Overview of themes and factors identified in this literature review (covering 1966 until October 2012 and West European and N orth American societies). The light gray boxes represent the six main themes: attitudes and beliefs, perceived risk, vaccine characteristics, advice and information, genera l health -related behavior, and accessibility and affordability. Each theme consists of several factors that are named in the white boxes. 79 4 Discussion This article presents an updated overview of determinants reported in the literature to influence vaccination uptake by persons aged 50 years and older in Western societies. We used these determinants to construct six themes: 1) attitudes and beliefs regar ding vaccination in general; 2) perceived risk and severity; 3) vaccine characteristics; 4) advice and information; 5) general health -related behavior; and 6) accessibility and affordability. The most prevalent determinants in the literature are related to attitudes and beliefs, vaccine characteristics, recommendations of healthcare workers, and perceived susceptibility. Our constructed themes resemble concepts from models explaining and predicting health behavior. Examples of these models are: the Health Belief model (HBM) (Janz and Becker, 1984), the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), the Andersen healthcare utility model (Andersen, 1995), and the model of Wilson and Cleary (Wilson, 1995). Many of these models have been used in vaccination studies and other preventive measures such as screening for the HBM (Coe et al., 2012; Wardle et. al., 2000). Andersen model consists of three constructs; environment, population characteristics and health behavior. The theory of planned behavior originates from behavioral attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention. And last, the model of Wilson and Cleary shows the influence of characteristics of the individual and the environment on different as pects on the quality of life. Looking at the different constructs of the different models, it becomes clear that HBM resembles the most of our constructed themes. The 'perceived benefits' are covered by our positive attitudes and beliefs on vaccination in general. Certain beliefs about vaccine effectiveness and side effects resemble HBM's 'perceived benefits', as do positive prev ious experiences and performing other preventive measures. 'Perceived severity' and 'perceived susceptibility' are reflected by the theme 'risk perception and severity '. Neither 'self -efficacy' nor 'cues to action' are directly reflected by our themes. Non etheless, our theme accessibility and affordability partly covers people's capacity to get a vaccination, while recommendations by health practitioners or others constitute cues to action, alongside information from the GP (under theme of advice and inform ation). A factor that we identified but do not find in the HBM is knowledge: not knowing the vaccine is needed. Although the HBM does not explicitly refer to this factor, we include it because, in our view, knowledge is the first step toward acceptance. A wareness could be raised through advertisements and reminder letters. The effectiveness of reminders in increasing the acceptance of influenza vaccination has been demonstrated in healthcare workers (Hollmeyer et al., 2013). These letters provide knowledge about the vaccination and invite patients to talk to their physicians about it. Factors affecting the uptake of vaccination older adults 80 Other barriers identified here and covered in the HBM are the following: negative attitudes regarding vaccination; no recommendation from a healthcare worker; personal and fr iend/family's bad experience with vaccination; not believing or knowing that the vaccine is needed; low level of perceived risk and low perceived severity of infectious disease; no experienced sickness episode; assumptions on non- effectiveness and side effects of the vaccine; perceived non- safety of vaccine's contents; and logistics. While addressing these barriers would improve uptake, it should be realized that many of them originate in beliefs and perceptions and reflect the experiences of others. Theref ore, communication should include objective information regarding vaccination in general, its side effects, and its efficacy. Concretely, the elderly should be clearly informed about the risk of getting an infectious disease, preferably by the GP. In particular, uptake could be increased by ensuring that the information is addressed to the individual (Thomas et al., 2010). Removal of logistic barriers could give the elderly an incentive to accept vaccination and obtain it at locations other than the GP's o ffice. There is strong evidence that vaccinating elderly people during home visits and using facilitators in the practice, for instance, would increase uptake of the influenza vaccine (Thomas et al., 2010). The effect of such interventions remains to be de monstrated among community -dwelling adults, however (Lau et al., 2012). Those elderly who do not engage in preventive health behavior warrant special attention, since they do not regularly visit a general practice where they could be vaccinated or at least get objective information. The present literature reviews gives insight into the role of external influence, particularly that of healthcare workers or friends and family. The GP remains the most important person concerning vaccination uptake while The Internet is not that predominantly present in the literature. It also sheds light on how behavior concerning general health and personal susceptibility affects vaccine uptake. These perspectives distinguish the findings presented here from those in other p ublished reviews, perhaps signaling a shift in the literature that in turn might reflect a change in attitudes towards prevention of diseases. Nowadays, prevention is given more priority. A focus on healthy living could make people think differently about their health status (namely susceptibility) and behavior, leading them to consult their GP. Heightened awareness would also lead them to discuss health matters with friends and family. Study strengths and limitations This review offers a complete and elaborate overview of the factors related to the vaccine uptake of persons aged 50 years and older. Because it includes both quantitative and qualitative research articles and covers a long time span, it offers new information on intervention strategies aimed at increasing the uptake of vaccines by the elderly. Three earlier reviews about the uptake of both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination covered material published almost a decade ago or longer (Richardson and Michocki, 1994; Mieczkowski and Wilson, 2002; Ward and Draper, 2006). More recent ones only 81 4 included quantitative studies (Kohlhammer et al., 2007) or did not describe a systematic literature search (Baeyens et al., 2009). Unfortunately, a limited number of articles studied a combination of different vaccines, which would have given us the opportunity to compare data between vaccinations. Looking at individual studies for both the influenza as well as the pneumococcal vaccination, determinants were identified for each of the all different themes except for 'knowledge of vaccine characteristics'. This theme was not considered to be important for the uptake of pneumococcal vaccine. In addition, our review would be more complete by adding patient characteristics. However, patient characteristics are less changeable over time and because there are several reviews/ elaborate studies on vaccination uptake and patient characteristics for example ( Ward and Draper 2006 ) and (Crawford, O'Hanlon et al. 2011 ), we feel that it is less necessary to update the literature on this specific subject. Therefore, we focused on the psychosocial factors which can be influenced by interventions. The relative importance of the different factors could not be determined due to the diversity of study designs, the quality of the studies, and the period of time covered by the articles. Concerning the time span, it should be kept in mind that some articles appeared more than 20 years ago. Although these contain important information, changes have since occurred in views on vaccination as well as public awareness of vaccines. Questions, therefore, could be raised about the comparability of the studies reviewed. Nevertheless, no distinct differences in the identified factors could be found between the older articles and the more recent articles. In that light, doubts about their applicability are (at least partly) unwarranted. On the other hand, the methodological approach of the present review adopting this long time span and including both qualitative and quantitative data ensures a thorough overview of the factors of vaccine uptake for persons aged 50 years and older. Conclusion Of the six main themes identified, the two most influential ones are attitudes and beliefs regarding va ccination, but especially the negative attitudes and beliefs about vaccine characteristics. The individual factors recommendations of healthcare workers and the individual's perception of susceptibility to the targeted disease also seem to be highly influential. We conclude that many factors play a role in the acceptance of vaccination by the elderly, and future research is needed to ascertain their relative importance.

(2015). Motives of Dutch persons aged 50 years and older to accept vaccination: a qualitative study. BMC Public Health, 15, 493 Motives of Dutch old er adults to accept vaccination 92 Abstract Background Elderly in several European countries are currently being vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal disease, and various reasons have been put forward to expand these programs. To successfully immunize the older adult population, however, it is crucial for the target group to accept such interventions. This study aims to elucidate the motives of Dutch persons aged 50 years for accepting vaccination. Methods Thirteen focus groups were composed with persons aged 50 years and older. A semi -structured top ic list with open- ended questions was used to guide the focus groups. The transcripts were analyzed according the principles of thematic survey. By an inductive process, the main themes and related subthemes were extracted from the responses. Results Eight themes were found to play an important role in accepting vaccination: healthy aging; usefulness of vaccination in older age; risk of getting an infectious disease; vaccine characteristics; severity of the disease and its implications; the experiences of p revious vaccinations; the influence of healthcare workers and other people; and the need for information. Conclusions This qualitative study reveals that acceptance of vaccination is not based on a single argument. The most important one appears to be the risk of getting an infectious disease. In that light, vaccination campaigns may emphasize the susceptibility of older adults. It is also advisable to consider the usefulness of vaccination in older age as an overall argument. A tailored approach to offering vaccination may be considered. Further research would be needed to determine the relative importance of the factors identified in this study. 93 5 Background Europe is aging; it is estimated that by 2060, 28.4% of the population of the 27 Member States of the European Union will be 65 years or older, compared to 18.6% in 2014 [1]. As a result of immunosenescence (the gradual deterioration of the immune system), co - morbidity, and general frailty, this population is susceptible to infectious diseases [2], resulting in higher mortality and morbidity rates than in young adults [3]. Infections may lead to irreversible frailty and thereby further dependency on long -term healthcare [4]. At the same time, community -dwelling older adults will be more socially engaged, which increases the chance of transmission of infectious diseases towards this population [5] . Apart from possible benefits to individuals in this age group, vaccination may yield social benefits such as lower overall costs of healthcare, as demonstrated by childhood vaccinations [6]. Several European countries offer elderly vaccination against influenza and in some instances against pneumococcal disease, tetanus, and diphtheria. In the Netherlands, for example, influenza vac cination is offered to everyone of 60 years or older and pneumococcal vaccine to groups at risk. However, proposals have been made to expand the Dutch immunization program for persons aged 60 years and older to include pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and pertussis [7]. For an immunization program to be successful and produce the most health benefits, its acceptance is crucial. It is therefore necessary to understand the different reasons given by older persons accept or reject vaccination. So far, no q ualitative study has explored these arguments for persons aged 50 years and older in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to explore the motives to accept or refuse vaccination among community -dwelling persons aged 50 years and older in the Netherland s. Methods Participants and procedures In total, 13 focus groups of individuals of 50 years or older (n=80) were composed. In a focus group, a person's view is clarified through interaction with other people, which does not occur in an interview [8]. It was decided to take 50 years as the cutof f point because of the possible biological advantages of starting vaccination earlier in life (e.g., stronger immune response). A list of foundations for the welfare of older adults, sheltered housing institutions, care homes, and residential groups acros s the Netherlands was compiled based on an internet search. Locations were selected from this list, whereby the geographical distribution and degree of urbanization were taken into account to ensure nationwide distribution and inclusion of individuals in b oth urban and rural areas. In addition, two commercial agencies were approached to recruit persons aged 50 and older. Letters were sent out to the different organizations inviting persons to participate in the study. Motives of Dutch old er adults to accept vaccination 94 Candidate respondents received an infor mation letter describing the background, objectives, and procedures of the study and enclosing an informed consent form. Those willing to take part returned the form containing their personal information. The participants ranged from 52 to 92 years of age and were classified as living independently (n=31), in a residential group (n=37), in a care home (n=2), or in sheltered housing (n=10) (table 1).

Focus groups The focus groups were convened between January and November 2012. All 13 had the same moderator (RE), accompanied by an assistant to take notes. The duration of each session varied from 65 to 98 minutes. Every participant received a gift voucher of \u20ac20 after attending. 95 5 The groups were guided using a semi- structured open- ended topic list (see additional file 1). Since the aim was to explore all opinions that arose, the questions were not based on existing formats such as the Health Belief Model, which might restrict the range of topics to be raised. Each session started with an intr oduction to the research and the aim of the focus group. The purpose of the study was explained as follows to the participants: \"In an aging society, the prevalence of infectious diseases will rise. Vaccination could protect older adults against several infectious diseases and promote healthy aging. In that light, it is important for us to know how you feel about vaccination and what your reasons are to either accept or reject vaccination.\" In addition, the group members were asked permission to record the session. The participants were then asked to give their thoughts on vaccination in general and to write down the pros and cons of accepting vaccination. This topic covered not only influenza vaccination but also, expansion of the current program to include vaccines for herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, and pertussis. Their views were discussed during the session. Furthermore, the contribution of vaccination to healthy aging was discussed, drawing special attention to the role of the general practitioner. Analysis All sessions were recorded with a digital voice recorder and the recordings were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analyzed with the software program Nvivo (QSR International) according to the principles of thematic survey [9]. Themes and subthemes were extracted by an inductive process. All of the transcripts were coded by the moderator (RE); afterwards, one was also coded by an independent researcher (IH). Coding consisted of labeling passages with concepts abstracted from this text. The results were compared, discussed, and refined until consensus was reached on the coding scheme and the labelling criteria. As the schemes of RE and IH were almost identical, consensus was achieved. By coincidence, the participants in some focus groups were predominantly 70 years and older, whereas those in other groups were predominantly between 50 and 70. Therefore, efforts were made to perform some data analysis based on age by comparing the concepts identified in the transcripts of these focus group s, referred to as older and younger participants. Motives of Dutch old er adults to accept vaccination 96 Results The views on healthy aging and the main factors influencing the participants' willingness to accept vaccination are discussed below and illustrated by quotes from different focus groups. The re sults are presented in three main topics: general views on healthy aging; reflections on whether to accept or reject vaccination; and conditions that have to be met before accepting vaccination. Each topic covers several themes that were probed during the focus groups. The general views refer to 'healthy aging' and 'usefulness of vaccination in older age'. The reflections were identified as 'the risk of getting an infectious disease', 'vaccine characteristics', the disease', 'experience of previous vaccinations', and 'the influence of the healthcare worker and other people'. Last, 'the need for information' was identified as a condition (Figure 1). A. General views A.1 Healthy aging There was consensus that aging is something one undergoes but that how one ages can be influenced, for example by taking care of one's body. Healthy living was specified as eating healthy food, exercising, getting enough sleep, and having no stress. \"Well, one can't do more than lead a healthy life. Eat regular m eals, and the rest comes naturally, one can't control that. Everything else just comes by itself .\" (focus group 9, female, sheltered housing) It was acknowledged that ailments come with aging; the crux is coping with them: \"As for aging gracefully, everyo ne gets sick now and then, life has its ups and downs, just accept it. You will suffer setbacks, so look on the bright side.\" (focus group 7, female, residential group) . They did, however, distinguish between physical and mental dimensions, whereby mental problems (such as Alzheimer's) were perceived as more severe. As one woman said, \"Because to me, the worst thing that can happen to you is ... with your mind .\" (focus group 12 , female, independent) The participants defined healthy aging as remaining independent and self -reliant. It was important for them to actively take part in society, engage in social contacts, and have a meaningful life. There was no consensus on whether vaccination could contribute to healthy aging. So even though they spoke about preventing disease by healthy living, not all considered vaccination as a part of this lifestyle: \"Well, but that is unnatural prevention.\" (focus group 1, female, independent) To some, accepting a vaccine was part of taking responsibility for your health and doing the best you can: \"Anyway, even if it does not help, at least you tried and that is encouraging.\" (focus group 8, male, residential group) Figure 1: An overview of the themes and factors identified during the focus groups Motives for older adults to accept vaccination 98 To others, vaccination was part of healthy aging. Some took it for granted and made a habit of accepting the influenza vaccine. Others felt that 'it doesn't hurt to try', which coincides with the saying 'prevention is better than cure' mentioned by a few participants. They just wanted to stay healthy and prevent disease: \"I am in fav our because it is part of overall prevention. Prevention is better than cure.\" (focus group 10, male, independent) A.2 Usefulness of vaccination in older age One important aspect that was brought up was the usefulness of vaccination at an older age. This was related to the fact that life is finite. Some participants felt you should let nature run its course instead of trying to prevent the inevitable: \"You have to die of something.\" (focus group 1, female, independent) Especially the older participants fel t that prolonging life is not always the right choice. Another concern was whether they would feel they had lived life to the fullest: \"Well yes, but if you feel your life is not yet complete, that there are still things you need to do for yourself, then I think it is alright to try to stretch it with an injection of something or other.\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) Some par ticipants had doubts about prolonging life without adding any quality to it. In addition, death was sometimes seen as deliverance, especially when somebody is already suffering. These participants also spoke of pneumonia being the old man's friend: \"And it makes a difference how you age. And let's face it, there comes a time when death can be a blessing.\" (focus group, female, independent) A different issue that was raised is wanting to age without any interventions (such as vaccines). This is related to th e notion that ailments go hand in hand with age. To some participants, the perspective of having more vaccines available in the future was indicative of a medicalization of aging: \"Just let us grow old in an ordinary way. And we don't necessarily all have to reach 90.\" (focus group 5, female, residential group) B. Reflections on whether to accept vaccination When considering whether to accept a vaccine, people reflected on several issues. The following sections discuss factors that appear to be important when deciding whether to accept vaccination. B.1 Risk of getting an infectious disease The risk of getting an infectious disease seems to be one of the most important factors. It was not often mentioned explicitly but came up as a topic of concern, with multiple aspects as shown below. B.1.1.Vulnerability The first aspect is whether participants felt vulnerable to infectious disease. In general, they did not, even though their age in itself put them at risk. More important to them was their health status at the time of vaccination: \"What matters is your general state of 99 5 health. Are you already chronically ill with one thing or another?\" (focus group 1, female, independent) In the event of feeling healthy, the participants saw two possible actions: they would either accept vaccination in order to stay healthy, or they would reject it because they would feel healthy enough to fight the infection. This latter argument was expressed by participants who have confidence in their bodies because of their healthy lifestyle: \"I believe I'm healthy enough to deal with a possible bout of flu, and then I think it is not really necessary.\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) In the event of feeling unhealthy, the participants mentioned two possible actions: to accept vaccination because they would feel vulnerable and be worried about their health; or to reject it because they would already be taking medication for co - morbidities and would not want the extra hassle. One participant spoke about being afraid that her body could not cope with an extra intervention due to the medications she was already taking: \"I just happen to think that I might be getting too much, these are all kinds of chemicals that your body has to deal with, and then you get something like this on top of it all.\" (focus group 9, female, sheltered housing) B.1.2. Prior sickness The second aspect is whether the participants had previous encounters with infectious disease. This includes personal experience, meaning having been ill themselves or seeing someone else get sick. Experience would have two possible effects on one's willingness to be vaccinated. If people had been ill themselves or had seen a loved one suffer ing, they felt more vulnerable and were more inclined to accept immunization for this particular infectious disease: \"But I have had pneumonia two or three times already. And then, if you are given that advice, well, then you go along with it.\" (focus grou p 6, male, residential group) On the other hand, participants without such experience did not consider themselves vulnerable at all and therefore wondered why they should accept the vaccine: \"Never been ill a day in my life, I never had the flu, so why should I do it now?\" (focus group 6, female, residential group) It appeared that the younger participants tend not to feel vulnerable to infectious disease because of their healthy lifestyle, and fewer had experienced episodes of sickness. B.1.3. Epidemic In the case of an epidemic, vaccines would be more easily accepted because the infectious disease would be widespread in the population, increasing the chance of contracting it. B.2 Characteristics of the vaccine Besides personal factors, the characteris tics of the vaccine were also part of the deliberation on whether to accept or reject a vaccine. These characteristics are its effectiveness and its side effects. Motives for older adults to accept vaccination 100 B.2.1.Vaccine effectiveness Though acknowledging that 100% effectiveness is difficult to achieve, the participants considered the effectiveness important. They mentioned it mainly in connection with influenza. \"Just like X said, viruses can also mutate very quickly, so you can never be assured that you won't get the flu.\" (focus group 5, female, residential group) Those who were hesitant to get a flu shot felt it wou ld not protect them because the vaccine only covers a few of the existing viruses. In addition, some wondered whether the immunity acquired from a vaccine is as strong as that acquired from undergoing the disease: \"And even so, if I go in for a shot with not a very strong dose, will my immune system then be activated enough? Wouldn't I just be kidding myself?\" (focus group 2, male, independent) In general, the minimum effectiveness for acceptance of a vaccine varied from 50 to 70 percent. This rate reflects the severity of the disease: the more severe, the more willing the participants were to accept a vaccine with a lower effectiveness. In addition, some participants did not consider prevention to be the main effect of vaccination. They said it could also make them less ill or reduce the amount of time they would be sick: \"Even if you can reduce your risk by 50% that would already be a great improvement. See, 100% risk -free is just hypothetical, it is just not realistic.\" (focus group 9, female, sheltered housing) B.2.2. Side effects of the vaccine Another important aspect is the possibility of side effects. In general, side effects were accepted as part of vaccination. In any event, mild side effects were never considered a problem. As one woman put it: \"Now, a red spot on your arm is no big deal, it could start hurting; well, then you just put a wet cloth around it and that takes care of that.\" (focus group 13, female, care home) However, if the side effects would interfere with everyday life, the acceptance rate could be much lower: \"But if I would really be affected and I would have to stay in bed for three or four days because I would feel mis erable, then I suppose I'd decline. I wouldn't do anything like that.\" (focus group 8, female, sheltered housing) Some participants doubted they would take the risk of potential severe side effects if they did not know whether they would actually get the d isease. They compared vaccines with medications: \"Oh, well. Look, if you are sick and you know that it will cure you, then you do go along with it. But I mean, if you are not very sick yet and you know that you will get seriously ill from the injection, th en I don't know if I would want to take that risk.\" (focus group7, female, residential group) In three focus groups, the participants also spoke about the content of the vaccine. Specifically, they believed that vaccines contain (poisonous) substances that diminish the functioning of the immune system. One participant expressed her feelings as follows: \"And then the dangers of it, because, yes, so there are ... see, they don't say much about it but so many poisonous substances are added to the vaccine and the se are all stored up in your body, they poison your body, which means that your immunity is lowered even 101 5 further.\" (focus group 4, female, residential group) There were also concerns about the impact of receiving more than one vaccine. B.3 Severity of the disease and its implications B.3.1. Perceived severity Another consideration was the severity of the infectious disease that the vaccine would protect against. Participants would accept vaccination against diseases that would affect their quality of l ife, increase mortality, cause suffering, produce pain and discomfort, or lead to invalidity. One participant summarized it as follows: \"I think this applies to all of us. As for me, it is at the top of the list. Health risks. I mean, to me that is a real concern, it determines whether or not I'll take that shot.\" (focus group 2, male, independent) Interestingly, when participants were asked how severe a disease had to be in order to accept a vaccine against it, most of the time they mentioned a mental illness, specifically one affecting memory. Apparently they consider physical problems less important and thus less severe. As one woman put it, \"If there would be an injection against Alzheimer's, I wouldn't hesitate a moment!\" (focus group 1, female, independent) One woman also compared the severity of the infectious diseases discussed in the focus group with those that are in the National Immunization Program (NIP). She concluded that it is more important to vaccinate against childhood diseases in light of their severity: \"It also depends on how serious the disease is; for children you can't take the risk of whooping cough and polio. But for the flu or pneumonia, I think those illnesses are not so serious, well, unless they kill you, of course; normally the inocula tion is worse. That is really the decision you have to make. To prevent polio and all those other childhood diseases, you just have to get the shots. Because the risks are too great. But considering the flu and pneumonia, that is not so clear.\" (focus grou p 1, female, independent) Others included the number of times one gets the disease in the degree of severity that influences the decision to accept vaccination: \"Well, I think if you get pneumonia once, you don't immediately drop dead, but if you get it ti me and again, year after year, then I guess I would be willing to get vaccinated.\" (focus group 1, female, independent) And last, this perception of the severity of a particular infectious disease can be influenced by personal experience and observing the disease burden on someone else. One woman recounted her husband's experience of pneumonia: \"Really, my husband had it too. I can tell you, you don't want to see that happen!\" (focus group 1, female, independent) Two specific reasons to accept vaccination concern the implications of the severity of the disease. These implications were the probability of contagion, and therefore wanting to protect others, and losing one's independence. Motives for older adults to accept vaccination 102 B.3.2. Protection of others Besides accepting a vaccine to protect oneself against infectious disease, the participants were also willing to protect people around them, especially their grandchildren and vulnerable spouses: \"Especially if you have grandchildren and you know that you are exposing them, then I would always do it, you know.\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) In the same light, people would accept vaccination to prevent becoming sick because of their role in caring for other people. For some, that was the decisiv e reason to accept the vaccine. On the other hand, some participants were wary of being tricked into guilt feelings if they rejected the vaccine. \"But we should not be talked into feeling guilty. Because if you don't participate .\" (focus group 5, male, residential group) Related to this is the perceived obligation to accept vaccination felt by some of the participants who work with vulnerable people, for example in a nursing home. As one woman explained, \"Well, for me that was the reason to accept a flu shot, because you are always working with older people, who are more vulnerable after all.\" (focus group 11, female, independent) This perceived obligation might be imposed by others: for example, a spouse who needs to be vaccinated in order to babysit for the grandchildren. Participants concluded that vaccination should remain voluntary if the immunization program were to be expanded. B.3.3. Staying independent Getting an infectious disease could mean losing some independence. The importance of remaining independent was also reflected in the discussion about vaccination. As one participant said, \"No, but you want to remain independent as long as possible, and to me that is a reason to be vaccinated.\" (focus group 11, female, independent) Th is was especially important for people without a partner. Becoming ill meant that it is more difficult to take care of them selves , and they didn't want to burden others by asking them to help out. Moreover, they wanted to keep participating and contributing to society. Vaccination could be a means to fulfill this desire: \"It can help you to stay healthy, to be able to participate fully in society.\" (focus group 10, male, independent) B.4 Experiences with previous vaccinations Another consideration is whether previous vaccination experiences were either positive or negative. Negative experiences with the influenza vaccine led to more hesitation about accepting the next influenza vaccination and perhaps other vaccines as well. One woman told about her experience with the influenza vaccine and its side effects: \"And that is exactly why I often thought that I would not do it again, because it always makes me so sick.\" (focus group 11, female, independent) Experience matters not only with respect to the possible side effects of a vaccine but also to its perceived effectiveness. \"I believe that I will always get my flu shot, because yes, put simply, it works, in my view, I never catch the flu. And when that vaccination was not availabl e, before I got those shots, I did indeed catch the flu once. Clearly, experience counts.\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) 103 5 B.5 External influence Two categories of people were identified that influence the decision on whether to accept a vacc ination: one's general practitioner (GP); and one's friends and family. B.5.1 The general practitioner The GP plays an important part in the participants' decision to accept vaccination or not. In the Netherlands, it is currently the GP who invites indiv iduals to come in for an influenza vaccination. Two active roles were identified. The first is leadership, meaning that the GP's advice is the main reason, and sometimes the only one, to accept or reject vaccination. Having a good relationship with one's p hysician and trusting him or her is essential: \"That letter, the invitation to come in for the flu shot, that comes from (...). That is my doctor, and I trust my doctor for 500%. Period!\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) Even when a participant was initially against vaccination; \"then my doctor convinced me to do it, yes.\" (focus group 13, male, independent). In addition, participants attached great value to the fact that the GP knows their medical condition. They therefore considered their family d octor as the right person to decide whether vaccination is necessary: \"To my mind, he is in the right position to say whether or not it is useful because he knows all your ailments; has the right picture of you.\" (focus group 2, male, independent) The seco nd active role is an advisory one, meaning that a person will ask the GP for advice, though not necessarily take it. It is added to the rest of the information people gather to make their decision: \"I think it is right, but I also have my own opinion. I wo uld not blindly follow his advice.\" (focus group 7, female, residential group) Especially the older participants saw the GP as a leader and were more inclined to follow his or her recommendations. The younger participants were less inclined to see the GP as a leader, and they would make their own decision. And last, some felt that the GP has nothing to do with their decision to accept vaccination: \"I make my own decision, because I form my own opinion of what to do, I make up my own mind, I don't need the doctor for that.\" (focus group 3, female, residential group) B.5.2 Friends and family In addition to the GP, other individuals also play a role, though to a lesser extent. These are family and friends. Their role involves talking about vaccination more than giving advice, but especially discussing the experiences, either positive or negative, that influence one's decision to be vaccinated or not. The conversations can either cast doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccine or reinforce a positive attitude. Motives for older adults to accept vaccination 104 C. Conditions before vaccination is accepted C.1 The need for and influence of different information sources Besides discussing the various factors that play a role in decision- making, the participants also spoke about the information they would want to receive when a vaccine is offered to them. Obtaining this information is seen as a condition for accepting any vaccination. The participants stressed the need for information about the vaccines: \"Obviously, we are not guinea pigs.\" (focus group 1, female, independent) Several sources of information were suggested. One idea was to enclose a fact sheet, like the one given with medications, along with the invitation for vaccination. Then the participants would know what to expect, especially regarding the side effects. In addition, other sources of information were discussed, with the GP being the most important one: \"Yes, I would take this up with my doctor, or ... Because that would be the right person to provide more information, like how it could turn out, right?\" (focus group 4, female, residential group) Participants would also search the internet for information and turn to reports on television and in the newspapers. However, these public sources have a different effect on the willingness to accept vaccination and could lead to negative attitudes. Some participants spoke about their mistrust of the medical profes sion, sparked by reports that money had been earned with the Mexican flu vaccination. Some participants expressed a dislike of the pharmaceutical industry because of this. \"And then there are those publications, on television and in the newspapers, saying that it was all greed, and yes, that made me quite hesitant. I thought, should I go along with it or not? That is obviously not the right thing to do.\" (focus group 5, male, residential group) As a consequence, the participants wanted a guarantee that info rmation coming from the GP or the government is objective, independent, and research -based. Some participants did express confidence in the government and the medical profession: \"If I could get such a vaccination somewhere, then I would go for it. And if it wouldn't do any good, they wouldn't be offering it; that is the only thing I wrote down.\" (focus group 10, female, independent) Discussion We identified eight themes that influence the decision of persons aged 50 years and older to accept vaccination. These are healthy aging, usefulness of vaccination in older age, risk of getting an infectious disease, vaccine characteristics, severity of the disease, experiences of previous vaccinations, influence of healthcare workers and other people, and need for information. Vulnerability to infectious diseases as experienced by the participants and the usefulness of vaccination in older age seem to be the most important factors influencing the decision to accept a vaccine. Concerning vulnerability, the participants fall into two distinct groups. The first did not feel vulnerable to infectious diseases, often due to their healthy lifestyle. The second did feel vulnerable because they suffer from chronic 105 5 disease, have themselves already experienced disease previous ly, or someone near to them had. This is an important finding because the core argument for offering vaccination to older people is their biological susceptibility to infection [2]. With regard to the usefulness of vaccination in older age, it were mostly the older participants who expressed doubts. Questions were raised about vaccines that could prolong life. Life is seen as finite; it should not be prolonged at all costs, especially when death could bring deliverance from suffering. In addition, the participants felt that aging should occur normally without any interventions. They saw more need for vaccination at a younger age, though this would depend on one's health status at the time of vaccination. The usefulness of vaccination in older age is sc arcely treated in the literature [10]. We feel that this theme came to light because of our explorative design and the fact that the study concerns not only the current offerings but also adding more vaccines to the program. Participants were asked to give all reasons they might have for accepting vaccinations (not only influenza immunization) instead of asking about specific ones. This might have given the participants a cue to take a broader perspective, allowing umbrella arguments to come to mind. Furthermore, as part of the theme of severity of the disease and its implications, the motive of wanting to protect others emerged in the focus groups as a reason to accept vaccination. This is another topic that has not been addressed in other studies. It is briefly touched upon in Kwong et al. [9]. There, the participants believed the vaccine would protect themselves and their family around them, especially the grandchildren. Also in our study, the participants expressed a need for vaccination in order to babysit for their grandchildren and to comply with the wishes of their children, as well as to protect their ill spouses. It is not clear why this topic was pronounced in our study but less so in others. It might reflect the increasing attention given to vaccinating adults in the Netherlands in recent years, after the Health Council released a report on moving toward a vaccination program for all ages [12]. This may have raised awareness of immunization among general practitioners, which in turn could have led to offering more vaccinations or giving more information on the availability of vaccines. The motive of protecting others could be useful when considering vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis), which was regarded as a terrible childhood disease. The participants were often willing to accept pertussis vaccine in order to protect their grandchildren from it. Overall, in contrast to our findings, (dis)trust in medicine and medical personnel and in the health services in general is often mentioned in the literature, notably in the studies of Telford and Rogers, Harris and Evans [13 -15]. Also, in contrast to others who found that logistic problems and/or financial barriers could impede the acceptance of vaccination [16], our study did not identify any logistic problems. This divergence might be related to the fact that in the Netherlands the influenza vaccine is provided by the general practitioner. Logistics are therefore not much of an issu e because 75% of the Motives for older adults to accept vaccination 106 population have access to their GP within less than a kilometer [17]. Furthermore, influenza vaccine is given free of charge, which could explain why cost is irrelevant to the participants in our study. The findings of our qualitative study still need to be explored quantitatively. Nonethel ess, our results suggest that targeted messages or personalized vaccination could be the key to a high vaccination uptake when offering older adults other vaccines alongside the existing influenza vaccination program. Information should be objective and independent. Information providers should also take into account that younger and older people may have different attitudes on some of the factors that were identified and illustrated in this study. Given that some older adults seem not to prefer prolonging life but would rather pursue quality of life, they might be more motivated to accept herpes zoster vaccination than pneumococcal vaccination. Although others might have the opposite inclination toward these vaccines, our findings indicate that the focus sh ould not be solely on prolonging life. Second, the participants did not feel vulnerable in general. Every person has a risk of infection at some time in life. However, older adults have an extra risk factor, namely their age. In order to give older adults the opportunity to fully profit from available vaccinations, this risk information could be shared. The ideal person to provide such information would be their GP. He or she has records of disease history and other information on patients in their clinics that would give them the background for a more precisely targeted advice. Moreover, the GP is by definition an important person in the decision- making process of older adults, as shown by our study especially for the elderly. However, the younger particip ants preferred to rely on the internet for guidance in their decision on whether to accept vaccination. Special attention is therefore needed to ensure that appropriate information is easy accessible on the internet. Nevertheless, it still has to be recogn ized that some participants did not consider vaccination useful in older age. Whereas most studies consider vaccination programs in their current composition, we looked into adding vaccines to existing influenza programs. Examples of potential additions are herpes zoster vaccine, pertussis vaccine, and most notably pneumococcal vaccine. A particular strength of this study is its broad explorative design. No pre-specified models were used to guide the topics that would be raised in the focus groups. This a llowed the participants to speak freely about vaccination. That might explain why some themes that had not been covered before came up in the sessions, such as usefulness of vaccination in older age. There are also a few limitations to this study. Unfortu nately, we did not gather demographics on the participants except for their age and residential setting. Had we done so, we would have been able to distinguish between the individual participants and their views on vaccination. 107 5 Furthermore, the persons wh o participated in the focus groups were probably already interested in research, which could imply a selection bias. In addition, the gender distribution was not balanced, with 65 women and 15 men, so the attitudes of men are underexposed. We tried to rec ruit a representative sample by inviting persons aged 50 years and older from different residential settings across the Netherlands. Unfortunately, we were only able to recruit two persons living in a care home. We approached several care homes, but the ad ministrators usually refused to cooperate because the residents were not deemed able to participate. Ideally we would like to have selected the participants randomly. However, this was not feasible because of the focus -group setting. The participants may have had to make arrangements for long travel and we would have needed enough individuals to form the focus groups. Three of the 13 focus groups had less than the minimum of five participants, but the shortfall was due to illnesses on the day they were convened. It is unfortunate that with this recruitment method it is not known how many persons were invited to take part, but we feel this was the most feasible approach. Last, seven of the 13 focus groups were convened at a time when the media carried freque nt reports on the role the pharmaceutical industry allegedly played in the provision of vaccines. This publicity could have influenced the results of our study because, as mentioned earlier, the participants would gather some of their information from the media. Still, mistrust was not found to be a key theme in this study, so the media influence may be considered low. Conclusion In conclusion, this qualitative study shows that the decision to accept vaccination is based not on a single argument but on multiple. The absence of perceived susceptibility seems to be the most important reason to reject vaccination. It is important to realize that the views of persons 50 years and older might be age- related. Furthermore, some of their views on health might relate to their intentions regarding vaccination and their preferences for specific vaccines (i.e., protecting quality of life versus life prolongation). In that light, a targeted or even personalized approach might be the most suitable way to encourage olde r adults to accept vaccination offers. Moreover, the usefulness of vaccination in older age must be taken into consideration. These observations warrant further exploration in future research.

Vaccine preferences and acceptance of older adults of four candidates vaccines .

The aim of this study is to determine the relative importance of vaccine and disease specific characteristics and acceptance for Dutch older adults, including pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis vaccination, and influenza vaccination. Methods A discrete choice experiment was conducted to generate choice data that was analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit statistical model . Results Important factors that were associated with vaccination acceptance in older adults are high mortality risk of the infectious disease, high susceptibility of getting the infectious disease, and high vaccine effec tiveness. Age, influenza vaccination in 2013 and self-perceived health score were identified as personal factors that affect vaccine preference. Potential vaccination rates of older adults were estimated at 68.1% for pneumococcal vaccination, 58.1% for her pes zoster vaccination, 53.9% for pertussis vaccination and 54.3% for influenza vaccination. For persons aged 50- 65, potential vaccination rates were estimated at 58.1% for pneumococcal vaccination, 49.5% for herpes zoster vaccination, 43.9% for pertussis vaccination and 42.2% for influenza vaccination. For persons aged 65 and older, these were respectively 76.2%, 67.5%, 57.5% and 65.5%. Discussion Our results suggest that older adults are most likely to accept pneumococcal vaccination of the four vaccines . Information provision accompanied with the implementation of a new vaccine has to be tailored for the individual and the vaccine it concerns. Special attention is needed to ensure high uptake among persons aged 50 -65 years. 115 6 Introduction Routine childhood vaccination has shown to be one of the most successful strategies to reduce the burden of infectious diseases [1 ]. For the older adult population (aged 50 years and older), in many countries currently only influenza vaccination is common to preve nt disease burden. In the Netherlands, influenza vaccination is offered to all persons aged 60 years and older. Nevertheless, other vaccinations such as pneumococcal, herpes zoster and pertussis vaccinations are available and licensed [2 ]. Expanding vaccination programs for the older population might be important as older adults are becoming a larger proportion of the general population. Where transmission of infectious diseases in care facilities for the aged is already high, c ommunity dwelling older adult s will be more socially engaged, which increases the transmission chance of infectious diseases towards this population [3,4] . As a result, the prevalence of infectious diseases could rise increasing healthcare demands. Vaccination may yield both individual health benefits (not becoming sick) as well as societal benefits (i.e., lower healthcare demands and costs) as demonstrated by childhood vaccinations [1] . One of the most important factors for any vaccination program to be successful is the acceptance of such a measure. Various factors such as vaccine and disease specific characteristics and personal factors have been identified that play an important role in the individual decision making process to accept vaccination of persons aged 50 years and older [5,6] . Yet, the relative importance of these identified factors is largely unknown. Obtaining such information is important to optimize the implementation of vaccines and education programs for health professionals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to reveal the relative importance of vaccine- and disease specific characteristics that play a role in the individual decision- making process and final acceptance of four (candidate) vaccines (pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis vaccination, and influenza vaccination) among Dutch persons aged 50 years and older. For that purpose, we performed a discrete choice analysis to identify vaccine preferences in this population. Vaccine preferences and acceptance of older adults 116 Methods Discrete choice experiment The term discrete choice experiment (DCE) refers to an experiment that is constructed to collect stated preference data ( choices made by individuals under experimental conditions) from survey responses to hypothetical, but realistic scenario's [7]. Using this method in the field of healthcar e assumes that healthcare interventions, services, or policies can be described by their characteristics (or attributes). DCE scenarios are characterized by specific attributes (characteristics) of which each attribute is varied by a specified range of categories, called levels. Scenarios are constructed from a combination of these levels. One choice task is comprised of at least two different scenarios. It is assumed that within one choice task, individuals choose the scenario they prefer most. Each respondent receives multiple choice tasks [8 ]. The data from the DCE is used to estimate the relative importance of the attributes and their associated levels by applying linked statistical modeling [9] . Selection of attributes and levels Based on a literatu re review [5] and a focus group study [10] , the following attributes were included in the DCE: clinical symptoms, susceptibility, mortality rate, vaccine effectiveness, side- effects and number of vaccinations. Levels were formulated based on information derived from the focus groups and the specific available clinical disease and vaccine information of pneumococcal, herpes zoster, influenza and pertussis. This resulted in realistic scenarios suitable for the study population. Table 1 shows the assigned levels to the six attributes in the choice experiment. Unlabelled scenarios (not explicitly mentioning the type of vaccine or disease on top of each of the two scenarios) were chosen to reduce possible insensitive responses (no trading between attributes) as people may focus disproportionally much on the labels [15] . An opt -out option (indicating no vaccination) was added as vaccination is not obligated in the Netherlands in real life. The attributes in which risks were included were dichotomised as much as possible. In addition, risks were presented in both text (as a risk label) and pie charts to make the interpretation as easy as possible [16,17] (Figure 1). 117 6 Table 1 The attributes and associated levels included in the discrete choice experiment Information on herpes zoster was obtained from [2,11] , information on pneumococcal disease was obtained from [2,12] , information on pertussis was obtained from [2,11] and information on influenza was obtained from [13,14] . Attribute Levels Associated disease* Clinical symptoms The vaccine protects against pertussis characterized by 1 to 3 months of coughing, episodes with tightness of the chest and sleep deprivation (1) Pertussis The vaccine protects against shingles, characterized by 2 weeks of itching and painful skin rash that could develop into chronic pain (2) Herpes Zoster The vaccine protects against pneumonia, characterized by 2 weeks of coughing, tightness of the chest and fever (3) Pneumococcal disease The vaccine protects against the flu, characterized by up to 1 week of high fever, muscle ache and shivers (4) Influenza Susceptibility 1 out of 100 persons get the disease (1) Pertussis Half of the people get the disease (2) Pneumococcal disease, influenza Everyone gets the disease (3) Herpes Zoster Mortality 1 out of 100 persons with this disease dies (1) Pertussis, herpes zoster, influenza 20 out of 100 persons with this disease die (2) Pneumococcal disease Vaccine effectiveness Half of the people are protected by the vaccine (1) Pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, influenza Everyone is protected by the vaccine (2) Pertussis Side effects The injection site is painful and swollen for 1 day (1) Pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis, influenza Not feeling well for a few days which requires to stay home (2) Number of given vaccinations The vaccine has to be given once (1) Pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis, influenza The vaccine has to be given twice (2) Vaccine preferences and acceptance of older adults 118 Figure 1 Example of two scenarios from which respondents had to choose the preferred one. 119 6 DCE design The choice tasks were generated by running a D -efficient design (Ngene Software version 1.1.1, http://www.choice -metrics.com ). Such a design takes into account prior knowledge concerning the respondent's preferences and limits the generation of dominant scenarios (an obvious preferred scenario). Therefore, small (0.01) positive and negative priors were included in building the design to account for prior knowledge; these were the same for all level across all attributes. Based on this procedu re, the final design consisted of 36 choice tasks which were divided over six blocks of 6 choice tasks (by NGene). The attribute levels varied across all choice tasks. The number of choice tasks was set on six to reduce the cognitive burden on the respondents. Each choice task was introduced with the question: 'Imagine that these two vaccines were offered to you for vaccination; which vaccine do you prefer?'. The initial survey was pilot tested to ensure correct wording and to test whether respondents under stood the provided information as well as the choice tasks of the DCE. Think out loud testing (a respondent completes the survey, reading it out loud, in the presence of the researcher) with eight persons ranging in age from 52 to 82 was used as part of th e pilot test. Demographics After the choice tasks, demographics and other personal factors were collected. These included standard aspects such as age, sex, education and questions on the lifestyle and social context of the participants. Current health was assessed with the EQ -VAS health state scale indicator of the EQ -5D [18] . Health literacy scores were gathered by using the Set Brief of Screening Questions [19]. This set comprises of three questions assessing the problems understanding health (care) related information, filling out medical forms and finding health related information. Health literacy level was calculated on the answers given to these three questions [20]. A 'healthy living' variable was also constructed combing non -smoking with 1 time exercise in the week. Respondents Six municipalities were asked to take a random sample of their population based on four age categories: 50 -60 years, 60- 70 years, 70- 80 years and 80 years and older. We choose to set the age limit to 50 years because vaccinating at that age might have biol ogical advantages (i.e., before the onset of immunosenescence (the gradual deterioration of the immune function). The municipalities were selected based on the urbanisation level and their geographical location. In total, 1800 potential respondents were selected. A postal survey was sent during December 2014. After three weeks, a reminder was sent to the non- responders . Persons returning the survey received a gift voucher of 10 euro. Each survey was accompanied with an invitation letter, giving information about the Vaccine preferences and acceptance of older adults 120 study, explaining the purpose of the study and contact information if there were any questions. Discrete choice analysis Respondents were excluded if one or more of the choice tasks were not filled in (i.e., more than 10% missing values). Nl ogit (version 5, http://www.limdep.com/ ) was used for choice modelling and SAS version 9.3 (http:// www.sas.com ) for the preparation of the data, including for example data cleaning, creating age groups and health literacy scores. Data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit statistical model. This model takes into account possible preference heterogeneity and adjusts for the multilevel structure (one respondent makes more than o ne choice) of the data. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the relative importance of the attributes using the following formula: =1 clinical symptoms pertussis +2clinical symptoms herpes zoster + 3 clinical symptoms pneumonia + 4 mortality20% +5susceptibility50% + 6 susceptibility100% + 7vaccine effectiveness100% + 8side effects severe + 9 vaccinating twice =0 The statistical model estimates the observed utility or 'V im' (the sum of all coefficients), that is the utility an individual ( i) derives from choosing an alternative ( m) (or vaccine in this study) for each choice task. The opt -out formula estimates the a- priori preference of respondents declining vaccination (i.e., choosing to opt- out) over accepting vaccination. The sign of the estimates of the attribute (levels) displays if this attribute (level) has a positive or a negative influence on measurable utility. Based on model fit tests (AIC and Chi -square), the constant, clinical symptoms, mortal ity, susceptibility and effectiveness attributes were included as random parameters. The estimates of these random parameters include a standard deviation (SD) assuming normal distribution. By including random parameters, the model accounts for any heterog eneity in the preference of the respondents concerning those attributes. The presence of preference heterogeneity does not indicate subgroups within a population per se (e.g., heterogeneity for the susceptibility attribute does not automatically mean that older adults with poorer health choose substantially different for all attributes). Effects coding was used for the attribute levels, which allows estimation of all level effects. [21] . This coding procedure codes the reference category as - 1 and the sum of the effect coded attribute levels is always zero. Estimates of the reference category can therefore be calculated as ( 1+ 2+ n)*-1. Using the attribute level estimates, the 121 6 vaccination uptake for different vaccine candidates was estimated using: 1/(1+ex pv) [22] . Because V includes random parameters, the standard deviation of these parameters should be taken into account [8] . This was done by taking 10,000 draws from a normal distribution for each random parameter (i.e., the mean and SD values were retrieved from the mixed logit model). For every draw of the random parameter, the observed utility \" V\" as well as the potential coverage rate was calculated. The average of the 10,000 calculated potential vaccination uptake was reported. A p -value of 0.10 for the levels was considered statistically significant in all analyses. Separate models were run for persons aged 50 -65 years and persons aged 65 years and older in order to compare estimated uptake for influenza with the actual uptake among individuals aged 65 years and older. For future programs expected uptake among 50-65 year olds were of interest. Impact on choice behavior of the different personal factors was assessed by adding each variable as a covariate to the mixed multinomial logit model. Based on l iterature the variables that were tested were: 'sex', 'education', 'influenza vaccination received in 2013' and 'health score'. Interaction terms were constructed between the attributes and significant personal factors to assess the specific influence of these factors on the attributes. Results Study population In total, 735 surveys were returned (response rate= 41%). Overall, 610 respondents were included in the analysis due to excluding persons with missing data in one (or more) of the DC tasks. Persons aged 60 to 70 years more often returned the survey and relatively less surveys were received from people aged 80 and older (33% compared to 16% of the respondents). More men than women completed the survey (51.8% vs. 48.2%). Our study population consists of fewer people with the non- Dutch nationality in comparison to the general older adults population (1.3% vs. 3%) [23] and more higher educated older adults (32% vs. 24%) (Statistics Netherlands, 2016] . In addition, self - reported influenza vaccination rate in this study (72.7%) is higher than the actual vaccinatio n rate that year (67.2%) for persons aged 60 years and older [24] (Table 2).

Within the total population, respondents preferred a vaccine that protects against an infectious disease with a highest mortality rate, highest susceptibility rate, that is most effective and for which only one vaccination is required. People preferred to be vaccinated against the clinical symptoms of pneumococcal disease over those of influenza and preferred vaccination against the clinical symptoms of influenza over those of pertussis and herpes zoster. Mild side- effects did not affect vaccine decision- making (Table 3). Both persons aged 50 -65 years and persons aged 65 years and older preferred a vaccine against a disease with 20% mortality over 1% mortality, 100% susceptibility rate over 1% and a vaccine with 100% effec tiveness over 50% effectiveness . Wh ile the number of required vaccinations did affect vaccination preferences among persons aged 65 and older, this attribute was insignificant among the persons aged 50 -65. Persons aged 50- 65 years preferred vaccination against the clinical syndrome of pertu ssis over influenza while persons aged 65 years and older significantly preferred influenza vaccination over pertussis vaccination. Both groups preferred vaccination against the clinical syndrome of pneumococcal di sease over influenza (Table 3).

Persons who received the flu vaccination in 2013 reported a higher preference for vaccination against the clinical syndromes of influenza compared to pertussis and herpes zoster compared to persons that did not receive the flu vaccination in 2013. Persons with a higher self -rated health score attach more importance to a vaccine that protects against an infectious disease with a 20% mortality rate, a vaccine with 100% effectiveness and a vaccine that has to be given twice in comparison to persons with a lower self -reported health score (Table 4). Estimated vaccine acceptance The estimated potential vaccination rates for the different vaccines were calculated for the 50 years and older study population as well as for those aged 50 -65 years and thos e aged 65 years and older (Table 5). The estimated vaccination rate for pneumococcal disease is highest in overall and for the two age groups (68.1%, 58.1%, and 76.2% respectively). For all vaccines, the estimated uptake was lower for persons aged 50 -65 compared to persons aged 65 year and older. Pertussis had the lowest estimated uptake of 53.9% for older adults. Looking at the different age groups, for persons aged 50 -65, lowest estimate vaccination uptake was estimated for influenza vaccination while for persons aged 65 years and older, lowest vaccination uptake was estimated for pertussis vaccination.

Discussion This experimental study examines the vaccine preferences and vaccine acceptance among Dutch persons aged 50 years and older. Respondents preferred protection against pneumococcal disease over influenza and protection against influenza over pertussis and herpes zoster. Furthermore, high vaccine effectiveness, high mortality and high susceptibility rates were also identified as preferences. Susceptibility rate of an infectious disease seemed to be the most important factor in the vaccination decision-making p rocess of older adults, followed by the clinical syndrome and mortality rate. Our results suggest that older adults are most likely to accept pneumococcal vaccination from the four available vaccines (influenza, pertussis, herpes zo ster and pneumococcal disease), resulting in the highest estimated uptake of 68.1%. For all vaccines, the estimated uptake was lower for persons aged 50 -65 compared to persons aged 65 year s and older. While for persons aged 65 years and older vaccination uptake for influenza was higher than for pertussis vaccination and similar to that for herpes zoster, little difference in uptake between influenza and pertussis was found for 50 -65 year olds with higher uptake for herpes zoster. Our estimated influenza vaccination uptake of 65.6% among persons aged 65 years and older is in line with the actual uptake of 67% among this population in 2014 [24] . In this age group, also the highest vaccine uptake of the study was estimated for pneumoc occal disease with 76.2%. Although protection against the clinical symptoms of pneumococcal disease seems to a preference by the total study population, preference concerning the clinical symptoms for the other infectious diseases seems to be age- dependent.

This is the opposite for the 65 years and older population. In additio n, persons aged 50- 65 years prefer a vaccine that protects against the clinical symptoms of influenza over a vaccine that protects against the clinical syndrome of herpes zoster, while the population aged 65 years and over did not report significant prefer ences for this vaccine compared to influenza vaccination. Differences in vaccine preferences were also observed between people that received earlier influenza vaccination or not as well as between persons with higher or lower self-perceived health scores. Older adults that perceive themselves as healthier, preferred prevention against diseases with high mortality rates, high vaccine effectiveness and vaccinating twice more compared to older adults with lower health scores do. The preference to receive two vaccinations might seem particular; however, it could be possible that these people feel that they will be better protected with a second vaccination. Older adults that received the earlier influenza vaccination reported a higher preference for vaccinatio n against the clinical syndromes of influenza compared to pertussis and herpes zoster compared to persons that did not receive earlier influenza vaccination. This seems logical, as older adults that accept vaccination against influenza probably perceive influenza as a serious disease. And given that influenza vaccination program is already in place it might be that this vaccine will be preferred because of its familiarity . In general, th e implementation of additional vaccines to achieve the highest possible uptake is challenging. Processes such as immunosenence (the gradual deterioration of the immune function) lead to a biological susceptibility of which people may not be aware. With regard to vaccine effectiveness, i mmunosenescence poses a challenge as well because it may lead to decreased vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination response might be better when vaccination is offered before this process sets in. However, it has to be acknowledged that the estimated vaccinatio n rates for persons aged 50 -65 years were lower, therefore the pros and cons of introducing vaccination at earlier age should be weighed. Also, the possibility of waning immunity has to be kept in mind. Since respondents prefer to be vaccinated if they per ceived themselves highly susceptible, it is important to inform the older adults on their biological susceptibility. Given the important role of the general practitioner in the Netherlands as advisor and executioner of the influenza vaccination, they probably are the most appropriate source of information. Vaccination may yield individual and societal benefits. Aspects such as vaccine effectiveness, disease mortality rate and susceptibility are important to focus on with the vaccine information provision. T his may lead to achieving the highest possible uptake and therefore contribute to healthy ageing. Currently, only influenza vaccination is offered to persons aged 60 years and older (and to certain risk groups) in the Netherlands. This vaccination is offer ed free of charge. In the current study, vaccines were offered to the respondents indicating no costs. It is not clear yet in what way 129 6 additional vaccines may be implemented at this point so this should be taken into consideration. Still, for any vaccination program to be successful, acceptation is crucial. This study therefore gives insight in the potential success of the implementation of new vaccines. This study is, to our knowledge, the first DCE study conducted about older adult vaccination. Our resul ts are in line with recent other studies that examine vaccine specific attributes in different Western populations. Studies on children [25,26, 27], parents [28 ,29,30,31,32] and the general population [33] all show preferences for high vaccine effectiveness . In most studies, respondents significantly preferred minor side- effects or low chance on (severe) side- effects over high levels of side- effects, while in our study, mild side -effects did not affect vaccine decision- making [25,30,31,32,34] . It could be po ssible that side- effects following vaccination of children is found to be more important than side- effects following vaccination of adults. Our study results are more similar to the observations of Determann et al. and Hofman et al. who suggest that side- effects compared to other vaccine characteristics are less important when deciding on vaccinations [27,33) . In contrast to the current study, sex and education influenced vaccine related preferences in these studies. Limitations Using discrete choice experiments it was possible to indicate the relative importance of the different attributes in the experiments. In addition, we could calculate potential up - take/use of the chosen measure so it can provide input for realistic implementation strategies. Ano ther advantage is that a DCE is always complementary to a regular questionnaire, this way covariates can be included to explain differences in preferences. However, our study has some limitations. First of all, this DCE was conducted among older adults, w hile previous research shows that DCEs pose a cognitive burden on participants [8], especially if they are older [35] . To overcome this concern and to ensure that older adults would be able to fill in the choice tasks, extensive pilot testing was incorpora ted which included think out loud testing and choice tasks were simplified as much as possible. We included, for example, vaccine effectiveness as a two level attribute (100% versus 50%). We therefore assume that respondents were capable to complete the DC E as provided to them. A limiting factor, related to the simplification, may be that no attribute was included that concerns the influence of the advice of a general practitioner. From literature, it is known that the general practitioner plays an important role in the vaccination decision- making of older adults. Further research has to be conducted to identify the relative importance of the general practitioner alongside the disease and vaccine characteristics. Although the selection of the respondents in our study was carefully planned based on random sampling in specific each category and the response rate was comparable with other DCE studies, there might be selection bias in our study due to the higher number of persons between the age of 60 and 70 years and higher educated people. Their Vaccine preferences and acceptance of older adults 130 opinions are therefore overrepresented in the choice modelling while there is an underrepresentation of the vaccine preference for the persons aged 80 and older and lower educated persons. This might influence the results because previous research suggests age dependent attitudes towards clinical symptoms and a more critical attitude towards vaccination in relation to a higher educational level [10,36] . However, our estimated influenza vaccination acceptance rate is in line with the actual influenza vaccination acceptance rate, which ensures some validity of the data. Conclusion The prominent factors that infl uence the vaccination choices of older adults are the vaccine effectiveness, the susceptibility for an infectious disease and the mortality caused by an infectious disease. Pneumococcal vaccination could be the most suitable candidate for implementation since this vaccine has the highest potential vaccine uptake. Moreover, vaccine preferences were associated with age, having received earlier influenza vaccination and the self -perceived health score. These findings need to be taken into account when considering implementation of vaccination in older adults. Therefore, information provision accompanied with the implementation of a new vaccine has to be tailored for the individual and the vaccine it concerns. 131 6 Acknowledgements We would like to thank th e older adults that participated in this study.

Expanding the programme to include routine vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and pertussis, for example, could reduce disease burden amongst the growing population of persons aged 50 years and older. Since most countries involve general practitioners (GPs) in the programmes, the potential success of such new vaccinations depends on the attitude of GPs towards these vaccinations. This qualitative study explores Dutch GPs' attitudes regarding vaccination in general, and their attitudes regarding the incorporation of additional vaccines in the current Dutch influenza vaccination programme. Methods Interviews were held with ten Dutch GPs (five men and five women) that worked either in an academic hospital, in a practice based in a health centre, or in individual practice. All interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed according to thematic analysis. Results GPs perceived prevention as part as their job and believed vaccination to be effective for preventing infectious diseases. However, influenza vaccination was not always perceived as effective. Doubts regarding the usefulness of additional vaccinations were identified. If additional vaccines would be offered, this should be based on scientific evidence and the severity of the infectious disease. Selection of patients for vaccination should not be based solely on age, but more on risk factors. The GP should be the central point of contact for new vaccination campaigns; however, high workload was seen as a concern. Several GPs questioned their ability to refuse to distribute the vaccinations. Conclusions A positive attitude towards implementing additional vaccinations is not apparent. Achieving the most health benefits seems to be the most important consideration of Dutch GPs regarding vaccinating older adults. Questions regarding the usefulness of vaccinating older adults should be taken into consideration. More research is necessary to confirm the results among a wider range of Dutch GPs. 137 7 Introduction Vaccinations are recommended for the elderly in many European countries. For example, in the Netherlands, a national influenza vaccination program is offered to persons aged 60 years and older [1] . In other countries, pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus and polio vaccination are also recommended [2] . There are reasons to expand these programmes, as demographic change will increase the elderly population size. In 2007, the Health Council of the Nether lands indicated that older age groups will be included in the target population for universal vaccination programs [3] . Additional routine vaccination against, for example, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, and pertussis could reduce the disease burden amongst those persons aged 50 years and older [4]. Several studies have indicated that herpes zoster and pneumococcal vaccines might be cost- effective for older adult Western population [5, 6] . Herpes zoster vaccination is already recommended for peopl e aged 70, 65, and 50 years and older in the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic and Austria, respectively. In Austria, pertussis vaccination is recommended for people aged 65 years and older [7] . In the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Health, W elfare and Sport decides which risk groups are to be invited for the free influenza vaccination program, as advised by the Health Council of the Netherlands. The general practitioner's office is the central point for organizing these immunization campaigns and the general practitioner (GP) (together with the practice nurse) selects, invites, and vaccinates the target population, accounting for 95% of all vaccinations administered to risk groups. The remaining 5% of vaccinations are given by others including a medical officer. Six percent of the target population had been recommended by a medical specialist instead of the GP; however, the vaccination itself was given by the GP. [8]. The feasibility of extending current programmes thus depends on the willingness of the GPs to organize and endorse these campaigns. From literature on the attitudes of GPs and healthcare workers (HCWs), it is known that influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for the elderly are considered important and are encouraged [9 -12]. Certain concerns have also been reported: the possibility of negative side effects, low vaccine effectiveness, and perceived lack of consequences of the disease [13] . In addition, GPs identified their propensity to overlook vaccination due to their focus on acute medical problems [14] . They also noted several logistical and educational barriers, e.g., storage of and information about the vaccines [9] . Despite positive attitudes regarding the current vaccinations, little is known about GPs' attitudes regarding vaccination of older persons in general, or regarding the potential candidate vaccines for this population. Given this lack of knowledge, the aim of this qualitative study was to ex plore these attitudes among Dutch GPs. Attitudes vaccination general practitioners: less is more? 138 Methods Selection of participants Volunteer sampling was used to recruit the GPs. An information letter was sent to regional societies of general practitioners which was forwarded to affiliated practices. Unfortu nately, the response rate was low. To include more GPs, practices across the Netherlands were selected randomly, taking into account location and type of practice, and approached directly by letter, followed by a phone call. If the attending GPs wished to participate, an appointment was made. In total, ten GPs agreed to be interviewed. All participants received a gift voucher following the interview. Informed consent was either obtained verbally by telephone or in writing by e- mail by the active enrolment o f the GP's for an interview. This type of study does not require ethics approval in the Netherlands because it does not fall under the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects act [ 15] Interview The selected data collecting method was face- to-face interviews. Focus groups were not considered feasible due to the GPs' high workload. Interviews were conducted in May and June 2013 at the general practitioner's office, and lasted a maximum of 30 minutes (as informed beforehand). All interviews were conducted by the same researcher. Saturation was reached after eight interviews, meaning that after eight interviews, no new concepts emerged from the interviews. The conversation was based on a semi-structu red topic list. This topic list was based on the literature and a focus group study among older adults in which the role of the GP was discussed. The open- ended questions covered four topics: 1) the perceived role of the GP concerning prevention in general ; 2) his/her attitude regarding the current influenza vaccination programme; 3) his/her attitude towards herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis, and reasons to vaccinate (or not) against these diseases; and, 4) the organization and practicality of vaccinating against additional infectious diseases. The potential candidates for immunization of persons 50 years and older were herpes zoster vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine and pertussis vaccine. Each interview started with discussion of vaccination from a broad perspective, and became more vaccination- specific towards the end. This was achieved by stating that besides influenza, herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis were also prevalent in elderly persons. No more information was given. In general, influenza vaccination was discussed in the beginning of the interview, and later on the conversation focussed on the potential vaccine candidates. Following each interview, the GPs were given the opportunity to indicate if they felt any topics were missed regarding their attitudes towards the vaccination of older adults, and to contribute additional information. However, this was infrequently the case. All interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and transcribed verbatim. Analysis 139 7 The transcripts were analysed with the software program Nvivo (QSR International) and based on thematic survey principles [16] . Segments of text were coded by labeling passages with concepts abstracted from this text. Through an inductive process, main themes and related subthemes were identified based on these labelled passages. Themes were then redefined and reformulated to ensure that the different themes covered the context of the subthemes. In total, three rounds of coding were needed. All interviews were conducted and initially coded by Renske Eilers (RE); one was coded by an independent researcher Irene Harmsen (IH) to minimize researcher bias. The results were compared, discussed and refined until consensus on the coding scheme and the labelling criteria was reached. The coding schemes of RE and IH were almost identical. Results Ten GPs (five women and five men) of various ages (i.e. , it was clear in the face- to-face interviews) were interviewed. All GP's that were interested in the interview were interviewed. Unfortunately, no response rate can be provided because it was not exactly known how many GPs were notified by the regional GP societies. Three GPs worked in a general prac tice within an academic hospital; three in their own individual practice; and four in a practice based in a healthcare center. The mean interview time was 29 minutes. The nine themes derived from the interviews are presented below. The GPs' attitudes regarding these themes are illustrated by quotes from the interviews. 1. Prevention and the current influenza vaccination programme This first section covers the attitudes on prevention in general and the current influenza vaccination program in the Netherlands. 1.1 Prevention in general All ten interviewees agreed that prevention is part of a GP's job, concurring that prevention for ms an increasing part of their daily workload. This entails patient education and administration of preventive procedures (vaccination, measuring cholesterol). All GPs felt that vaccination was a good instrument to prevent infectious diseases. As one stated: Once more, I believe it to be a very effective, inexpensive method to prevent lots of trouble and suffering. (GP 8. Male, Central region of the Netherlands, own practice) Attitudes vaccination general practitioners: less is more? 140 1.2 Attitudes regarding the influenza vaccination programme Even though GPs believed vaccination to be a good preventive tool, influenza vaccination was not always considered effective. Most considered the influenza vaccination programme useful: I think that the influenza vaccination programme helps, that it would so to say help to prevent, well, a massive outbreak. (GP 6, male, Eastern region of the Netherlands, own practice) Others did not: Personally, I have the impression that the influenza vaccinations have no effect whatsoever, but of course that is not science, but that is not the impression of the people who get the shot, they manage to get through the winter better, so to say, they get through their year better. (GP 7, male, Central region of the Netherlands, own practice) And even some who were positively inclined towards vaccination had reservations about lowering the age limit to 60 years, as was done in 2008 in the Netherlands: But I do wonder about one thing, should it already be offered to people over 60, of course it used to be 65 (...) continues : We are all growing steadily older and we are, let's say, relatively young for a longer time, so I find that a hard one to judge. (GP 4, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) 2. Potential vaccine candidates and the expansion of the influenza vaccination programme 2.1 Usefulness In general, the idea of vaccinating older adults against additional infectious diseases was not well received. The majority of the GPs thought that availability in itself did not justify distributing the vaccine. Becau se they felt that experiencing disease is part of life, vaccination was not deemed a precondition for healthy ageing: (...) yes, there is a tendency to try to avoid all of life's risks and I can't help but think that that is not how life is. (GP 1, female, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital ). They saw life as finite and death as a redeemer. As one GP said: Once again, those who die of it [the flu] will be the weaker brothers and sisters, who are already confined to bed, or suf fer from Parkinson's or a serious case of COPD, or whatever. And then the end is actually merciful. (GP 7, male, Central region of the Netherlands, own practice) Pneumococcal disease was also given as an example, calling it an old man's best friend: Oh, we ll no, I mean if you are 85 and your life isn't rosy, or you have really had enough, pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, can be a kind way to depart. (GP 9, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) Expanding the range of vaccines in the programme could also have negative consequences on the perceived severity of a disease, as one GP mentioned: Yes, and I also think, like from the moment that you offer vaccinations for shingles that -- oh, so shingles is apparently a seriou s illness. What I mean to say is that people's perception will change. (GP 8, male, Central region of the Netherlands, own practice) An epidemic is one situation for which adding vaccines to the programme could be justified. And some GPs saw the provision of additional vaccines as an advance in medicine, for obtaining health and healthy ageing. 141 7 3. Considerations regarding potential vaccines Two main arguments were identified for the way GPs expressed their willingness to consider potential new vaccines. These are 'evidence- based practice' and 'severity of the infectious disease'. 3.1 Evidence -based practice Evidence- based practice was considered very important, especially regarding a vaccine's effectiveness and side- effects. Good vaccine characteristics formed a condition for implementing a new vaccine. As one GP explained: You have to be sure it is useful, you have to be sure it helps, that it has no negative effects and that you can really prevent problems. (GP 5, male, Sou thern region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) Two others wondered whether vaccination could still benefit older adults, questioning how effective the immune response would be in an ageing immune system. If the vaccine could not prevent d isease, it should at least reduce the disease burden. GPs discussed the balance between side- effects and vaccine effectiveness: If there are a lot of mild or some serious side- effects, while the effectiveness is maybe not all that high, then I think, yeah, then you should not do this. The overall effect should be balanced. (GP 3, male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital) Although side -effects are no reason to advise against vaccination, they should be taken into account: But I think that whatever you do, whatever interventions you make, you should also give due consideration to what the other side of it is, the side- effects, so the same goes for vaccinations. (GP1, female, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academ ic hospital) If new vaccines were to be introduced, GPs assumed that implementation rested on thorough scientific evidence. As one GP stated: Yes, certainly. But I just assume that that has been determined before it will even have been considered as an addition to the vaccination programme (...) c ontinues: The studies checking whether or not it is safe, I'll take those for granted. (GP 4, female , Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) This assumption also applied to their role in informing patients: Well, that is very important to me, I do want to be able to give a good, justified explanation to my patients that it is useful to do it, just like I would do with any medical interventions. (GP2, female Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital) Finally, to some GPs cost -effectiveness was an important aspect of evidence- based practice: Right, and it should not be an afterthought that you have to consider the costs and benefits. We happen to live in times when we have to be frugal with every euro we spend. (GP5, male, Southern region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) 3.2 Severity of the infectious disease The second important argument is the severity of disease. Although the initial disease burden of herpes zoster was perceived to be quite low, its consequences could be severe, justifying vaccination: Essentially, the number of compla ints that people have while they are suffering from that seems to be reasonable, as far as I can tell, but what Attitudes vaccination general practitioners: less is more? 142 counts is the number of complaints afterwards. (GP 3, male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital) Pneumococcal dise ase was considered severe enough to warrant vaccination due to its mortality rate. Although pertussis was not perceived as severe enough among the elderly to justify vaccination, it was perceived as a threat to infants. In that light, ensuring herd immunity to protect children was considered a benefit of pertussis vaccination among the elderly. Take pertussis, for instance, you do it above all to protect infants, to make sure that infants cannot get infected. (GP 5, male, Southern region of the Netherlands , practice in healthcare center ) The frequency of GPs encountering patients with a clinical syndrome during consultations appears to influence the GP's perception of its severity. GPs were not often consulted for the three infectious diseases discussed her e; herpes zoster was the one they saw most. 4. Practical implications and implementation GPs contemplated the practicalities of offering additional vaccines to older adults. In particular, they discussed the practicalities of adding new vaccines to the c urrent influenza vaccination programme. They raised issues about the target population, the participating organizations, possible barriers, and autonomy. 4.1 Target population The GPs felt that deciding who should receive the vaccination should not be based solely on age. Their reservations reflected the perceived lack of health benefits: And again, that is the point, what do we gain by vaccinating the entire elderly population? (GP 2, female, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital) It would be preferable to select people for vaccination on the basis of criteria such as co -morbidities to identify a high -risk population: Of course, the benefit of the inf luenza vaccinations is the prevention of complications in vulnerable persons. And then if you start giving it to everyone -- well, if you and I get the flu, then it's a nuisance, but you get over it. So there is no real need for a vaccination. (GP 5, male, Southern region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) 4.2. Participating organizations All interviewees agreed that the GP's office should be the central point for new vaccination campaigns. They dismissed the idea of leaving it up to other organizations such as the Public Health Service. As one GP stated: Well that was clear then, at the ti me of that Mexican flu, that there was no organization, that is, apart from the GP's office, that was able to carry out such a mass vaccination campaign in a very short time. So I think that should we do the preventive vaccinations, that the GP practice is the most suitable of all organizations, that is where it should be. (GP 5, male, Southern region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) In addition, GPs felt that vaccinations should be given by a single organization: I think it would be silly, going to your GP for your flu shot, but to the GGD [Public Health 143 7 Service ] for a vaccination for pneumococcal disease. (GP 10, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) The latter respondent stated that even though the amount of work might triple by offering more vaccines, the GP should still be the preferred provider. Two arguments were identified for this statement. First, using the GP's practice ensures high coverage because GPs can effectively reach the target population. This is enhanced by the long -lasting patient- doctor relationship and the perceived prestige of GPs in the eyes of older adults that creates trust. The current influenza vaccination programme was taken as an example: But well, I believe we can deliver that message -- like hey, it's useful, just do it, yes -- better, I think, than anyone else in primary care, than the district health team. In general, we will have been in touch with the elderly for years, have treated them for years, so yes, alright, th at implies we have built up trust, and that makes it rather easy to advise them, or means, for instance, that such advice will be taken. And that is what you see happen with the influenza vaccination. (GP 8, male, Central region of the Netherlands, own pra ctice ). The second argument is more practical. If a vaccination programme is based on for example co -morbidity criteria (as preferred by the GPs), that selection process would necessarily involve the GPs: It would not be very smart of the authorities if t hey would not involve the GP (...) continues ; As far as I'm concerned, there is no other organization that knows the people as well as the GP. He is aware if the indications, has an exact registration of the medical history, and for the time being there is no other organization that can implement it. (GP 5, male, Southern region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) Another role that the GPs identified for themselves is as the role of an advisor in their patients' decision -making: I'll give ad vice, I won't tell them what to do. No. (GP 4, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center). The role of the GP depends on the individual patient: Well, that is really just about what you do as a doctor and what the patient likes to see and get. And by now, I do know my elderly patients, and some, well they like to discuss things and then you go along, and others expect to get more directions, and th en you tell them what they should do. (GP 3, male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital). Even if another organization were to be involved, GPs felt that they should have an important informative role to play because people wo uld turn to them with their questions: Well, I think that in that respect, seeing that all those people come to us to ask about it, that the patients think it is important what our opinion is. So in that respect, we have an important role in informing them (GP3 male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital). 4.3 Potential barriers One potential barrier for adding additional vaccinations was the extra workload. Some GPs remarked that organizing the influenza vaccination programme alone is an extensive undertaking: It does have a big impact, we have an influenza committee here, that starts up early on, all those people have to be selected. The GPs have to be chased to Attitudes vaccination general practitioners: less is more? 144 assess all those people. Altogether, it is a lot of bother. (GP 3, male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital). However, not all GPs felt that the extra workload would be insurmountable if financial compensation was forthcoming. As one GP stated: Yes, barriers can be overcome in principle, bu t these tasks have to be facilitated, our professional group is naturally given quite a lot of tasks. (GP 1, female, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital). Others, in contrast, believed that handling the distribution of the inf luenza vaccine would be easy, indicating that implementation of additional vaccines would not be a problem: But really, that influenza programme, that runs very smoothly, it's easy to carry it out, it is only one shot. So it takes two or three hours, really, per year, so it does not take much time. (GP 6, male, Eastern region of the Netherlands, own practice) Vaccine- specific selection criteria would add to the workload. To keep it within bounds, GPs would opt for similar selection criteria and combination vaccines. Therefore, they preferred any additional vaccines to be implemented within the influenza vaccination programme: If the criteria would be the same that would make it a lot easier, and of course it would be best if they would both be simultaneous, like in both arms or as a cocktail vaccine like with hepatitis A and B. That would be handy, from a logistic point of view. (GP 3, male, Northern region of the Netherlands, practice in academic hospital) Another GP put it succinctly: I simply want to be ab le to order the right numbers on let's say, the same website, that everything is just the same. (GP 4, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) At the same time, the GPs foresaw restrictions on the patients' freedom to choo se a particular vaccine: Well, see, assume that you could give it as one shot, then that would be easier, it would be less work, but then there might be people who say they want the one shot but not the other. I could imagine that that would complicate thi ngs. (GP 9, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) 4.4 Autonomy Several GPs questioned their ability to refuse to distribute the vaccinations, indicating that a positive attitude is not always necessary. They don't believe that they have the authority to decide whether to vaccinate or not: Well like that influenza vacc ination, I am happy to leave that up to the authorities who in their wisdom have decided to adopt that programme -- oh well, then I'll just go along with it, I'm just an employee, so to speak. (GP 7, male, Western region of the Netherlands, own practice) O thers did feel autonomous with respect to their own conditions: If it is being offered, then it has been decided that it is worth it. Then I'll just go along with it. But obviously, the costs should somehow be proportional to the benefits, the number of pe ople that benefit from it, the disease burden. (GP 9, female, Central region of the Netherlands, practice in healthcare center) 145 7 Discussion This qualitative study offers insight into the attitudes of Dutch GPs regarding the vaccination of older adults and regarding potential new vaccines candidates. Nine themes that reflect the attitudes of Dutch GPs were identified: prevention and the influenza vaccination programme; usefulness of additional vaccines; evidence- based practice; severity of the infectious disease; target population; participating organizations; potential barriers; and autonomy. A positive attitude towards prevention in general and vaccination in particular does not necessarily imply a positive attitude regarding additional vaccinations. T he interviews revealed several reasons why the GPs doubted the usefulness of potential vaccine candidates. First, they questioned eligibility for vaccination based solely on age criteria. Selection based on co -morbidity was considered more useful. Furtherm ore, they were concerned that implementation of a vaccine might cause the elderly to perceive certain infectious diseases as more serious. According to the interviewed GPs, the initial clinical syndromes of both herpes zoster and pertussis are not perceived as severe enough to warrant vaccination. Finally, they felt that it was not right to avoid all risks in life, not even the risk of death. In this light, pneumonia was seen as the old man's best friend. The addition of other vaccinations to the influenza vaccination program may therefore involve ethical issues/ challenges such as ageism (which is referred to as stereotyping or discriminating based on age), because implementation will most likely be age-dependent, and the ethics surrounding end -of-life decisions. The influenza vaccination programme was initiated in 1997 and has since become common practice in the Netherlands [1] . Not all GPs had a positive attitude towards this vaccination programme. Nonetheless, distribution of the vaccine has become a rou tine part of their job. This ambivalence may emanate from their perception of themselves as not fully autonomous in the decision to give vaccinations. GPs comply with decisions made by the government, trusting that sufficient evidence has been gathered to justify the implementation of a new vaccine. Some GPs stated that certain conditions should be met, especially re- imbursement, to facilitate the distribution of the vaccines by the GPs. Despite their ambivalent attitudes, they felt that if additional vacc ines were introduced, GPs should be involved, regardless of their lack of a positive attitude or their high workload. Their role would be that of a consultant or advisor to the patients and/or as the organizer of the vaccination campaigns. In addition, they considered the GP office to be the most suitable place for distribution because it forms the locus of the patient- doctor trust relationship and the selection of patients eligible for vaccination. Previous studies suggested that the GP plays an important role in the vaccination decision- making process of an older person [17] . GPs might play a key role in ensuring a high uptake of current and future vaccines. To this end, the support of the GPs should be optimized. This study suggests that their support co uld be won by providing them with appropriate information, given the importance they ascribe to evidence- based practice. Supply of information would also encourage a more positive attitude towards Attitudes vaccination general practitioners: less is more? 146 vaccination. That, in turn, would facilitate patient education and assist GPs in caring out their advisory role in the decision- making process of the elderly. Qualitative studies on GPs' attitudes towards (new) vaccines are scarce. Those that have been published focus on existing programmes and vaccination rates [18] . According to Swiss GPs, although pneumococcal disease was perceived as potentially severe, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be the least important vaccination in their daily practice, especially compared to influenza vaccination. [18] . In our s tudy, however, pneumococcal disease was identified as the most likely potential vaccine candidate when considering the attitude of the interviewed GPs [18]. Other studies have emphasized the importance of good vaccine characteristics [13,19,20] , the diseas e burden caused by herpes zoster, specifically the longer -term consequences [20] , the disease burden caused by pneumococcal disease [21], and the importance of vaccination as a preventive tool [22] . The literature on pneumococcal vaccination indicates that target population vaccination is preferred above general population vaccination based on a single age criterion [12,13,21, 23]. This conclusion is also drawn here. Interestingly, the GPs interview ed in the present study questioned the usefulness of expanded immunization programmes for older adults. In the literature, this issue has only been addressed briefly by Van Haaren and not in other studies referenced within this article. The GPs interviewed in this study indicated that healthy elderly persons could withstand the flu, thus arguing against vaccinating the elderly against influenza [23] . Study strengths and limitations Given the low response rate, and consequently the low number of interview ed GPs, the present study was prone to selection bias. GPs have a high workload, and those GPs who were willing to participate might have had a strong interest in research or in elderly vaccination, or may have been critical of the topic. Also, GPs working an academic hospital were probably over -represented. Therefore questions might be raised concerning the representativeness of the study population. However, even though only 10 GPs were interviewed, they were located across the Netherlands, and saturation of the data was present after eight interviews. It is thus likely that the survey gathered all points of view. Nonetheless, the various attitudes identified in this study should be quantified. Conclusion This qualitative study suggests that GPs do not necessarily have a positive attitude regarding the addition of potential vaccine candidates to the current Dutch influenza vaccination programme. The main challenge to expanding the vaccination programme to include potential vaccine candidates within the influenza vaccination schedule is how to achieve the most health benefits. Some questions about the usefulness of vaccinating 147 7 remain unanswered. Thus, the degree of support among GPs, who are key players in th e vaccination decision- making process of the elderly, is not yet clear. Further studies are needed to quantify the observations presented in this qualitative study, and to extend the research to encompass a larger sample of Dutch GPs.

The intention of Dutch general practitioners to offer vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis to people aged 60 years and older . BMC Geriatrics. 2017Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 152 Abstra ct Background: Increasing life expectancy results in a larger proportion of older people susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). In the Netherlands, influenza vaccination is routinely offered to people aged 60 years and older. Vaccination against pneumococca l disease, herpes zoster and pertussis is rarely used. These vaccines will be evaluated by the Dutch Health Council and might be routinely offered to older people in the near future. Possible expansion of the program depends partly on the willingness of general practitioners (GPs) to endorse additional vaccinations. In this study, we assessed predictors of GPs' attitude and intention to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older. Methods: GPs (N=12.194) were invited to fill in an online questionnaire consisting of questions about social cognitive factors that can influence the willingness of GPs to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older, including underlying beliefs, practical considerations of adding more vaccines to the national program, demographics, and GPs' patient population characteristics. The questionnaire was filled in by 732 GPs. Results: GPs were positive both about vaccination as a preventive tool and the influenza vaccination program, but somewhat less positive about expanding the current program. Prediction analysis showed that the intention of GPs to offer additional vaccination was predicted by their attitude towards offering additional vaccination, towards vaccination as a preventive tool, towards offering vaccination during an outbreak and on GPs opinion regarding suitability to offer additional vaccination (R 2=0.60). The attitude of GPs towards offering additional vaccination was predicted by the perceived severity of herpes zoster and pneumonia, as well as the perceived incidence of herpes zoster. Severity of diseases was ranked as important argument to recommend vaccination, followed by effectiveness and health benefits of vaccines. Conclusion: Providing GPs with evidence- based information about the severity and prevalence of diseases, and effectiveness and health benefits of the vaccines, together with an active role of GPs in informing older people about vaccines, could modify the intention towards additional vaccination of people 60 years and older. 153 8 Background Life expectancy has increased around the world, resulting in a larger proportion of older people in the population. It is estimated that by 2060, 28.4% of the population in the EU will consist of people older than 65 years of age, which would be an increase of almost 10% sinc e 2014 [1]. Age -dependent deterioration of the immune system, called immunosenescence, together with general frailty and possible co -morbidity make older people particularly susceptible to infectious diseases [2,3]. Infectious diseases play an important ro le in the disease burden of older people and an increased social engagement among community -dwelling older adults might additionally increase the risks of transmission [4 -6]. Moreover, immunity - vaccine and naturally acquired - can wane over time which makes reactivation of certain latent viruses possible [7]. Successful (re)vaccination of older people against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) may be an important preventive strategy for reducing the disease burden and health care costs in the aging popul ation. Vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis are available, but only influenza is routinely offered to people aged 60 years and older in the Netherlands [8]. The diseases occur frequently among older people in the Netherlands [9] and vaccination against pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster is amongst others routinely offered to people aged 65 and 70 years of age respectively in the UK, while vaccination against pertussis is amongst others offered to people aged 65 in Belgium [10]. These vaccines are currently also being evaluated by the Dutch Health Council on their suitability to be routinely offered to older people in the near future. As is the case in many European countries, general practitioners (GPs) carry out the national influenza vaccination program by selecting and inviting eligible patients from their registries and administering vaccination in the Netherlands. Moreover, previous research showed that the advice of the GP to get vaccinated was mentioned as the most important external influence on acceptance of vaccination by older people [11]. For this reason, they are the most likely choice in the Netherlands to administer vaccination when implementing new vaccination strategies for older people and to offer vaccination against infectious diseases other than influenza vaccination to elderly populations. Consequently, the feasibility of expanding the current program also depends on the willingness of GPs to organize and endorse new vaccination strategies. However, little is known about Dutch GPs' attitude towards expanding the program for elderly people with additional vaccines, whether they would be willing to offer and administer those vaccines and under which circumstances. Recently, a qualitative study was conducted in the Netherlands [12] exploring the attitude of GPs towards vaccinating older people and towards adding pneumococcal, herpes zoster and pertussis vaccination to the current program. In an effort to quantify the findings of this qualitative stu dy, we conducted a cross -sectional study investigating the relative and combined strength of the identified factors and underlying beliefs in explaining the intention of GPs to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older against more infectious diseases than influenza. Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 154 Methods Participants and procedure In January 2015, all Dutch GPs (12.194 registered) working in 5068 general practices were invited to fill in an online questionnaire about the factors that influence their willingness to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older against infectious diseases other than influenza. GPs were asked to participate via a link in an e- mail sent by the National Influenza Prevention Program Foundation (SNPG), which coordinates the logistics of the influenza vaccination pr ogram (i.e. , delivering vaccines to practices). Of the invited GPs 723 (6.0%) participated in this study. This type of study does not require ethics approval in the Netherlands because it does not fall under the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects act [13]. The questionnaire The questionnaire used for this study was based on an interview study among ten Dutch GPs, which explored GPs' attitude towards vaccination of older people in general and potential future candidates for inclusion in the current influenza vaccination program for people aged 60 years and older [12]. The questionnaire consisted of 37 questions/statements about social cognitive factors, underlying beliefs, practical considerations, demographics, and characteristics of the GPs' patient population . Variables were measured on 7 -point Likert scales ranging from 1 = totally disagree to 7 = totally agree, unless otherwise indicated. Items measuring the same underlying construct were averaged into one single construct when internal consistency was suffi cient (Cronbach's alpha > 0.60 or Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.50). Items were recoded so that all effects pointed to the same direction. See Table 1 for an overview of the constructs and their internal consistency. In addition to questions abou t their intention to vaccinate patients in their 60s against other infectious diseases than influenza, GPs were asked about their intention to recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis to healthy people in their 60s and their intention to recommend vaccination of these diseases to people in their 60s with co -morbidity with separate items (see Table 1). 155 8 Table 1. Overview of constructs measured by the online survey Variable Number of items Reliability Example question Intention 3 = .88 I would be willing to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older against infectious diseases other than influenza. Attitude 2 r = .64 I think vaccination as a preventive tool is: 1 = not very useful; 7 = very useful. Attitude additional vaccination 1 n.a. Offering additional vaccination other than influenza vaccination to people aged 60 years and older is necessary. Attitude vaccination 80+ 1 n.a. Offering people 80 years and older some form of vaccination is still useful. Attitude outbreak 1 n.a. Vaccinating people 60 years and older with or without co -morbidities during an outbreak of an infectious disease is always useful. Perceived severity (per infectious disease) 4 n.a. How serious do you think are the different diseases for people aged 60 years and older? Influenza/ herpes zoster/ pneumonia/ pertussis: 1 = not severe at all; 7 = very severe. These are four separate items. Selection comorbidity over age 3 = .81 Vaccina ting people on the basis of co -morbidities is favored over vaccinating people on the basis of age, irrespective of the infectious disease. Prevention 1 n.a. In general, prevention of illness has the preference over cure. Prevention mortality 1 n.a. Additional vaccines should primarily be focused on the prevention of death. Prevention morbidity 1 n.a. Additional vaccines should primarily be focused on the prevention of illness Usefulness health benefits 1 n.a. In the consideration to offer vaccinati on, individual health benefits are more important than cost - effectiveness on the population level. Intention (per infectious disease) 3 n.a. I would recommend healthy people in their 60s to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease/ herpes zoster/ pertussis. These are three separate items. Intention comorbidity (per infectious disease) 3 n.a. I would recommend people in their 60s who have a comorbidity to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease/ herpes zoster/ pertussis. These are three separate items. n.a., not applicable Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 156 Moreover, GPs were asked to rank six arguments for offering vaccination to older patients. These arguments were identified as main arguments in the qualitative study preceding this cross -sectional study [12]. The arguments concerned health benefits for the individual, the severity of an infectious disease, vaccine effectiveness, side- effects of a vaccine, the outbreak of an infectious disease, and cost- effectiveness of vaccination. Furthermore, GPs were asked which of the proposed vaccines they considered to have the highest probability of being included in a program (pneumococcal/ herpes zoster/ pertussis vaccinatio n/ none of the above) . Next to that, practical considerations about offering additional vaccination were measured by asking about GPs' suitability to apply additional vaccination, the importance of reimbursement for the implementation of a vaccination prog ram, and preference for offering and administering additional vaccination at the same time as influenza vaccination, in the same national program, or outside of a national program. Demographic variables were age, sex, and kind of practice (own practice, sh ared practice, integrated in health care setting, academic setting). Characteristics of GPs' patient population were number of patients registered in the practice, an estimate of the proportion of patients aged 60 years and older registered in the practice, and the perceived incidence of influenza, pneumonia, herpes zoster, and pertussis among patients aged 60 years and older in their practice (1 = never; 7 = very often ). Data analysis Following a descriptive analysis of the sample (frequencies), univariate associations between intention and social cognitive factors, beliefs and practical considerations were tested with Spearman's correlation test. To control for the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple testing, the Benjamini- Hochberg [14] procedure was applied. Furthermore, paired z -tests were used to compare the intention to recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis to people in their 60s when they are healthy and when they have co -morbidities. In order to determine which factors contributed most to the prediction of GPs intention to offer additional vaccination and their attitude towards offering additional vaccination other than influenza vaccination to older people, prediction analyses were performed using R andomForest [15]. RandomForest is an algorithm that predicts an outcome (intention, attitude) of an individual by means of several predictor variables (in our case social cognitive factors, b eliefs, practical considerations, demographics and patient population characteristics). The relative importance of the predictor variables is assessed by determining how much the prediction error increases as a result of random permutation of the data for that variable. If a variable does not contribute to the prediction of the outcome, error estimates from the randomly permuted dataset will be about the same as for the original dataset, while prediction errors increase by permuting the data on variables th at are crucial for the prediction of an outcome. 157 8 Results Response and descriptive statistics See Table 2 for demographics and patient population characteristics. Of the total sample, 463 (63.3%) were male, while 55% of the registered GPs ar e male. Participants had a mean age of 51.2 years (range 30 to 70), which was comparable to the mean age of the overall Dutch GP population (48.9 years). Most GPs reported to be part of a shared practice with several GPs (43.5%) or were working in their own practice (34.8%), instead of in a practice integrated into another health care setting (21.2%) or an academic setting (0.3%). On average, the number of patients registered in the practices was 3136 (range 220 to 17000), with an estimated average of 750 patients above the age of 60 (range 0- 4000). The average perceived incidence of the four diseases on a seven point Likert scale was 4.7 for pneumonia, 4.6 for influenza, 4.2 for herpes zoster, and 2.4 for pertussis. GPs ranked the severity of the infectious disease most often as the most important factor for recommending vaccination to people in their 60s (37.6% ranked it as most important), followed by the effectiveness of the vaccine (26.5%) and the expected health benefits for the individual (20.8%). Cost- effectiveness was the least often reported factor for recommending vaccination (43.2% ranked it as least important), followed by the side- effects of the vaccine (17.9%) and during an outbreak of the infectious disease (17.8%). Regarding the question of which vacc ine candidate had the highest chance of being included in a vaccination program, 74.6% GPs chose pneumococcal vaccine, 10.5% herpes zoster vaccine, 4.2% pertussis vaccine, and 10.7% indicated that they considered that none of those vaccine candidates was l ikely to be included. The attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool in general was significantly more positive than the attitude towards offering additional vaccination (M=5.43 vs. M=4.22, t(731)=21.425, p<.001). Correlations between intention and attitude with items of the questionnaire Here we report univariate associations of intention and attitude towards offering additional vaccination with the social cognitive factors, beliefs and practical considerations. In order to avoid false positive results we control the FDR at 5% (Table 3). In total, 134 associations among the 190 associations studied are declared significant at an FDR 5%, which corresponds to about seven or fewer false discoveries among the 134 associations (0.05*134=6.7). Both int ention and attitude to offer additional vaccination showed significant univariate associations with almost all social cognitive factors and practical considerations considered. All associations were positive, except for the associations with selection based on co -morbidity instead of age, the belief that adding additional vaccination will complicate the organization of vaccination, and the belief that additional vaccination should primarily be based on the prevention of death. See additional file 1 for all 190 associations. Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 158 Table 2.

The results suggest that the presence of co -comorbidities increases the intention of GPs to recommend vaccination against the three infectious diseases to people in their 60s. Intention with or without co -morbidities was highest for pneumonia, followed by herpes zoster and pertussis. Prediction analysis Due to missing values, the R andomForest algorithm was performed for 694 participants (see figures 1 and 2). The variables included in the prediction analysis with intention to offer additional vaccination other than influenza as outcome explained 60% of the variance in intention. Attitude toward s offering additional vaccination other than influenza vaccination to older people, the general attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool, the practical consideration of GPs being suitable to administer additional vaccination, and the attitude towards offering older people vaccination during an outbreak of the infectious disease are among those with the largest predictive value for the intention to vaccinate people aged 60 years and older against infectious diseases other than influenza. The variabl es included in the prediction analysis with attitude towards offering additional vaccination as an outcome explained 39% of the variance in attitude. Factors with the largest predictive value for attitude include the selection of vaccination for older individuals on the basis of co -morbidities instead of age, general attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool, the attitude towards offering people aged 80 years and older vaccination, the attitude towards offering older people vaccination during an outbreak of the infectious disease, and the perceived severity of herpes zoster and pneumonia, as well as the prevalence of herpes zoster. 161 8 Figure 1.

On average, GPs seem to be positive about vaccination as a preventive tool in general, but a bit less positive about offering additional vaccination to people aged 60 years and older. Our findings further suggest that GPs are more willing to recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zos ter and pertussis to patients in their 60s when those patients have co -morbidities, with the most positive intention for pneumococcal disease. The attitude of GPs to offer additional vaccination was amongst others predicted by the perceived severity of pneumococcal disease and the perceived severity and prevalence of herpes zoster. Research from the US, Australia and Italy has also shown that GPs had a positive attitude towards recommending influenza and pneumococcal vaccination to older patients and that these diseases were perceived to be serious for older people [17 -20]. Moreover, research from the United States has shown that GPs recommend herpes zoster vaccination less often to their older patients than they do influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [21], despite the recognition of GPs that herpes zoster can cause prolonged suffe ring among older individuals [22]. This is in accordance with our finding that most GPs indicate the pneumococcal vaccine as the one among the three vaccine candidates with the highest chance to be added to the national program, and that only few GPs consider herpes zoster vaccination and pertussis vaccination for inclusion. This is also in line with the estimated disease burden of the respective diseases [23], as well as with the prioritization of Dutch older adults, who had indicated the highest acceptanc e for pneumococcal vaccination and the lowest for pertussis vaccination [11]. Consequently, the intention of Dutch GPs to offer additional vaccination to older people will probably depend on their perceived severity of the diseases and their disease burden. GPs ranked the severity of an infectious disease most frequently as an important argument for offering vaccination to older people, followed by the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the expected health benefits for the individual. Cost-effectiveness was ranked as the least important argument for offering vaccination. Side effects of the vaccine and the outbreak of an infectious disease were also ranked lower in the importance for the decision to offer vaccination. Previous research from the US had shown that beliefs about vaccine effectiveness, the risk for illness, and cost- effectiveness of a vaccine were strongly associated with the recommendation of pneumococcal vaccination by GPs [17]. The selection of vaccination for older individuals based on co -morbidities instead of age, also appeared as one of the main predictors of the attitude of GPs to offer additional vaccination to older people. Although it was difficult to interpret its influence since it shows a negative univariate association with attitud e to offer additional vaccination, we Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 164 think that selection on comorbidity is preferred. The contradiction was very likely due to the way the statement was framed: \"Vaccinating people on the basis of co -morbidities is favored over vaccinating people on the basis of age, irrespective of the infectious disease\" contains a weighing up of two alternatives. In order to better understand this contradiction, we presented this item as two separate statements to a group of GPs (N=99). Results showed that selection of vaccination for older individuals on the basis of co-morbidity was favored over selection on the basis of age. Attitude to offer additional vaccination to people aged 60 years and older other than influenza was further predicted by their general attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool, as well as by their attitude towards offering vaccination to patients in their 80s and during the outbreak of a disease. Moreover, intention was predicted by whether GPs think that they are the suitable professionals to offer additional vaccination to older people. Considering the importance of the role of GPs in expanding the current vaccination program for older people, it is a positive sign that they consider themselves suitable for offering and applying additional vaccination. In the qualitative study preceding this study, GPs explained that they were suitable to implement new vaccination strategies, because of their successful implementation of the influenza vaccination program, their knowledge on the disease histories of their patients, and their role as health educators that are trusted by older patients [12]. Influenza vaccination uptake rates among older people are suboptimal in Europe [24]. Previously reported barriers to administering vaccination to adults have been a lack of physicians' knowledge about vaccination [25], poor vaccine supply [26], cost of vaccinations [27], and practice barriers, such as competing priorities in care especially in the presence of acute or chronic problems [28,29]. The most co mmon barriers for vaccination uptake among patients were a lack of knowledge about the benefits of vaccination [30], concerns about vaccine safety [31,32] and when vaccination is not recommended by physicians [11,32,33]. In the light of our findings, it seems to be especially important to inform GPs about available vaccines for older people and to provide them with evidence- based information on the incidence and severity of the targeted infectious diseases among older people. The finding that GPs have a mor e positive intention to offer pneumococcal, herpes zoster and pertussis vaccination to older patients, when they have co -morbidity is in line with research showing that co - and multi- morbidity lead to higher susceptibility towards infectious diseases in ol der people [4]. However, older age on its own also increases the incidence of serious complications and mortality associated with infection [4,34,35]. Identifying the influence of co -morbidities on the disease burden of infectious diseases poses methodolog ical challenges [23] since data on the occurrence of comorbidity is often missing. Policy advisers should therefore clearly state evidence- based implications, explaining why recommendation of vaccination is based on age rather than on co - morbidity. For example, research has suggested that vaccination against herpes zoster should be focused on specific age groups, since the disease burden was relatively low for 165 8 people aged 50 years and older, but increased considerably for people aged 75 years and older [23] . A limitation that should be mentioned is that the survey length was kept to a minimum and the variables were for the most part measured by one single item, which might have lowered measurement specificity. This was done to achieve a higher response rate. Still, response bias is likely with the low response rate of 6% and we only have limited data to compare participating GPs to the total population of Dutch GPs. Moreover, generalization of the findings to other countries should be treated with caution since vaccination policies, as well as vaccination acceptance differ among countries [36]. Conclusion In conclusion, GPs seem to be positive about offering at least some of the additional vaccinations to older people, when infectious diseases are perceived as severe and prevalent. They also feel suitable to administer additional vaccination. In order to ensure a positive attitude of GPs towards informing about and administering additional vaccinations to older people, they need to have clear guidelines, inc luding evidence- based information about severity and incidence of the diseases, the effectiveness and health benefits of the vaccines, as well as about advising vaccination based on high -risk groups.

Intention of general practitioners to offer more vaccinations 170 171 Chapter 9 General di scussion General discussion 172 Summary of the results The European population is ageing. This will lead to an increase in the proportion of older adults. Consequently, taken into account the gradual deterioration of the immune system, the prevalence of infectious disease will rise among this population, leading to higher burden of disease and associated healthcare costs. Vaccination is one of the measures that might prevent part of this burden. This thesis aims to contribute to the body of work on the willingness of older adults (50 years and over) to accept vaccination. More specifically, it reveals vaccine preferences and acceptance rates for three vaccine candidates (pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis vaccination). In addition, this thesis elaborates on the attitudes and intention of general practitioners towards vaccination for older adults. Such information is crucial to reach acceptance and successful implementation of vaccination aiming to contribute to healthy ageing. In chapter 2, we identified three potential vaccine candidates that might complement the current influenza vaccination program. Based on information on the vaccine availability , the pathogen, disease outcomes and the cost effectiveness of vaccination, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis were selected. C hapter 3 describes a study that estimates the burden of the disease caused by these three infectious diseases in older adults. Influenza was also included. Pneumococcal disease caused the highest burden in older adults, due to the high mortality, followed by influenza, herpes zoster, and pertussis. Using available literature, our next step was to identify key factors that influence the willingness to accept vaccination among older adults. Chapter 4 shows that the two most influential factors in the vaccination d ecision- making process among older adults are (negative) attitudes and beliefs about vaccination in general a nd beliefs about the vaccine characteristics (e.g., vaccination weakens someone's immune system). Recommendations of healthcare workers and the ind ividual's perception of susceptibility to the targeted disease are also of high importance to older adults. The focus group study in chapter 5 shows that the risk of acquiring an infectious disease, vaccine characteristics, the severity and the implications of the infectious disease, previous vaccination experiences, and the general practitioner (GP), were all important in the Dutch older adults' decision whether to accept vaccination or not. These key factors were mostly in line with international literatu re. While vaccinations were found to be important, questions were raised on the usefulness of vaccination at older age. This relates to, for example, the opinion to let nature run its course instead of trying to prevent something that is inevitable (death) . Regarding the general practitioner; two active roles for the general practitioner were identified: leadership and an advisory role. In chapter 6, using discrete choice experiments (DCE), high vaccine effectiveness, high mortality, and high vulnerability were identified as preferences for older adults when considering vaccination. These experiments showed that Dutch older adults preferred protection against the symptoms of pneumococcal disease over protection against the symptoms of influenza. Protection against influenza was preferred over 173 9 herpes zoster and pertussis. Regarding vaccine and disease characteristics, the number of vaccinations needed and the protection against the clinical syndrome of influenza were found more important to people aged 65 year s and older than to people aged between 50 and 65 years. Vaccination acceptance rates for adults aged 50 years and older were estimated at 68% for pneumococcal disease, 58% for herpes zoster and 54% for pertussis vaccination. Estimated vaccination rates fo r persons aged 65 years and older were higher for all vaccinations than for persons aged between 50 -65 years, for example 76% versus 58% for pneumococcal vaccination. The two following studies focused on the attitude and intention of GPs towards expanding vaccination programs, since they have an important role for older adults considering vaccination (Chapter 7 and 8). Chapter 7 describes an interview study revealing that GPs do not necessarily have a positive attitude towards expanding the vaccination prog ram of elderly. Gaining the most health benefits seems to be the most important reason to adhere to expanding vaccination programs. Other factors that matter to the GPs are the severity and the prevalence of the infectious disease. In addition, vaccination should be offered to high -risk groups. Chapter 8 describes a survey among GPs. In this study factors were identified that predicted intention of adults aged 60 years and over to accept vaccination against other diseases than influenza. Factors that had th e highest predictive value were attitude towards offering additional vaccination other than influenza vaccination and towards vaccination as a preventive tool, the practical consideration of GPs being suitable to administer additional vaccination, and the attitude towards offering older people vaccination during an outbreak of an infectious disease. A number of findings deserve to be highlighted in this discussion, as there is new literature or these findings came up across the different studies. Older adu lts seem to value the effectiveness of vaccines highly. From that perspective, it is relevant that recently, there have been developments in vaccine effectiveness for pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster vaccine. The results of the CAPITA study, a random ized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a 13 -valent conjugated vaccine (Prevenar13) were published. The study showed a vaccine effectiveness around 45% in preventing community acquired pneumonia caused by a serotype included in the vaccine and non-bacteremic and non- invasive community -acquired pneumonia. For preventing invasive pneumococcal disease, a vaccine effectiveness of 75% was found. The CAPITA study also showed that the efficacy of the vaccine remained throughout the follow -up for al most 4 years (1). In our study (Chapter 6), we already accounted for a vaccine effectiveness of 50%, therefore this does not change the vaccination uptake estimate for pneumococcal disease. For herpes zoster, a new vaccine is being developed but not yet av ailable. This vaccine is an adjuvant herpes zoster subunit vaccine. Trials with this vaccine in persons aged 50 years and older showed a vaccine efficacy close to 97% for all age groups (50- 59, 60- 69, >70 years) ( 2). This eliminates the differences in vaccine effectiveness in different age- groups as described in the study of Oxman et. al ( 3). This new vaccine has General discussion 174 to be given twice and no severe adverse events were attributed to the vaccine. In addition, it can also be given to immunocompromised patients for whom Zostavax is contra -indicated (2). These new results will influence the acceptance rate, as the current vaccine Zostavax has an effectiveness of around 50%. Using the model of our current discrete choice experiment, the estimated acceptance rate of this new vaccine would be 64% for persons aged 50 years and older instead of 52% with Zostavax 3. Chapter 4, 5 and 6 show that vulnerability to an infectious disease is a reoccurring theme, both among older adults as g eneral practitioners. Vulnerability entails different entities such as perceived health status associated with age and co -morbidity, the risk of acquiring an infectious disease but also the more subjective self -reported health score. Feeling vulnerable was shown to lead to either a higher chance of accepting vaccination to protect oneself or a lower chance because people do not want to stress their body (even more). On the other hand, not feeling vulnerable could lead to either accepting vaccination to stay healthy or not accepting vaccination because one does not perceive any health threat by infectious diseases. In the choice experiment, self -reported health score was identified as a preference actor, meaning that people with a high self -reported health sc ore in comparison to those with low reported health score attach more importance to: 1) vaccine that protects against high mortality infectious diseases 2) a vaccine with 100% effectiveness rate, and 3) a vaccine that has to be given twice. This also stresses the importance of the concept of vulnerability in the acceptance of vaccines in older adults. Another interesting finding, that might be specifically true for the Dutch older adults, is that side effects of the vaccine hardly seem to play a rol e in the acceptation of vaccination. Whereas side effects are an important argument for Dutch parents to decline vaccination in children ( 4), Dutch older adults were found to be more indifferent and accept mild side effects as inevitable part of vaccinatio n. Methodological discussion The overall aim of the studies presented in this thesis was to construct a generic model based on factors affecting the willingness to vaccinate to estimate the acceptance of vaccination against different vaccine preventable diseases among various age groups of elderly. With this model, vaccination acceptance could be estimated when implementing new vaccinations to the older adults. Even though the influenza vaccination is offered to persons aged 60 years and older, we chose to include persons aged 50 years and older as our study population. Vaccinating at this age means vaccinating before the immune system function declines and therefore may have b iological advantages. Vaccinating at an earlier age may result in a stronger immune response and therefore better protection in later life ( 5). To anticipate future developments, we included this younger age group in our studies as well. 3 The vaccine characteristics to estimate the acceptance of the new vaccine are 100% effectiveness and vaccinating twice. All the other remain the same as described in chapter six. 175 9 Questions could b e raised about the studies that were conducted to select the attributes and levels to include in the discrete choice experiment (mainly chapter 4 and 5). Although the literature review offers an extensive overview of the factors related to vaccine uptake o f older adults, including both quantitative and qualitative research, we have included articles in this study that were published over 20 years ago. Views on vaccination as well as public awareness have since changed. Doubts on relevance, however, are unwa rranted, since no distinct differences in factors were identified in the older and newer articles. Regarding the focus group study, questions might be raised on the representativeness of the study population, because care home residents and men in general were underrepresented. In addition, the focus groups were held at a time when the media frequently presented reports on the role of the pharmaceutical industry in the debate about the provision of additional vaccines; we believe this media influence can be considered to be low since mistrust was not identified as a key theme in this study. A particular strength of this study is its open explorative design allowing a wide range of factors to be identified. Taking into account the strengths and limitations, we feel confident that both the literature review and the focus group study form a solid foundation for the subsequent discrete choice study. The interview and the survey performed among general practitioners might be weighed down by their sample sizes, m aking the studies prone to selection bias. F or qualitative studies, the most important criteria to terminate the data collection is reaching saturation, which was reached in the interview study. Nonetheless, the participating GPs might have a particular interest either in research or in (elderly) vaccination, which should be taken into account when interpreting the study results. Nevertheless, we feel confident that these two studies are good starting points for exploring the attitudes and intentions of GP regarding vaccination of the elderly. Regarding the responses collected during the discrete choice experiments, questions can be raised on the validity of this data. It has been mentioned (Chapter 6) that DCEs pose a cognitive burden on the participants. Although we have tried to circumvent this by simplifying the choice tasks as much as possible in the study design, it remains uncertain that respondents actually understood the tasks , even after a pilot study. From the literature, it appears that respondents, instead of using the information from the choice task, base their judgment mainly on their own experiences (possibly taking other factors not mentioned in the choice experiment into account) ( 6). As such, the respondents might not trade- off between attributes and levels of the scenarios in the DC tasks. For example, there could be a difference between reading and imagining the symptoms or experiencing the symptoms yourself. As a consequence, participants with and without prior disease experience may have interpreted the choice situations differently. Information about experienced sickness of the participants would therefore have been useful. This way, we might have identified a sub group of participants that had particular thoughts on vaccination sinc e the different clinical symptoms were identified as significant factors determining vaccine (non)preferences. General discussion 176 Consequently , the coefficients may not reflect the trading off process that older adults engage in when deciding on vaccination. In addition, age has a significant effect on the consistency of completing the choice task, where older participants fail to answer consist ently (7). A more recent study also shows that older adults might not trade- off between choices ( 8). Thus, concerns regarding the validity of discrete choice experiments exist. Discrete choice experiments always reveal preferences of people based on hypot hetical situations reflecting what they presumably would have chosen given the specific scenario. A possible solution to these concerns might be that respondents complete the questionnaire accompanied by a researcher, as suggested in the literature (8). These interviewers can answer questions and help respondents to interpret the attributes and levels and this way guide them through the questionnaire. This gives assurance that respondents interpret the DCE tasks appropriately and consequently, the valid ity of the data is ensured. However, the chance of introducing interviewer bias is present when using different interviewers. Studies have shown that stated preferences could predict actual behavior. Recently, a study has been published investigating the predictive value of DCEs by comparing stated and revealed preferences among parents deciding whether or not to vaccinate their new born child against hepatitis B. It was found that 80% of the actual behavior was predicted by the stated preference DCE ( 9). It should also be mentioned that during our thinking out loud testing, the subjects of various ages found the choice tasks difficult but manageable. More importantly, the estimated vaccination rate of influenza for persons aged 65 years in our study is in line with the actual vaccination uptake in that same year. This supports face validity of the responses. It is difficult to provide generic vaccine acceptance estimations based on the results described in this thesis, specifically the DCE results. The design of the DCE included specific clinical syndromes of the pertaining infectious diseases , consequently, the results might be vaccine -specific. However, the identified relative importance of the different disease and vaccine characteristics provide inform ation on the acceptance of other vaccines than the three included vaccine candidates. For example, the vaccine acceptance will be higher for an infectious disease with high mortality than the vaccine acceptance of a vaccine that protects against an infectious disease with low mortality rates. Also, vaccine acceptance will be higher when vaccine effectiveness is high. This way, a rough estimation can be made on whether vaccines would be accepted in the older adult population. New developments for the current vaccine candidates can be incorporated as well. If a new vaccine is developed that has higher effectiveness, vaccine acceptance will probably increase. 177 9 Implications of this research The estimated vaccine acceptance for the three vaccine candidates indicates that older adults are generally willing to accept vaccination. This implies that older adults would like to know about the available vaccines and therefore active communication on the availability of these vaccines should be initiated. This is independent of actually offering these vaccinations to older adults in a national program. These vaccines may be purchased yet they are not easy accessible. Older adults should have the opportunity to make an (informed) choice concerning their own healthy ageing through vaccination. After all, vaccination could provide health benefits as shown in chapter 2 and 3. This thesis provides opportunities to develop communication strategies to inform older adults about these vaccines. First, it should be acknowledged that vaccine acceptance originates from attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions. Therefore, communication should focus on providing objective information to counter false beliefs and perceptio ns. Second, regarding the content of these communication messages, vaccine effectiveness, mortality rates and susceptibility rates were identified as highly relevant to older adults, therefore the information should focus on these aspects. This way, inform ation can be tailored to the vaccine it concerns by focusing on the most important characteristics. The most apparent example for individual tailoring might be the perceived susceptibility and the actual susceptibility due to immunosenescence. Older adults do not feel at risk for infectious diseases while they in fact are. And feeling at risk is an important factor in accepting vaccination. Vaccine information should therefore convey the biological susceptibility of older adults. In addition to the content of the communication messages, it should be taken into account that age- related views may exist so consequently, personalized information may be most required. These age- related views are reflected in vaccine preference and acceptances rates, the need for vaccination and the perceived severity of infectious diseases. This implies for example that for persons aged 50 to 65 years, it should be acknowledged that com munication should also be focused on maintaining quality of life, while for persons aged 65 yea rs and older, mortality is more important (chapter 6). Finally yet importantly, this thesis also identifies the main sources for presenting the information to the public. It is clear that the GP plays an important role for older adults in the acceptance of a vaccine, more so than friends or family. Therefore, the GP seems to be the most suitable person to inform older adults on these vaccines and vaccination in general. However, chapter 5 shows that also in this case age- related views may exist. While older age group might be more submissive towards the GPs opinion, the younger age group consults the internet for information. This is important because these younger people are the 'elderly of the future'. Special attention is needed to make sure that objectiv e information is easily accessible on the Internet and actively offered by the GP's or institutes like the RIVM to make people aware of the availability of this information. This could be done by spreading information pamphlets on the different vaccinations together with, for example, the invitation for the influenza vaccination. This means that persons aged 60 years and older will get a yearly reminder that other General discussion 178 vaccinations are also available and ensures that these people receive objective information. I n addition, persons that come to the GP's office to get the influenza vaccination can also be actively offered information on other vaccinations by handing out information pamphlets. This is in line with the finding that GP's see themselves as having an important role as advisor of old er adults regarding vaccination. However, although chapter 7 shows that a positive attitude towards prevention in general and vaccination is present among GPs; a positive attitude towards offering older adults more vaccinations is not always obvious. For example, the infectious diseases focused on in this thesis were not found severe enough. GP's furthermore feel less need for younger people and/or healthy perso ns to be vaccinated. A risk assessment based on co -morbidity to identify risk groups in need of vaccination would be more in order. To obtain the cooperation of the GP's, the positive attitudes of GP's should be reinforced and the more negative attitudes should be countered. In chapter 8, it was shown that the attitude of GP's towards extra vaccination was largely predicted by perceptions on different disease characteristics. These perceptions should be either strengthened when these are correct or countered when these are incorrect with evidence based -information, which is also the preference of the GPs themselves. For example, supplementary training could be organized on this subject educating GPs not only on the different vaccines, but also on the willing ness of older adults to facilitate the provision of information to the older adults even more. Future research Future research should focus on the eligibility of the proposed more tailored information provision and the impact of this information on the vaccine acceptance. For this, the influenza vaccination can be used.. Using a randomized controlled design, one group of older adults would receive information focusing on the susceptibility for, and the mortality of influenza. Another group receives the current influenza vaccination information leaflet and a final group receives information on a totally different subject than vaccination. Then, all groups would be offered an influenza vaccination and differences in influenza vaccination uptake would be analyzed. They would also complete a questionnaire including questions on baseline characteristics to compare the groups, and questions on their intention and attitude towards vaccination as well as their opinion on the information provided. For years, there has been some debate concerning the influenza vaccination, therefore it would be best to present the choice sets in a unlabeled form (assigning non- labelled alternatives to the choice set, such as vaccine 1 and vaccine 2) In addition, the theme of the usefulness of vaccination at older age has barely been touched upon and deserves a more detailed investigation. 'Is it not okay to get sick anymore' and 'you have to die of something' were some of the arguments of the older adults for rejecting vaccination. To study this further a more ethical and philosophical approach is required. In- depth -interviews with older adults and general practitioners could be conducted to specifically explore this aspect in more detail. And last, this thesis 179 9 only scratch es the surface of attitudes of GP's regarding expanding older adult vaccination so more in depth research is necessary to understand the viewpoints of the GP's. One interesting idea would be to conduct a choice experiment among GP's to compare their vaccines preferences with the preferences of older adults. And last, if the availability of the more vaccines will be more actively announced, research should focus on the practical implications of this. This concerns for examp le equality in obtaining vaccines and other logistics. Expanded vaccination programs in other countries To date, influenza vaccination is by far the most offered vaccination to elderly in Europe. In The Netherlands it is the only vaccination routinely offered to persons 60 years and older currently. In this thesis, pneumococcal, herpes zoster and pertussis w ere identified as vaccine candidates and vaccine acceptance for these vaccines was estimated. In other European countries, these vaccines are already offered or recommended to (older) adults. In addition, national vaccination programs are organized for pneumococcal vaccination and herpes zoster vaccination in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In Germany, Austria and France, for example, a combined vaccination of Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis every 5 -10 years in adult life is recommended and funded. Herpes zoster vaccination is recommended (but not funded) in Austria and Czech Republic for persons aged 50 years and older. In France and The United Kingdom, this vaccination is recommended and funded for people aged 65 and older, and 70 and older, respectively.. For pneumococcal disease, several forms of recommendations (co -morbidity, catch -up, general recommendation) exist in Europe, including several European countries ( 10). The national pneumococcal vaccination program in the United K ingdom started in August 2013. This program offers pneumococcal vaccination to adults over 65 years and adults aged between 20 -64 years who have been defined as a risk group (11 ). The vaccine used in the UK is the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vacc ine (known as PPV23). The vaccine is given once with no annually repetitions except for individuals with no spleen, splenic dysfunction or chronic renal disease who will require boosters at five year intervals. The GPs are invited to implement the immunization program and upon acceptance, the attending GP will also conduct the influenza vaccination program. The GP's office collects data on vaccine acceptance and refusal (12) . Vaccination coverage (percentage of eligible elderly that received the vaccination) has remain stable over the last years, around 68% ( 13). In September of 2013, The United Kingdom were the first European country to implement a national immunization herpes zoster vaccination program, offering herpes zoster vaccination to all elderly of 70 years and older and catch up vaccination to elderly of 78 years and older. The elderly are invited by their GP's to receive the herpes zoster vaccination when they become eligible ( 12,14) . After the implementation of the immunization program, vaccine u ptake rates were 61.8% in the first year and 55.3% in the second year. Less than 10% of the eligible elderly actively declined the vaccination General discussion 180 (15) . Now, in its third year, a vaccine coverage of 46% is achieved thus far ( 16). This might have to do with the changing health service in the United Kingdom, as an increasing number of private providers might lead to an increase in the mistrust of the public in vaccination campaigns ( 17). Beyond European borders, the United States implemented a herpes zoster vacc ination program in 2007 for adults aged 60 years and older. In 2007, a vaccination uptake of 1.9% was estimated but this steadily increased to 27.1% in 2014 ( 18,19) . In 2014, pneumococcal vaccination was recommended for all adults aged 65 years and older. The vaccination uptake for adults aged 65 and older was 61.3 % in 2014 for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV 13) (19) . Comparing our estimated vaccination rates to the uptake in the discussed countries, our estimates are higher. For pneumococcal disease, our estimated vaccination rate for persons aged 65 years and older is 76.2% compared to 61.3% in the United States and 68% in the United Kingdom. The same is the case for herpes zoster vaccination; 68% versus 27% in United States and 46% in the United Kingdom. This suggests that our estimates might be too high, but a comparison of influenza vaccination rates between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands shows that vaccination uptake can also be higher in the United Kingdom (71% vs 65% in the Netherlands) ( 10,20 ). In the Netherlands, the Health Council of the Netherlands has published her advice regarding herpes zoster vaccination and came to the conclusion that routine vaccination of elderly with the currently available vaccine(s) is not warranted. Reasons for this were that shingles does not pose a threat to society and the vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection were deemed insufficient. Should the new vaccine (discussed earlier) get market authorization and show high efficacy, the advice of the Health Council may be reconsidered (21). The Health Council of the Netherlands currently debates vaccination against pneumococcal disease for the elderly. Pertussis vaccination for older adults is currently not a priority. For the influenza vaccination, the most recent updates on the vaccine uptake show that acceptance is decreasing in the age group of persons aged 60 - 64 years old. This has been the case for several years know ( 20). Looking at the results of our studies, this might be because thes e older adults do not feel vulnerable for influenza. Healthy ageing and vaccination: challenges remaining Considering vaccination as a measure to contribute to ' Healthy Ageing' poses more challenges than the acceptance of this measure. First, there is the clinical or biological aspect of vaccinating elderly. The immunosenescence which has been discussed several times in this thesis does not only lead to an increased vulnerability to infectious disease, it has consequences for the immune response induced by vaccines. It affects both innate and adaptive immunity, limiting the respo nse to pathogens and to vaccines (22). For example, in children, a vaccine effectiveness of 90% or higher is common, while the vaccine effectiveness in elderly is more commonly around 50%. This reduced 181 9 effectiveness is especially important since older adul ts' value vaccine effectiveness highly. In addition, elderly are a more frail population, often being excluded from clinical trials testing new vaccines. This leads to a lack of evidence to inform immunization policy for this growing demographic group ( 23). More vaccination studies, looking specifically at this subgroup of the population might therefore be relevant. Besides the lack of knowledge, a paradigm shift might be required as suggested by Macntyre. The waning efficacy of vaccines should be consider ed in the light of the increasing disease incidence. In other words, if a vaccine is 50% effective, it still prevents 50% of the disease cases ( 23). And what is the relevance of reduced vaccine efficacy if levels of protection drop only after 10 years when life-expectancy is also 10 years? The focus on preventing disease completely might therefore be not realistic and a shift in focus reducing early mortality and morbidity might be required. General conclusion This thesis gives insights into the willingness of older adults to receive vaccination. It is apparent that the decision of older adults to accept vaccination is not based on a single argument but on multiple arguments. Most certainly, a part of the older adult population will base their decision mostly on the opinion of the GP. However, the rest will weigh the pros and cons, taking their perceived vulnerability, the vaccine effectiveness and severity of the infectious disease into account. Overall, older adults are willing to accept vaccination. Considering the studies in this thesis, pneumococcal vaccination will be the vaccination with the highest acceptance. Herpes vaccination follows in second place and pertussis in last place. However, this thesis also shows that individual differences exist in accepting vaccination. These differences are most apparent when looking at the age of the older adults, their influenza vaccination status and their self -perceived health. Therefore, it is of the utmost importanc e to focus on tailored information when implementing new vaccines to achieve the highest vaccination uptake possible in an effort to contribute to healthy ageing.

General discussion 184 185 Summary The willingness of older adults to receive vaccination Summary 186 Vaccines have been very successful in preventing infectious diseases. Since the implementation of routine vaccination of children, incidences of childhood diseases and mortality have reduced significantly. Next, a new and vulnerable target population received increased attention in the Netherlands. As a result, the National Influenza Prevention Program was implemented in 1997, offering influenza vaccination to persons aged 65 years and older (from 2007 persons aged 60 years and older) and certain risk groups to prevent associated complications and mortality of influenza. Life expectancy has over the course of 150 years risen spectacularly in most European countries and will keep rising which r esult s in a increasing size and proportion of the population 50 years and older. This population is more susceptible to infectious diseases because of immunosenescence, co -morbidity and general frailty. Thus, to promote healthy aging, vaccination against other vaccine- preventable- diseases could be a strategy. In addition to its possible individual benefits, vaccination may also yield social benefits, for example lower overall cost of healthcare. Assessment vaccine cand idates In chapter 2, we assessed herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease, pertussis and hepatitis A vaccines according to a previously formulated set of criteria for additions to a national immunization programme. Herpes zoster, pneumococcal disease and pertussis are common among persons aged 50 and older in t he Netherlands. In the futur e, older adults will become more susceptible to hepatitis A, because fewer persons will have acquired natural immunity through exposure. For each of these infectious diseases, a vaccine is available, although its effectiveness varies and it may not be spec ifically registered for the elderly population. Whereas vaccination might have consequences for the virulence by serotype replacement or antigenic changes and prevalence of pneumococcal disease and pertussis, it could lower the disease burden and reduce healthcare costs. Currently, only vaccination against herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease appear to be cost- effective. Considering the incidence and the crude estimated burden of these diseases, prevention of pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster might w arrant higher priority than prevention of pertussis and hepatitis A. We conclude that vaccination may improve the health of the elderly population and identified pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis vaccination as candidate vaccines. However, our review shows that there are still gaps in our knowledge, and therefore an accurate judgement about its potential impact remains difficult. More research is needed to determine how vaccination can most effectively improve the health of the growing popul ation 50 years and older. We therefore estimated the burden of disease of pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertussis and influenza, specifically for persons aged 50 years and older in chapter 3 . The average annual disease burden for these four diseases in the Netherlands was estimated for the period 2010 -2013 using the disability -adjusted life year (DALY) measure. Disease models and parameters were obtained from previous research. Where possible these models were adapted specifically for older adults and applied age- specific parameters derived from literature. The disease burden based on these adapted models 187 and parameters was compared with the disease burden based on the general population models. Among older adults, the disease burden in the period 201 0-2013 was highest for pneumococcal disease, mostly because of high mortality, followed by influenza. Disease burden of herpes zoster and pertussis was relatively low and consisted mostly of years lived with disability. B etter information on the course of infectious diseases and long -term consequences would enable more accurate estimation of disease burden in older adults. The willingness of older adults to receive vaccination For any vaccination program to be successful in a given population, acceptance of vaccines is crucial. The aim of this thesis was to identify prominent factors that play a role in the vaccination decision- making process and to determine the relative import ance of these identified factors. In order to gain insight in the willingness of older adults to receive vaccination pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis, chapter 4 describes a literature review to identify all relevant factors related to vac cine uptake for persons aged 60 years and older in relevant literature databases. We identified six main themes that influence the willingness to be vaccinated: 1) attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination in general; 2) perceived risk and severity; 3) vaccine characteristics; 4) advice and information; 5) general health -related behavior; and 6) accessibility and affordability. The most prevalent determinants in the literature are related to attitudes and beliefs, vaccine characteristics, recommendations of healthcare workers, and perceived susceptibility. In addition, qualitative research was conducted to elucidate the motives of Dutch persons aged 50 years for accepting vaccination. Chapter 5 describes the results of 13 focus groups with Dutch older adults receding in different living arrangements. The transcripts were analyzed according the principles of thematic survey. By an inductive process, main themes and related subthemes were extracted from the responses. Eight themes were found to play an im portant role in accepting vaccination: 1) healthy aging; 2) usefulness of vaccination in older age; 3) risk of getting an infectious disease; 4) vaccine characteristics; 5) severity of the disease and its implications; 6) the experiences of previous vaccin ations; 7) the influence of healthcare workers and other people; 8) and the need for information. The most important one appears to be the risk of getting an infectious disease. From the previous two discussed studies, it can be concluded that different factors play a role in the vaccination decision making of older adults. Chapter 6 determines the relative importance of vaccine and disease specific characteristics and acceptance for Dutch older adults, including pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, pertuss is vaccination, and influenza vaccination. Based on the literature review and the focus group study, we identified 6 factors to be included in a discrete choice experiment study to determine the relative importance of these 6 factors. These factors were: the clinical syndrome, the mortality rate, the vaccine effectiveness, the side effects, the risk of Summary 188 getting the disease (or vulnerability) and the number of vaccinations that need to be given. The study generated choice data that was analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit statistical model . Using this model, the vaccine uptake of the included vaccines (pneumococcal, herpes zoster, pertussis and influenza vaccination) could also be estimated. Older adults were invited by sending a questionnaire and information letter. The response rate amounted to 41% (735 older adults). Of the included factors, high mortality risk of the infectious disease (20%) , high susceptibility of getting the infectious disease (100%) , and high vaccine effectiveness (100%) were found to be most important for vaccine acceptance. Age, having received influenza vaccination in 2013 and self -perceived health score were identified as individual factors that affect these vaccine preferences. Persons who received the flu vaccination in 2013 reported a higher preference for vaccination against the clinical syndromes of influenza compared to pertussis and herpes zoster compared to persons that did not receive the influenza vaccination in 2013. Persons with a higher self -rated health score attribu ted more importance to a vaccine that protects against an infectious disease with a 20% mortality rate, a vaccine with 100% effectiveness and a vaccine that has to be given twice in comparison to persons with a lower self -reported health score. Potential v accination rates of older adults were estimated at 68% for pneumococcal vaccination, 58% for herpes zoster vaccination and 54% for pertussis and influenza vaccination. For persons aged 50 -65, potential vaccination rates were estimated at 58% for pneumococc al vaccination, 50% for herpes zoster vaccination, 44% for pertussis vaccination and 42% for influenza vaccination. For persons aged 65 and older, these were 76%, 68%, 58% and 66%. respectively. These results suggest that older adults are most likely to ac cept pneumococcal vaccination of the three candidate vaccines. In addition, the information that accompanies the implementation of a new vaccine has to be tailored for the individual and the vaccine it concerns. Special attention is needed to ensure high u ptake among persons aged 50 -65 years. The attitude of the general practitioner on adult vaccination From the previous studies, it also became apparent that the general practitioner plays an important role in vaccination decision making of older adults. I n The Netherlands and other countries, the general practitioner's office is the central location for organizing these immunization campaigns. The general practitioner (GP) (together with the practice nurse) selects, invites, and vaccinates the target popul ation, accounting for 95% of all vaccinations administered to risk groups. Consequently, the feasibility of extending current programmes depends on the willingness of the GPs to organize and endorse these campaigns. Therefore, we explored the Dutch GPs' attitudes regarding older adult vaccination in general and their attitudes regarding the incorporation of additional vaccines in the current Dutch influenza vaccination programme. Chapter 7 and 8 focus on adults aged 60 years and older, as the influenza vacc ination program is offered to this target population. In these studies, the included vaccines were pneumococcal disease, herpes z oster, pertussis and influenza vaccination. Chapter 7 describes a qualitative 189 study were ten Dutch GPs (five men and five women) were interviewed that worked either in an academic hospital, in a practice based in a health centre, or in individual practice. Transcripts were again analysed according to thematic analysis. GPs perceived preventio n as part as their job and believed vaccination to be effective for preventing infectious diseases. However, influenza vaccination was not always perceived as effective. Doubts regarding the usefulness of additional vaccinations were identified. If additio nal vaccines would be offered, this should be based on scientific evidence and the severity of the infectious disease. Selection of patients for vaccination should not be based solely on age, but more on risk factors. The GP indicated that they should be the central point of contact for new vaccination campaigns. However, high workload was seen as a concern and s everal GPs questioned whether they could actually refuse to conduct the vaccination program when it is implemented. We concluded that a positive attitude towards implementing additional vaccinations is not apparent. Achieving the most health benefits seems to be the most important consideration of Dutch GPs regarding vaccinating older adults. In order to confirm these results among a wider range of GP's, a questionnaire was designed based on the findings of the qualitative study and send online to all general practitioners' offices in the Netherlands (chapter 8) Using RandomForrest analysis, the most important factors were identified that predict the intention of general practitioners to give additional vaccination and their attitude towards expanding older adult vaccination. In total, 723 GP's filled in the questionnaire (response rate of 6%). T he intention of GPs to offer additional vaccination to p eople aged 60 years and older other than influenza vaccination was mainly predicted by their attitude towards offering additional vaccination, their attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool in general, and their attitude towards offering vaccination during the outbreak of an infectious disease. The factors with the largest predictive value for attitude include the selection of vaccination for older individuals on the basis of co -morbidities instead of age, general attitude towards vaccination as a preventive tool, the attitude towards offering people aged 80 years and older vaccination, the attitude towards offering older people vaccination during an outbreak of the infectious disease, and the perceived severity of herpes zoster and pneumonia, as well as the prevalence of herpes zoster. On average, GPs seem to be positive about vaccination as a preventive tool in general, but a bit less positive about offering additional vaccination to people aged 60 years and older. Our findings further suggest that GPs are more willing to recommend vaccination against pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and pertussis to patients in their 60s when those patients have co -morbidities, with the most positive intention for pneumococcal disease. Summary 190 Conclusion The studies presented in this thesis g ive insights in the willingness of older adults to receive vaccination and the importance of adult vaccination. It is apparent that the decision of older adults to accept vaccination is not based on a single argument but o n multiple arguments. Most certain, a part of the older adult population will typically base their decision on the opinion of the GP. However, the remaining part of people will weigh the pros and cons, taking their perceived vulnerability, the vaccine effectiveness and severity of the infectious disease into account. Overall, older adults are willing to accept vaccination. Considering the studies in this thesis, pneumococcal vaccination will be the vaccination with the highest acceptance. Herpes vaccination follows in second place and pertussis in last place. However, this thesis also shows that individual differences exist in accepting vaccination. This relates to the age of the person that would receive the vaccination, their influenza vaccination status and their self -perceived health. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to focus on tailored information when implementing new vaccines to achieve the highest vaccination uptake possible in an effort to contribute to healthy ageing. 191 Samenvatting De vaccinatiebereidheid van 50 -plussersSamenvatting Nederland is door invoering van het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma op basis van een literatuur analyse aan de infectieziekten is de werkzaamheid vaccins. overtuigingen ten opzicht van vaccinatie in het algemeen; 2) de veronderstelde kans op ziekte en ernst van de ziekte; 3) 4) advies informatie; acht: vatbaarheid voor de infectieziekte; 4) nst van de ziekte en de consequenties ervan; 6) de ervaringen met vorige 7) spelen in de beslissing 50 -plusse r om vaccinatie te accepteren.
