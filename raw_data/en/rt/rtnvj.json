Here's what you need to know.", "sitename": "The Journal News", "date": "2021-07-27", "cleaned_text": "Think the pandemic is over? What to know about the highly contagious delta variant Just when many people thought we were getting ahead of the COVID-19 virus outbreak and could relax, highly-transmissible variants have surged up among unvaccinated people and caused hospitalizations to spike. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [is expected to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with high transmission](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/07/27/covid-vaccine-variant-hospitalization-children-mask-mandates/5380480001/) as COVID-19 cases continue to rise and vaccination rates wane, according to media reports Tuesday. The guideline change comes a few days after Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief COVID-19 medical adviser, said the agency was reexamining mask recommendations for fully vaccinated Americans. \"We're going in the wrong direction,\" Fauci told CNN's anchor Jake Tapper on Sunday. As of July 20, the more-contagious delta variant made up 83% of all U.S. cases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said [in a Senate committee hearing last week](https://www.c-span.org/video/?513400-1/senate-hearing-covid-19-response). In the week prior, the delta variant was responsible for just 50% of new cases. \"In some parts of the country the percentage is even higher, particularly in areas of low vaccination rates,\" Walensky said. It's meant that COVID cases in New York, still relatively small compared to last winter, are heading in the wrong direction as health officials raise growing concerns that the coronavirus is far from being eradicated. [In New York, new COVID cases grew by 51%](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2021/07/26/covid-cases-new-york-rise-check-county/47947263/) in the week ending Sunday, rising to 9,352 cases. In fact, New York had nearly 2,000 new COVID cases on Sunday for the first time since mid-May, state records show, in part as the Delta variant continues to grow. On Monday, Monroe County health officials announced [there had been 222 new confirmed COVID cases](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2021/07/27/monroe-county-covid-positivity-rate-new-cases-vaccinations/5383410001/) in the previous week. There were 139 positive cases in the previous week's report. There had been just 72 new cases locally during the last week of June. Unvaccinated people are most at risk, the CDC said, but vaccines aren't 100% effective. As cases continue to rise, here are some of your questions about the delta variant, answered. What is the delta variant? Variants occur when a virus mutates, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Some variations allow the virus to spread more easily or make it resistant to treatments or vaccines. The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (delta) variant emerged in India and was first diagnosed in the U.S. in Oklahoma in April 2021. Since then it has been spreading rapidly and now makes up the majority of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. Is the delta variant more dangerous? It's definitely easier to spread and catch. \"In a completely unmitigated environment\u2014where no one is vaccinated or wearing masks\u2014it's estimated that the average person infected with the original coronavirus strain will infect 2.5 other people,\" [Dr. F. Perry Wilson, a Yale Medicine epidemiologist, told Yale Medicine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid). \"In the same environment, delta would spread from one person to maybe 3.5 or 4 other people.\" According to the CDC, there is \"evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures,\" associated with the delta variant. So far there is no definite study on whether delta will make you sicker. Early information from a [Scotland study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext) suggested the delta variant was twice as likely to result in hospitalization in unvaccinated people but this hasn't been confirmed. Are COVID delta symptoms different? There have been reports of different symptoms. Classic cold symptoms such as headaches, a sort throat and a runny nose are more frequently reported with delta. Loss of taste and smell \u2014 prevalent in earlier strains of the virus \u2014 are also less likely to occur, at least as early onset symptoms. If the infection progresses into a serious case, though, every symptom can come back into play. The delta variant is also more likely to lead to \"long COVID,\" the mysterious ailment in which people experience a variety of symptoms for weeks or even months at a time, according to Abbott and Deaconess Health Systems President Dr. James Porter. Differences in symptoms could also be due to the younger average age of unvaccinated people. How do I avoid getting COVID from the delta variant? Get vaccinated. Get your family and friends vaccinated. \"There is a clear message that is coming through,\" Walensky said at a press briefing. \"This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk, and communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well.\" Which vaccine is the most effective against the delta variant? Reports and preliminary studies have shown the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines may be slightly lower against the delta variant. Many of the studies have yet to be peer-reviewed. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which require two shots, are 94-95% effective in preventing infection from the original COVID strain. The Johnson & Johnson shot, which is a once-and-done shot, is 66.3% effective in preventing infection. All three are nearly 100% in preventing hospitalization and death. But one study from Israel found that the [Pfizer vaccine was 64% effective against the delta variant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-05/israel-sees-decline-in-pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-rate-ynet-says). Another study \u2014 more recent, but not yet peer-reviewed \u2014 shows the [ Pfizer vaccine is 88% effective against the delta variant](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/5-things-to-know-delta-variant-covid) and 96% effective against hospitalization from delta after two doses, according to a Public Health England analysis, Yale Medicine reported. Moderna, in a study not yet peer-reviewed, said its vaccine is effective against the delta variant, Yale Medicine said. And a [new study from bioRhiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452771v1) says that people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may need a second dose, ideally the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. This study has not been peer-reviewed or published, but it matches [studies of the AstraZeneca vaccine](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses) that concludes one dose is 33% effective against symptomatic disease of the delta variant and 60% effective against the variant after the second dose. \"The message that we wanted to give was not that people shouldn't get the J.&J. vaccine, but we hope that in the future, it will be boosted with either another dose of J.&J. or a boost with Pfizer or Moderna,\" Nathaniel Landau, a virologist at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine who led the study, told The New York Times. The results contradict studies published by Johnson & Johnson that say a single dose of their vaccine is effective against the variant. Pfizer has announced that a booster shot of their vaccine strongly extends protection, and they are developing a vaccine targeted directly at the delta variant, but so far the FDA and CDC have said that booster shots are not necessary. Can I still get COVID after being vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective. In a best-case scenario with a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, which are 95% effective, five in every 100 people would still be vulnerable. It's also possible to contract COVID between the first and second shots, or right after the second shot. Vaccines work, broadly speaking, by teaching your body how to fight off specific infections, essentially giving your immune system a big head start. That doesn't happen as soon as the needle goes in. Nicole Iovine, an infectious disease expert and hospital chief epidemiologist at University of Florida Health, said it takes the average person 10 to 14 days after the second shot (or the one Johnson & Johnson shot) to build up a protective number of antibodies, but each person is different. Any individual person may make an immune response faster or slower than average, she said. Can you get the COVID vaccine while you have COVID? According to the CDC, [you shouldn't](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=No.%20People%20with%20COVID,criteria%20before%20getting%20vaccinated.). They advise that you wait until you have recovered and have met the [criteria for discontinuing isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html), even if you're symptom-free. This also applies if you contracted COVID between the first and second doses of vaccine. Does a COVID-19 test detect the delta variant? The [delta variant has distinctive biological markers](https://fortune.com/2021/06/30/covid-delta-variant-tests-detection/) that some COVID-19 tests might not be able to detect, according to Fortune. How do you test for the delta variant? A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is more likely to detect the delta variant than a COVID-19 test, according to Fortune. Fortune reported that companies are creating rapid tests to detect the delta variant without the need for a PCR test. Should I start wearing a mask again? If you are around people who are immunocompromised or children too young to be vaccinated, or if you live or travel in an area with low vaccination rates, you may want to hang on to your mask for awhile longer. Masks are much less common than they were a few months ago after the [CDC relaxed its stance on masks in May](/story/news/health/2021/04/27/cdc-guidelines-say-vaccinated-people-dont-need-wear-masks-outside/7395850002/). But the CDC's update was based on rising immunity levels and plunging cases at the time. Wearing a mask on top of being vaccinated is the safest way to avoid getting infected. And you may be infected but not showing symptoms, which means you could easily pass on the virus to someone who is unvaccinated or someone whose weakened immune system prevented them from getting full protection from the vaccine. Vaccines are \"brilliantly successful\" at preventing hospitalization, but they're not as perfect at preventing disease transmission, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. People who are vaccinated have a low risk of getting sick themselves and can cut down on the risk of transmitting the virus to someone else by wearing a mask, he said.
