Recently, application of herbal formulations has gained importance in treating complex diseases. Therefore, this study explores the efficacy of tri-herbal medicine Divya Sarva-Kalp-Kwath (SKK; brand name, Livogrit) in treating free fatty acid (FFA)-induced steatosis in human liver (HepG2) cells and rat primary hepatocytes. Previously, we demonstrated that cytosafe SKK ameliorated CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the role of SKK in reducing FFA-induced cell-death, and steatosis in HepG2 through analysis of cell viability, intracellular lipid and triglyceride accumulation, extracellular free glycerol levels, and mRNA expression changes. Plant metabolic components fingerprinting in SKK was performed via High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC). Treatment with SKK significantly reduced the loss of cell viability induced by 2 mM-FFA in a dose-dependent manner. SKK also reduced intracellular lipid, triglyceride accumulation, secreted AST levels, and increased extracellular free glycerol presence in the FFA-exposed cells. SKK normalized the FFA-stimulated overexpression of SREBP1c, FAS, C/EBP, and CPT1A genes associated with the induction of steatosis. In addition, treatment of rat primary hepatocytes with FFA and SKK concurrently, reduced intracellular lipid accumulation. Thus, SKK showed efficacy in reducing intracellular triglyceride accumulation and increasing extracellular glycerol release, along with downregulation of related key genetic factors for FFA-associated steatosis.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-10-21", "cleaned_text": "and Extracellular Glycerol Levels [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25204849](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25204849) often originates from high-fat diet intake and metabolic disorders leading to excessive deposition of lipids and triglycerides (TGs) in the hepatocytes of patients [ [2](#B2-molecules-25-04849), [3](#B3-molecules-25-04849)]. Free fatty acids (FFAs) in the diet also increase levels of ceramides, which are known to be involved in several pathways linked to inflammation, apoptosis, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and progression of steatosis [ [4](#B4-molecules-25-04849)]. Prolonged persistence of steatosis may lead to the development of hepatic fibrosis and other non-hepatic (cardiovascular, cancer, and neurological) health complications. While the global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease might be near to a billion cases, the prevailing variety in the pathological manifestation of steatosis disease leads it to be rather under-reported [ [5](#B5-molecules-25-04849)]. Palmitic acid and monounsaturated oleic acid represents the two most abundant FFA present in high-fat diets [ [6](#B6-molecules-25-04849)]. Intake of high levels of oleic acid and palmitic acids from food sources has been shown to induce steatosis in hepatocytes of process palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) [ [16](#B16-molecules-25-04849)]. For retaining normoglycemic conditions, the liver tends to metabolize excess glucose to FFA through the process of de novo lipogenesis involving activation of transcriptional factors and lipogenic genes [ [17](#B17-molecules-25-04849)]. This FFA accounts for 26% of total stored triglycerides in hepatocytes [ [17](#B17-molecules-25-04849)]. Herbal formulations have been observed to inhibit triglyceride formation through SREBP1c and C/EBP pathways [15](#B15-molecules-25-04849), [18](#B18-molecules-25-04849)]. [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. These plant metabolites have been found to have hepatoprotective effects. For example, B. diffusa L. plant extract can modulate liver injury in animals through a reduction of cytochrome enzyme activities [ [20](#B20-molecules-25-04849)]. P. niruri sensu Hook. f. glycosides, alkaloids injuries through amelioration of oxidative stress [ [27](#B27-molecules-25-04849), [28](#B28-molecules-25-04849)]. In our previous study, we performed a detailed chemical analysis of SKK by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Liquid Chromatography based-Mass Spectroscopy. We have reported the presence of plant gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, quercetin, catechin, and corilagin as marker components originating from its herbal components [ [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. We have shown that SKK exhibited hepatoprotective effect in Wistar rats and HepG2 cells against Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) induced toxicity and inflammation [ [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. Fingerprinting of Divya 1](#molecules-25-04849-f001)). acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, catechin, rutin, and corilagin. These plant metabolites also identified using liquid chromatography-based mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques in our previously published study [ [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. Chromatogram analysis showed all plant metabolites of SKK were well separated without any tail or diffuseness ( [Figure 1](#molecules-25-04849-f001)A-D). Maximum retention factor (Rf) values obtained for the different plant metabolite marker compounds G1 and G2). No band intensity or position variations were observed in both replicates of SKK showing the robustness of the plant metabolites. The amount of total polyphenols present in SKK, obtained using the Folin-Ciocalteu method was 4.22% w/w. Based upon HPTLC fingerprinting and phenolic content analysis, we reaffirmed the chemical constituents of SKK. 2.2. SKK Modulates HepG2 Cell Viability [Figure to 2 mM FFA acid (O): 1.32 mM and palmitic acid (P): 0.66 mM) induced a significant (p value < 0.05) loss of cell viability (70.3% \u00b1 5.1%) after 48 h treatment ( [Figure of HepG2 cells with varying concentrations of SKK showed a significant (10 \u00b5g/mL: p value < 0.05 and 30 \u00b5g/mL: p value < 0.001) dose-dependent hepatoprotective ( [Figure 2](#molecules-25-04849-f002)B). These preliminary results indicated a protective role for SKK against FFA-induced toxicity without inducing any other observable side effects like a decrease in cell viability or metabolic impairment. 2.3. SKK Inhibits Intracellular Lipid Accumulation [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)A). This was measured using neutral lipid-binding oil red 'O' (ORO) dye. Other combinations of oleic acid and palmitic acid did not induce any sizable changes in intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells ( [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)A). Qualitative analysis of lipid accumulation in the HepG2 using ORO dye showed that cells treated with varying doses of SKK up to the highest therapeutic dose did not show any change in intracellular lipid accumulation compared to the normal control ( [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)Bi,ii). However, cells treated with 2 mM FFA showed a significant increase in the intracellular lipid accumulation indicating the onset of steatosis (as seen in [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)Biii). Pretreatment of the HepG2 cells with varying concentrations of SKK (3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL) considerably reduced the FFA-induced accumulation of intracellular lipids in the cells ( [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)Biv,v,vi). Quantitative measurement of the ORO dye accumulation using a multiplate reader confirmed the visual observations ( [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)B,C). Results showed that pretreatment of HepG2 cells with SKK (0, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL) significantly (p value < 0.01) reduced the 2 mM FFA-induced lipid accumulation in the HepG2 cells ( [Figure 3](#molecules-25-04849-f003)C). Interestingly, SKK showed similar effects in reducing FFA-stimulated intracellular lipid accumulation at all the tested concentrations. 2.4. SKK Moderates Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) Release, Intracellular Triglyceride, and Extracellular Glycerol Levels [29](#B29-molecules-25-04849)]. In our study, a significant (p value < 0.05) increase in levels of AST levels was observed in HepG2 cells treated with 2 mM FFA (2.5 \u00b1 0.2 fold) compared to untreated controls ( [Figure 4](#molecules-25-04849-f004)A). This FFA stimulated increase in AST level was significantly (p value < 0.05) reduced to normal levels upon treatment with 30 \u00b5g/mL of SKK ( [Figure 4](#molecules-25-04849-f004)A). The intracellular triglyceride synthesis three of FFA and one molecule of glycerol [ [30](#B30-molecules-25-04849)]. Hence, the induction of steatosis in the hepatocytes is accompanied by intracellular increase in triglyceride levels and reduced extracellular levels of free glycerol molecules. HepG2 cells treated with 2 mM FFA showed a significant (p value < 0.05) increase in the intracellular storage of triglycerides levels (157.5 \u00b1 49.9 \u00b5g/mg) untreated cells ( [Figure Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with varying concentrations of SKK (0, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL) significantly reduced the intracellular accumulation of triglycerides (52.85 \u00b5g/mg) stimulated by exposure ( [Figure 4](#molecules-25-04849-f004)B). Quantification of the free glycerol levels in the cell culture media, using the GC-MS method showed a significant reduction in the presence of glycerol levels in the FFA-treated HepG2 cell culture media, compared to media obtained from untreated cells, as per the area under the curve (AUC; [Figure 4](#molecules-25-04849-f004)Ci,ii). Normalization of the glycerol contents based on individual sample protein content showed the presence of 53.07 \u00b1 11.5 \u00b5g glycerol per mg protein in the cell culture media obtained from untreated cells. This glycerol level was reduced to 22.8 \u00b1 4.4 \u00b5g per mg protein in the cell culture media obtained from 2 mM FFA-treated HepG2 ( [Figure SKK (0-30 \u00b5g/mL) significantly recovered the extracellular levels of free molecules compared to FFA exposed cells ( [Figure 4](#molecules-25-04849-f004)Ciii,iv,v,D). The results showed modulation of liver injury and lipolysis process by SKK in the hepatocytes stimulated with high FFA exposure. 2.5. Genomic Level Changes Induced by SKK in the In Vitro Steatosis Model [Figure 5](#molecules-25-04849-f005)A-D). Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with varying of significantly ameliorated the did exhibit a concentration-dependent effect. Heat-map analysis of the mRNA expression showed 2 mM FFA categorically stimulated an increase in mRNA expression back to normal levels in HepG2 cells following prophylactic treatment with SKK. 2.6. Intracellular Lipid Accumulation in the FFA Stimulated Rat Primary Hepatocytes [Figure 6](#molecules-25-04849-f006)). Concurrent treatment of the primary hepatocytes with SKK provided significant protection against FFA induced intracellular lipid accumulations leading to normalization of the intracellular lipid contents ( [Figure 6](#molecules-25-04849-f006)). 3. Discussion [31](#B31-molecules-25-04849)]. Recent studies have shown that polyherbal formulations have equivalent efficacy to their allopathic counterparts in healing diseases without causing any side effects [ [32](#B32-molecules-25-04849), [33](#B33-molecules-25-04849), [34](#B34-molecules-25-04849)]. Therefore, herbal formulations such as Divya Sarva-Kalp-Kwath (SKK) marketed under its brand name 'Livogrit' is considered as an alternative therapeutic intervention against steatosis. [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. Hence, in the present study, the same plant metabolic compounds were analyzed using the HPTLC as a quality check for SKK. HPTLC findings indicated that these markers were amply present in the SKK formulation. Initial cell viability screening of the SKK showed them to be cytosafe in the human HepG2 cells with an the FFA-induced cell-death the HepG2 cells. A similar protective response of SKK was earlier observed by us in HepG2 cells treated with carbon tetrachloride [ [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. Plant quercetin, rutin, corilagin, and caffeic acid play a major role in the hepatoprotective role of SKK against a wide range of extracellular lipid levels decrease in the glycerol level are the hallmarks of steatosis ailment [ [41](#B41-molecules-25-04849)]. Studies on steatosis seldom emphasize the diet-related increase in hepatic lipids and remain largely focused on the transcriptional segment of fatty acid synthesis enzymes. In our present study, we selected and utilized 2 mM concentration of FFA for induction of steatosis, as other extracellular FFA concentrations did not induce a sizable fat accumulation in the HepG2 cells, under present experimental conditions. The observations are in line with the previous works of Lech\u00f3n et al. and Ricchi et al. [ [11](#B11-molecules-25-04849), [13](#B13-molecules-25-04849)]. Therefore, this in vitro model might closely resemble the liver ailment conditions observed clinically in patients. [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849), [42](#B42-molecules-25-04849)]. In parallel, SKK also increased the presence of extracellular free glycerol molecules. These observations suggest that SKK modulated the process of triglyceride synthesis [ [43](#B43-molecules-25-04849)]. Polyphenol extracts obtained from S. nigrum and P. niruri has shown a protective effect against high fat diet-induced the development of steatosis along with reduced mitochondrial energy metabolism. In our study, HepG2 cells exposed to FFA showed upregulation in the mRNA expression of SREBP1c, C/EBP, FAS, and genes. of HepG2 with SKK downregulated overexpressed This observed downregulation of SREBP1c and C/EBP by SKK might be directly related to the regulation of the AMPK protein phosphorylation, protecting against the progression of [48](#B48-molecules-25-04849), [50](#B50-molecules-25-04849)]. Kaempferol, a plant metabolite belonging to B. diffusa has been found to modulate the AMPK/mTOR pathway, an upstream regulator of SREPB-1c cleavage and activation in RIN-5F cells cells [ [51](#B51-molecules-25-04849)]. C/EBP is upregulated in the liver of obese and aged mice leading to steatosis [ [52](#B52-molecules-25-04849), [53](#B53-molecules-25-04849)]. C/EBP-knockout in mice on a high-carbohydrate diet and obesity were found to have reduced triglyceride levels and downregulated expression of lipogenic genes [ [54](#B54-molecules-25-04849)]. Hence, in our study downregulation of the SREPB-1c and C/EBP by SKK indicated a transcriptional level regulation of the FAA-induced steatosis. [55](#B55-molecules-25-04849)]. Our study that SKK downregulated FAS in the FFA-stimulated HepG2 cells, and could be correlated to the decrease in the intracellular triglyceride storage and extracellular free glycerol level increase. Thus, SKK was able to disrupt the FAS-regulated fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis process. CPT1A is a liver isoform that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps for the transportation and conversion of fatty acids for mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Overexpression of CPT1A in FFA-treated HepG2 cells can be inferred as an adaptive response to metabolize the increased levels of available intracellular FFA. An increase in fatty acids is responsible for induction of CPT1A levels in the liver [ [56](#B56-molecules-25-04849), [57](#B57-molecules-25-04849)]. In the present study, CPT1A expression increased in HepG2 cells stimulated with 2 mM FFA. SKK treatment brought down this upregulated CPT1A levels to the normal level. This apparent normalization of CPT1A levels post SKK treatment points towards a chain of events leading to the attainment of homeostasis by the cells [ [58](#B58-molecules-25-04849), [59](#B59-molecules-25-04849)]. Prolonged enhancement of CPT1A activity can lead to increased mitochondrial energy metabolism leading to heightened reactive oxygen species generation and causing cellular damage and apoptosis [ [60](#B60-molecules-25-04849)]. Whereas, a decrease in CPT1A expression can lead to reduced -oxidation in liver and could contribute to fatty acid accumulation and inflammation in hepatocytes [ [61](#B61-molecules-25-04849)]. Thus, our study could show that the reduced levels of intracellular lipids in both the pretreated and concurrently treated HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes with SKK were through the modulation of the FFA-stimulated steatosis related transcription factors (SREBP1c and C/EBP), and associated lipogenic gene (FAS), which in turn also normalized the fatty acid transporter (CPT1A) gene expression levels responsible for the transport of fatty acids for mitochondrial energy metabolism. Modifications in the extracellular presence of glycerol in the FFA-treated HepG2 cells pretreated with SKK further strengthen this finding. Interestingly, the regulation of intracellular lipid and triglyceride levels by SKK was close to the basal level of HepG2 cells indicating that the treatment did not impede the normal cellular metabolic activities. Quercetin is a known suppressor of SREBP1c and FAS genes involved in lipogenesis [ [36](#B36-molecules-25-04849)]. Similarly, rutin has shown therapeutic efficacy in lowering triglyceride levels and lipid droplet accumulation in preclinical models [ [37](#B37-molecules-25-04849)]. Caffeic acid is a known enhancer of lipolysis via of adipose triglyceride lipase activity [ [35](#B35-molecules-25-04849)]. are known to ameliorate FFA-induced steatosis by targeting multitude of pathways involved in the development and progression of steatosis and also act additionally as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents [ [38](#B38-molecules-25-04849)]. We did not investigate the role of SKK alone (without FFA) in stimulating steatosis associated genes since SKK appeared benign in terms of inducing any loss of cell viability or intracellular accumulation of lipids in the HepG2 cells. [59](#B59-molecules-25-04849)]. Another likely limitation is the lack of immune profiling, which is involved in the progression to fibrosis. Further, exploratory animal and human trials involving SKK will provide additional support to our observations. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chemicals and Reagents [19](#B19-molecules-25-04849)]. Briefly, 7.5 g of SKK powder was weighed and mixed with 400 mL of water. The mixture was boiled until a volume of 100 mL remained. The resultant decoction was dried using lyophilizer, and 853 mg of powder was obtained. Triglyceride analysis reagents were procured from Randox Laboratories Ltd., Crumlin, United Kingdom. The standards used for HPTLC were gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), caffeic (Natural remedies, Chandigarh, India). All other chemicals and reagents used for the tissue processing work were of the highest analytical grade. 4.2. Metabolite Analysis of SKK [62](#B62-molecules-25-04849)]. 4.3. In-Vitro Cell Culture [63](#B63-molecules-25-04849)]. Cells were passaged at 70% confluence and used for assays based on the number of cells required in each experiment.

Primary Rat Hepatocyte Isolation and Treatment [64](#B64-molecules-25-04849)]. Briefly, liver was cut into 1 mm thick pieces and perfused with hepatocyte wash medium (Gibco, Evansville, IN, USA). These liver pieces were placed in 0.25% Trypsin + EDTA solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) for 30 min till transformation into soft mushy texture. The whole tissue was then forced to pass through 100-40-micron sieves, serially. The filtrate was added to 30 mL of complete DMEM medium and centrifuged at 50\u00d7 g. The pellet was collected and cell viability of the isolated hepatocytes was measured up to 65% using trypan blue-based assay. Cells were plated in 96 well plates at a cell density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well and maintained in normal Williams' media Evansville, IN, USA) and Opti and 2% \u00b0C and 5% CO2. For functional assay, cells were plated in a 12-well plate at a density of 3 \u00d7 105 cells/well. Albumin was analyzed post 24 h of culture from the supernatant of plated cells using commercially available kits for Albumin (Randox Laboratories Ltd., Crumlin, UK) and measured using Randox Monaco clinical chemistry analyzer (Randox Laboratories Ltd., Crumlin, UK), following the manufacturer's instructions. The primary hepatocytes were treated with a combination of 2 mM FFA along with varying concentrations of SKK (0, 3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL) and incubated for 12 h, following which the intracellular lipid accumulation was evaluated using the ORO assay. 4.11.
