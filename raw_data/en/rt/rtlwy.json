It enables you to connect deeply with yourself in order to let go of suppressed, unresolved issues, allowing your body to return to its natural healthy state and vitality. Energy Healing Therapy helps to harmonize and balance you on all levels of your being: emotional, mental, physical and spiritual. [Meet Ter](https://www.energyhealingtherapy.ca/about)esa [Member of National Health Practitioners of Canada (NHPC) and Certified Advanced Integrative Energy Healing Practitioners (CAIEHP)](https://www.energyhealingtherapy.ca/about) I trained in Energy Healing at Langara College and completed the 2-year Advanced program certificate (A.I.E.H). I began doing treatments on medical staff at St. Paul's Hospital as well as Addiction and Senior Centers throughout Vancouver. My story and journey is one of healing, as there is no greater sense of purpose than assisting others in their own self-discovery while empowering them to heal. TREATMENTS are individualized according to your specific needs each session. They are done while you're fully clothed lying down or sitting in a chair. During the table treatment, the practitioner places his or her hands gently on your body or off, if you prefer a no touch approach, in order to restore free-flow of energy where blockages of any types are sensed. The treatment will remove blockages in your energy pathways (meridians) caused by stress, negative thought patterns, traumas and physical injuries to promote full healing. During an INTAKE the practitioner will ask you about your health history, current symptoms and issues, stress levels, and what you'd like the outcome to be for that particular treatment. The practitioner will also explain the table treatment and what to expect while you're on the table. A first time session is 90 minutes, so that the practitioner can gather all of the necessary information on you as well as understand the issues that have brought you in for a treatment. First time clients will also be asked to complete a client and consent form. DEBRIEF after treatment to: - Get your feedback about your table treatment - Assess how you feel afterwards The practitioner will: - Share his or her findings regarding your treatment - Outline a simple and easy to follow wellness plan for you to recover and heal. It's advisable to follow through the suggested amount of treatments on a weekly basis, so you complete the healing process and return to your vital and healthy state. POST TREATMENT reminder to: - Hydrate - Get the rest you need. Listen to your body ! - Avoid alcohol for a few days After a treatment clients report feeling more: - Energized, relaxed, happier, improved sleep, peace of mind, balanced, and motivated. Clients report feeling less: - Tension, stress, acute and chronic pain, anxiety and depression. \"Having an Energy Healing Therapy session with Teresa is like having a mind, body and spirit tune-up. The E.H.T. sessions have also helped me release some very deep-rooted issues that talk therapy could not achieve, and I always feel lighter and brighter after each session. Teresa always makes me feel comfortable during sessions, and she is excellent at communicating the E.H.T. process. Highly recommended!\" Tanya T. (Vancouver) \"I was truly amazed by my body's immediate reaction to the energy healing therapy. I felt alive and free from tension and pain that has been ailing me for most of my adult life. The ability to take breaths at ease, and deeply relax my mind and body, has given me a new outlook on life and its many stresses. I really thank you Teresa for helping me learn about my mind and body connection and achieve a greater sense of being.\" Lisa "}
