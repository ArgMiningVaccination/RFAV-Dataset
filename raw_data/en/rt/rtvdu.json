Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 2 VALUE -BASED BENEFITS SUBCOMMITTEE Clackamas Community Coll ege Wilsonville Training Center, Rooms 111-112 Wilsonville, Oregon August 11 , 2016 8:00 AM - 1:00 PM Members Present: Kevin Olson, MD, Chair; David Pollack, MD; Susan Wentz, MD , MPH , Jessie Little (Oregon Health Authority ); Adam Obley, MD, MPH (Center for Evidence Based Policy ); Henry Milzcuk, MD (OHSU Pediatric ENT ); Alejandro Perez , MD (Providence ); Justin Kelly and Alison Yoxall (Novocure ); Duncan Neilson, MD and Charles Bentz, MD (Legacy Health) ; Megan Patton; Jamie Hewlett and Michael Straight (Osiris ); Scott Kitchel , MD (Neurospine Institute ); Grant Hamilton (SI-Bone ); Andy Kranenburg, MD (via phone) . Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:05 am and roll was called. Minutes from the May 19, 2016 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved . Smits reviewed the errata document. Hodges raised concerns about the movement of torticollis ( ICD-10-CM M43.6) to an uncovered line. There was discussion that this code is for acquired torticollis. Staff will review the place ment of congenital torticollis (ICD-10-CM Q68.0) and bring recommendations for coverage to the next V bBS meeting. Livingston reviewed the HERC staff 's inten t to delay formation of a workgroup to examine the opioid for back conditions guideline until after the Oregon Opioid Prescribing Guidelines Task Force 's work is complete and further information is available after there has been a period of implementation of HERC's new guideline . She requested feedback on the type of data subcommittee members would like to see to inform decision -making for evaluating changes to this guideline. The members felt that the results of the statewide task force would be sufficient. Smits said all coverage changes approved at this meeting th at would result in significant cost increases will not take effect until January 1, 2017. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 3 Smits reviewed the new meeting form that includes a consent agenda section without discussion , unless a member has questions or concerns, and a straightforward list of topics with minimal discussion. Feedback about this change was encouraged . Topic: Consent Agenda Discussion: 1) CPT 35261 : Coffman said lines 82 and 135 appear to have overlapping neck blood vessel injury diagnoses and repair treatment code s. He requested that staff review lines 82 INJURY TO MAJOR BLOOD VESSELS OF EXTREMITIES AND NECK and 135 CRUSH INJURIES OTHER THAN DIGITS; COMPARTMENT SYNDROME; INJURIES TO BLOOD VESSEL(S) OF THE NECK to see if the neck vessel treatment portion s of these lines can be combined. 2) 31603 and 31605: Hodges requested clarification that adding emergency tracheostomy CPT codes to the Ancillary File will allow coverage for all indications. Staff feels that if an emergency tracheostomy is performed for a diagnosis which is below the funding line, then the immediate diagnosis need for this procedure (airway obstruction) would still be a covered indication. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove 54235 FUNCTIONAL AND MECHANICAL DISORDERS OF THE GENITOURINARY SYSTEM INCLUDING BLADDER OUTLET OBSTRUCTION, 418 BALANOPOSTHITIS AND OTHER DISORDERS OF PENI S and 438 HYPOSPADIAS AND EPISPADIAS 2) (eg, SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION 3) Add 92250 (Fundus photography with interpretation and report) to lines 8 TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS and 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS 4) Add all inpatient CPT codes to line 122 NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES 5) Add O89.4 (Spinal and epidural anesthesia -induced headache during the puerperium) to line 428 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TR EATMENT 6) Add 42900 (Suture pharynx for wound or injury) and 42950 (Pharyngoplasty (plastic or reconstructive operation on pharynx)) to line 292 CANCER OF ORAL CAVITY, PHARYNX, NOSE AND LARYNX 7) Remove 31603 and 31605 ( Tracheostomy, emergency procedure ) from a ll lines on the Prioritized List a.

CARRIES 7-0. Topic: Straightforward Items Discussion: There was no discussion about any of the straightforward agenda items. Note: HERC discussed the coverage of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for radiation cystitis and radiation proctitis. HERC voted to 337 CONDITIONS REQUIRING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY. See the HERC minutes for details and final decision. Recommended Actions: 1) Add G0396 and G0397 (Alcohol and/or substance (other than tobacco) abuse structured assessment (e.g., AUDIT, DAST), and brief intervention) to line 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER 2) Add H0004 (Behavioral health counseling and therapy, per 15 minutes) to line 197 AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS 3) Add H0006 ( Alcohol and/or drug services; case management ) to line 66 SUBSTANCE - INDUC ED MOOD, ANXIETY, DELUSIONAL AND OBSESSIVE -COMPULSIVE DISORDERS 4) Add H0032 (Mental health service plan development by non -physician) to lines 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER , 66 SUBSTANCE -INDUCED MOOD, ANXIETY, DELUSIONAL AND OBSESSIVE -COMPULSIVE DISORDERS , 69 SUBSTANCE -INDUCED DELIRIUM; SUBSTANCE INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL , and 614 ABUSE OF NONADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES 5) Remove G96.8 (Other specified disorders of the central nervous system) and G98.8 (Other disorders of the nervous system ) from lines 75, 297, 350, 382 (dysfunction lines) a.

CARRIES 7-0. Topic: 2017 ICD-10-CM Code Placement Discussion: There was minimal discussion about 2017 ICD-10-CM-CM code placements or related Prioritized List changes. E08.3521 -E08.3549 ( Diabetes mellitus d ue to underlying condition with... retinal detachment ) were also added to line 284 RETINAL DETACHMENT AND OTHER RETINAL DISORDERS .

CARRIES 7-0 Topic: Laryngeal reinnervation in children Discussion: Smits the evidence and the staff recommendations for laryngeal reinnervation for vocal cord paralysis. Dr. Henry Milczuk from OHSU Pediatric ENT testified that children don't have very good options for treatment. Literature combines kids and adults. Medialization is an effective treatment for adults, but not for kids due to growth issues. Another issue with the literature on this topic is that it examines aspirat ion pneumonia when dysphagia is the usual issue in children. Kids with dysphagia from vocal cord dysfunction need feeding tubes or g -tubes. Providers can do injections/fillers into vocal cords, but these are temporary procedures generally. Laryngeal reinne rvation was developed to help kids with dysphasia. Ratings in trials that based results on parent 's impression of how the child deals with clear liquids \u2014 generally saw improvement on parental rating scales. No studies did barium swallows or other gold stand ard measurements. Dr. MIlzcuk arg ued that dysphagia should be an indication for children, and aspiration needs to be covered but generally for adults. Treating dysphagia in children can be inferred to improve aspiration. Dysphonia can be absence of voice a s well as hoarseness. The weakness of voice can make kids fall behind in school and social settings; it's a quality of life issue. Dysphonia is a di sability which qualifies for individual educational plans in the school setting. He is here to advocate for use of this in kids as they have fewer treatment options. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 7 Olson asked about spontaneous recovery. Milczuk testified that approximately one-third of kids with this condition will have spontaneous recovery of vocal cord function. Due to this fact, provider s generally wait 6 -12 months before any interventions . When queried about the frequency of this condition, Dr. Milczuk said he sees about one case per month. Hodges suggested that we could put dysphonia/vocal cord dysfunction on a complications line as it results from surgery or other interventions. Milczuk replied that some cases are due to cancer or other non -procedural causes. Wentz said that she has seen several cases of vocal cord dysfunction during review as HSD. This condition is very different in adults vs kids. She noted that there is a gap in the literature in which aspiration is not studied in children. She said she feels that treatment of dysphonia is important for speech development. Smits said that p revious HSC discussion regarding dysph onia was on spasmotic dysphonia, which is a completely different medical condition that happens in adults. Based on that review the current HERC policy is to not cover dysphonia. Dysphonia in children due to vocal cord dysfunction has not been previously r eviewed. There was discussion about whether there should be a level of dysphonia in children which should qualify for services. There was discussion about whether a new line for dysphonia in children should be created. It was decided that the condition and treatment should be added to an existing line as a biennial change would take a long time to implement and this condition is ra re and treatments are not likely to be abused. Recommended Actions: 1) Modify GN141 as shown in Appendix A 2) Add CPT 92507 (Treatment of speech, language, voice, communication, and/or auditory processing disorder; individual), 92508 (group, 2 or more individ uals), 92524 (Behavioral and qualitative analysis of voice and resonance) to line 70 LARYNGEAL STENOSIS OR PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS and line 521 PARAL YSIS OF VOCAL CORDS (Laryngeal reinnervation by neuromuscular pedicl e) from PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS and line 521 PARAL YSIS OF VOCAL (Laryn goscopy, 521 PARAL YSIS OF 6) Add 31570 -31571 (Laryngoscopy, direct, with injection vocal cord(s), therapeutic ) to line 70 LARYNGEAL STENOSIS OR PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS and line 521 PARAL YSIS OF VOCAL CORDS OR LARYNX Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 8 7) Rename line 367 DYSTONIA (UNCONTROLLABLE ( Laryngoplasty; ) line 367 DYSTONIA LARYNX 11) Remove 31528 (Laryngoscopy direct, with or without with dilation) from line 133 GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS MOTION: To approve the line title, coding and gu ideline note changes as amended . CARRIES 7-0. Topic: Acupuncture guideline clarification Discussion: There was no discussion about this topic . Recommended Actions: 1) GN 92 was modified as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: Opioids for back conditions guideline Discussion: There was no discussion about this topic . Recommended Actions: 1) Guideline note 56 was modified as shown in Appendix A 2) Guideline note 60 was modified as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To approve the guideline note changes as presented . CARRIES 7-0. Topic: Tobacco cessation and elective surgery Discussion: Livingston presented the issue summary. Olson discussed concern around the fact that the evidence shows that offering intensive counselling and NRT is associated with benefit, even Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 9 when abstinence is not universally achieved. However, the standard of car e in the surgical community is around abstinence. Gibson raised concern about limiting the guideline to specific types of surgeries which have more evidence of harm rather than expanding the guideline to all elective surgeries. Additionally, with regard to the exception for people with mental illness, abstinence does not seem insurmountable. For example, the state hospital does not allow smoking , demonstrating the feasibility of cessation among the mentally ill. Pollack discussed that the language regar ding exceptions from abstinence misses other categories of people for whom it may be difficult to quit, such as those with cognitive impairment. He proposed alternative language around assessing the appropriateness of smoking cessation for a particular in dividual with mental illness or cognitive impairment. The invited expert on a later topic, Dr. Chuck Bentz, provi ded additional clinical input. Bentz shared that there is solid evidence about there being the highest benefit in people with mental illnes s, and that this population has a shorter life expectancy by 20 years that is partially attributable to high rates of cigarette smoking. To exempt this population would be to exclude them from a strong health benefit. He also suggested there is good data that people with psychiatric illness can quit. Olson mentioned that there is an exceptions process that can be utilized in unusual circumstances. A consensus was not reached , although there was a final proposal to remove the exception for severe and persistent mental illness. Bentz provided additional information about the major benefit of tobacco cessation prior to surgery is when there is a vascular bed at risk. A large amo unt of risk management around surgery is related to complications from smoking. Podiatric surgeries were recommended to be included. Smits will discuss further with the podiatrists as part of a larger upcoming review. Allen discussed the impact of smoki ng on dental procedures with any type of flap placement. There was general agreement that r eproductive, cancer -related, and diagnostic procedures ought to be excluded from the cessation requirement. Dr. Bentz provided additional input on the various ways of testing for tobacco cessation, including when NRT is acceptable. He discussed that Mayo leads the country in this and is using anabasine. Gibson proposed making the guideline about all elective procedures. Others concurred. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 10 The issue of marijuana was raised, and the group decided not to address it in the guideline . Recommended Actions: 1) Staff to revise propose guideline and bring back to a future meeting Topic: Hand/finger injuries and malformations Discussion: Smits requested feedback on when hand and finger deformities and injuries should be in the funded area of the Prioritized List. Williams noted that problems that result in affected hand function should be covered. There was disc ussion about higher prioritization for the dominant hand vs the non -dominant hand. The subcommittee also felt that self -limiting conditions should be on unfunded lines ; disabling conditions should be on a higher line. There was a question raised about wh ether thumb function should be given higher priority. In general, the subcommittee felt that this topic should only be addressed in the future if it did not take up undue staff time and attention. Recommended Actions: 1) Staff to examine prioritization of hand/finger conditions as staff time and effort allow Topic: Implantable cardiac loop recorders Discussion: Smits reviewed the staff summary. Wentz asked whether there was evidence that using implantable cardiac loop recorders (ICLRs) for transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) resulted in patient outcome changes. Smits replied that the evidence was around intermediate outcomes (e.g. arrhythmias identified) rather than patient oriented outcomes such as a mortality benefit. There was also a question about how much intervention (medications, implantable defibrillators, etc.) could help when the cardiac event , by definition , would be very rare (<1 per month). Smits replied that many of the arrhythmias being detected (ventricular fibrillation, bradycardia, etc.) could result in sudden death and therefore intervention would likely be helpful. Hodges noted that a guideline would be helpful for the medical directors of the CCOs. Without a guideline, the medical directors need to review each case. There was discussion about the level of evidence supporting the use of ICLRs. Williams noted that diagnostic tests f requently have lower levels of evidence tha n therapeutic treatments. There was a general concern about the lack of evidence showing improved outcomes such as mortality. After discussion, it was felt that if ICLRs could result in diagnoses being made whose treatment could prevent catastrophic outcomes such as sudden cardiac death, then coverage for the limited indication of TLoC should be approved. There was later testimony from Dr. Alejandro Perez regarding the use of ICLRs for evaluation of cryptogenic s troke. He noted that the WARSS study of crypogenic stroke Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 11 found that anticoagulation given , regardless of a patient having known atrial fibrillation , did not improve outcomes. Guidelines say that if you can not prove that a stroke was due to atrial fibril lation, then the patient should be treated with aspirin and not anticoagulation. Therefore it is important to figure out if crypogenic stroke is caused by atrial fibrillation . He also described the Crystal study, an RCT showing 48 hr monitoring only found a small percent with atrial fibrillation , and that this percent increased with 6 month monitoring. Finding out cause of stroke can lead to change in therapy and possibly prevent major stroke. There was no change in the subcommittee recommendation based on this testimony. Recommended Actions: 1) Advise HSD to add CPT 33282 ( Implantation of patient -activated cardiac event recorder ) to the Diagnostic Procedures File and remove from the Services Recommended for Non - Coverage Table 2) Advise HSD to add HCPCS C1764 (Event recorder, cardiac (implantable)) to the Diagnostic Procedures File and remove from the Ancillary File 3) Adopt a new guideline note regarding implantable cardiac event monitors as shown in Appendix D MOTION: To approve th e coding changes and adopt the guideline note as presented CARRIES 7-0. Topic: Electronic tumor treatment fields (ETTF) for initial treatment of glioblastoma Discussion: Smits noted that the staff summary and recommendations had been updated from that found in the meeting packet due to the newly published NCCN guideline on treatment of CNS malignancies. She reviewed the updated summary and recommendations. Gibson noted that the overall treatment effect was statistically significant, but wondered whether the overall 5 month survival increase justified the cost. Smits noted that ASCO's website listed the cost as approximately $20,000/month. The re was discussion about how this compared to standard radiation and chemotherapy. Olson noted that this malignancy has such a grim prognosis that the 5 month survival increase was approximately a 25% increase over standard therapy, which had been about the threshold for coverage in the old guideline regarding coverage of cancer near the end of life. There was discussion about the single study on which the NCCN guideline is based. Study was stopped early due to the data safety monitoring board ruling. Gibson noted that stopping a trial early can lead to lack of identification of complications and may lead to erroneous outcomes. Obley noted that the major concern with stopping a study early is that it guarantees a positive trial. If the study had been continued longer, it is possible that this early improvement would not follow through over time . Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 12 Justin Ke lly, senior director of health policy for Novocure , testified. The trial for ETTF for initial treatment of glioblastoma was stopped early due to such compelling improvement. He referred to his more detailed testimony at the May V bBS meeting. The V bBS decision was to cover ETTF for initial treatment of glioblastoma. V bBS felt that a specific clause should be added to the proposed guideline that specified that ETTF was not covered for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, as the evidence for that treatmen t is still poor and NCCN was divided on coverage for that indication. NOTE: later discussion at the August, 2016 HERC meeting discussed that it was discriminatory to disabled persons to include performance measure requirements such as the KPS or ECOG scor e over a certain level. There was concern that this provision might be in conflict with the ADA. HERC struck that portion of the proposed guideline (represented as red strike through wording in Appendix D). Recommended Actions: 1) Add HCPCS codes A4555 a nd E0766 to Line 299 CANCER OF BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM and advise HSD to remove these codes from the ancillary procedures file. 2) Adopt a new guideline for electronic tumor treatment fields as shown in Appendix D MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note as amended . CARRIES 7 -0. Topic: Sacr oiliac joint fusion Discussion: Smits reviewed the evidence summary and staff recommendation to not cover sacroiliac joint fusion. Pollack asked about long term outcomes, and Smits replied tha t there was one study of 2 years duration that showed improvement through those 2 years. Andy Kranenburg, MD, an orthopedist from Medford , testified via phone. He noted that he has conflicts of interest including being on the teaching panel for the manuf acturer. He noted that there was a study from 2014 (Rudolf) that had a 4 year prospective follow up showing continuing improvement in symptoms, as well as a 5 year retrospective study that also showed continuing improvement. Scott Kitchel MD, an orthopedist from Eugene at the Neurospine Institute , testified. He noted conflicts of interest including being on teaching faculty for SI Bone and a primary investigator for the SI Bone RCT at the Eugene site. Dr. Kitchel noted 40 peer reviewed articles on this technique showing evidence of improvement. Medicare is now covering it , as well as some private insurers . In his trial, he operated on about 20 p atents and noted good outcomes. All large RCTs are i ndustry sponsored. Compared to conservative treatment, SI joint fusion is more cost effective, results in less opioid use, has a shorter time for s ymptom resolution, improved quality of life , and improved disability. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 13 Saboe raised a question about the indications for surgery in the large RCT. Kitchel responded that patients needed to have pain consistent with sacroiilitis for 6 months, and have had 3 months of conservative therapy. The investigators confirmed the location of pain by 2 injections separated by 2 weeks which required an improvement in p ain by 50%. Physical exam needed to be confirm SI joint pain. Saboe asked what the comparator of conservative therapy was in these trials. Kitchel responded that this therapy consisted of injections, manual therapy (chiropractic or PT), bracing, and an exercise program . Saboe felt that it was important to note that the actual protocol for the PT or chiropractic therapy was not included in the study. Saboe raised concerns that SI joint fusion can lead to bad outcomes. His anecdotal experience is that SI joints improved over time with any therapy. He has the c oncern that fusing one SI joint will lead to dysfunction in the other S I joint , leading to fusion and then dysfunction in the lumbar spine. Olson asked Kitchel whether the trials showed increasin g rates of contralateral SI joint dysfunction or lumbar spine issues. Kitchel responded that these outcomes were looked at in the trials and were not seen at 2 years. He acknowledged that there is no data on whether this would happen at later times. Kranenburg requested that the deliberations be evidence -based rather than based on anecdote. He shared the subcomittee's concern with industry sponsorship, but did not find other flaws in the study design and thought that the trials under discussion were rig orously designed. There was discussion about adding SI joint fusion to the lower (uncovered) surgical back line. There was further discussion that such a placement would not allow patients options who fail conservative therapy. Saboe continued to expre ss his concerns with the possible complications of this type of surgery. Gibson asked how the trials define d a clinically significant reduction in pain. Kitchel responded that the studies used a reduction of at least 2 in the pain score. After further discussion, no consensus was reached. The motion to table this topic to a future meeting passed, and staff was directed to work with experts and examine the literature again. Recommended Actions: 1) Tabled to a future meeting Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 14 Topic: Coverage G uidance \u2014Tobacco cessation in pregnancy Discussion: Obley presented the evidence review of Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy. Livingston reviewed the Coverage Guidance and Multisector Interventions box language and proposed modifications to the Prioritized List. Pollack raised the concern about the use of the term \"pregnant women\" given that there could be transgender persons who are pregnant and do not consider themselves women and recommended that this be changed throughout the document to \"during pregnancy.\" Williams expressed disappointment in the limited impact of interventions on cessation. Neilson discussed that with repeated quit attempts, there is incremental improvement. Neilson also discussed the importance of being able to use NRT in hospitalized pr egnant women since ho spitals are smoke free. Recommended Action: 1) Replace \"pregnant women\" throughout the Coverage Guidance document with \"during pregnancy\" MOTION: To approve the recommended changes to the Prioritized List based on the draft Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy C overage Guidance scheduled for review by HERC at their 8/11/2016 meeting. CARRIES 7-0. Topic: Coverage Guidance \u2014Skin substitutes Discussion: This topic was not reviewed by V bBS due to time constraints. Public testimony was heard during the public comment section of the meeting and is included below: Michael Sinclair, Osiris, testified about inclusion of his product , Grafix, for wounds. Gra fix tissue is approved for any part of the body. A new study published last week showed that a large percent of complex wounds closed with this skin substitute and avoided amputation. Complex wounds cannot be addressed by the three products currently reco mmended for coverage in the coverage guidance. His product can be used for complex wounds and exposed bone and/or tendon. NICE recommends Gra fix with a high rating. Only their trial used a third party to verify wound closure and to do data analysis. Gra fix is available in multiple sizes, so will cost less as you can get larger sizes. It closes more wounds, closes faster than other products, and saves money due to larger sizes and reduced amputation rates. Patients in this trial were excluded from most trials. Alejandro Perez, MD , testified on skin substitutes. He noted inconsistencies in the VbBS materials. The Lavery study is labeled as poor in one section and fair in another. He endorses Epifix and Gra fix as options as useful for venous ulcers, a nd notes that the majority of wounds are venous ulcers. Oasis and A pligraf are currently the only options. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8/11/2016 Page 15 Products based on pork or male foreskin can be problematic for Muslim or orthodox Jewish patients. He m ade other commen ts on coverage guidance confid ence entries. Jeff Hughes, director of reimbursement from LifeSciences, testified. He reviewed studies for his product (Omnigraft). He stated that outcomes should include percent of wounds closed and quality of life. Only their study looked at quality of life as an outcome. His product also has decreased infection rates, reduced time to healing, and reduces rates of osteomyelitis. Recommended Actions: 1) This topic was tabled until the October, 2016 V bBS meeting Topic: 2018 Biennial review Discussion: The two biennial review topics (Deleting line 392 and repair of inguinal and ventral hernias) were tabled to a future meeting due to time constraints.

Oculopathy 1 Question : Where should oculopathy diagnoses be placed on the Prioritized List? Question source : HERC staff, HSD Issue : ICD10 includes multiple codes for oculopathy. ICD -9 only included diabetic oculopathy. The ICD - 10 codes were placed on lines containing the underlying disease (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, etc.). However, these lines do not contain the CPT codes required for tre atment of the oculopathy. Diabetic oculopathy is listed as of ICD -9 250.50 ( Diabetes with ophthalmic manifestations, type II or unspecified type) and similar codes. Oculopathy is no longer listed as a subdiagnosis for diabetic eye disease in ICD -10. The diabetic codes would appear on line 100 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY if they continued to be included as a subdiagnosis of diabetic eye disease. Oculopathy is an eye disease which can present as an interstitial keratitis, scleritis, iri tis, chorioretinitis, or exudative retinal detachment. It can be caused by a variety of conditions. The current placement of these codes allows treatment of the underlying disease but not the eye manifestations. ICD-10 Code Code description Current pla cement A50.01 to line s 270 ACUTE, SUBACUTE, CHRONIC AN D OTHER TYPES OF IRIDOCYCLITIS, 340 SCLERITIS and 365 CHORIORETINAL INFLAMMATION a. Will allow treatment of eye manifestation of the disease b. Keep codes on their underlying disease lines Wigs for Chemotherapy/Radiation Induced Hair loss 1 Question : how should the Prioritized List be modified to indicate coverage for wigs for patients with hair loss due to chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment? Question source : HERC staff, HSD staff Issue : Under the Affordable Care Act, the Medicaid expansion population has to receive a benefit which includes the Essential Health Benefits as defined by law. Oregon is selecting the PacificSource Codeduct Plan as its base benchmark, and that plan includes cove rage for wigs of up to $150 per year for people who have undergone radiation or chemotherapy treatment. In order to meet other regulatory requirements in an efficient way, Oregon has chosen to provide a single benefit package for the expansion population a nd the categorically eligible populations. The most expedient way to meet this requirement is to add this coverage for wigs. Procedure code : HCPCS A9282 (Wig, any type, each) is on the Ancillary List Possible ICD-10 diagnostic codes : L58.0 ( Acute radiode rmatitis is DISEASE OF NAILS, HAIR AND HAIR FOLLICLES L65.8 (Other specified nonscarring hair loss) is on line 588 DISEASE OF NAILS, HAIR AND HAIR FOLLICLES .

Rehabilitative and Habilitative Therapies 1 Issues : 1) GN6 was discussed at the May, 2016 VBBS meeting and the VBBS directed staff to remove vascular and cardiac rehabilitation from the guideline, as these are very different type of services with different indications for frequency and use compared to other re habilitative services. HERC staff was directed to create a new guideline for cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. After reviewing many private insurance policies regarding these services, staff determined that any such guideline would need to be extreme ly long and detailed. OHP medical directors were queried about their need for such a guideline and the unanimous reply was that such a guideline was not useful: these services are not abused and a detailed guideline would not assist the CCOs. Therefore, staff is proposing removing vascular and cardiac rehabilitation from this guideline with no new guideline. 2) GN 6 Rehabilitative Therapies requires several edits to bring it into compliance with federal rules regarding habilitative services. Excerpts from federal rule regarding habilitative services are shown below: a. Separate coverage limits must also be established for rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices (see 45 CFR 156.115(a)(5)(iii)) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. A combined limit that cannot be exceeded based on medical necessity is not permissible. States will need to assess any existing limits on this coverage to determine if an amendment to the ABP SPA is required. b. Text of 45 CFR 156.115(a)(5)(iii) i. (iii) For plan years beginning on or after Januar y 1, 2017, do not impose combined limits on habilitative and rehabilitative services and devices. c. Federal definition of habilitative services: i. 45 CFR 156.115 1. (5) With respect to habilitative services and devices - 2. (i) Cover health care services and device s that help a person keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living (habilitative services). Examples include therapy for a child who is not walking or talking at the expected age. These services may include physical and occupational thera py, speech -language pathology and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings; Rehabilitative and Habilitative Therapies 2 HERC staff recommendation : 1) Modify GN6 as shown below a.

the Prioritized List have coding changes to allow treatment of bleeding into the vitreous when there is a retinal tear ? Question source : Andreas Lauer, MD, Casey Eye Institute Issue : When a retinal tear occurs, there may be bleeding into the vitre ous which needs to be removed to allow laser therapy or cryo therapy to the actual retinal tear itself. Dr. Lauer recommends adding a vitrectomy code to line 304 VITREOUS DISORDERS which allows vitrectomy with laser photocoagulation (CPT H43.1 ( Vitreous hemorrhage ) to pair with 67039. Currently 67039 appears on lines 100, 284, 290, 353, 365, 388, and 453. Dr. Lauer also recommends adding two diagnosis codes for retinal tears a nd breaks (ICD -10 H33.30, H33.31) to the retinal detach ment line (284 RETINAL DETACHMENT AND OTHER RETINAL DISORDERS ) to allow pairing with vitrectomy with laser photocoagulation. Currently, H33.30 and H33.31 a re only on line 379 RETINAL TEAR . The definition of these lines, however, would prevent this addition. His request is that H33.30 and H33.31 should pair with CPT 67039. A simpler solution would be to add 67039 to line 379. HERC staff recommendation : ) to line s 304 VITREOUS DISORDERS and 379 RETINAL TEAR a. All other vitrectomy codes appear on line 304 b. Addition to line 379 would allow pairing with H33.30 ( Unspecified retinal break ) and H33.31 ( Horseshoe tear of retina without detachmen t) Ankle Arthritis 1 Question : Where should ankle arthritis be prioritized? Question source: HERC staff Issue : During the ICD -10 podiatry review, the podiatry experts recommended moving ankle arthritis (M24.17x Other articular cartilage disorders, ankle/foot ) from line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT to line 436 INTERNAL DERANGEMENT OF KNEE AND LIGAMENTOUS DISRUPTIONS OF THE KNEE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INJURY/IMPAIRMENT as they felt that ankle arthritis was of equivalent severity to knee arthritis. They also propo sed moving a set of CPT codes for repair of ankle arthritis to this line was discussed at two VBBS meetings, but never approved. However, M24.17 was moved to line 436 in error, but none of the proposed CPT codes for repair were moved. M24.17 also currently appears on line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND R ECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS ; it no longer appears on line 545. The relevant repair CPT codes for ankle arthritis appear on line 392. In a separate issue for this meeting, HERC staff are proposing deletion of line 392. The other M24.1 series codes for ot her non-ankle joints appear on line 392 and line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS other than the hip diagnosis (M24.15) which appears on the line 361 in addition to lines 392 and 530. There are multiple other ICD -10 codes which can be used for ankle arthritis, which appear in the table below. These codes are on inconsistent lines and may or may not have CPT codes pairing with them that are appropriate for surgical repair . Of note, major arthritis or recurrent dislocations of foot joints appea r on line 364 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MAJOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS . Another appropriate arthritis line is 361 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS, AND ASEPTIC NECROSIS OF BONE. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Consolidate all specific ankle arthritis ICD -10 diagnosis codes to the arthritis medical and surgical lines (lines 361 and 467) as shown in the table below a. Leave \"not elsewhere classified \" and other non -specific diagnoses on uncovered line s b. Appropriate sur gical CPT codes appear on line 361 for repair c. ICD-10 M24.17 ( Other articular cartilage disorders, ankle and foot) should only appear on an uncovered line as the primary types of arthritis (osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, etc.) are al ready on the upper lines d.

Question source : HERC staff ; HSD H earings Division ; Dr. Chris Seuferling DPM Issue : Hallux rigidus is arthritis of the big toe joint. It causes pain and swelling of the toe, and may cause issues with walking. The treatment for this condition is typically NSAIDs, ice or heat packs, injections into the joint, physical therapy , and changes in footwear. Surgery may be required in patients with severe symptoms that do not respond to conservative measures. The main surgical options are fusion of the joint (arthrodesis), simple excision of the joint (Keller's procedure) and joint replacement with an artific ial implant. Hallux rigidus is generally categorized into 4 types, depending on severity of symptoms and radiographic findings. Coughlin and Shurnas Classification Exam Findings Radiographic Findings Grade 0 Stiffness Normal Grade 1 mild pain at extremes of motion mild dorsal osteophyte, normal joint space Grade 2 moderate pain with range of motion increasingly more constant moderate dorsal osteophyte, <50% joint space narrowing Grade 3 significant stiffness, pain at extreme ROM, no pain at mid - range severe dorsal osteophyte, >50% joint space narrowing Grade 4 significant stiffness, pain at extreme ROM, pain at mid - range of motion same as grade III VBBS/ HERC history The placement of hallux rigidus (ICD -10 M20.2) was reviewed by the podiatry and the orthopedics ICD -10 review groups. Prior to these reviews, the ICD -9 equivalent of M20.2 was on line 545 DEFORMITIES OF FOOT. The podiatry group suggested moving M20.2 to 467 OSTEOARTHRITIS AND ALLIED DISORDERS with the addition of a series of CPT allow treatment. This suggestion was discussed at length at two VBBS meetings, but no decision was reached. However, M20.2 was moved from line 545 to line 467 in error after these meetings, without any movement of CPT codes to allow treatment. Of note, line 467 is a medical line and does not contain other surgical procedures for other joints. The surgical line for osteoarthritis is 361 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, OSTEOARTHRITIS, OSTEOCHONDRITIS DISSECANS, AND Hallux Rigidus orthopedic ICD-10 review group subsequently reviewed ICD-10 M20.2 and suggested moving it from line 545 to line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS, which was not approved. The orthopedics documents were incomplete and the discussion related to this change cannot be located . However, after the orthopedic review at VBBS , one treatment code for hallux ridigus (CPT 28289) was added to line 392 but the ICD -10 code was not. This appears to be an error as well.

N=1 trial (20 patients) examining P T for osteoarthritis of the big toe joint b. Mean differences at four weeks follow up were 3.80 points (95% CI 2.74 to 4.86) for self reported pain, 28.30 \u00b0 (95% CI 21.37 to 35.23) for big toe joint range of motion, and 2.80 kg (95% CI 2.13 to 3.47) for muscl e strength. Although differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups were reported, the risk of bias was high. The trial failed to employ appropriate randomisation or adequate allocation concealment, used a relatively small sample and incorpor ated a short follow up (four weeks). No adverse reactions were reported. c. Authors' conclusions The reviewed trial presented a high risk of bias, which limited conclusions that could be drawn from the presented data. The inclusion of only one trial indicates the need for more robust randomised controlled trials to determine the efficacy of interventions for this condition. 2) Roukis 2010, systematic review of cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy for hallux rigidus a. N=11 studies (374 procedures) b. Pain was relieved or improved in 149/167 (89.2%) procedures, and 139/217 (77%) patients related being satisfied or very satisfied with their outcomes. A total of 18 (4.8%) procedures underwent surgical revision. c. cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteoto my should be considered a first-line surgical treatment for hallux rigidus. However, there is still a need for methodologically sound prospective cohort studies that focus on the use of this procedure for specific grades of hallux rigidus and compare the s ubjective and objective outcomes as well as the need for surgical revision with other procedures. 3) Deland 2012, review of surgical treatment of hallux rigidus (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225095651_Surgical_Management_of_Hall ux_Rigidus - Study not included due to length) a. Early to mid -stage hallux rigidus is best managed with proximal phalanx osteotomy. reserved for late -stage hallux rigidus. Joint implants 1) NICE 2005 , review of joint implants for hallux rigidus a. Recommends coverage: Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of metatarsophalangeal joint replacement with an artificial implant of the hallux appears adequate to support the use of this procedure . b. The main outcome measures reported were pain relief and patient satisfaction. Three studies reported that 73% (8/11), 79% (46/58) and 100% (7/7) of joints with implants were pain free after mean follow -ups of 17 months, 12 years and 35 months, respectively. Another study including 86 implants reported a Hallux Rigidus 4 statistically significant improvement in pain scores after the procedure. Two further studies reported pain relief in 66% (59/90) of implants and 94% (30/32) of patients (mean follow -ups of 3 years and 8 years, respectively). c. Complications: The main complication reported was the formation of osteophytes around the implant. This affected between 4% (2/49) and 71% (41/58) of implants. in 0% (0/106) to 29% (21/73) of implants, and frequency of fracture was related to the length of time that the implant had been in place. At the follow -up assessmen t, between 0% (0/11) and 8% (3/37) of implants had needed to be removed (mean follow -ups of 17 and 70 months, respectively). Other complications included malpositioning of the implant, infection, inflammation, dislocation and persistent pain. 2) Roukis 2010 , review of autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty for hallux rigidus a. N=2 studies (23 patients) Both studies used the AOFAS First Metatarsal -Phalangeal -Hallux Scoring System, which had a mean of preoperatively rising to 89.4 postoperative ly. First of 16.7_ preoperatively rising to 51.1_ postoperatively. Complications occurred in 4 (14.3%) feet and no feet required surgical revision. The results of this systematic review demonstrate improv ement in patient outcomes and first metatarsal -phalangeal joint dorsiflexion, as well as few complications following soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty for end -stage hallux rigidus. However, there is still a need for methodologically sound prospective cohort studies that compare autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty with other forms of arthroplasty and arthrodesis for end -stage hallux rigidus. Other policies 1) NICE 2005 a. Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of metatarsophalangeal joint replacement of the hallux appears adequate to support the use of this procedure 2) Aetna 2015 a. Covers cheilectomy for hallux rigidus b. Covers arthrodesis for hallux rigidus only after fail ed cheilectomy c. Aetna considers total prosthetic replacement arthroplasty with silastic implants and hemiarthroplasty medically necessary for persons with disabling arthritis of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint (hallux rigidus). Expert input : Chris Seuferling, DPM ...my research supports surgical procedures, at least in advanced stage cases of hallux rigidus (M20.21/2). I would recommend approving 2 surgical procedures for advanced stage hallux rigidus diagnosis M20.21/2): Hallux MPJ B) CPT -Code 28292: Keller procedure (Though this is listed as bunionectomy, it is appropriate for advanced stage patient who is not candidate for fusion ie; older, inactive, or osteopenic patients) C) I would also recommend covering surgical procedure 28289 (cheilectomy) for earlier stage cases. Recommend covering stage 3 and 4 as the highest priority and cover fusion surgery (arthroplasty) only (not implants). Cheilectomy would be a lower priority for coverage as this is used for stage 1 a nd 2. Stages are based on radiographic findings. Stage 1 has a inflamed, painful joint with no radiographic findings; these patients have pain with exercise but not necessarily daily activities. Stage 2 has early radiographic findings; this stage can res pond to conservative care (PT, injections, orthotics, etc.). Stage 3 and 4 have joint destruction and do not respond generally to conservative care. HERC staff summary Hallux ri gidus is a disabling arthritic condition.

Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Osteoarthritis affecting of the big toe joint of the foot (hall ux limitus or rigidus) is a common and painful condition. Altho ugh several treatments have been proposed, few have been adequately eva luated. Objectives T o identify controlled trials evaluating interventions for osteoarthritis of the big toe joint and to determine the opti mum intervention(s). Search methods Literature searches were conducted across the following electro nic databases: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; and PEDro (to 14th January 2010). No language restrictions were app lied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised trials, or co ntrolled clinical trials that assessed treatment outcomes for osteoarthritis of the big toe joint. Participants of any age or gender with osteo arthritis of the big toe joint (dened either radiographicall y or clinically) were included. Data collection and analysis T wo authors examined the list of titles and abstracts identi ed by the literature searches. One content area expert and one m ethodologist independently applied the pre-determined inclusion and exclu sion criteria to the full text of identied trials. T o minimis e error and reduce potential bias, data were extracted independently by t wo content experts. Main results Only one trial satisfactorily fullled the inclusion criteria and was included in this review. This trial evaluated the effe ctiveness of two physical therapy programs in 20 individuals with osteoarthr itis of the big toe joint. Assessment outcomes included pain le vels, big toe joint range of motion and plantar flexion strength of the hall ux. Mean differences at four weeks follow up were 3.80 points (9 5% CI 2.74 to 4.86) for self reported pain, 28.30 \u00b0 (95% CI 21.37 to 35 .23) for big toe joint range of motion, and 2.80 kg (95% CI 2.13 to 3.47) for muscle strength. Although differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups were reported, the risk of bias was high. The trial failed to employ appropriate randomisat ion or adequate allocation concealment, used a relatively smal l sample and incorporated a short follow up (four weeks). No adverse reaction s were reported.

The in clusion of only one trial indicates the need for more robust randomise d controlled trials to determine the efcacy of interventions f or this condition. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Interventions for treating osteoarthritis of the big toe jo int This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from re search about the effect of interventions for osteoarthritis o f the big toe joint. The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis of the bi g toe joint: A physical therapy program consisting of a standard physical th erapy program (stretching and other exercises, ultrasound and electrical stimulation), plus extra mobilisation and gait training exe rcises, compared with a standard physical therapy program alon e, - May improve pain. - Function was not measured. - No harms or side effects occurred. What is osteoarthritis and how is it treated? Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints. When your joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. I nstead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally an d makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshape n and make the joint painful. Doctors used to think that osteoarthritis was caused by wear an d tear on the cartilage. However, it's now thought that osteoa rthritis is a disease of the whole joint. Many factors may increase your ris k of getting osteoarthritis in the big toe joint, such as parti cular foot structure, trauma, family history of the disease, joint dise ase, and gait abnormalities. OA is one of the most common forms of arthritis and affects men an d women equally. OA is one of the main causes of disability as people grow older. Interventions such as physical therapy, including exercises ai m to enhance or maintain muscle strength, physical tness and ov erall health. People exercise for many different reasons including weight loss, strengthening muscles and to relieve the sympto ms of OA. Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis of the big toe joint : Pain (higher scores mean worse pain) - People who did a standard physical therapy program plus extr a exercises rated their pain to be 3.8 points lower on a scale of 0 to 10 after 4 weeks, compared with people who did standard physical t herapy alone (38% absolute improvement). - People who did a standard physical therapy program plus extr a exercises rated their pain to be 0.4 points on a scale of 0-10 aft er 4 weeks. - People who did a standard physical therapy program alone rat ed their pain to be 4.2 on a scale of 0 to 10 after 4 weeks.

The author undertook a systematic review to identify material relating to the clinical outcomes aftercheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy for hallux rigidus. Studies were considered only if they involved consecutively enrolled patients undergoing cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy, evaluated patients at mean follow-up /C2112 months' duration, included some form of objective and subjective data analysis, and included details of complications requiring surgical intervention. Eleven studies involvinga total of 374 procedures were identied that met the inclusion criteria. Pain was relieved or improved in 149/ 167 (89.2%) procedures, and 139/217 (77%) patients related being satised or very satised with their outcomes. A total of 18 (4.8%) procedures underwent surgical revision. Six studies involving 177 proceduresspecied the grade of hallux rigidus as follows: grade I, 10.2% (n \u00bc18); grade 72.3% (n \u00bc128); and grade III, 17.5% (n \u00bc31). The results of this systematic review make clear the general improvement in objective and subjective data as well as the low incidence of revision surgery required after cheilectomy with phalangealdorsiflexory a rst-line surgical treatment for hallux rigidus. However, there is still a need for methodologically sound prospective cohort studies that focus on the use of this procedure for specic gradesof hallux rigidus and compare the subjective and objective outcomes as well as the need for surgical revisionwith other procedures. /C2112010 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Numerous etiologies have been purported and likewise myriad surgical procedures have been advocated (2, 4- 17). One such surgical procedure is cheilectomy of the rst metatarsal-phalangeal joint combined with a dorsal extension (i.e., dorsiflexory) osteotomy at the base of the proximal phalanx with or without additional transverse plane reduction of concomitant hallux abductus interphalangeus 1952, Bonney and MacNab (17) reported ''disappointing'' results for 9 patients who underwent excision of dorsal ''bony outgrowth(s)'' about the rst metatarsal head and theorized that performing a phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy instead might provide improved outcomes. They did not present any actual cases involving phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy until 1958 when Kessel and Bonney (18)published outcomes in predominantly adolescent patients with hallux rigidus. Moberg (21) described the same exact technique in an adult population with hallux rigidus in 1979. It should be noted that these authors and others (17-22, 27, 29) advocated performing the phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy in isolation andnot with concomitant cheilectomy metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Combined cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteot- omy did not exist in the literature until 1993 when Desai et al (24) published their non-peer-reviewed abstract presentation from theBritish Orthopaedic Foot Surgery Society meeting. The rst peer- reviewed article, by Blyth et al (28) was published in 1998. Since these publications, authors have both advocated (30, 39-41, 45) and condemned (16) the addition of a phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy to a cheilectomy procedure of the rst metatarsal-phalangeal joint with little high level of evidence data supporting either viewpoint. Furthermore, it has been proposed that undergoing cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy does not prevent the ability to perform revision surgery consisting of repeat cheilectomy with phalangeal dorsiflexory osteotomy, Keller resectional arthroplasty, implant arthroplasty, or arthrodesis (24, 29, 30, 32, 41, 45) .Financial Disclosure : None reported.

In an effort toprocure the highest quality studies available, studies were eligible for inclusion only if they involvedconsecutively enrolled patients undergoing isolated autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasty for the treatment of end-stage hallux rigidus, evaluated patients at mean follow-up of 12-months' duration or longer, included pre- and postoperative range of motion of the rst metatarsal-phalangeal joint, determined pre- andpostoperative outcomes using a scoring system, and documented any complications. Two studies involving a total of 28 autogenous soft tissue interpositional arthroplasties for end-stage hallux rigidus were identied that met the inclusion criteria. There were 12 men (52%) and 11 women (48%) with a mean age of 58.2 yearsfollowed for a mean of 21.6 months. Both studies used the AOFAS First Metatarsal-Phalangeal-Hallux Scoring System, which had a mean of 26.0 preoperatively rising to 89.4 postoperatively. First metatarsal-phalangeal joint dorsiflexion had a mean of 16.7 /C14preoperatively rising to 51.1/C14postoperatively.

Page 1 of 522 The procedureThe procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis commonly affect the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint at the base of the big toe. The joint ma y become predominantly stiff (hallux rigidus) or deformed (hallux valgus). 2.1.2 analgesics, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory tablets or cream, and steroid injections into the joint. Surgery ma y be required in patients with se vere symptoms that do not respond to conservativ e measures. The main surgical options are fusion of the joint (arthrodesis), simple e xcision of the joint (K eller's procedure ) and joint replacement with an artificial implant. 2.2 Outline of the pr ocedur e 2.2.1 MTP joint replacement is carried out under gener al or regional anaesthesia using tourniquet control. An incision is made o ver the joint and the capsule is exposed b y dividing tissue and retr acting tendon. The joint surfaces are e xcised and the medullary canals of the first metatarsal and pro ximal phalanx are reamed to accommodate the prosthetic joint implant. A preliminary reduction with a trial implant is done to ensure a snug fit and the implant components are then placed in each canal. The joint capsule is closed and a fle xible splint is used postoper ativ ely to maintain the correct position. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 The main outcome measures reported were pain relief and patient satisfaction. Three studies reported that 73% (8/11), 79% (46/58) and 100% (7/7) of joints with implants were pain free after mean follow-ups of 17 months, 12 y ears and 35 months, respectiv ely. Another study including 86 implants reported a statistically significant impro vement in pain scores after the procedure. T wo further studies reported pain relief in 66% (59/90) of implants and 94% (30/32) of patients (mean follow-ups of 3 y ears and 8 y ears, respectiv ely).Metatarsophalangeal joint replacement of the hallux (IPG140) \u00a9 NICE 2005.

Fractures adiologically in 0% (0/106) to 29% (21/73) of implants, and frequency of fr acture was related to the length of time that the implant had been in place. At the follow-up assessment, between 0% (0/11) and 8% (3/37) of implants had needed to be remo ved (mean follow-ups of 17 and 70 months, respectiv ely). Other complications included malpositioning of the implant, infection, inflammation, dislocation and persistent pain.

Question source: Dr. Richard Owens, orthopedic surgery Issue : Flatfoot diagnoses are generally on uncovered lines, and the diagnoses on the Prioritized List used for this condition generally do not pair with the most used repair codes. Dr. Owens has requested that the HERC consider coverage for flat foot due to posterior ti bialis tendonopathy. Dr. Owens feels that lack of coverage for the early forms of this disorder results in patients developing more severe stages and finally getting coverage for an ankle fusion surgery for the late states, when earlier care might have pr evented the need for such extensive surgery. Flatfoot (hyperpronation and flattening -out of the longitudinal arch) (also known as pes planus or pes planovalgus) is a common deformity among children and adults. It may be congenital, or be acquired due to various conditions including posterior tibial tendon dysfunction. Lack of a functional arch affects the biomechanics of the lower leg and can result in pain. Flat feet are very common in children, and may resolve as the child grows. Flat feet can also develop as an adult ( \"adult acquired flatfoot \") due to injury, illness, unusual or prolonged stress to the foot, faulty biomechanics , or as part of the normal aging process. If a youth or adult appears flatfooted while standing in a full weight bearing position, but an arch appears when the person plantar flexes , or pulls the toes back with the rest of the foot flat on the floor, this condition is called flexible flatfoot. Most flexible flat feet are asymptomatic, and do not cause pain. In these cases, there is usually no cause for concern. In some patients, lower leg pain results from the flat foot, which can be treated with the use of shoes with properly f itting, arch -supporting orth otics. Rigid flatfoot, a condition where the sole of the foot is rigidly flat even when a person is not standing, often indicates a significant problem in the bones of the affected feet, and can cause pain in about a q uarter of those affected. Other flatfoot -related conditions, such as various forms of tarsal coalition (two or more bones in the midfoot or hindfoot abnormally joined) or an accessory navicular (extra bone on the inner side of the foot) should be treated promptly, usually by the very early teen years, before a child 's bone structure firms up permanently as a young adult. Both tarsal coalition and a n accessory navicular can be confirmed by X-ray. Rheumatoid arthritis can destroy tendons in the foot (or both feet) which can cause this condition, and untreated can result in deformity and early onset of osteoarthritis of the joint. Such a condition can cause severe pain and considerably reduced abil ity to walk, even with orthoses. Ankle fusion is usually recommended. There are 4 stages of acquired flat foot deformity. Stage I is an inflammation of the tendon and normally is treated conservatively with braces . Stage II has the foot remaining flexib le, with arch collapse and mild sinus tarsi pain. Stage III is a rigid fore and hindfoot, with severe sinus Posterior Tibialis Tendinopathy 2 tarsi pain and subtalar arthritis. Stage IV involves ankle pain, deltoid ligament compromise, and subtalar arthritis and talar tilt in ankle mortis e are seen on xray. Acquired flat foot deformity is typically seen in middle aged patients with conditions such as diabetes. Treatment of asymptomatic flat feet is not required. Foot or leg pain due to flat feet is treated with orthotics for arch suppor t, NSAIDs, and/or foot exercises. Surgery may be done for more severe stages of flat foot or when conservative therapy fails. From Dr. Rich Owen I am sending a review article from our orthopedic review journal. It discusses the four stages of adult acqu ired flatfoot deformity. Patients predictably progress from Stage 1 to at least Stage 3 and sometimes Stage 4 without treatment. Currently, OHP doesn't cover surgical or nonsurgical options. The condition is severely debilitating, and gets worse with time. Many times nonsurgical treatment does not work.

These deformities vary in location, severity,and rate of progression. Establishing a diagnosis as early as possibleis one of the most important factors in treatment. Prompt early,aggressive nonsurgical management is important. A patient inwhom such treatment fails should strongly consider surgicalcorrection to avoid worsening of the deformity. In all four stages ofdeformity, the goal of surgery is to achieve proper alignment andmaintain as much flexibility as possible in the foot and anklecomplex. However, controversy remains as to how to manageflexible deformities, especially those that are severe. Adult-acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD) encompasses a wide failure of the liga- ments that support the arch also oc-curs, often resulting in progressivedeformity of the foot. 1,4-6Deformi- ties vary in severity, rate of progres-sion, and location along the arch.Treatment has been effective in re-lieving pain. However, achievingmaximum function remains a chal-lenge. When the deformities becomemore severe and fixed, the results oftreatment are more limited. Contro-versies persist regarding how to treatAAFD, especially the more severeflexible deformities. The presenting symptoms of AAFD vary according to the stage ofdisease. Early on, a patient presentswith pain and swelling medially overthe posterior tibial tendon. the tendon may notrupture, it often becomes dysfunc-tional. Tendon failure occurs most of- ten just distal to and at the level ofthe medial malleolus. The etiology ofthe condition is multifactorial. Pre-existing is common, and obe-sity is often present. Relative hy-povascularity in this area of thetendon is another possible factor. 7 AAFD is more common in females,with peak incidence at age 55 years. With time, medial foot pain caused by tendon failure may dissi-pate, although swelling may persist.Ligament failure commonly occursalong with the tendon dysfunction.However, it may take place after or,less commonly, before tendon fail-ure. The spring ligament complexthat supports the talonavicular jointoften is involved, resulting in in-creasing deformity at this joint.Along with subluxation at subtalarjoint. medial migration of the talar headoccurs, resulting in flattening of thearch as the foot displaces from un-Jonathan T.

Volume 16, Number 7 , July 2008 399The Efficacy of Nonsurgical Interventions for Pediatric Flexible Flat Foot: A Critical Review Angela Jane MacKenzie, BSc, *Keith Rome, PhD, *and Angela Margaret Evans, PhD *w Background: The pediatric flat foot frequently presents as a common parental concern in the health care setting. Foot orthoses are often used, yet benets are uncertain and disputed, having been variably investigated. A recent Cochrane reviewcites limited evidence for nonsurgical interventions. This critical and structured review evaluates the eect of pediatric foot orthoses from assessment of the current literature.Methods: A systematic search of the following electronic data- bases: Medline, CINAHL, AMED, and SPORTDiscus, using an array of search terms. A further search was also performed onrelevant reference listings. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed journal articles, publication date from 1970 onwards, in the English language. Exclusion criteria were surgery interventions,adult subjects, rigid flat foot, articles based on opinion. Astructured Quality Index was used to evaluate the research quality of articles. Three reviewers independently assessed the studies with disputes resolved by majority consensus. Studieswere then grouped according to the outcome measures used. Results: Thirteen articles, from an initial 429, met the criteria for quality evaluation. The mean Quality Index score was 35%(range: 13% to 81%), indicative of generally poor and varying methodological quality. Conclusions: The low quality of the studies negates denitive conclusions. Only 3/13 quality evaluations scored >50%; hence, evidence for ecacy of nonsurgical interventions for flexible pediatric flat feet is very limited. Future research needs validatedfoot type assessment, applicable outcome measures for the in-tervention, the use of control groups, allowance for independent eects of footwear, age range comparisons, larger samples, and prospective, longer follow-up.Clinical Relevance: There is very limited evidence for the ecacy of nonsurgical interventions for children with flexible flat feet. Clinicians need to consider the lack of good-quality evidence intheir decision-making for the management of pediatric flat foot.Key Words: flat foot, pediatric, orthoses, quality, evidence (J Pediatr Orthop 2012;32:830-834) Pediatric flat foot continues to be a frequent pre- sentation to a range of health professionals, as it re- mains a common concern to parents.1,2A recent Cochrane review, and a subsequent wider topic review, has high- lighted the limited evidence relating to the use of foot orthoses, which are commonly used by clinicians fortreating pediatric flat foot. 3,4Cochrane reviews are central to evidence-based medicine. However, by focusing ex- clusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) a large swath of the published literature is excluded from generalpurview. Our experience, conducting 2 published reviews that examined interventions for pediatric flat feet, has brought particular methodological issues to light, 3,4which in turn, contribute to the benets of treatment being dis- puted, and the conclusions about studies addressing inter- vention eects, becoming polarized.5-11 The aim of this literature review was to evaluate the eect of foot orthoses on the flexible pediatric flat foot, and using a structured critical framework, to assess the methodological quality of the reported studies. METHODS Data Sources A systematic search of electronic databases included Medline, CINAHL, AMED, and SPORTDiscus. The following last electronic search was run on March 30, 2011. In addition,a secondary search was performed on the reference sec- tions of the relevant articles.

Flatfoot Deformity in Children and Adolescents: Surgical Indications and Management Abstract Most children with flatfeet are asymptomatic and will never require treatment. In general, flatfoot deformity is flexible and will not cause pain or disability; it is a normal variant of foot shape. Thus, it is essential to reassure and educate patients and parents. A flatfoot with a contracture of the Achilles tendon may be painful. In these cases, a stretching program may help relieve pain. Scant convincing evidence exists to support the use of inserts or shoe modifications for effective relief of symptoms, and there is no evidence that those devices change the shape of the foot. The surgeon must be vigilant to identify the rare rigid flatfoot. Indications for flatfoot surgery are strict: failure of prolonged nonsurgical attempts to relieve pain that interferes with normal activities and occurs under the medial midfoot and/or in the sinus tarsi. In nearly all cases, an associated contracture of the heel cord is present. Osteotomies with supplemental soft-tissue procedures are the best proven approach for management of rigid flatfoot. Although flatfoot deformity is a common reason for a child to present for evaluation by a healthcare provider, understanding of the defor- mity and consensus regarding its management is poor, particularly among healthcare providers in differ- ent medical specialties. This is due to several factors, including the poor methodology of published reports, the lack of controlled research studies, and conflicting evidence in the litera- ture. Studying the natural history of the flatfoot is difficult because most affected patients are asymptomatic and do not seek medical attention. Moreover, because no established clinical or radiographic criteria exist to define the flatfoot, the true prev- alence of the deformity is unknown. Traditionally, flatfoot was described as a low or absent medial longitudi- nal arch, with the hindfoot in excessive valgus alignment.1The present consensus is that flexible flatfoot is present from birth and ex- hibits good joint mobility and normal muscle function.1Despite the lack of high-quality research, it is clear that most flatfoot deformities in children are flexible, painless, and functional and do not require treatment. Chil- dren with a painless flatfoot who visit an orthopaedist are generally brought in because their parents are concerned that the foot deformity will cause pain and/or disability in adulthood. The role of the orthopaedist is to reassure patients and parents of children with flexible flatfeet that no treatment is necessary and to identify and treat the rare flatfoot deformities that may become disabling. In their 1947 study of foot pathology in 3,600 Canadian soldiers, Harris and Beath2reported that flatfeet were seen in approximately 23% of the recruits. Sixty-four percent of flatfeet were October 2014, Vol 22, No 10 623Maryse Bouchard, MD, MSc Vincent S.

Evaluation of the results of hindfoot arthrodesis from the published data has been difcult owing to the great variety of pathologic entities and surgical techniques reported in the studies. A comprehensive search for relevant reports, reference lists, and citation tracking of the included studies wasconducted using the PubMed /C210, Embase/C210, and CINAHL/C210databases. The studies had to have been prospective, included patients with hindfoot problems, evaluated arthrodesis of 1 or more tarsal joints, and had at least 1 of the following primary clinical outcome parameters: pain, function, or complications. Two of us independentlyselected the relevant studies using prede ned criteria and graded the quality of evidence using a 0 to 9 star scale according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 16 prospective case series were included; 5 studies scored 6 stars, 8 scored 5 stars, 2 scored 4 stars, and 1 scored 3 stars. A best evidence synthesis was performed, and improvement in function and pain was found for 3 combinations: talonavicular arthrodesis for rheumatoidarthritis, subtalar arthrodesis for post-traumatic arthritis showed good results for pain and function, the last especially when performed arthroscopically. The best evidence syntheses revealed good results for pain and function for these disease-operative technique combinations. /C2112015 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. All rights reserved. Functional impairment of the hindfoot due to pain, deformity, and/ or instability is common in adults. When conservative treatments, such as the use of orthotics and custom made shoe wear, adaptation of one 's activities of daily living, and medications, have failed to resolve the pain and improve function, surgery can be considered. Surgical fusion has long been regarded as a salvage operation for relief of the symptomatic hindfoot because of movement limitations and rela- tively high complication rates. Triple arthrodesis (fusion of the talo-calcaneal, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints) has long been the preferred technique and has been extensively documented by various investigators (1-3). A number of retrospective studies, and a few prospective studies, have documented good functional results and high patient satisfaction rates after hindfoot arthrodesis. In recent years, emphasis has been increasing on single arthrodesis of the tarsal joints, including isolated fusion of the talonavicular (4,5) ,calcaneocuboid (6), and subtalar joint (7-15)to preserve the adjacent unaffected joints. Also, the technique of arthroscopic arthrodesis of hindfoot joints has been described, with promising results (16-18). An important question to answer is which speci c tarsal fusion technique will be most effective with regard to which pathologic entity. Because of the heterogeneity of pathologic entities and patient groups, the variety of surgical techniques, and the lack of disease- speci c and surgery-speci c scoring systems, it has been dif cult to evaluate the results of hindfoot arthrodesis. The rst step in answering this question is to examine the published data regarding outcome studies that were prospective in design and focused only on tarsal (talocalcaneal, calcaneocuboid, and/or talonavicular joint) fusion. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate which speci c tarsal fusion (isolated or combined) was the most effective for the treatment of speci c hindfoot pathologic features.

Question source : HERC staff Issue : Tobacco cessation (line 4) was added to the acupuncture guideline in May, 2016. Previously, there were no session limits for acupuncture to tobacco cessation. The May, 2016 change added the restriction of 12 sessions per year. 12 sessions was chosen to be consistent with the session limits for other conditions. The staff evidence summary from the May meeting is belo w: Four meta -analyses (White 2014, Di 2014, Cheng 2012, and Tahiri 2012) came to varying conclusions [about whether acupuncture alone was effective for tobacco cessation], either finding superiority of acupuncture over control/sham at 0 -6 months or inconcl usive. The d ifferences between the meta -analyses was most attributable to differing methods of pooling. In general, the w idely varying acupuncture t echniques and protocols used in RCTs let to the inability to draw firm conclusions on effectiveness. The general staff conclusion is that acupuncture may be helpful for smoking cessation, and is definitely not harmful. The number of visits used in study protocols ranged from 3-20, but were generally fewer than recommended by experts. There is insufficient evidence about the need to pair acupuncture with other therapies for smoking cessation. The acupuncture guideline was updated at the August, 2016 meeting to limit treatments to a certain number \"per year\" or \"per pregnancy.\" Tobacco cessation was left off that discussion, but will be included in the acupuncture guideline on the October, 2016 Prioritized List. To be consistent with the August, 2016 changes, the acupuncture sessions for tobacco cessation would be limited to 12 per year. However, the ACA mandates two quit attempts be covered per year. The acupuncture guideli ne could be modified to reflect that 12 sessions would be covered for each quit attempt as mandated by the ACA. Note: the ACA does not require acupuncture be covered for tobacco cessation at all. HERC staff have received guidance from the Oregon Departme nt of Justice that tobacco cessation is included under mental health parity and therefore may not be subjected to hard visit numbers. Two possible changes to the acupuncture guideline could be made to accommodate this: either remove tobacco from the guide line and therefore subject to no visit limits or add in wording to make the visit limits \"soft limits.\" Acupuncture Guideline Clarification October 2016 2 HERC staff recommendation s: 1) Modify GN92 as shown below regarding tobacco cessation a.

At the most recent meeting, several changes were made to the proposed guideline. 1) Consider elimination or modification of the language around patients with serious and persistent mental illness 2) Expanding the guideline to include all elective surgical procedures, including podiatry , other dental procedures, and more . Add language about excluding specific categories (such as diagnostic, oncologic, and reproductive). 3) Modify the 6 month cessation language to be more clear for implementation Selected e xcerpts from initial evidence summary Thomsen, 2014 (document not included due to length) 1. Cochrane systematic review of RCTs looking at interventions for preoperative smoking cessation 2. 13 trials including 2010 participants 3. Smoking cessation at least 4 weeks prior to surgery results in improved morbidity 4. Smoking cessation counseling a. Brief interventions ineffective for either complication reduction or lo ng term smoking cessation b. Intensive interventions, defined as weekly face to face for 4 -8 weeks with telephonic support, and with pharmacotherapy (NRT) are effective 5. Optimal period unclear 6. Conclusion: There is evidence that preoperative smoking interventio ns providing behavioral support and offering NRT increase short -term smoking cessation and may reduce postoperative morbidity.

In addition to nicotine and metabolites, tobacco products also contain other alkaloids that can serve as unique markers of tobacco use. Two such markers are anabasine and nornicotine. Anabasine is present in tobacco products, but not nico tine replacement therapies. Nornicotine is present as an alkaloid in tobacco products and as a metabolite of nicotine. presence of anabasine >10 ng/mL or nornicotine >30 ng/mL in urine indicates current tobacco use, irrespective of whether the subject is on nicotine replacement therapy. The presence of nornicotine without anabasine is consistent with use of nicotine replacement products. Heavy tobacco users who abstain from tobacco for 2 weeks exhibit to tobacco smoke can cause accumulation of nicotine metabolites in nontobacco users. Urine cotinine has been observed to accumulate up to 20 ng/mL from passive exposure. Neither anabasine nor nornicotine accumulates from passive exposure. 4.

HERC STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Discuss adoption of a new guideline note: ANCILLARY GUIDELINE NOTE X, SMOKING CESSATION AND ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES Smoking cessation is required prior to elective surgical procedures for active tobacco users. Cessation is required for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure and requires objective evidence of abstinence from smoking prior to the procedure . Elective surgical procedures in this guideline are defined as surgical procedures which are flexible in their scheduling because they do not pose an imminent threat nor require immediate attention within 1 month. Reproductive, cancer - related and diagnostic procedur es are excluded from this guideline. The well -studied tests for confirmation of smoking cessation include cotinine levels and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. However, cotinine level s may be positive in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) users (which is not a contraindication to elective surgery coverage). In patients using NRT the following alternatives to urine cotinine to demonstrate smoking cessation may be considered: o Exhaled carbon monoxide testing (well studied) o Anabasine or anatabine testing For patients with psychosis or cognitive delay, intensive smoking cessation should be offered, but cessation is not required prior to elective surgery if quit attempts exacerbate their mental health . Certain procedures, such as lung volume reduction sur gery, bariatric surgery, erectile dysfunction surgery, and spinal fusion have 6 month tobacco abstinence requirements. See Guideline Notes 8, 100, and 112. Additional issues: Modify guideline notes 8, 100, and 112 : A) to be consistent in requiring cotinine level testing, and B) consider adding language about the frequency of testing.

Congenital Torticollis 1 Question : Where should congenital torticollis be prioritized? Question source : VBBS Issue : At the August, 2016 VBBS meeting, acquired torticollis (ICD -10 M43.6 Torticollis) was removed from line 407 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE and kept only on line 607 DISORDERS OF SOFT TISSUE as an errata. This placement was consistent with previous placement of this code prior to the implementation of the new back lines. At the August meeting, VBBS members expressed concerns that congenital torticollis (ICD (Congenital deformity of sternocleidomastoid muscle) is currently on line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS. HERC staff w as directed to review the evidence for various treatments for congenital torticollis and propose a new line placement which would allow coverage for those treatments found to be effective. VBBS was most interested in having this condition covered in childr en. G24.3 (Spasmodic torticollis) of muscle(s); neck muscle(s), excluding unilateral (eg, for cervical dystonia, spasmodic torticollis)) for botulinum toxin injection but not physical therapy CPT codes (97001, 97002 and similar). The OHP medical directors felt that congenital torticollis was a condition that affected infants and very young children. Once a child has reached the age of approximately 3 years, the condition is harder to treat and neuroplasticity is no longer present. Defects in vision, hearing, and other complications from the torticollis will likely no longer respond to treatment of the torticollis at this point in neurodevelopment. Torticollis in older children may cause disabilities, but these disabilities would likely be treatable using different diagnosis codes.

This decision was based on the fact that 50 -70% of cases of congenital torticollis spontaneously resolve in the first year of life with minimal residual deficits. PT is indicated if complications are not resolving. One review cite d (Do 2003) indicated that botulinum toxi n and surgery may be considered for resistant cases after 6 months of physical therapy.

All patients had excellent results at final assessment, none required surgical intervention. i. N=820 (75.5% of patients): Manual stretching by PT for deficits of passive rotation of the neck of more than 10 degrees, with 3 sessions per week. Therapy stopped when full passive rotation of the neck was regained or there was no further improvement after 6 months of treatment a. Results: Most cases treated with manual stretching showed progressive i mprovement of the range of side flexion, rotation, the head tilt, the craniofacial asymmetry, and a decrease in the tumor size in the SMT group. b. The overall mean duration of treatment with physiotherapy was 118 days (3.9 months). c. The overall final outcom e scores for the manual stretch group were excellent and good in 91.1%. ii.

Suhr and Magdalena Oledzka Purpose of review To present the current literature regarding congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) to promote the most effective and evidence-based intervention. CMT is a musculoskeletal deformity observed at birth or in infancy, characterized by persistent head tilt toward the ipsilateral side with the chin rotated toward the contralateral side. The incidence of torticollis is on the rise and as a result there has been a surge in the literature on the topic, however, until recently, there was little consensus on the treatment approach. Recent findings Research on CMT has gone in several directions. One branch is looking at diagnostics, imaging, and attempting to understand the underlying disease behind torticollis, down to the cellular level. This information may be helpful in the other, more clinical research vein to determine prognosis, establish plan of care, and create guidelines for the treatment of infants with torticollis. Summary CMT presents as a muscular imbalance. We know from the pediatric and adult literature, whether it is about cerebral palsy or anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, that muscle imbalances can lead to skeletal changes, postural dysfunction, and impaired movement patterns. These can lead to functional limitations and limitations in participation. CMT, therefore, needs to be addressed. Although this article presents the current evidence and guidelines for treatment, there is still much to be learned regarding disease, optimal intervention, duration of treatment, and timing of follow-up. Video abstract http://links.lww.com/MOP/A24. Keywords congenital muscular torticollis, conservative management, physical therapy INTRODUCTION Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) is a muscu- loskeletal deformity observed at birth or in infancy, characterized by persistent head tilt toward the involved side with the chin rotated toward the contralateral shoulder [1]. Historically, the inci- dence of CMT was reported to be 0.3-2.0% [1-3]. More recently, the incidence of CMT is on the rise, reported to be as high as 16% in healthy newborns [4] and is likely related to the introduction of the Back to Sleep Campaign in the early 1990s by the American Academy of Pediatrics and similar Euro- pean initiatives [5]. As increasing numbers of infants are presenting to pediatricians, physical therapy clinics, and other specialists, there has been a surge in the literature describing diagnosis, conservative management, and surgical intervention. In this review, we examine the most recent evidence to describe conservative management best practices and to propose areas of future research.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS The general term 'torticollis' refers to the clinical sign of ipsilateral head tilt with contralateral rotation. This may be the result of a variety of medical diagnoses, including those of neurologic, ocular, osseous, gastro- intestinal, and inflammatory origins [6,7&,8]. As CMT isa clinicaldiagnosis, itisimperativethatthe clinician be well educated about all differential diagnoses in order to pursue the most appropriate treatment. For the purpose of this article, we discuss only cases of muscular origin or CMT. Pediatric Rehabilitation, Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, New York, USA Correspondence to Maureen C. Suhr, PT, DPT, PCS, Pediatric Reha- bilitation, Hospital for Special Surgery, 535 East 70th Street, New York, NY www.co-pediatrics.comREVIEW Copyright \u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.CMT may be divided into three groups based upon presentation: infants with sternomastoid tumor - range of motion (ROM) limitations and a palpable, intramuscular, fibrotic mass (fibromatosis colli) in the affected sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle; muscular torticollis - limitations in active and passive cervical ROM because of contracture of the SCM; and postural torticollis - clinical presen- tation of CMT without the presence of tumor or passive ROM restrictions [1,2,8,9&&]. Conservative management of CMT can achieve good-to-excellent outcomes in greater than 90% of cases [1,2]. Prognosis and treatment duration vary depending on infant age at onset of treatment, severity of ROM restrictions, and presence of a fibrous mass in the SCM. In general, earlier diagnosis, less severe ROM restrictions, and an absence of mass correlate with more complete resolution of symp- toms and shorter treatment duration [1,2,9&&,10]. IMAGING Over the last decade, in an effort to understand the cause and disease process of torticollis, an influx of research has occurred in the realm of imaging and diagnosis. Although imaging is not readily available to most therapists in the clinics, it is necessary for the clinicians to understand the implications of the findings and be able to utilize them in establishing prognosis and plan of care. In infants with CMT, ultrasonography is the preferred type of diagnosticimaging [8]. Ultrasound is relatively inexpensive, noninvasive, quick, and a reasonably nonanxiety provoking procedure, which is useful in differential diagnosis [11]. On ultrasound of CMT, particularly in those with sternomastoid tumor or involvement of the entire length of the muscle, the involved SCM appears larger and hyperechoic compared with the uninvolved side [8,11]. This hyperechogenicity is thought to be attributed to fibrosis of the SCM in this population [11] and has been found to correlate with the clinical severity, impacting the treatment outcomes [12,13]. Although ultrasound is the preferred imaging medium, Kwon and Park [11] suggest it may not be sensitive enough to discern the early stages of struc- tural change in the muscle, and Lee et al. [12] describe the potential influence of growth and physiologic change following exercise on ultra- sound readings. They propose the use of real-time sonoelastography to measure tissue elasticity. In sonoelastography, compression of the tissue creates 'strain' or displacement. A harder (less elastic) tissue produces less strain than a more flexible one [11,12]. Kwon and Park divided 50 infants with CMT into 2 groups based on SCM thickness, sonoelastographic score, and the extent of longitudinal involvement in the muscle. Both groups were treated with physical therapy according to a standardized manual therapy protocol and were given a home program. The authors found a significant difference in treatment duration, with the group with the larger, harder SCM, and fibrotic involvement of the entire length of the muscle, having much longer treatment duration and in some instances, incomplete resol- ution of the symptoms [11]. The authors suggest that understanding the SCM's elasticity may guide treatment choice, intensity, and prognosis, indicat- ing that a more fibrotic muscle may benefit from early and aggressive physical therapy management with an expected longer duration of treatment. INTERVENTION In 2013, Ohman et al. [14&] reported the results of a survey of Swedish and Danish therapists who were asked to identify what they found to be the most effective practices in treating CMT. The results showed a high level of agreement among respond- ing therapists regarding the most common inter- ventions (i.e. passive stretching, handling advice for parents and caregivers, facilitation of neck muscle strengthening exercises and active cervical ROM). Responders also agreed upon basic examination; however, there was discrepancy among providers regarding the assessment of hip and hand asymme- try. There is an association reported in the literatureKEY POINTS /C15Diagnostic imaging provides the clinician with an insight into the degree of muscular fibrosis, which may guide treatment choice and intensity, and influence prognosis. /C15In general, delayed diagnosis, more severe restrictions in ROM, and greater fibrotic involvement of the SCM lead to longer duration of treatment or less desirable outcomes. /C15Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines provide clinicians with a foundation for screening, referral, and treatment of CMT. /C15CMT may have long-term developmental consequences. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to determine the optimal follow-up and monitoring. /C15Future research needs to focus on objective diagnostic tools, a simple and reliable method of measuring infant's cervical ROM, effectiveness of manual and supplemental interventions, optimal dosage, and parental perceptions of the diagnosis and treatment.Orthopedics 76 www.co-pediatrics.com Volume 27 /C15Number 1 /C15February 2015The Clinical Presentation and Outcome of Treatment of Congenital Muscular Torticollis in Infants\u2014AStudy of 1,086 Cases By J.C.Y. S.P . Tang, T.M.K. Chen, M.W.N. Wong, and E.M.C. Wong Hong Kong Background/Purpose: The main objectives of this study were to define the clinical patterns and characteristics of congeni- tal muscular torticollis (CMT) presented in the first year of lifeand to study the outcome of different treatment methods. Methods: This is a prospective study of all CMT patients seen in 1 center over a 12-year period with uniform recordingsystem, assessment methods, and treatment protocol. Results: From a total of 1,086 CMT infants, 3 clinical groups group was found to present earlierwithin the first 3 months and was associated with higherincidence of breech presentation (19.5%), difficult labor (56%), and hip dysplasia (6.81%). Severity of limitation of passiveneck rotation range (ROTGp) was found to correlate signifi-cantly with the presence of SMT, bigger tumor size, hip dysplasia, degree of head tilt, and craniofacial asymmetry. Conclusions: A total of 24.5% of the patients with initial deficits of passive rotation of less than 10\u00b0 showed excellentand good outcome with active home positioning and stimula-tion program. The remaining cases with rotation deficits ofover 10\u00b0 and treated with manual stretching program showedan overall excellent to good results in 91.1% with 5.1%requiring subsequent surgical treatment. The most importantprognostic factors for the necessity of surgical treatmentwere the clinical subgroup, the ROTGp, and the INDEX WORDS: Torticollis, outcome. TORTICOLLIS in Latin means twisted neck and was rst dened by Tubby in 1912 as ''A deformity, either congenital or acquired, characterized by lateral inclinationoftheheadtotheshoulder,withtorsionoftheneck and deviation of the face.'' 1The term congenital muscular torticollis has been used by investiga- tors2-8to denote a neck deformity primarily involving shorteningofthesternomastoidmusclethatisdetectedatbirth or shortly after birth. This clearly should bedifferentiated from many other congenital and acquiredtypes of torticollis such as congenital cervical vertebralanomalies, infections and inflammation ofadjacent structures, neoplastic conditions, and miscella-neous types of structural and functional neurologicalcauses. In infants with torticollis, the head typically istilted toward the side of the affected muscle and rotatedtowardtheoppositeside.Inmanycases,amassortumorcan be palpated in the involved muscle. Skull and facialasymmetry or plagiocephaly also may be present. Al-though a combination of various theories has beenproposed, the true etiology of torticollis remains uncer-tain. Among them is birth trauma, which proposed thatcongenitally shortened sternomastoid muscle was torn atbirth with the possible arethe hereditary hypothesis, neurogenic theory, and the infectiontheory.7,12Oneofthelatesthypothesesproposed thattheconditioncouldbethesequelofanintrauterineorperinatalcompartmentsyndrome. 13 Macdonald further divided the congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) into sternomastoid tumor group (SMT)and those with tightness of the sternocleidomastoidmuscle (SCM) but no clinical ''tumor'' as musculartorticollis (MT). 8Postural torticollis (POST) was used to describe those congenital torticollis with all the clinicalfeatures of torticollis but with no demonstrable tightnessnor tumor of the sternomastoid muscle. 6However, such distinction of postural torticollis from the CMT was notmade clearly in the literature and in most series the termCMTwould include all these 3 groups.

There are a number ofinherent problems when one reviews the literature of thepast 100 years. Most series are historical series based onsmall numbers over long period of time. Most studiesinclude mixed clinical group of early and late presenta-tion cases without clear indications for treatment norstandardsubjectivenorobjectiveassessmentmethods.Asa result, the conclusions based on the condition and theoutcome of treatment are not comparable among thedifferentseries. The current study is a prospective study of all CMT patients seen in 1 center over a 12-year period with auniform recording system and assessment methodology.This study is an extension of 1 of our previous studies 14 with larger number of patients, many longer follow-upperiods, and more detailed outcome analysis with aspecial scoring system. The main objectives were todene the clinical patterns and characteristics of CMTininfants presenting in the rst year of life using standardgrouping and assessment methods and to use this as abasis to study the outcome of a well-dened treatmentprotocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients less than 1 year of age with torticollis treated in the special Children's Torticollis Clinic center from 1985 to 1997 were included in the study. Patients with acute torticollis, congenital anoma-lies of the cervical spine, spasmodic torticollis, and other forms ofneurogenic, ocular, and organic torticollis were excluded from thestudy. The following information was recorded: sex, the age atpresentation, the side of the torticollis, birth history and obstetric data,presence of hip dysplasia, associated spinal and musculoskeletalanomalies, the presence of head tilt and craniofacial asymmetry, thelimitationofrangeofmotionoftheneckinrotation,andsideflexionascompared with the normal side. All the data were analyzed indepen-dentlybyoneoftheauthors. Clinical Groups of Congenital Muscular Torticollis All the cases of congenital torticollis were subdivided into the following 3 clinical groups: (1) SMT group with denite presence ofclinically palpable sternomastoid ''tumor,'' (2) MT group\u2014musculartorticollis group without palpable or visible tumor but with clinicalthickeningortightnessofthesternomastoidmuscleontheaffectedside,and (3) POST group\u2014a third group without features of the above 2groups; most patients in this group had postural head tilt or late-onsetoculartorticollis. Measurement of Limitation of Range of Motion of the Neck Range of motion of the neck was measured using the arthrodial protractor with the baby or child in the supine position, with theshoulder stabilized and the head and neck supported by the examiner overtheedgeoftheexaminationcouchsothattheneckisfreetorotateand move in all directions (Fig 1). This position also would allow adetailed examination of the neck and the whole SM muscle from theorigin to the clavicular and sternal insertion. Clinical experiencesuggested that the rotation element (ROT) is easier to measure withgoodinterexaminerreliabilityandisthuspreferredbytherapiststoside flexion. 14,17The passive range of motion of neck were assessed and compared with the normal side. The limitations in passive ROT were recorded for data analysis and were subclassied into 4 subgroupsaccording to the severity of passive neck ROT decits: ROTGp I, noactual ROTlimitation; ROT limitation of 16\u00b0 to 30\u00b0; ROTGp IV, ROTlimitationofmorethan30\u00b0.

Treatment Protocol Home treatment group. For cases of minimum decits of passive rotation of less than 10\u00b0, an active home stimulation exercise andpositioning program were used.Astandard brochure and a set of slidestoillustratethehomeprogramwereusedtoenhancetheinstructionsandtraining of the caretaker. The accuracy of the home exercises wasconrmedandcheckedbytheauthoratregularintervals.Theendpointof treatment was the attainment of full or less than 5\u00b0 of limitation ofpassiverotationoftheneck. Manualstretchinggroup. Theindicationsformanualstretchingare for patients who have obvious CMT and are less than 1 year old withdecits of passive rotation of the neck of more than 10\u00b0 irrespective oftheclinicalgroups. Manual stretching was done by properly trained and experienced physiotherapists with a standardized program 3 times per week.Treatment duration was dened as the time between the initialassessment and the time that full passive rotation of the neck wasregained or when there was no further improvement shown after morethan6monthsoftreatment. Surgical treatment group. The indications for surgery were for patients with signicant head tilt and decits of passive rotation andsideflexionoftheneckgreaterthan10\u00b0to15\u00b0andthepresenceoftightband or tumor in the SCM. They either have not responded to orimproved additionally after at least 6 months of physiotherapy manualstretching. For the majority of patients a uniform method of distalunipolar open release and partial excision of the clavicular and sternalheads of the sternomastoid muscle was done. Postoperatively, anintensive program of physiotherapy was prescribed that included scartreatment,maintenanceoffullpassiverangeofmotionoftheneck,andactivestrengtheningexerciseforaperiodof3to4months. Follow-UpAssessments All patients were followed up regularly in the Torticollis Clinic with detaildocumentationoftheheadtilt,activeandpassiverangeofmotionof rotation and side flexion of the neck, facial asymmetry, size of thetumor and time of disappearance of tumor, and treatment duration.

There also was astatistically signicant correlation between the ROTGpIII and IV with the severity of head tilt and craniofacialasymmetry. Results of Treatment According to the criteria and treatment protocol, 266 patients (24.5%) received active treatment at home, and 820patients(75.5%)receivedmanualstretchingtherapy.The mean follow-up of the patients was 4.5 years with arangefrom1.5yearsto13years.

Thebreakdownofthepatientsshowedthat24.2%belongedtotheSMTgroup,17.6%totheMTgroup,and58.1%tothePOST group. Of all the cases, 5% were changed to themanual stretching group when no improvement was seenwithin 4 weeks after the start of treatment. They all hadexcellent results at the nal assessment. No patientrequiredsurgicalinterventionatthenalassessment. The majority of the 820 cases treated with manual stretching program belonged to the SMT group (55.1%),followed by MT(33.6%) and POST(11.3%). Most casestreated with manual stretching showed progressive im-provement of the range of side flexion, rotation, the headtilt, the craniofacial asymmetry, and a decrease in thetumor size in the SMT group. The overall mean durationof treatment with physiotherapy was 118 days (3.9months).

DISCUSSION TheoverallincidenceofCMTfromourpreviousstudy of over 250,000 infants was found to be 1.3%.14The current series differed from that of the literature in manyaspects. First, we use a uniform classication system tosubdividetheCMTpatientsinto3clinicalgroups\u2014thosewith SMT, the group with MT, and the POST groups.From the detailed analysis of the 1,086 cases presentedearly in the rst year, the SMT group was the largestgroup (47.2%), a nding comparable with study byCanale et al 2who reported that one third of their patients treatedforCMThadahistoryofpseudotumorofinfancy.SMTwasfoundinthisseriestobeassociatedwithearlierclinical presentation, much higher incidence of breechpresentation, vacuum extraction, and incidence of hipdysplasia. Secondly, to quantitatively document the severity of thetorticollisthisserieshasusedthelimitationofrotationoftheneckastheobjectiveindexassessment.Thenormalrange of rotation in infants is about 110\u00b0 rather than theoftenthought90\u00b0.Itisimportanttostressthatthepassiverotation only can be measured properly in the mannerdescribed above in the Methodology section. Such mea-surement was based on an interexaminer reliability studysimilar to that reported by Cheng andAu 14and Binder et al.17In addition the study also showed that the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.789 ( P,.001) indicating a good correlation between rotation and passive side flex-ion. Hence, in this study the passive ROT was use alone for measurement of neck range in torticollis. It was clearfrom the results that the ROTGp IV, ie, those withlimitation of over 30\u00b0 had a signicantly higher correla-tion with breech presentation, vacuum extraction rate,craniofacial asymmetry, head tilt, and earlier presenta-tion.Atotalof95.8%oftheROTGpIVwerefoundintheSMTgroupinstrongcontrasttothePOSTgroupinwhich97.5%ofthecaseswereintheROTGpIorII.Forthehipdysplasia 0% occurred in the ROTGp I in contrast to5.9% in the ROTGp III and 10.92% in the ROTGp IV(P,.0001) a nding similar to that of Binder et al 17in 1987. In the literature, hip dysplasia was reported in 8%to 20%. 18-20However, these papers made no further breakdown according to the severity of the torticollis. Itshould be noted that the presence of tumor is not alwaysassociated with a reduction in neck range. In fact, 6% oftheSMTgroupfellintoROTGpIwithnoactualdecreaseinrotationoftheneck. The POST group in this series (22.1%) represented caseswithsignsofheadtiltandminorornoactualdecitin the passive rotation. They resembled the group ofposturaltorticollisassuggestedbyHulbert. 6Thesignsof transient head tilt probably could be secondary to abnor-mal fetal position without structure alteration in thesternomastoid muscle. The MT group behaves similarlytotheSMTgroupandcouldrepresentalessseveregroup. Although it is well accepted that late cases with a denite tight band of the SCM should be treated opera-tively, there is no clear consensus on the management ofearly cases. Despite the controversies, manual stretchingstill is the most commonly practiced treatment for SMTand MT with reported good success rates varying from61% to 85%. 2,4,5,6,11,17,21-24In this series, the treatments were divided into 3 groups as dened in the treatmentprotocol. A total of 24.5% of the CMT patients withdecits of rotation of the neck of less than 10\u00b0 weretreated with active home positioning program with uni-formly good results with the exception of 5% of thepatients who were changed to the manual stretchinggroup with ultimate excellent to good results. A total of75.5% (820 case) with initial limitation of passiverotation of over 10\u00b0 were treated with manual stretchingprograminastandardprotocolforameandurationof3.9months with an overall nal outcome of 91.1% excellentto good results. The SMT group had 12.2% fair to poor results and 7.6% necessitating surgery later. The MTgroup had better overall result of 6.2% poor to fairoutcome and 3.1% with resultant surgery. The POSTgroup had excellent result, and no case require surgery.Multivariateanalysisalsohasshownclearlythatthemostimportant prognostic factors for surgical treatment werethe more severe ROT group, the clinical type, and lateageofpresentation(P 5.0006to.012).

In patients operatedonatage6monthsto2yearsofage,excellentresultscanbe achieved by unipolar lower pole transverse incision,excision of 1 cm of the sternomastoid tumor, carefulrelease of all tight fascia bands, followed by an intensivepostoperativephysiotherapystretchingprogramforupto3 months. In all the surgical cases, facial asymmetryshowed signicant progressive improvement with mildresidual asymmetry found in less than 30% at the nalassessment. 25 The results of this study showed much better overall results with very low operation rate than most series.2,4- 6,11,15,17,21-24Thismaybebecauseofthefactthatthereisa clear treatment protocol and all manual stretching con-ducted by trained physiotherapists rather than by parentsas practiced in other studies. In addition, the majority ofpatients in this series presented early in the rst fewmonths of life, and treatment can be started relativelyearly and monitored carefully in the special torticollisclinic. AlthoughtheclinicalgroupingofPOST,MT,andSMT mayjustreflectaspectrumofseverityofCMT,theresultsofthisstudyhaveshownconvincinglythatsuchgroupingand assessment technique has denite clinically signi-cant diagnostic and prognostic value and could provide agoodbasisformorerationalstudyoftheproblem.

W ONG , MA Investigation performed at The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China Background: The natural history of congenital muscular torticollis and the outcome of different treatment modali- ties have been poorly investigated, and the results of treatment have varied considerably. Methods: The main objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of 821 consecutive patients with congenital muscular torticollis who were first seen when they were less than one year old, were treated witha standardized program of manual stretching, and were followed for a mean of 4.5 years. Before treatment, thepatients were classified into one of three clinical groups: (1) palpable sternomastoid tumor, (2) muscular torticol- lis (thickening and tightness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle), and (3) postural torticollis (torticollis but no tightness or tumor).Results: Of the 821 patients, 452 (55%) had a sternomastoid torticollis. Multivariate analysis of the outcomes showed that (1) the duration of treatment wassignificantly associated with the clinical group (p < 0.0001), a passive rotation deficit of the neck (p < 0.0001),involvement of the right side (p < 0.0001), difficulties with the birth (p < 0.009), and age at presentation (p <0.0001); (2) the overall final assessment score was associated with the rotation deficit (p = 0.02), age at presenta- tion (p = 0.014), and duration of treatment (p < 0.0001); and (3) subsequent surgical treatment was required by 8% (thirty-four) of the 452 patients in the sternomastoid tumor group compared with 3% (eight) of the 276 patients inthe muscular torticollis group and 0% (none) of the ninety-three patients in the postural torticollis group. Conclusions: This large prospective study demonstrated that controlled manual stretching is safe and effective in the treatment of congenital muscular torticollis when a patient is seen before the age of one year. The mostimportant factors that predict the outcome of manual stretching are the clinical group, the initial deficit in rotation of the neck, and the age of the patient at presentation. Surgical treatment is indicated when a patient has under- gone at least six months of controlled manual stretching and has residual head tilt, deficits of passive rotationand lateral bending of the neck of >15\u00b0, a tight muscular band or tumor, and a poor outcome according to ourspecial assessment chart. he reported prevalence of congenital muscular torticol- lis has ranged from 0.3% (fifteen of 5079 live births) to2.0% (forty-three of 2190 live births) 1-7. The typical le- sion is a hard mass within the substance of a tight sterno- cleidomastoid muscle. It is often recognized when a child isone to four weeks old. The size of the lesion ranges from 1 to 3cm in its largest transverse diameter. It is firm and smooth,movable beneath the skin, and apparently tender to touch 8. After reaching its maximum size, the mass gradually recedes at varying rates within the first year and, in most patients, the muscle tightness subsides after the mass has resolved. In somepatients, large portions of the muscle may become fibrotic.Secondary or associated skull and facial asymmetry or plagio- cephaly are often found. Macdonald 9 divided patients with congenital muscular torticollis into two groups: those with a sternomastoid tumor and those with tightness of the sternocleidomastoid but noclinical tumor, which he termed muscular torticollis.

The incidence of congenital mus- cular torticollis has been reported to be 3.92 percent in neonates. 1,2 Congenital muscu- lar torticollis might be defined as a developmen-tal disorder of the sternocleidomastoid muscle characterized by fibrosis, which results in the shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. 3 This leads to limited neck motion and secondary musculoskeletal complications such as craniofa-cial deformity and scoliosis. 3 Approximately 80 to 90 percent of congenital muscular torticollis cases resolve with stretching exercises without evident Disclosure: The authors have no financial interests regarding the content of this article.

This systematic review aims to examine the literature describing the effectiveness of surgery for ne-glected congenital muscular torticollis.Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review to examine the effec-tiveness of surgical treatment for neglected congenital muscular torticollis by means of meta-analysis. The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Co-chrane library, and KoreaMed for all articles published before May of 2014. Studies with quantitative data describing the effectiveness of surgery for con-genital muscular torticollis were included. The primary outcomes after surgery were (1) clinical outcome measured by scoring systems; (2) change in range of motion of the neck; and (3) change in skeletal deformities, measured by Cobb angle and the cervicomandibular angle. Effect estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis.Results: Twelve studies were included in the review (published between 1976 and 2014), including a total of 220 patients with neglected congenital mus-cular torticollis. All studies used an interrupted time-series design. Surgical treatment was successful in 81 percent of cases, based on the scoring systems for surgical outcome. Outcomes of surgery performed in patients older than 15 years did not differ significantly from those of surgery performed in pa-tients aged 15 years or younger. The range of motion of the neck and skeletal deformities showed significant improvement after surgery.Conclusions: Surgical treatment for neglected congenital muscular torticollis produced satisfactorily successful results, with improvement in both the range of motion of the neck and secondary skeletal IV.

PEDIATRIC/CRANIOFACIALVIDEO Botulinum toxin injection for congenital muscular torticollis presenting in children and adultsAbstract\u2014 Congenital muscular torticollis may present in late childhood or adulthood with cervical contractures, limited range of motion, pain, and mus-cular hypertrophy. Seven of eight pediatric and adult patients with congenitalmuscular torticollis were injected with botulinum toxin type A. Only two pa-tients had a modest benefit with improved range of motion. Early recognitionand treatment of congenital muscular torticollis is crucial to prevent subse-quent contractures and other complications. NEUROLOGY 2006;67:1083-1085 Abigail Collins, MD; and Joseph Jankovic, MD Congenital muscular torticollis is a relatively com- mon musculoskeletal condition of infancy that pre-sents as a head tilt with limited range of neckmotion. 1The prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 2.0%.2 If inadequately treated, cervical muscles fibrose re-sulting in progressive limitation of head movementand craniofacial asymmetry, compensatory scoliosis,plagiocephaly, and elevation of the ipsilateral shoul-der that worsens with age. We review here a series ofpediatric and adult patients presenting with congen-ital muscular torticollis. Methods. We reviewed medical records of all consecutive pa- tients with congenital muscular torticollis. Eight of 10 identifiedcases satisfied the following diagnostic criteria: abnormal headposture with limitation of neck motion noted within the first yearof life. Two patients were excluded because of insufficient clinicalinformation. Videotapes of patients taken on presentation werereviewed, and illustrative cases were selected. Permissions tovideo were obtained from all patients or their parents who signedan informed consent approved by the Baylor College of MedicineInstitutional Review Board. Results. The 10 patients with congenital muscular tor- ticollis in our database represent 0.6% of the total of1,644 pediatric and adult patients referred for cervicaldystonia evaluation at the Movement Disorders Clinic,Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, between1981 and 2005. First noted to have torticollis from birthup to age 3 months, the patient ranged in age from 6months to 41 years old at presentation (table 1). Pre-senting symptoms included a head tilt with or withoutassociated pain, muscular hypertrophy, and tightness ofneck muscles. Three patients reported gradual progres-sion of stiffness and pain, and two reported progressive shoulder elevation. At the time of initial evaluation, sev-eral patients had received previous interventions includ-ing physical therapy (PT) and oral medications, but onlyone received botulinum toxin injection, with poor re-sponse (table 1). Initial examination revealed a head tilt with de- creased range of neck motion in all patients (table 2)(video segments 1 and 2 on the Neurology Web site at www.neurology.org). There was shortening and tighten-ing of the SCM in all cases, with thick band formationdescribed in six of the eight cases. Additional findingsincluded muscular hypertrophy of the contralateralSCM, ipsilateral trapezius, or scalenus muscles, andshoulder elevation. All cases, except Case 8, had subjec-tive craniofacial asymmetry ranging from mild to severe.None of the patients had head tremor, commonly seen incervical dystonia. Seven of the eight patients received botulinum toxin type A (BTX) injections into affected neck muscles (table3). Two patients (Cases 1 and 2) had moderate improve-ment in range of motion (ROM), whereas four had poorresponse without change in pain or ROM. Case 8 under-went PT initiated at age 3 months and had complete reso-lution of congenital muscular torticollis requiring nofurther intervention, including BTX. Discussion. This report is the first study to de- scribe the effects of nonsurgical treatment, i.e., BTX,in congenital muscular torticollis presenting in latechildhood and adulthood. Although a modest benefitmay be obtained in some cases, our results empha-size the importance of early intervention with PT orBTX to prevent the long-term complications of con-genital muscular torticollis. Distinguishing congenital from adult-onset etiolo- gies of torticollis is important, because their treat-ments and outcomes differ widely. Besides a historyof head tilt since infancy and lack of tremor, otherfeatures evident in congenital muscular torticollis,but usually absent in cervical dystonia, include con-stant nature of the head tilt and abnormal neck pos-ture, lack of improvement with sensory tricks, andpresence of craniofacial asymmetry. Muscular hyper-trophy occurs in both conditions. Cervical dystonia israre in childhood 3and typically presents as episodic paroxysmal torticollis within the first year of life.4 Inherited errors of metabolism, such as aromaticAdditional material related to this article can be found on the Neurology Web site.

CD has a great impact on the activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life. Currently, the most widely used and recommended first line treatment is botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) injections. Physiotherapy is a potentially useful adjuvant, but little is known about its effectiveness. Consequently, our objective was to investigate the effec\u00ad tiveness of physiotherapy alone or as an adjuvant treat~ent to BoNT/A injections in cervical dystonia (CD) by means of a systematic literature review. Two online databases, PubMed and Web of Science, were searched for articles describing the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment for CD. After screening, based on predefined in-and exclusion criteria, 16 studies were retained. Their methodological quality was assessed according to Cochrane guidelines. The methodological quality of most studies was low. Examples of shortcomings are small sample sizes, lack of randomization or blinding, and diversity in therapeutic techniques and outcome measures.

Improvements in head position, pain, cervical range of motion, quality of life and ADL have been reported, which is promising.

Cervical dystonia is considered a form of primary adult\u00ad onset focal dystonia [1, 2]. The prevalence numbers of CD vary, ranging from 2.3/100,000 to 390/100,000 [3, 4]. This wide range can be explained by the application of various definitions, e.g. by including non-focal dystonia or gen\u00ad eralized dystonia or by regional differences. The reported numbers are also believed to underestimate the true prev\u00ad alence due to delayed diagnostics and because only diag\u00ad nosed cases are included [4-7]. CD can be considered an important health problem with a devastating impact on all levels of functioning and personal factors of individuals. For instance, CD affects a person's working capacity and sleeping quality [8-12]. Also, more frequent psychiatric comorbidity as well as a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders have been demonstrated in patients with CD in comparison with healthy controls [13-15]. ~Springer Section 7.0 Coverage Guidances 1 RHEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) COVERAGE GUIDANCE : NONINVASIVE TESTING FOR LIVER FIBROSIS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS C DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6 /2016 HERC Coverage Guidance If a fibrosis score of F2 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C , the following are recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) : Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) (Virtual T tissue quantification, ElastPQ) Shear wave elastography (SWE) (Aixplorer \u00ae) Blood tests (only if imaging tests are unavailable) : Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) Fibrometer FIBRO Spect \u00ae II If a fibrosis score of F3 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C , one or more of the following are recommended for coverage (strong recommendation ): Imaging tests: Transient elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) Shear wave elastography (SWE) Magnetic resonance elastography is recommended for coverage for F2 or F3 only whe n at least one imaging test (FibroScan, ARFI, and SWE) has resulted in indeterminant results, a second one is similarly indeterminant, contraindicated or unavailable, and MRE is readily available (weak recommendation).

RATIONALE FOR DEVELOP MENT OF COVERAGE GUI DANCES AND MULTISECTOR INTERVEN TION REPORTS Coverage guidances are developed to inform covera ge recommendations for public and private health plans in Oregon as they seek to improve patient experience of care, population health and the cost - effectiveness of health care. In the era of the Affordable Care Act and health system transformation, reachi ng these goals may require a focus on population -based health interventions from a variety of sectors as well as individually -focused clinical care. Multisector intervention reports will be developed to address these population -based health interventions o r other types of interventions that happen outside of the typical clinical setting. HERC selects topics for its reports to guide public and private payers based on the following principles: 3 Noninvasive Testing for Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Represents a significant burden of disease or health problem Repre sents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Our reports are based on a review of the relevant research applicable to the intervention(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on clinical interventions and modes of care, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of the GRADE methodology. For more information on coverage guidance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat or manage disease at a population level. For some conditions, the HERC has reviewed evidence and identified effective interventions, but has not made coverage recommendations, as many of the se policies are implemented in settings beyond tradition al healthcare delivery systems. 4 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evi dence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, wh ich in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assess ment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidence -based Policy . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission.

Given that both serum and noninvasive tests are less invasive that biopsy , it is likely that more patients will be referred for, and receive treatment with noninvasive testing . Some patients who have noninvasive tests Most patients would strongly prefer to have a noninvasive test over a liver biopsy in order to avoid the procedural risks associated with the biopsy. Policy makers will need to balance the value of this greater access to less sensitive/specific tests with the Guidelines are mixed in their recommendations about the use of serum biomarker testing as an adjunct or alternative to imaging.

It could be equally appropriate to do a second imaging test versus going straight to liver biopsy depending on the institution and availability of nearby alternatives.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Balance of benefits and harms : Given the good (F2) and excellent (F3) performance of the recommended imaging tests and the potential harms of liver biopsy, the balance is strongly in favor of offering these tests as an option for patients for whom Hepatitis C direct -acting antiviral therapy is being considered. Because these tests sometimes return inconclusive results, additional testing including liver bi opsy may still be required for some patients. Though they are inferior to the recommended imaging tests, blood tests also have a good performance at the F2 threshold and h ave a favorable balance when imaging tests are unavailable and biopsy is not required. Rationale: The diagnostic operating characteristic of the recommended imaging tests are good to excellent (defined as an AUROC 0.8). Patient - oriented health outcomes are not available. However, given the characteristics of the tests, the strong values and preferenc es for noninvasive tests when results are comparable, and the improved individual -level resource allocation, these tests are recommended for coverage . The strong recommendation for imaging tests when the cutoff is F3 is due to the excellent performance at this level of cutoff (defined as an AUROC 0.9) and the other factors in favor of their use. The weak recommendation at the F2 c utoff is based on \"good\" but not \" excellent \" performance, and the high societal cost of treating patients at levels of fibrosis who are not at short -term risk . The diagnostic operating characteristics of the blood tests are variable. Though tests recommended at the F2 threshold can accurately assess the fibrosis stage F2 or higher, they are inferior to the imaging tests at this level, and expert input suggests less clinically reliable, and so are recommended only when imaging tests are unavailable. No existing blood test can accurately distinguish between F2 and F3 . Therefore, blood tests cannot be recommended (alone or in combination with noninvasive imaging tests) when the treatment planning re volves around an accurate diagnosis of F3. Many of the non-recommended blood tests have fair to poor operating characteristics regardless of the treatment threshold . MRE is much more expensive than the other imaging tests and thus is only recommended when available after two other imaging tests f ail to return useful results. Recommendation: If a fibrosis score of F2 is the threshold for antiviral treatment of Hepatitis C, the f ollowing are recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) : Imaging tests: 10 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Coverage question: Should noninvasive testing for liver fibrosis for chronic hepatitis C be recommended for coverage?

A GRADE Evidence Profile is provided in Appendix B. 11 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease in the United States, and chronic hepatitis C infection is the leading indication for liver transplantation (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2016). The CDC estimates that 3.5 million people in the United States are currently infected with HCV, though the precise number is not known. One study cited by the CDC estimated that around 15,000 deaths were attributable to HCV in 2007. Well established modes of transmission for HCV infect ion include injection drug use and receipt of blood products prior to 1992 . According to the CDC, the prevalence of HCV infection among injection drug users ranges from about 30% for younger users (aged 18 to 30) to 70 -90% for older injection drug users. The natural history of HCV infection is variable, and 15 -25% of people will clear the infection and not develop chronic hepatitis C. Between 5% and 20% of those with HCV i nfection will develop cirrhosis, generally over the course of 20 to 30 years, and between 1% and 5% will die from HCV -related liver disease (CDC, 2016). There are no highly accurate tools to predict which individuals with chronic hepatitis C will go on to develop cirrhosis. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends b irth-cohort screening for hepatitis C for anyone born between 1945 and 1965 . HCV testing is also recommended for those in high risk groups included people with a history of injection drug use, those who received blood products before 1992, those with HIV infection, and those born to HCV -positive m others (CDC, 2016). Before 2013, treatment for chronic hepatitis C relied on interferon and ribavirin, sometimes with the addition of a protease inhibitor in the case of genotype 1 infections. These treatments were long (24 to 48 weeks), entailed a high bu rden of adverse effects, and response rates were highly variable. The advent of direct -acting antiviral treatments (i.e. sofosbuvir, simeprevir, and others) appears to have improved the success rates (as measured by the surrogate marker of sustained virolo gic response at 12 weeks) and acceptability of treatment, though at considerable cost. Traditionally, staging of chronic hepatitis C infection was done by examining histologic specimens from liver biopsies of the liver for evidence of fibrosis. The METAVI R fibrosis stage is the most commonly used measure for assessing the histologic degree of hepatic fibrosis: F0 = No fibrosis F1 = Portal fibrosis septa F2 = Portal fibrosis with few septa = fibrosis with = Cirrhosis Progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis is associated with complications of end -stage liver disease including portal hypertension, portosystemic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis have developed as an alternative to biopsy for staging chronic hepatitis C infection. 12 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Indications In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, the likelihood of progression is closely correlated with the presence and severity of liver fibrosis (Chou et al., 2013). Thus, tests to diagnose the presence and ascertain the degree of fibrosis are indicated in the staging of patients with chronic hepatitis C, particularly when that information is relevant to decisions about HCV treatment. For instance, accurate determination of fibrosis stage is essential when treatment eligibility decisions are made on the basis of fibrosis severity. Beyond decisions about HCV treatment, tests to determine the presence of cirrhosis may be indicated in order to ensure appropriat e supportive care and screening for complications of cirrhosis for these patients. Until recently, the only options for staging fibrosis in hepatitis C patients was histological examination of the by biopsy entails procedural risks (including bleeding, infection, and pain), and the results are prone to sampling and interpretation errors. Despite these drawbacks, liver biopsy remains the \"gold standard\" for the diagnos is of fibrosis and cirrhosis (Chou et al., 2013). The accuracy of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis are measured against the reference standard of the results from a liver biopsy, using these definitions: Sensitivity refers to the proportion of patients who actually have the condition in question who have a positive test result. Specificity refers to the proportion of patients who really do not have the condition in question who have a negative test result. Positive likelihood ratio is the ratio of the p robability of a positive test result in a patient with the condition to the probability of a positive test result in a patient without the condition. Likelihood ratios are most useful when the pre -test probability of the condition is known and the post -test probability at which treatment would be recommended is well established. Negative likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in a patient with the condition to the probability of a negative test in a patient without the conditio n. The receiver operating curve (ROC) is a graphical illustration of the trade -off between sensitivity and specificity for an index diagnostic test (specifically for a test that has continuous rather than binary, or yes/no results) compared to a reference standard. The \"index\" test refers to the test that we are looking at to see how good it is. The reference standard has sometimes been referred to as the \"gold standard,\" but given that some reference standards are not themselves perfectly accurate the ter minology has s hifted to \"reference standard.\" The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) is an overall measure of how well the index test compares to the reference standard across a range of possible cutoffs. An index test that has cutoff value th at allows perfect sensitivity and specificity (i.e. perfect classification of those with and without the condition) would have an AUROC of 1.0, while an AUROC of 0.5 represents a useless test (no better than a coin flip, on average). A test with an 13 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 AUROC o f 0.8 0-0.89 is generally regarded as a good test, while tests with an AUROC >0.90 are regarded as excellent tests . These distinctions are conventional, but arbitrary. Technology description Noninvasive techniques for staging liver fibrosis include imaging and blood tests. Five types of imaging tests are available: transient elastography (TE), acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI), shear wave elastography (SWE), magnetic resonance elastography -time tissue elastography (RTE). Transient Elastography (FibroScan\u00ae) measures the velocity of a low -frequency (50 Hz) elastic shear wave propagating through the liver. The velocity of the wave indicates the tissue stiffness, with the stiffe r the tissue, the faster the shear wave propagates. The patient lies supine during the procedure, which takes less than five minutes. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (Virtual T ouch tissue quantification, ElastP Q) measures the speed of short -durat ion acoustic pulses that propagate shear waves and generate localized displacements in liver tissue. Commercial ultrasound machines can be easily modified to implement ARFI. Shear wave elastography (Aixplorer\u00ae Supersonic Imagine) creates ultrasonic beams t hat are focused on liver tissues, and a very high frame rate ultrasound imaging sequences monitors the transient propagation of the shear waves in real time. This procedure can be implemented on commercial ultrasound machines. Magnetic resonance elastograp hy images the propagation characteristics of a shear wave in the liver using a modified phase -contrast method. Almost the entire liver can be analyzed with MRE, and it can be used effectively in patients with obesity or ascites. This procedure is more cost ly and more time consuming than the other imaging techniques. Real -time tissue elastography constructs elasticity images of the liver by measuring the tissue strain induced by compression from a high -frequency ultrasound scanner. Tissue compression produce s strain in the tissue, where the strain is smaller in harder tissue than in softer tissue. Five proprietary blood testing protocols are available in the U.S., which use a combination of biochemical markers and patented algorithms to determine fibrosis st age. There are 25 additional blood tests that are not proprietary. The components of these blood tests are shown in Table 1 below. The most common components of the blood tests are platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransfer ase (ALT). About half of the tests include patient's age in the algorithm. 14 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table 1: Blood Tests f or Measuring Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Hepatitis C Blood tests Components of test/algorithm Proprietary tests ELF Test (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis ) Hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of age and gender FIBROSpect\u00ae II Hyaluronic acid, (GGT), and patient's age and gender ActiTest\u00ae is alanine Age-platelet index (ALT), p rothrombin 15 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Blood tests Components of test/algorithm Fibrosis probability index (Sud index) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol, insulin resistance, alcohol intake, and patient's age Fibrosis -protein index (GGT), and prothrombin index HALT -C model (Hepatitis C Antiviral Long -Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis ) Platelet count, (AST), international normalized ratio and index Platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and inhibitor 1 (TIMP - and patient's Adapted from Chou & Wasson (2013) Key Q uestions and Outcomes The following key questions (KQ) guided the evidence search and review described below.

What is the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests for the diagnosis and management of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C? 2. Does the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C vary based on: a. Duration of infection b. Fibrosis score c. Body habitus d. Operator/interpreter training or experience e. Co-existence of other etiologies of liver disease (e.g., non -alcoholic steatohepatiti s) 3. What are the comparative diagnostic operating characteristics of tests of liver fibrosis? 4. What is the evidence for the timing of the initial testing for fibrosis and intervals for subsequent reassessment of fibrosis? Critical outcomes selected for inclu sion in the GRADE table were hepatitis -related morbidity/progression, need for liver biopsy, and quality of life . Important outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were testing -related adverse events and change in treatment plan (especially a decision to begin antiviral therapy) . Evidence r eview We identified no randomized controlled evidence on the use of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis compared to liver biopsy with respect to clinical outcomes in hepatitis C infection. We identified a poor quality systematic review and meta -analysis of six studies reporting on the relative prognostic value of liver biopsy, FibroTest \u00ae, FIB -4, and APRI for predicting overall survival. All of the tests offered statistically significant prognostic value for over all survival with AUROCs of 0.58 for APRI (95% CI 0.53 to CI to 0.95). The authors did not describe the methodologic rigor of the included studies. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies (for example, in one study of APRI and FIB -4 in HCV patients, 68% of the patients had HIV co -infection). Lastly, the review was authored by the inventor of the FibroTest \u00ae and two employe es of the company that market the test. A more recent study (Verg niol et al., 2014) examined the prognostic value of evolving measurements of liver stiffness. In this study, about 1,025 people with chronic hepatitis C and two recorded measurements of liver stiffness (separated by >1,000 but <1,500 days) recorded between 2004 and 2008 were included. The average age of included patients was 52 years, half were men, the average BMI was 25 kg/m2, and about 12% reported excessive alcohol consumption. During the mean follow -up period of three years (after the second measurement of liver stiffness), 16% of patients achieved sustained virologic response from HCV treatment. Survival data was available for 95% of patients; of those, 35 patients had died and 7 had unde rgone liver transplantation. Twenty -one of the deaths were from liver - related causes. In the univariate analysis, several factors were associated with statistically significantly increased hazard ratios for death: age (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06), male s ex (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.43), baseline liver stiffness measurement (HR 4.27, 95% CI 2.94 to 6.22), follow -up liver stiffness measurement (HR 5.47, 95% CI 3.82 to 7.84), and change in liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.25, 95% CI 17 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 1.16 to 1.36). Unusuall y, alcohol abuse appeared to have a protective effect in this study (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97). In the multivariate analysis, baseline liver stiffness measurement (HR 5.76, 95% CI 3.74 to 8.87), change in liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1. 11 to 1.28), and achievement of SVR (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.80) were statistically significant independent predictors of death. Overall, the authors concluded that patients with low -baseline liver stiffness measurements, those who achieve SVR, and those with non -cirrhotic baseline liver stiffness measurements and stable or decreasing measurements at follow -up all have an excellent prognosis. Conversely, patients with cirrhotic baseline liver stiffness measurement or those with advancing significant fibro sis have a poorer prognosis. Cross -sectional data has correlated liver stiffness measurements by TE with the presence of portal hypertension (Kim et al ., 2013), but TE has not been demonstrated in prospective studies to predict clinical outcomes related t o portal hypertension in hepatitis C patients. A prospective cohort study of nearly 900 Japanese patients with HCV investigated the correlation between liver stiffness measurements by TE and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over a mean fol low-up of 3 years (Masuzaki et al., 2009). Compared to a reference value of less than 10 kilopascals (kPa), various cut-offs of liver stiffness were assoc iated with relative risk of HCC ranging from 16 to 45. The remainder of the identified systematic revi ews summarized diagnostic accuracy studies of various tests compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy. Most of these studies report diagnostic performance by way of sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC. A test that perfectly matches the diagnoses assigned by the reference test would have an AUROC of 1. Conventionally, tests with an AUROC of 0.9 to 1 are cons idered excellent, 0.8 -0.89 are good, 0.7 -0.79 are fair, and below 0.7 are poor, and though widely used, these distinctions are arbitrary. Magnetic Resonance Elastography Singh et al ., 2015 This is a good quality systematic review and meta -analysis of pati ent-level data to determine the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) compared to liver biopsy as the reference standard. The use of patient -level data in the meta -analysis allowed them to perform stratified analyses to determine if the diagnostic performance of MRE varied based on sex, obesity, or the etiology of the liver disease, and also allowed the authors to reduce the risk of spectrum bias and standardize diagnostic cut-offs for various fibrosis stages. The authors included 12 studies that met inclusion criteria and for which they were able to obtain the individual participant data (n=697). Overall, the included studies were judged to be at low to moderate risk of bias. Three of the studies did not adequately report on blindi ng procedures, raising the possibility of review bias. Among the included patients, the average age was 55 years old, the majority were males (60%), and the average BMI was 27. Nearly half of the participants had HCV -related liver disease (47%), with smal ler numbers of patients with HBV, NAFLD, ALD, AIH, or other miscellaneous etiologies. The level 29.7% operating characteristics of MRE from the meta -anal ysis, including both positive and negative likelihood ratios, are reported in Table 2 below . 18 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table 2: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of MRE Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) Sensitivity Specificity 4.79 0.11 In the subgroup and sensitivity analysis, the diagnostic performance of MRE did not significantly vary based on sex, presence of obesity, or etiology of liver disease. In this review, MRE had a failure rate of about 4%, and this was most commonly due to interference from hepatic iron overload. Overall, the authors concluded that MRE was highly accurate for diagnosing fibrosis and cirrhosis regardless of BMI or the etiology of chronic liver disease. Transient Elastography Steadman et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality, comprehensive technology assessment of transient elastogra phy (TE) for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis in adults with chronic liver disease. Overall, 57 studies reporting diagnostic performance of TE compared with liver biopsy were included. The results were stratified by the etiology of liver disease, and 13 of the included studies were in patients with HCV. The included studies were methodologically rigorous with the authors rating nearly 80% of them as high quality. The diagnostic operating characteristics of TE (in HCV patients only) from the meta -analys is are reported in Table 3 below . Table 3: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of Transient Elastography Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) (0.92 - 0.96) 0.85 0.91 9.4 0.16 19 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 The authors also performed a basic economic analysis to calculate the incremental cost per correct diagnosis gained by liver biopsy over TE. In the subgroup of patients with HCV, the incremental cost per correct diagnosis using biopsy ranged from $1,861 fo r patients with F2 disease to $3,260 for patients with F3 disease. The authors were careful to note that their economic modeling does not account for the practice of monitoring progression of liver fibrosis and observe that the common practice in Alberta, Canada is yearly TE and biopsy every 3 -5 years. Overall, the authors concluded that TE was an accurate method for diagnosing fibrosis or cirrhosis and was less costly than liver biopsy. Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse Imaging Nierhoff et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of the diagnostic operating characteristics of ARFI in patients with chronic liver disease using liver biopsy as the reference standard. The authors included 36 studies (both published manuscripts and a bstracts) of nearly 4,000 patients. Among the included studies, 7 examined only patients with HCV as the etiology of their liver disease while another 18 studies reported on populations with mixed etiologies of chronic liver disease, including HCV. The methodologic quality of the included studies was mixed , and about half of the studies had potential flaws related to spectrum bias (bias introduced because the range and distribution of disease severity in the study is not rep resentative of the overall popula tion of people with the condition ) and review bias (bias introduce when the interpreter of the index test is already aware of the result of the reference test, or vice -versa ). The main reported measure of diagnostic performance was AUROC. The results of the meta -analysis of the HCV only and mixed etiology studies are reported in Table 4 below . Table 4: AUROC of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging Tests Fibrosis Stage AUROC - HCV only studies (95% CI) (0.89 - 0.93) One possible explanation for the poorer diagnostic performance in the mixed studies is the finding in subgroup analysis that higher BMI is associated with reduced diagnostic accuracy and a higher failure rate for testing. Overall, the authors concluded that the diagnostic performance of ARFI is good to excellent for detecting fibrosis and cirrhosis. The au thors also note that their findings are consistent with those of an earlier, smaller meta -analysis of ARFI using individual participant data. 20 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse ( ARFI vs. Transient Elastography ( TE) Bota et al ., 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of studies comparing ARFI and TE to a reference standard of liver biopsy for the evaluation of fibrosis. The authors included 13 trials; 10 of the trials reported diagnostic accuracy of ARFI and TE for the diagnosis of s ignificant fibrosis ( F2), and all the trials reported diagnostic accuracy for cirrhosis (F4). The etiology of liver disease in each study was variable, and all but one study included patients with chronic hepatitis C. The authors observed that failure rat es (i.e. inability to obtain any valid measurements) were higher for TE (6.6%) than ARFI (2.1%) , and five of the trials only included patients with valid ARFI and TE. The authors' risk of bias assessment for most studies was low. The results of the meta -analysis are reported in Table 5 below . Table 5: Diagnostic Operating Characteristics of ARFI and TE Test and Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% CI) Sensitivity Specificity Positive 0.87 6.79 0.13 Overall, the authors concluded that there were no significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI and TE. They note that while the higher failure rate for TE is concerning, new and more sensitive probes may mitigate this limitation. Blood Tests Dozens of blood tests and related interpretive indices or scores have been proposed for the diagnosis of fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with HCV. The components of these tests are discussed in detail in the technology description section of this report. Chou & Wasson, 2013 This is a good -quality systematic review of blood tests for the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with HCV. The authors did not perform a meta -analysis but present results for measures of diagnostic accuracy as medians and ranges. The number of studies for each test and the authors' GRADE assessment of the strength of evidence are provided in Table 6 below . The results of the review of these tests are also summarized in Table 6. Because of the large number of tests as w ell as the various cut-offs used for each test, only the AUROC (median and range) are presented in this table. 21 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table 6: Studies of Blood Tests for Liver Fibrosis Test Number of studies Strength of evidence Fibrosis (F2) AUROC median (range) Cirrhosis AUROC median (range) 18 0.71 (0.38 - 0.94) 0.89 (0.64 - 0.99) Hyaluronic acid 8 Moderate 0.75 (0.65 - 0.88) 0.90 (0.80 - 0.97) 0.79) 0.86 (0.58 - 0.95) 0.84 (0.54 - 0.97) AST-ALT ratio 32 High 0.59 (0.50 - 0.82) 0.72 (0.52 - 0.91) 0.74 Moderate NR (0.61 - 0.91) Pohl index 12 Low 0.52 (0.52 - 0.53) 0.65 (0.64 - 0.66) The Chou & Wasson review also summarized the results of trials making direct comparisons between APRI or FibroTest \u00ae and various other blood tests. Very few of these direct comparisons showed substantial differences in the median AUROC for fibrosis, but median differ ences in excess of 0.05 are reported in Table 7 below . Only one of the direct comparisons (APRI vs. AST-ALT ratio) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis exceed a median difference in AUROC of greater than 0.05; in those studies APRI was more accurate than the AST -ALT ratio. 22 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table 7. Studies of Direct Comparisons between Two Blood Tests Number of studies Test A AUROC median Test B AUROC median Median difference (range) 13 APRI 0.76 AST-ALT ratio 0.58 0.17 0.78 FibroIndex 0.72 0.08 (0.02 to 0.10) The authors also include 9 studies that report on the use of combinations of blood tests or indices. Four studies reported on diagnostic performance of the Sequential Algorithm for Fibrosis Evaluation that combines results from APRI and FibroTest \u00ae. In two studies of patients with fibrosis (F2), the algorithm had an AUROC of 0.90 and 0.94. In 3 studies of cirrhosis, the algorithm had a median AUROC of 0.87. The remaining combinations of tests or indices were only studied in single trials. The authors point out several limitations of the review, the most important of which is the binary interpretation of presence or absence of clin ically significant fibrosis. As they note, \" Measures that incorporate the accuracy of tests at each fibrosis stage would therefore be more informative than estimates based on dichotomized classifications.\" Additionally, because nearly all the included stud ies grouped patients with both lesser stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis, it was not possible to ascertain the diagnostic performance of blood tests for less severe fibrosis independent from the diagnostic accuracy of the full spectrum o f significant fibrosi s, and distinguishing between F2 and F3 is not possible . Overall, the authors conclude that a variety of blood tests are moderately useful for the identification of clinically significant fibrosis in patients with HCV. Shear Wave Elastography Li et al ., 2016 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of real -time shear wave elastography (SWE) for staging liver fibrosis. The authors identified eight studies with a total of 934 patients comparing SWE to a refer ence standard of liver biopsy. Most patients in the included studies had chronic viral hepatitis, but the precise breakdown was not provided. The included studies were general ly at low risk of bias, though three were judged to be susceptible to disease pro gression bias because of the time difference between the two tests. The diagnostic operating characteristics from the meta -analysis are reported in Table 8 below . 23 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table 8. Diagnostic Operating Characteristics for Shear Wave Elastography Fibrosis Stage AURO C (95% 0.88 7.25 0.15 The authors note that the primary limitations of their review include the small number of studies and the inability to perform subgroup analysis by etiology of chronic liver disease. The authors observe that compared with reported diagnostic accuracy of other modalities, SWE is com parable to TE and ARFI for diagnosis of cirrhosis, and comparable to ARFI but better than TE for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis ( F2). Overall, the authors conclude that the diagnostic accuracy of SWE for fibrosis staging is good. Real -Time Tissue E lastog raphy Kobayashi et al ., 2014 This is a good -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of real -time tissue elastography (RT-TE) compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy. The authors identified 15 trials includi ng over 1,600 patients. Ten of 15 studies included patients with HCV. The authors expressed concerns over the risk of bias in several included studies related to patient selection bias and t he absence of pre -specified cut-off values for the index tests. Th ey also identified possible publication bias in their funnel plots. The meta -analytic results for sensitivity and specificity are reported in Table 9 below . Table 9. Diagnostic Operating Characteristics for Real -Time Tissue Elastography Fibrosis Stage AUROC (95% Positive LR (95% CI) (95% authors conclude that , \"RTE is not highly accurate for any cut -off stage of fibrosis.\" 24 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Direct Comparisons of FibroTest\u00ae, FIB -4, APRI, and TE Houot et al ., 2016 This is a poor -quality systematic review and meta -analysis of trials making direct comparisons between FibroTest \u00ae, APRI, FIB -4, and TE compared to a reference standard of liver biopsy . The authors identified 71 trials, of which 37 includ ed only patients with HCV. The main purpose of the review was to determine whether there were differences between the AUROC of these tests for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis (defined here as F2) or cirrhosis. The review did not provide information on the methodologic quality of the included studies. The authors applied three meta -analytic methods to ascertain whether the differences in test performance were statistically significant : an indirect pooled AUROC difference, a standard pooled AUROC differen ce, and a Bayesian pooled AUROC difference. Among the HCV -only studies, the differences in AUROC for most comparisons were generally small (<0.05). In the indirect pooled analysis, only one comparison showed a statistically significant difference in favor of TE over APRI for diagnosis of cirrhosis. In the standard pooled analysis FibroTest \u00ae was favored over TE and APRI for diagnosis of fibrosis; TE and FIB -4 were favored over APRI for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. In the Bayesian pooled analysis , FibroTest \u00ae was favored over APRI for the diagnosis of fibrosis and TE and FIB -4 were favored over APRI for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. This review is subject to potential conflict of interest as the senior author is the inventor of FibroTest \u00ae and the study was funded in part by BioPredictive, the company that markets FibroTest \u00ae. Factors Influencing Accuracy of TE Perazzo et al ., 2015 This is a narrative review article that summarizes research on various factors that influence the accuracy and interpretation of transient elastography. The authors identify four factors that are associated with overestimation of fibrosis by TE: heightened necroinflammatory activity as denoted by alanine transaminases greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, extrahepatic cholestasis and hepatic congestion, non -fasting status, and the presence of severe steatosis. The authors also note that the relia bility of TE measurements is modified by operator experience and propose a definition of an experience d operator as greater than 100 examinations. Similarly, large ranges of inter -observer variability are reported in the literature and discrepancies betwee n assessments of adjacent fibrosis stages are more common . The authors suggest that longitudinal follow -up and examination by the same experienced operator may prove most accurate. We did not identify any evidence that addresses the question of initial ti ming of staging or the appropriate intervals for re -staging using non -invasive tests. The systematic review of TE did observe that the common practice in Alberta, Canada is to perform non -invasive tests to assess fibrosis stage every 3 to 5 years. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Although an imperfect test itself, liver biopsy remains the reference standard by which noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are judged. There is no direct comparative evidence that examines the effects of different diagnostic strateg ies on the predetermined clinical outcome s: 25 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Hepatitis -related morbidity/progression Need for liver biopsy Quality of life Testing -related adverse events Change in treatment plan Furthermore, t here is only sparse evidence on the value and reliability of prognostic information obtained from noninvasive tests. However, there are a large number of studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis to the reference standard of liver biopsy. Many of these studies (see Appendix D) demonstrated good or excellent performance of non -invasive tests for the detectio n of various levels of fibrosis; in general, imaging studies appear to have greater ability to distinguish between intermediate stages of fibrosis (i.e. betwee n F2 and F3), while blood tests appear to be suitable for establishing the presence of significant fibrosis ( F2) or cirrhosis (F4) . OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource Allocation The price of noninvasive tests is generally significantly less than liver biopsy and avoids the costs associated with harms from liver biopsy . However, noninvasive testing is likely to be done at a higher frequency than liver biopsy and the increased number of total procedures may somewhat reduce the cost-savings associated with avoid ing liver biopsy. The more significant cost driver is the impact noninvasive testing may have on determining the eligible population for treatment with hepatitis C. Health plans have prioritized treatment of hepatitis C patients with the newer expensive me dications both because of the high cost of these medications and the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C infection in the general population. The cutoff point for some plans in Oregon include only treating persons with a score of F3 or above. This requires t esting that can accurately distinguish between the cutoff point s for treatment. If a test has a high false positive rate, that would lead more people into a hepatitis C treatment pathway (increasing overall costs of the population in the near term). If a t est has a high false negative rate, then people with more advanced fibrosis who may particularly benefit from treatment would not qualify for treatment (decreasing health system costs, but at the expense of fewer eligible people receiving appropriate treat ment). Values and preferences Patients would highly value avoiding an invasive procedure as long as the information provided by a noninvasive test was comparable. There would be minimal variability in this preference. From a population perspective, it woul d be very important that these tests can accurately distinguish between those persons who would benefit the most from the very expensive treatment versus others who may be able to delay or avoid treatment altogether. 26 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 POLICY LANDSCAPE Quality measures No quality measures were identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse . Payer coverage policies The Oregon Medicaid fee -for-service Approval Criteria for Hepatitis C Direct -Acting Antivirals require s liver fibrosis staging by either >3.25), or clinical evidence (ascites, portal hypertension) of cirrhosis The Washington Health Care Authority outline s the treatment policy for patients with HCV , with the accepted diagnostic tests for liver damage including imaging procedures (FibroS can\u00ae, AR FI, SWE) and blood tests (FibroS ure\u00ae, APRI). The Table 10 below shows the allowed tests and cutoffs used to stage liver fibrosis to determine hepatitis C treatments. Table 10: Washington Health Care Authority Accepted Diagnostic Tests and Procedures to Stage Liver Damage in Patients with Chronic HCV - 2.33 m/s 0.58 - 0.74 1.5 - 1.9 F2 F2 7.1 - 9.5 kPa 1.38 - 2.0 m/s 0.49 - 0.57 F1/0 F1/0 7.0 kPa 1.37 m/s 0.48 0.9 On May 27, 2016, a United States District Court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Washington Medicaid program to cover direct -acting antiviral medications for Medicaid clients with hepatitis C, regardless of the extent of liver fibrosis. Coverage policies for noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis were searched for four commercial Aetna is by three of these payers: Aetna, Cigna, and Moda. MRE for staging liver fibrosis is covered by only Moda . None of the other imaging tests are covered by these pay ers. Three of the four payers do not cover the blood tests for staging liver fibrosis. Moda Health covers direct -acting antivirals require the staging of liver disease by liver biopsy, METAVIR scores, FibroScan\u00ae score, APRI score, rad iological imaging consistent with cirrhosis (i.e., evidence of portal hypertension), or physical findings or clinical evidence consistent with cirrhosis as attested by the prescribing physician . The Regence Medical Policy Manual states that, \"Liver biopsy is 27 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 typically recommended prior to the initiation of antiviral therapy .\" Coverage policies for direct -acting antivirals for Cigna and Moda do not in dicate specific methods for staging of liver fibrosis . For Medicare, n o National Coverage Determinations or Local Coverage Determinations related to noninvasive tests for liver fibrosis were identified. Professional society guidelines American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) Guideline, 2016 The AASLD and IDSA guideline endorses the use of biopsy, imaging, and/or noninvasive markers to evaluate advanced fibrosis in HCV patients for treatment planning and to ascertain whether additional screening and management of cirrhosis is needed (Class I, Level A). It also endorses the continued monitoring of liver disease in those who defer treatment, but does not specify the use of noninvasive tests or provide an optimal interval for re -assessment. Regarding noninvasive tests, the AASLD and IDSA guideline makes the following statements: \"No single method is recognized to have high accuracy alone and each test must be interpreted carefully. A recent publi cation of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found evidence in support of a number of blood tests; however, at best, they are only moderately useful for identifying clinically significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.\" \"Vibration -controlled transient liver elastography is a noninvasive way to measure liver stiffness and correlates well with measurement of substantial fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. The measurement range does overlap between stages.\" \"The most efficient app roach to fibrosis assessment is to combine direct biomarkers and vibration -controlled transient liver elastography. A biopsy should be considered for any patient who has discordant results between the 2 modalities that would affect clinical decision making . For example, one shows cirrhosis and the other does not. The need for liver biopsy with this approach is markedly reduced.\" \"Alternatively, if direct biomarkers or vibration -controlled transient liver elastography are not available, the AST -to-platelet r atio index (APRI) or FIB -4 index score can help, although neither test is sensitive enough to rule out substantial fibrosis. Biopsy should be considered in those in whom more accurate fibrosis staging would impact treatment decisions. Individuals with clinically evident cirrhosis do not require additional staging (biopsy or noninvasive assessment).\" 28 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericano para el Estdio del H\u00edgado (ALEH), 2015 This is a comprehensive clinical practice guideline on the use of noninvasive tests for evaluating liver disease across a variety of etiologies. In general, EASL/ALEH endorse the use of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis. Specific recommendations and stat ements include: \"Non -invasive tests should always be interpreted by specialists in liver disease, according to the clinical context, considering the results of other tests (biochemical, radiological and endoscopic) and taking into account the recommended q uality criteria for each test and its possible pitfalls (A1) .\" \"TE is a fast, simple, safe and easy to learn procedure that is widely available. Its main limitation is the impossibility of obtaining results in case of ascites or morbid obesity and its limi ted applicability in case of obesity and limited operator experience (A1) .\" \"TE should be performed by an experienced operator (>100 examinations) following a standardized protocol with the patient, fasting for at least 2 hours, in the supine position, right arm in full abduction, on the midaxillary line with the probe -tip placed in the 9th to 11th intercostal space with a minimum of 10 shots (A1) .\" \"Although alternative techniques, such as pSWE/ARFI or 2D -SWE seem to overcome limitations of TE, their qu ality criteria for correct interpretation are not yet well defined (A1) .\" \"MR elastography is currently too costly and time consuming for routine clinical practice use and seems more suited for research purposes (A1) .\" \"When compared in HCV patients, the d ifferent patented tests have similar levels of performance in diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis (A1) . Although non -patented tests might have lower diagnostic accuracy than patented tests, they are not associated with additional costs, are easy to calculate, and are widely available (A2) .\" \"Among the different available strategies, algorithms combining TE and serum biomarkers appear to be the most attractive and validated one (A2) . In patients with viral hepatitis C, when TE and serum biomarkers results are in accordance, the diagnostic accuracy is increased for detecting significant fibrosis but not for cirrhosis. In cases of unexplained discordance, a liver biopsy should be performed if the results would change the patient management (A1) .\" 29 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 The EASL/ALEH guideline includes the following proposed algorithm for noninvasive testing in HCV patients. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), 2015 NICE issued medical technology guidance on the use of Virtual Touch Quantificatio n (VTq, a proprietary system for performing ARFI) for diagnosing and monitoring liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B and C. The panel endorsed the use of VTq as an option for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B or C. They concluded that VTq is as acc urate as transient elastography and cost modelling suggested that VTq would likely to be cost saving compared to transient elastography and liver biopsy. 30 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), 2013 SIGN published a comprehensive guideline on t he management of hepatitis C in 2013 including recommendations regarding the use of noninvasive tests for diagnosing fibrosis and cirrhosis. The SIGN guideline state s that while biochemical markers may be able to distinguish cirrhosis from less degrees of fibrosis, \"intermediate stages are not distinguishable.\" Thus, SIGN recommends that biochemical markers should not be considered an alternative to biopsy for staging intermediate levels of fibrosis, but may be used in place of biopsy to diagnose cirrhosis (B recommendations, 2++ evidence). The guideline does offer that measurement of liver stiffness by noninvasive testing may be considered a \"recommended best practice based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.\" Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference Statement, 2015 This consensus conference statement (Barr et al., 2015) asserts that elastography (using either ultrasound or magnetic resonance techniques) can be used to diagnose liver fibrosis in patients \"without overt decompensated cirrhosis.\" The panel stated that elastography should be used to group patients into three categories: those with minimal fibrosis (F0 or F1), th ose with a high likelihood of cirrhosis (F4), and those with values in between suggesting moderate to severe fibrosis (F2 and F3). The panel also proposed consensus diagnostic thresholds which are reproduced in Table 11. Table 1 1: Consensus of Suggested Th resholds in Patients with Hepatitis C Device No Clinically Significant Fibrosis: METAVIR Stage < F2, Unlikely to Need Follow -up Advanced Fibrosis and/or Cirrhosis: METAVIR Stage of F4 and Some Stages shear modulus, while U .S. elastography techniques are reported in Young modulus. The Young modulus is three times the shear modulus. World Health Organization, 2014 The WHO released a comprehensive guideline in 2014 focused on management of hepatitis C in resource limited settings. In general, the guideline state s that noninvasive tests should be favored over liver biopsy and \"in resource -limited settings, it is suggested that aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI) or FIB4 be used for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis rather than other noninvasive tests that require more res ources such as elastography or Fibrotest.\" (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence) 31 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 REFERENCES Evidence Sources Bota, S., Herkner, H., Sporea, I., Salzl, P., Sirli, R., Neghina, A. - analysis: ARFI elastogr aphy versus transient elastography for the evaluation fibrosis.

GRADE INFORMED FRAMEWORK - ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confide nt that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that th e desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that t he undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating ac ross studies for the treatment/outcome1 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limit ations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recomme ndation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issue about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 35 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low : The su bcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across stu dies. 36 Noninvasive Testing f or Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C DRAFT f or VbBS/HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 APPENDIX B.

What is the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests for the diagnosis and management of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C? 2. Does the comparative effectiveness of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C vary based on: a. Duration of infection b. Fibrosis score c. Body habitus d. Operator/interpreter training or experience e. Co-existence of other etiologies of liver disease (e.g., non -alcoholic steatohepatitis) 3. What are the comparative diagnostic operating characteristics of tests of liver fibrosis? 4. What is the evidence for the timing of the initial testing for fibrosis and intervals for subsequent reassessment of fibrosis? Search Strategy A full search of the core sources was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, technology assess ments, and clinical practice guidelines using terms for each of the studied interventions .

There are only approximately 20 ICD -10 codes on line 392 that do not also appear on line 364. There is no clear definition of what is considered a major vs a minor joint. The diagnoses on line 392 include hip, wrist, shoulder, ankle, finger and toe conditions, while the diagnoses of line 364 include basically all joints. The ICD-10 Orthopedics group never finished their review due to the overwhelming number of new ICD -10 codes and their complexity. Therefore, there is not clear guidanc e on how these lines should be t reated. On review, HERC staff found very few codes on line 392 that could not be easily placed elsewhere, and did not see a good rationale for maintaining both of these lines. Additionally, these two lines have caused confusion and bee wn sadfasdasd source of numerous questions from providers and plans about what diagnoses were intended to appear on each. Line 392 contains only 2 CPT codes not found on line 364 (CPT 26045 and 26426). CPT 26045 is on one other appropriate line. CPT 26426 is on two other inappropriate lines and needs to be added to the line contai ning the diagnosis of boutonniere deformity. HERC staff recommendation s: 1) Delete line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS a. All ICD -10 codes also appear ing on line 364 should remain on line 364 b. The ICD-10 codes on line 392 that do not appear line 364 should be moved to the lines shown in the table below i. Some are also moved from other current lines as m ore appropriate placement 2) Rename line 364 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MAJOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS 3) Add CPT 26426 (Repair of extensor tendon, central slip, deformity); using local tissue(s), including lateral band(s), each finger) to line 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS to pa ir with M20.02 a.

How should they be modified as part of the HERC biennial review of this topic? Question source : HERC staff , biennial review Issue : Obesity treatments, including pharmacologic, nutritional, behavioral, surgical, and multisector interventions are likely to have changed in the last few years. This topic is being addressed as part of the biennial review of the Prioritized List, to ensure that it is up to date. An Obesity Task Force was created to assist VbBS and HERC with this biennial review topic. Phase I - Clinical interventions Discussion scope: 1. Obesity and overweight , adult and pediatric a. Pharmacologic interventions b. Behavioral inte rventions c. Surgical d. Devices Format: 2 meetings in MARCH 2016 Phase II - Multisector interventions Discussion scope: 1. Evidence supporting multis ector interventions to decrease obesity a. Paraclinical interventions b. Community based c. Regional policy interventions HERC Obesity T askforce - Overall Summary Obesity T ask Force , Issue #876 Page 2 Overall structure of Prioritized List : The obesity lines are currently divided into funded and nonfunded lines. Bariatric surgery is only included on the Type 2 Diabetes line. Obesity was reprioritized during the ICD -10 process to mid-way down the Prio ritized List based on limited efficacy. The lower obesity line has non -intensive nutritional counseling and interventions, bariatric surgery for specific subgroups, and medication management. In practice, non -intensive nutritional counseling is more like ly to be done and less easy to limit than the more effective intensive counseling. There are two groups of codes that are on the lower (unfunded) obesity line and not the higher (funded) line: bariatric surgery without diabetic comorb idity, and medicatio n management codes (99605 -99607). The proposals include removing bariatric surgery from lower line and only placing on funded line (with a guideline) and continuing to not cover pharmacologic treatments of obesity. The loss of the lower obesity line w ould have minimal impact. Obesity Task Force Recommendation s: 1. Delete the lower obesity line, 589 2. Do not change current exclusion of pharmacologic treatments for obesity 3. Add exclusion of devices to the obesity guideline note to clarify intent 4. Move all obesity related interventions including bariatric surgery to the higher obesity line 5. Revise the bariatric surgery guideline to reflect the new HTAS Draft Coverage Guidance 6. Revise the obesity guideline note as it addresses behavioral interventions 7. Add state ment on Multisector I nterventions for obesity to the Prioritized List Behavioral interventions for obesity 1 Question: Should current coverage on the Prioritized List of behavioral interventions for obesity be modified? Issue: As part of the biennial review, OHP coverage of behavioral interventions are being reviewed and evidence updated. Currently, obesity and overweight guideline makes recommendations for intensive counseling on nutrition and physician activity. The Guidelin e Note language is based on USPSTF recommendations. Children are not currently discussed in the guideline. The Obesity Task Force Phase 1 addressed behavioral interventions for obesity. Prioritized List Status: Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE (See Guideline Notes 8,64,65) NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nu trition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) Behavioral interventions for obesity 2 are includ ed on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight persons for which this therapy is effective include: hyperte nsion, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome. Pharmacological treatments are not intended to be included as services on this line.

Clinicians should offer or refer patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions. B 2012, currently being updated Children and Adolescents, Age 6 - 18 Years Old The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years and older for obesity and offer them or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral intervention to promote improvement in weight status. B 2010, currently being updated Adults who are overweight or obese and have additional CVD risk factors The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are overweight or obese and have additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity for CVD prevention. B 2014 General adult population without a known diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi demia, or cardiovascular disease. Although the correlation among healthful diet, physical activity, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease is strong, existing evidence indicates that the health benefit of initiating behavioral counseling in the primar y care setting to promote a healthful diet and physical activity is small. Clinicians may choose to selectively counsel patients rather than incorporate counseling into the care of all adults in the general population.

Conclusion: Evidence from a limited number of randomized trials shows that parent - only interventions are at least as, and possibly more, effective than either parent -child or child -only interventions for weight loss in obese children. Behavioral interventions for obesity 9 HERC Staff Assessment: It appears that there is very modest weight reduction as a result of high intensity interventions for weight loss in obese adults and overweight adults with risk factors. While almost all of the outcomes are interme diate, there is limited data that a reduction in diabetes incidence may be associated with intensive weight management. Many types of behavioral interventions are associated with a weight loss that is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Primary care based interventions appear to be ineffective. The characteristics of effective behavioral interventions are most consistently: high intensity programs, multicomponent (diet and exercise), group - based commercial programs, Mediterranean diet, and the following sub -elements -- calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and comparison to peers. The evidence on individual versus group interventions is mixed. In children, multicomponent, high intensity programs appear to result in weight loss that is of borderline clinical significance. Obesity Task Force Phase 1 Recommendations (per their 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 meetings) 1. Add Z71.3 Dietary counseling and surveillance to Line 325 2. Consider making the following changes to the guideline : a. Remove the limit about not exceeding visits once per week as it may hinder pediatric or other multicomponent/ multiple specialty visits. b. Discuss whether to modify the language on maintenance visits or remove it c. Add distinct language about children d. Include language about types of interventions with the most evidence GUIDELINE NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity in adults is limited to accepted intensive , counseling on nutrition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. A multidisciplinary team is preferred , but a single clinician could also deliver intensive coun seling in primary care or other settings . Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 - 2 weeks) are included on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for an additional 6 months (up to 12 months ) as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits at the conclusion of the intensive treatment are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. The characteristics of effect ive behavioral interventions include: high intensity programs ; multicomponent (including at a minimum Behavioral interventions for obesity 10 diet and exercise), group -based commercial programs ; Mediterranean diet ; and the following sub -elements -- calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and comparison to peers. Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight persons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes impaired fasting glucose , or the metabolic syndrome. Medical treatment of obesity in children is limited to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions . For treatment of childr en up to 12 years old, interventions may be targeted only to parents, or to both p arents and children. 1 General Evidence from Systematic Reviews LeBlanc et al, 2011 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of primary -care relevant obesity treatments for adults that was conducted by the Agency for Health Research and Quality to inform the deliberations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The authors identi fied a total of 58 trials of behavioral interventions; 38 trials (n=13,495) examined behavioral interventions alone, 18 trials (n=11,256) examined behavioral interventions plus orlistat, and 3 trials (n=2,652) examined behavioral interventions plus metform in. Sixty percent of trial participants were women and the average baseline BMI was about 32 kg/m2. Slightly more than half the participants in the included trials had clinical or subclinical cardiovascular risk factors. The quality of included trials was mixed with 24% being rated good and the remainder rated fair (mostly due to issues with allocation concealment, blinding, and outcomes assessment. In general most trials found that behavioral interventions, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformi n, resulted in modest weight loss at 12 to 18 months. Specifically, in the meta -analysis behavioral interventions alone were associated with a weight change of -3.01 kg (95% CI -4.02 to -2.01); behavioral interventions plus orlistat with a weight change of -2.98 kg (95% CI -3.92 to -2.05); and behavioral interventions plus metformin with a weight change of -1.52 kg (95% CI -2.82 to -0.21). All groups showed high degrees of statistical heterogeneity. The authors did note that more intensive interventions (12 to 26 sessions) produced greater average weight loss (4 to 7 kg) compared with less intensive interventions (fewer than 12 sessions, average weight loss of 1.5 to 4 kg). The number of sessions appeared to be the only marker of intensity that was associate d with greater weight loss; after adjusting for the number of sessions, other intervention characteristics did not alter the effect size. Finally, the authors note that subgroup reporting was sparse and mixed. On average, behavioral interventions produced less weight loss in black patients and women. Few trials included in the review reported on distal health outcomes like death, cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, or quality of life. Among the few trials that did there were no observed differences in these outcomes between the behavioral intervention and control groups. A small number of trials (n=3) also examined the effect of behavioral intervention on the development of diabetes; these trials did show that behavioral interventions delivered in 7 to 23 sessions over one year reduced incident cases of diabetes by approximately 50% at 2 to 3 years of follow -up. There was very little available information about harms of behavioral weight loss interventions. Bottom line: In a general adult populati on, behavioral interventions are associated with modest reductions in weight at 12 -18 months. More intensive behavioral interventions appear to result in greater weight loss. Behavioral interventions also appear to reduce cases of incident diabetes in high risk populations. 2 Dombrowski, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized or cluster randomized trials examining long - term maintenance (>12 months) of weight loss with non -surgical interventions. The review included 45 trials spanning nearly 8,000 patients. All patients were older than age 18, had BMI>30, and had lost >5% of their body weight in the prior 24 months. Study interventions included behavioral counseling focused on diet and exercise, pharmacologic treatments, food replacements, or combinations of these interventions intended to maintain weigh loss. The primary outcome was weight at 12 months after randomization. Most of the studies (n=28) were U.S. based. The behavioral interventions were varied and were delivered by diverse provider types (physicians, therapist, dieticians, physiotherapists, peer support s, etc...) and in diverse formats and settings (internet, phone, clinic, community, and gym). On average, the behavioral interventions had 3.2 contacts with patients each month. In the meta -analysis, behavioral interventions alone were associated with an average weight loss of 1.56 kg (95% CI -2.27 to - .086) There was low to moderate statistical heterogeneity. Bottom line: In a general adult population, behavioral in terventions result in maintenance of weight loss at up to 12 months after an initial weight loss. Evidence from Pragmatic Trials Hartmann -Boyce, et al, 2014 b This is a systematic review and meta -analysis that was performed in order to examine the effects of multicomponent behavioral interventions for obese adults when implemented in routine, everyday practice. The outcomes that were studied included 12 month weight change, blood pressure, lipids, and glucose. The interventions that were investigated in th e included studies were, a priori, grouped into categories based on intervention type (commercial weight loss programs with and without meal replacements, primary care interventions, and internet based programs). Ultimately, the authors included eight stud ies spanning over 3,700 participants. Half the studies were done in the U.S., and the remainder were done in Western Europe or Australia. Mean BMI in the studies ranged from approximately 30 to 40 kg/m2. Four studies were deemed to be at low risk of bias w hile the remaining four studies felt to be at high risk of bias. Weight loss at 12 months varied by intervention type; commercial programs with meal replacements were associated with an average weight loss of 6.83 kg (95% CI -8.39 to -5.26); group based co mmercial programs without meal replacements were associated with an average weight loss of 2.21 kg (95% CI -2.89 to -1.54); automated internet -based program were associated with an average weight loss of 0.7 kg (95% CI -1.37 to -0.03); and primary care -based programs were associated with an average weight loss of 0.45 kg (95% CI -1.34 to -0.43). At 24 months, weight loss was attenuated in all groups, with only group -based commercial programs, with or without meal replacement, showing statistically significa nt differences in weight compared to control arms. 3 Few studies examined the effects of these interventions on blood pressure or fasting glucose. None of the observed differences between intervention and control groups achieved statistical significance. Bottom line: In routine everyday settings, group -based commercial weight loss programs, with or without meal replacements, appear to be more effective for weight loss than primary care office -based or internet -based behavioral interventions, but this conclusion is bas ed on a small number of studies several of which had high risk of bias. Diabetes Prevention Programs Balk, et al, 2015 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions targeted at both diet and physical activity to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in people at heightened risk. This review was done to inform the recommendations of the Community Preventive Services Task Force. The authors identified 53 studies; 30 studies comparing diet and exercise interventions to usual care, 13 co mparing more intensive behavioral interventions with less intensive interventions, and 13 evaluations of single programs. Overall, 33 studies were deemed good quality and the remaining were considered fair quality. The characteristic s of interventions are reproduced from the review in Appendix A. All of participants in the included studies were deemed to be at heightened risk of diabetes by various criteria. The average BMI of participants was 31 kg/m2, the average age 39 years, and 65% of participants wer e women. Participants were of varied ethnicities and levels of educational attainment. The follow -up periods ranged from 1 to 23 year s. In the overall meta -analysis, combined diet and physical activity promotion programs were associated with a relative ris k of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.66) for incident type 2 diabetes. There was little to no statistical heterogeneity and there was no indication of publication bias. In the overall analysis, the effectiveness did not appear to vary by setting, number of sessions , approach, duration, use of individual goals , or tailored diet plans. The authors concluded that programs with an individually tailored exercise plan may be more effective than those that did not. Among the six studies that directly compared more and less intensive interventions, five favored more intensive interventions (RR 0.28 for incident type 2 diabetes) over less intensive interventions (RR 0.56 for incident type 2 diabetes), though only one of the individual studies showed a statistically significan t difference. More intensive programs were variably characterized by greater numbers of sessions, more intensive diet and exercise plans, goal setting, maintenance phases, individual contact, and use of an exercise physiologist. For the outcomes of incide nt cases of type 2 diabetes and body weight, there were no significant differences between group and individual interventions. For the outcome of fasting plasma glucose, interventions that included individual diet counseling were associated with a small bu t statistically significant improvement in fasting plasma glucose ( mean difference -4 mg/dL, P=0.02). 4 Only three of the included studies reported distal clinical outcomes including all -cause or cardiovascular mortality but the authors found that there was \"no consistent pattern of results.\" Similarly, the authors found limited evidence of no significant effects on cardiovascular events, nephropathy, or neuropathy. Bottom line: Behavioral interventions targeted at improving diet and physical activity in adu lts at risk for diabetes are associated with substantial reductions in the risk of incident diabetes. More intensive programs appear to be somewhat more effective than less intensive programs. Interventions in People with Type 2 Diabetes Franz, et al, 20 15 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials of behavioral weight loss interventions in overweight and obese adults who already have type 2 diabetes. The authors identified 11 RCTs (6,754 participants) that met inclusion criteria including 12 month follow -up and less than 30% attrition rate. Of note, only 3 of the studies compared behavioral interventions with usual care; the remaining trials compared two different behavioral interventions for weight loss. The behavioral interventions were diverse, including meal replacements, reduced energy intake plans, group behavioral weight management programs, intensive physical activity, and diets with various proportions of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. The meta -analytic result s are complicated and have high heterogeneity because of the diversity of interventions, but in aggregate behavioral interventions were associated with weight loss of approximately 3% to 9% at 1 year. The greatest percent weight loss was observed in the intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILI, as described in the LookAHEAD trial) and the Mediterranean diet group (8.6% and 7.2% respectively). For the programs with less than 5% weight loss at 12 months, there was no statistically significant change in hem oglobin A1c. The two programs that reported greater than 5% weight loss at 1 year (ILI, Mediterranean diet) were associated with statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c of -0.6% and -1.2% respectively. Bottom line: In obese adults with type 2 diabetes, intensive lifestyle interventions (as described in the LookAHEAD trial) and Mediterranean diet were associated with >5% weight loss at 1 year and significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c. The authors do caution that t he ILI used in the LookAHEAD trial may not be easily adapted to most health care settings. Behavioral Techniques , Combinations, and Delivery Modes Hartmann -Boyce, et al, 2014 a This is a systematic review, meta -analysis, and meta -regression meant to explor e the techniques and modes of delivery that are correlated with successful behavioral interventions for weight loss. The systematic review identified 37 RCTs spanning over 13,000 participants. In the primary meta -analysis, all behavioral interventions were associated with a mean weight loss of 2.84 kg at 12 months (95% CI -3.61 5 to -2.07) compared to controls. There was a very high degree of heterogeneity. In the secondary meta - analyses programs involving supervised physical activity, more frequent contact, and in -person contact were not associated with program effectiveness. Similarly, effectiveness did not vary by individual or group interventions. In the meta -regression, programs that included calorie counting, contact with a dietician, and behavioral tech niques comparing participants' behavior with others were associated with greater weight loss. No other program characteristics were positiv ely correlated with weight loss. Bottom line: The authors conclude that most behavioral interventions for weight lo ss are successful, but that the program characteristics most correlated with successful weigh loss are calorie counting and dietician contact. Johns, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions for either diet or e xercise compared with combined behavioral weight management programs (BWMPs) in obese adults. The authors identified 8 RCTs (spanning 1,022 participants) that directly compared diet or exercise programs with BWMPs. All but one of the studies were judged to have at least moderate risk of bias. The primary outcomes were short - (3-6 months) and long -term (12 -18 months) weight loss. In the meta -analysis comparing BWMPs with diet -only programs, there was no statistically significant difference in weight loss at 3-6 months. However, at 12 months BWMPs were associated with greater weight loss than diet - only programs (mean difference -1.72 kg, 95% CI -2.80 to -0.64). BWMPs were superior to exercise -only programs at 3 -6 months (mean difference -5.33 kg, 95% CI -7.61 to -3.04), and at 12 -18 months (mean difference -6.29 kg, 95% CI -7.33 to -5.25). Bottom line: Diet-only interventions are comparable to combined behavioral weight management programs in the short term (3 -6 months), but BWMPs produce greater weight loss at 12 months and beyond. BWMPs are superior to exercise -only programs for both short - and long -term weight loss. Primary Care -specific Behavioral Interventions Booth, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions delivered in primary care settings for obese adults. The authors identified 15 randomized or cluster randomized trials spanning 4,539 participants. Ten of the studies were done in the U.S. with the remainder done in Weste rn Europe. Most participants were in their fifth or sixth decades, were women, and had BMIs between 35 and 50 kg/m2. The behavioral interventions were diverse, but were all delivered in outpatient primary care settings. The methodologic quality of the incl uded studies was difficult to assess because of poor reporting of methods. In the primary meta -analyses, primary care - based behavioral interventio ns were associated with small but statistically significant reduction in weight at 12 months (effect size -1.36 kg, 95% CI -2.10 to -0.63) and 24 months (effect size -1.23 kg, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.18) when compared with controls. There was moderate heterogeneity. 6 Bottom line: The authors conclude that primary care -based behavioral interventions are associated with small reductions in weight that may not be clinically significant. Behavioral Interventions for Children and Adolescents van Hoek, et al, 2014 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of behavioral interventions for obese young children (ages 3-8 years). The authors identified 27 studies, of which 11 were included in the meta -analysis. The 11 studies included in the meta -analysis spanned just over 1,000 participants. In the primary meta -analysis, behavioral interventions were associated with a modes t reduction in BMI z -score of -0.25 (95% CI -.036 to -0.14). general, reductions of <0.5 in the BMI z -score are not considered to be clinically significant. There was a very high level of heterogeneity in the overall meta -analysis. In the exploratory an alysis, the authors found that only moderate or high intensity multicomponent interventions resulted in weight reductions that approached clinical significance (change in BMI z -core -0.46, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.39). Bottom line: While behavioral intervention s for young children appear to result in weight loss, the difference may not be clinically significant. Moderate or high intensity multicomponent behavioral interventions were associated with greater weight loss than other programs. Ewald, et al, 2013 This is a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared parent -only interventions with parent -child or child -only interventions for the treatment of childhood obesity. The authors identified 10 reports from six randomized trials spanning 4 66 children . Most of the children were between ages of 5 and 12 years and were either >20% overweight or above the 85th percentile for BMI. Methodologic quality was difficult to assess due to unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of every study. Because of a high degree of heterogeneity, the authors did not perform a meta -analysis. In the narrative summary, the authors conclude that parent -only interventions are associated with similar or greater weight loss when compared with parent -child or child -only interventions. Bottom line: Evidence from a limited number of randomized trials shows that parent -only interventions are at least as , and possibly more , effective tha n either parent -child or child -only interventions for weight loss in obese children. 7 References Balk, E.

Question source : HERC staff, biennial review topic Issue: Pharmacotherapy for obesity is not in the funded region of the Prioritized List, as stated explicitly in Guideline Note 5. There have been requests to review the efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for obesity and reconsider placement on the Prioritized List. The Obesity Task Force Phase 1 met 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 and reviewed pharmacotherapy. Prioritized List Status Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE Guideline Notes -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nutrit ion and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face contact more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) are included o n this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is evidence of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on th is line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 2 Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight persons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome. Pharmacological treatments are not intended to be included as services on this line. Evidence summary Cochrane, 2003 a. Systematic review of RCTs b. Sixteen orlistat (n = 10,631), 10 sibutramine (n = 2623) and four rimonabant trials (n = 6365) met inclusion criteria. c. Attrition rates averaged 30% to 40%. d. Compared to placebo a. orlistat reduced weight by 2.9 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5 to 3.2 kg) b. sibutramine by 4.2 kg (95% CI 3.6 to 4.7 kg) c. rimonabant by 4.7 kg (95% CI 4 .1 to 5.3 kg). e. Patients on active drug therapy were significantly more likely to achieve 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds. f. Orlistat reduced diabetes incidence, improved total cholesterol, LDL -cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased rates of gastrointestinal side effects and slightly lowered HDL levels. g. Sibutramine improved HDL and triglyceride levels but raised blood pressure and pulse rate. h. Rimonabant improved HDL -cholesterol, triglyceride and blood pr essure levels and glycaemic control in patients with diabetes but increased the risk of mood disorders. i. Conclusions: All three antiobesity agents are modestly effective in reducing weight and have differing effects on cardiovascular risk and adverse effect s profiles. Longer and more methodologically rigorous studies of anti -obesity drugs that are powered to examine endpoints such as mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are required.

Summary of Recommendations 1.0 Care of the patient who is overweight or obese 1.1 We recommend that diet, exercise, and behavioral modification be included in all obesity management approaches for body mass index (BMI)_25 kg/m2 and that other tools such as pharmacotherapy (BMI 27 kg/m2 with with BMI 40 kg/m2) be used as adjuncts to behavioral modificationto reduce food intake and increase physical activity when this is possible. Drugs may amplify adherence to behavior change and may improve physical functioning such that increased physical Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 5 activity is easier in those who cannot exercise initially. Patients w ho have a history of being unable to successfully lose and maintain weight and who meet label indications are candidates for weight loss medications. (1|QQQQ) 1.2 In order to promote long -term weight maintenance, we suggest the use of approved1 weight los s medication (over no pharmacological therapy) to ameliorate comorbidities and amplify adherence to behavior changes, which may improve physical functioning and allow for greater physical activity in individuals with a BMI _ 30 kg/m2 or in individuals with a BMI of _ 27 kg/m2 and at least one associated comorbid medical condition such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and obstructive sleep apnea. (2|QQEE) 1.3 In patients with uncontrolled hypertension or a history of heart disease, we recommend against using the sympathomimetic agents phentermine and diethylpropion. (1|QQQE) 1.4 We suggest assessment of efficacy and safety at least monthly for the first 3 months, then at least every 3 months in all patients prescribed weight loss medic ations. (2|QQEE) 1.5 If a patient's response to a weight loss medication is deemed effective (weight loss _ 5% of body weight at 3 mo) and safe, we recommend that the medication be continued. If deemed ineffective (weight loss _ 5% at 3 mo) or if there ar e safety or tolerability issues at any time, we recommend that the medication be discontinued and alternative medications or referral for alternative treatment approaches be considered. (1|QQQQ) 1.6 If medication for chronic obesity management is prescrib ed as adjunctive therapy to comprehensive lifestyle intervention, we suggest initiating therapy with dose escalation based on efficacy and tolerability to the recommended dose and not exceeding the upper approved dose boundaries. (2|QQEE) 1.7 In patients with T2DM who are overweight or obese, we suggest the use of antidiabetic medications that have additional actions to promote weight loss (such as glucagon addit ion first -line agent for T2DM and obesity, metformin. (2|QQQE) 1.8 In patients with cardiovascular disease who seek pharmacological treatment for weight loss, we suggest using using medications that are not sympathomimetics such as lorcaserin and/o r orlistat. (2|QEEE) August, 2008 Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 6 Endocrine Society Pediatric Clinical Guideline Recommendations: We suggest that pharmacotherapy (in combination with lifestyle modification) be considered in: 1) obese children only after failure of a formal program of intensive lifestyle modification; and 2) overweight children only if severe comorbidities persist despite intensive lifestyle modification, particularly in children with a strong family history of type 2 diabetes or premature cardiovascular disease. In general, children with a BMI below the 95th percentile should not be treated with antiobesity drugs . Pharmacotherapy should be provided only by clinicians who are experienced in the use of antiobesity age nts and aware of the potential for adverse reactions. We suggest bariatric surgery for adolescents with BMI above 50 kg/m2, or BMI above 40 kg/m2 with severe comorbidities in whom lifestyle modifications and/or pharmacotherapy have failed.

(Weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence ) NICE, 2014 NICE Guidelines, CG 189: Obesity identification, assessment, and management http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189/chapter/1 -recommendations#pharmacological - interventions 1.8 Pharmacological interventions Adults 1.8.1 Consider pharmacological treatment only after dietary, exercise and behavioural approaches have been started and evaluated. [2006] 1.8.2 Consider drug treatment for people who have not reached their target weight loss or have reached a plateau on dietary, activity and behavioural changes. [2006] 1.8.3 Make the decision to start drug treatments after discussing the potential benefits and limitations with the person, including the mode of action, adverse effects and monitoring requirements, and the potential impact on the person's motivation. Make arrangements for appropriate healthcare professionals to offer information, support and counselling on additional diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies when drug treatment is prescribed. Provide informat ion on patient support programmes. [2006, amended 2014] Children 1.8.4 Drug treatment is not generally recommended for children younger than 12 years. [2006] 1.8.5 In children younger than 12 years, drug treatment may be used only in exceptional circumstances, if severe comorbidities are present. Prescribing should be started and monitored only in specialist paediatric settings. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.6 Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 8 In children aged 12 years and older, treatment with orlistat[ 9] is recommended only if physical comorbidities (such as orthopaedic problems or sleep apnoea) or severe psychological comorbidities are present. Treatment should be started in a specialist paediatric sett ing, by multidisciplinary teams with experience of prescribing in this age group. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.7 Do not give orlistat to children for obesity unless prescribed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in: drug monitoring psychological support behavioural interventions interventions to increase physical activity interventions to improve diet. [2006, amended 2014] 1.8.8 Drug treatment may be continued in primary care for example with a shared care protocol if local circumstances and/or licensing allow. [2006, amended 2014] 1.9 Continued prescribing and withdrawal Adults and children 1.9.1 Pharmacological treatment may be used to maintain weight loss rather than to continue to lose weight. [2006] 1.9.2 If there is concern about micronutrient intake adequacy, a supplement providing the reference nutrient intake for all vitamins and minerals should be considered, particularly for vulnerable groups such as older people (who may be at risk of malnutrition) a nd young people (who need vitamins and minerals for growth and development). [2006] 1.9.3 Offer support to help maintain weight loss to people whose drug treatment is being withdrawn; if they did not reach their target weight, their self -confidence and bel ief in their ability to make changes may be low. [2006] Adults 1.9.4 Monitor the effect of drug treatment and reinforce lifestyle advice and adherence through regular review. [2006, amended 2014] 1.9.5 Consider withdrawing drug treatment in people who have not reached weight loss targets (see recommendation 1.9.8 for details). [2006] 1.9.6 Rates of weight loss may be slower in people with type 2 diabetes, so less strict goals than those for people without diabetes may be appropriate. Agree the goals with th e person and review them regularly. [2006] 1.9.7 Only prescribe orlistat as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who meet one of the following criteria: Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 9 a BMI of 28 kg/m2 or more with associated risk factors a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or more. [2006] 1.9.8 Continue orlistat therapy beyond 3 months only if the person has lost at least 5% of their initial body weight since starting drug treatment. (See also recommendation 1.9.6 for advice on targets for people with type 2 diabetes.) [2006] 1.9.9 Mak e the decision to use drug treatment for longer than 12 months (usually for weight maintenance) after discussing potential benefits and limitations with the person. [2006] 1.9.10 The co -prescribing of orlistat with other drugs aimed at weight reduction is not recommended. [2006] Children 1.9.11 If orlistat[ 9] is prescribed for children, a 6 -12month trial is recommended, with regular review to assess effectiveness, adverse effects and adherence. [2006, amended 2014] Cost analysis Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), 2015 1) Methods - used primarily good - and fair -quality (RCTs) and prospective comparative cohort studies. Also derived harms from retrospective comparative cohort studies, and case series of >50 patients (which were also used for long -term benefit. i. Liraglutide ( Saxenda \u00ae) 1. Small net benefit for BMI 27 based on 3 studies of liraglutide + lifestyle modification v lifestyle modification alone. High rates of adverse effects (80 -96%) but low rates of discontinuation (8 -10%). Long term f/u > 2 years unknown. ii. Lorcaserin ( BELVIQ \u00ae) Small net health benefit, based on 3 good quality RCTS, reductions in total body weight were modest, ranging from 4.5 -5.8% among lorcaserin recipients, compared to a 1.5 -2.8% mean decrease among those taking the placebo (p<0.001 for lorcaserin vs. placebo in all studies). A single study reported outcomes related to comorbidity status and found 50.4% of lorcaserin patients versus 26. 3% of placebo patients achieved a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% (p>0.001).5 Discontinuation of lorcaserin from drug -related AEs occurred in 4.3 -8.6% of patients across studies, and approximately 80% of study participants experienced any AE. Only 1/3 studies reported comorbidity benefit, the others just reported on weight. Long term f/u > 2 years unknown. iii. Naltrexone/Bupropion ( Contrave \u00ae) Moderate certainty of small benefit based on 4 RCTS, recipients lost 5.0 - 9.3% of total body weight after 56 weeks follow -up; patients who received a placebo lost 1.2 -5.1% of total body weight. A single RCT reported outcomes related to improvement of comorbidities and found Pharmacotherapy for Obesity 10 that 44.1% of patients taking N/B achieved a target HbA1c <7% compared to 26.3% of placebo patients.6 Dis continuation of N/B from adverse effects occurred in 19.5 -29.3% of patients receiving standard -dose N/B across studies, and 83.1 -90.4% of patients experienced any AE. No studies > 1 year follow up. low certainty for a small net benefit in patients with BMI 30-34.9 and T2DM based on the results of a single RCT in this population. iv. Phentermine/Topiramate ( Qsymia \u00ae) - moderate certainty of small net benefit based on 8 good/fair reports from 5 RCTs. In these trials, patients receiving the recommended dose combina tion (7.5/46 mg) lost 7.8-8.5% of total body weight (vs. 1 -2% for placebo), while the range for those receiving a higher dose (15/92 mg) was 9.2 -10.9%. Patients who received any dose of P/T experienced greater improvement in obesity - related comorbidities s uch as T2DM, hypertension, and sleep apnea. We found no studies that had a patient population with mean BMI <35. Overall, 91 -95% of patients experienced one or more AEs, and 1.3 -16.0% discontinued P/T due to AEs. No data extended beyond 2 years. 2) Conclusion s re: all pharmacologic therapies - benefits are again relatively modest in comparison to conventional weight -loss management. Across all four medications, total weight loss was 3 -7% higher than achieved with placebo or active comparator therapy. In additi on, there are limited data on resolution or improvement in comorbidities, lack of information on long -term weight trends, high rates of discontinuation in many studies, and not -inconsequential concerns about potential to harm (two of the four are scheduled substances). 1. Naltrexone/buproprion - >$100,000 per QALY vs. conventional treatment. 3) CTAF panel conclusion that the evidence was inadequate to distinguish the net health benefit among the reviewed drugs. HERC Staff Assessment There is insufficient evidence to support significant improvements in health outcomes for pharmacologic treatment of obesity. A number of obesity drugs have been pulled off the market due to adverse effects. Given that outcomes are only minimal to moderate reductions in weigh t loss, without evidence of long -term significant morbid ity or mortality benefits, there are numerous adverse effects and safety concerns associated with these drugs, and that some are quite costly, there is little reason to support coverage of these medic ations. Guidelines are mixed with some recommending against the use of pharmacotherapy for obesity, and others offering weak support for their use as an adjunctive therapy. Obesity Task Force Recommendations Recommend continue d noncoverage of pharmacotherapy. There was a proposal to have it be a covered adjunctive treatment, but because of the lack of long -term patient oriented health outcomes, cost, and safety concerns, the group agreed to recommend continued noncoverage. 1) Make no change t o the current noncoverage of pharmacotherapy for obesity. Devices for Obesity 1 Question: Should a variety of devices be included on the Prioritized List in the treatment of obesity? Issue: There are a variety of devices newly approved in the treatment of obe sity including gastric balloons and vagal nerve blockade devices. There is also a gastrointestinal lining device being evaluated for use in the U.S. These are not currently included on the Prioritized List but also not explicitly excluded as many do not have identifiable procedure codes associated with them .

Based on study design, there were no control groups for these analyses. Therefore, the effect of ORBE RATM is likely being overestimated. ii. ReShape 1. 2 US RCTs, one N=30, one N = 326. 2. In the large study, sham endoscopy and diet and exercise counseling compared to ReShape and counseling were found to have statistically significantly greater %EWL at 24 -weeks fo llow -up (25.1% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.004). However, the effect of ReShapeTM on %EWL was reduced by 48 - weeks follow -up (from 25.1% to 18.8%). c. Early removal of device in 7 -8% of patients (they should be removed at 6 months in all patients normally) d. Adverse effects include: nausea (29%), vomiting, abdominal pain (34%), distension, constipation, diarrhea, gastric ulceration, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (18%). Serious side effects include migration (1.4%) and gastric perforation (0.1%). 4 deaths were re ported either due to gastric perforation or aspiration event. In one study 28/326 had serious side effects, with 75% requiring Emergency Department visits. ICER, 2015 1. Technology assessment with experts and public input a. Included RCTs, comparative cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) b. Case series >50 only for harms and long term benefit 2. Temporary intragastric balloon (IGB) insertion was associated with: a. Modest benefits at 1 year of f/u relative to conventional approaches b. Higher -quality studies sho wed incremental BMI changes and percentage weight loss of 1-3 points and 4 -8%, respectively - and also tended to worsen after balloon removal (typically after six months). c. There was great variability in study design, duration of follow -up (particularly af ter balloon removal), and treatment approach (i.e., single vs. multiple balloon insertions). 3. \"Low certainty of a comparable net benefit for temporary IGB insertion relative to either lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery in patients with a BMI 35.\" Devices for Obesity 3 Duodenal -Jejunal Bypass Liner (EndoBarrier\u00ae) ICER, 2015 1. 2 RCTS, 1 good and 1 fair comparing the duodenal -jejunal bypass liner ( DJBL ) to conventional weight -loss treatment. 2. No difference in reduction of mean BMI between control and DJBL 3. Patients in both studies reduced or discontinued anti -diabetic medications; however, data on comorbidities were not reported for control patients in one study, and statistical testing for differences was not conducted in either study. 4. Complications of the DJBL included device or anchor migration, epigastric pain, and sleeve obstruction; 2.9 -20.5% of patients had the device removed prematurely across studies. Finally, enrollment in a large clinical trial of DJBL is currently stopped pending investigation o f a higher - than -expected rate of bacterial liver infection. 5. Conclusion: insufficient evidence to low certainty of no benefit (and possible net harm) and significant adverse effects Vagus Nerve Block (Maestro\u00ae) MED, 2016 1. Rapid review of vagus nerve block (M aestro) 2. 1 RCT (ReCharge) with 2 different articles, one with 12 months and the other with 18 month follow up 3. Results: At 12 - and 18 -months follow -up, the vagal nerve block group, compared to those who received a sham device, had statistically significantly greater percentage total body weight loss (%TBWL) and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL). However, the clinical meaningfulness of these findings is uncertain. For %TBWL, at 12 months, the difference between groups was 3.3% and at 18 months it was 5.0%. The latter finding was a function of differential weight regain among the sham group between 12 and 18 months . 4. Patient oriented health outcomes (dyslipidemia, hypertension , MACE) not examined 5. Limitations of the evidence: mostly female patients, authors wit h conflicts (although did have independent review board), single trial 6. Adverse effects: 8.6% experienced a serious adverse event compared to 0.0% in the sham group. Frequent adverse events included pain at the neuroregulator site, heartburn/indigestion, abdominal and other pain, nausea, dysphagia (i.e. difficulty or discomfort with swallowing), and eructation (i.e. belching) . ICER, 2015 1. 2 RCTs. One with earlier version no longer on the market . 2. After 12 months follow -up in each study, vBloc patients lost 17 -24.4% of excess body weight versus 15.9 -16.0% excess weight loss (EWL) in control patients. 3. No comorbidity outcomes reported 4. \"Low certainty of a small or comparable net benefit for the vBloc device compared to a sham device in patients w ith a BMI 35.\" Devices for Obesity 4 Commercial payers: Aetna, 2015 1. Considers these procedures experimental and investigational because the peer -reviewed medical literature shows them to be either unsafe or inadequately studied: a. Gastric balloon b. Vagus nerve blocking (e.g., vBloc therapy provided by the Maestro Rechargeable System) c. Gastrointestinal liners (EndoBarrier) Cigna, 2015 1. Cigna does not cover the following bariatric surgery procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity, when performed alone or in conjunction with anothe r bariatric surgery procedure, because each is considered experimental, investigational or unproven (this list may not be all - inclusive): a. Intragastric balloon b. Duodenojejunal bypass liner (e.g., Endobarrier) c. Vagus nerve blocking (e.g., Maestro\u00ae) HERC Staff Assessment: The devices for obesity reviewed here : gastric balloons ORBERA and ReShape , the vagus nerve stimulator (Maestro), and the duodenal jejunal bypass liner (Endobarrier) , have insufficient evidence demonstrating long term health outcomes and have high adverse event rates . None of these are recommended for inclusion on the Prioritized List. Similarly, t wo prominent commercial insurers do not cover any of these interventions because they are considered experimental . There are not distinct CPT or HCPCS codes for many of these devices, making addition to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage table logistically difficult. HERC Staff Recommendations: 1. Add an entry to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage table for these devices, even though there are no specific codes for many of them. 2. Add language to Guideline Note 5 making it clear that these devices are not included on the funded obesity line. GUIDELINE NOTE 5, OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT Line 325 Medical treatment of overweight (with known cardiovascular risk factors) and obesity is limited to accepted intensive counseling on nutrition and physical activity, provided by health care professionals. Intensive counseling is defined as face -to-face cont act more than monthly. Visits are not to exceed more than once per week. Intensive counseling visits (once every 1 -2 weeks) are included Devices for Obesity 5 on this line for 6 months. Intensive counseling visits may continue for longer than 6 months as long as there is eviden ce of continued weight loss or improvement in cardiovascular risk factors based on the intervention. Maintenance visits are included on this line no more than monthly after this intensive counseling period. Known cardiovascular risk factors in overweight p ersons for which this therapy is effective include: hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, or the metabolic syndrome. Pharmacological treatments and devices ( e.g. gastric balloons, duodenal jejunal bypass liners, and vagus nerve blocking dev ices) for obesity are not intended to be included as services on this line or any other line on the Prioritized List. Multisector Intervention Statement for Obesity 1 Question: How should the multisector intervention report on obesity be applied to the Prioritized List? Question Source: Obesity Task Force, HERC Staff Issue: The obesity task force looked at reviews published in the last five years based on the following scope statement: Population description Overweight and obese patients, including adults, children, and adolescents Population scoping notes: Includes interven tions targeted at parents, pregnant women, and others that impact outcomes in children Intervention(s) Multisector interventions such as community interventions, policy, systems, and environmental change Intervention exclusions: None Comparator(s) No care, usual care, other studied interventions Outcome(s) (up to five) Critical: Morbidity, all -cause mortality Important: Weight loss, remission/prevention of diabetes, remission of hypertension Considered but not selected for GRADE Table: None Key questions What interventions are most effective and most cost -effective at achieving weight loss and improving patient outcomes? Does effectiveness vary by socioeconomic factors such as race, ethnicity, income, and educational attainment? What models of ca re would allow these interventions to be implemented most effectively and cost -effectively? Summary The Obesity Task Force Phase 2 reviewed a scope statement to approach multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity. The OHSU Center for Evidence - based Policy performed a literature search, limited to English -language systematic reviews published in the last 4 ye ars. They were further limited to the most recent reviews, unless conclusions were divergent. Sixteen systematic reviews were included in the evidence Multisector Intervention Statement for Obesity 2 summary . The obesity task force discussed the limitations of the literature, including a lack of data on the critical and some important outcomes, and the need to consider impact on physical activity and improved nutrition instead of only on BMI indices, which are flawed. They also assisted with identifying the policy landscape as well . Ultimately the Ob esity Task Force created a summary document of the literature identified. See the Obesity Task Force Phase 2 summary document. The proposed Multisector Intervention Statement on the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity lists those interventions for which there is at least limited evidence to support their effectiveness. The following have insufficient evidence to demonstrate effectiveness to impact obesity: Intervention Outcome Changes in food voucher policy (changes in WIC benefits and allowing purchase of food from farmer's market using SNAP benefits, among low - income immigrants) (Mayne et al., 2015) Evidence shows no association with reduced BMI, but does show an association with increased purchase, presence in home/home availability, and consumption of healthy foods. Interventions to increase use of stairs (signs, stairwell improvements) (Bellicha et al., 2014) Limited evidence shows a modest effect on stair use; weight -related outcomes not reported. Community -based, multicomponent physical activity interventions (e.g., fitness classes and programs, interactive group sessions, walking groups, counseling, social support, health promotion materials, and/or media campaigns) targeting women 18 -65 years old Evidence support for enhanced physical activity o utcomes but not for weight -related outcomes Financial incentives to change health habits in terms of physical activity and healthy eating Mixed evidence that incentives increase physical activity or healthy eating at up to 12 months while incentives rem ain in place Interventions to modify diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, or a combination that target children age 2 -18 in their homes or include significant family involvement Inconclusive evidence on BMI; some studies showed significant improvements in diet or physical activity HERC Staff recommendations: Add a Multisector Intervention statement on Obesity to the Prioritized List MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS: PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OBESITY Limited evidence supports the following inte rventions: Multisector Intervention Statement for Obesity 3 School and childcare settings School based interventions to reduce BMI (especially with physical activity focus) School nutrition policy and day care meal standards Family -based group education programs delivered in schools Obesity prevention interventions in childcare settings (nutrition education, healthy cooking classes for 2 -6 year olds , physical activity and playful games) Community level interventions Environmental interventions (social marketing, cafeteria signs, farmers markets, walking groups, etc) Introduction of light rail Community -based group health education and counseling interventions, workplace education interventions Workplace and college interventions to improve physical activity Multiple settings: Interventions to reduce sedentary screen time (in some studies, also to increase physical activity and nutrition). Multicomponent individual mentored health promotion programs to prevent childhood obesity Parental support interventions for diet and physical activity (group educat ion, mental health counseling) Policy change s Sugar sweetened beverage taxes Elimination of tax subsidy for advertising unhealthy food to children This Multisector Interventions statement is based on the work of the HERC Obesity Task Force and the full su mmary of the evidence report is available here: WEBSITE HEALTH EVIDENCE REVIEW COMMISSION (HERC) MULTISECTOR INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OBESITY For HERC/VbBS meeting materials 10/6/2016 Table of Contents Evidence Summary 44 1 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 The interventions listed in the Evidence Summary T able are reviewe d in the evidence summary below and are recommended by a major organization with expertise in public health.

The Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) requested that staff members conduct research on available interventions to address obesity, including interventions outside of traditional health care systems. Increasingly, public and private health care payers, including HERC, recognize that in order to achieve their goals to improve patient experience of care, population health , and the cost -effectiveness of health care, they must consider evidence -based multisector interventions along with individually focused clinical care. In so doing , they can maximize health and economic outcomes. Multisector interventions such as the ones described here can be cost -effective ways to prevent, treat or manage disease at a population level. This report was prepared in consult ation with the Obesity Task Force members (See Appendix B), who served as subject matter experts from a variety of related disciplines. These interventions will directly inform the Prioritized List and are intended to aid coordinated care organizations as they seek to effectively address obesity, and we hope that they will be useful to private health plans and policymakers interested in using the tools at their disposal to prevent and reduce obesity. BACKGROUND Today, more than one in four adults in Orego n are obese, which equates to over 8 00,000 people. In addition, 15% of Oregon's six- to nine -year -olds were obese in 2012 . Children who are obese are more likely to become obese adults , putting them at a greater risk of chronic disease. Obesity can lead to diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure , high cholesterol, arthritis, heart disease , and stroke , taking a toll on families and the health care system. In Oregon, obesity contributes to 1,500 deaths per year. It is second only to tobacco a s a leadin g cause of preventable death. In 2009 n early 73% of adult Oregonians with a history of heart attacks were overweight or obese. According to a 2012 report from the Institute of Medicine, national costs attributed to treating obesity - related disea ses are estimated to be $190 billion , which represent s 21% of all health care spending . Obesity -related chronic diseases cost Oregonians about $1.6 billion in medical expenses each year, with $339 million of that paid by Medicare and $333 million paid by M edicaid. People who are obese are estimated to have annual medical costs that are $1,429 higher than people who are not obese . Clinical strategies to prevent and treat obesity include screening, behavioral counseling, medications, referral to weight -loss p rograms, and surgery. Many of these have limited efficacy and primarily focus on treatment, rather than prevention of obesity. Given the widespread prevalence of obesity and its significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and societal costs, it is importan t to understand the range of effective interventions that can occur inside and outside of a clinical setting . Preventing obesity is likely to be the most cost -effective strategy, and solutions in the community setting have the potential to affect a large number of people. This report on multisector interventions for obesity examines 9 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity that occur in community settings, which can be policies, programs, or environmental changes. EVIDENCE REVIEW General Multisector Interventions Mayne et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of natural or quasi -experimental studies conducted to examine the effects of policy and built environment changes on obesity outcomes. The authors identified 37 studies, but only three of these studies measured weight or body mass index (BMI) outcomes (the remaining studies only examined changes in dietary composition or physical activity). One study of school nutrition policy and day care meal standards involving almost 68,00 0 children in Chile found mixed results for the outcomes of BMI z -score and obesity prevalence , and the initial improvements were not sustained at 24 months. The second study examined the effects of changes in food voucher policy among 72,000 low -income im migrant adults in the United States and found no association between the policy change and BMI. The third study measuring weight - or BMI -related outcomes , which was designed as a longitudinal within -person study of the effects of a new light rail system in Charlotte, North Carolina , found that use of the light rail system was associated with a self -reported BMI reduction of 1.18 kg/m2 (95% CI -2.22 to -0.13) and reduced the odds of incident obesity. The authors did note that weaker study designs are more li kely to report positive findings. Two additional studies, which assessed the association between nutrition and changes in food voucher policy, considered non -weight outcomes . One of these studies found an increase in home availability and consumption of he althy foods associated with changing food voucher -eligible foods among Hispanic and African American mothers and children enrolled in Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) . The other study found an increase in the purchase of healthy foods associated with loc al changes to vendor payment systems (i.e., permitting farmer s markets to accept food vouchers). Bottom line: There is limited evidence from a study in one community that the use of a new light rail system was associated with a small reduction in self -repo rted BMI and incident obesity. The results of nutritional policy interventions were mixed. Amiri Farahani et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of community -based physical activity interventions targeting women ages 18 to 65 years old. The aut hors identified nine studies including four methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Most of the studies were conducted in the United States and involved multicomponent interventions to promote physical activity. Most of the intervent ions involved social support, goal setting, barrier anticipation, and self -monitoring; these were provided in theoretical constructs of social cognitive theory and social marketing theory. One trial involved a combined exercise program for mothers and daug hters and one included a free gym membership. Although seven of the nine studies reported positive effects on physical activity, only four studies reported statistically significant improvements. No studies reported on weight or BMI outcomes. The authors c oncluded that there was \"insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of community - based interventions for enhancing physical activity among women.\" 10 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Several programs found improvements in physical activity, but there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of community -based physical activity promotion programs for weight loss in adult women. Hillier -Brown et al., 2014 a This is a narrative systematic review of interventions applied at various levels to reduce socioeconomic disparities in adult obesity. Interventions were classified as occurring at the individual, community, or societal levels. Five studies at the individual level were included : four examined tailored weight -loss plans delivered via primary care, and the fifth wa s a long -term study of an educational intervention for obesity prevention. The individually tailored weight -loss plans delivered in primary care appeared to be effective at up to 12 months . Several of the studies showed greater effects among African Americ an participants. At the community level, the authors identified 12 studies : eight examined community - based group health education and counseling interventions, two examined workplace education interventions, and two examined family -based group education pr ograms delivered in schools. Overall, the results of the community -based interventions were mixed ; some of the studies of community - based education and counseling programs showed modest reductions in BMI, but only in the short term (3 to 6 months). At the societal level, the authors identified three studies . The first was an initiative involving environmental strategies to encourage healthful eating and physical activity through \"social marketing... stairway signs, cafeteria signs, farmers markets, walking gr oups, challenges, workshops, educational displays, newsletters, project website, project information centre and print materials .\" This study showed modest positive results, but only among the higher -educated participants. The other two societal -level studi es examined the effects of changes in the structure of nutrition assistance programs for poor women; neither study found significant effects on obesity. Bottom line: There is some evidence of effectiveness for individual -level interventions (particularly those involving tailored weight -loss plans in primary care) in reducing inequalities in adult obesity, but there was less evidence for the effectiveness of community - and societal -level interventions. Workplace Interventions Bellicha et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of stairs. Fifty studies, conducted in a mix of workplace and public settings, were included. The primary outcome measure was stair climbing (ascent only ) or stair use (ascent and descent combined). The interventions consisted of a mix of motivational and directional signs with or without stairwell enhancements. The study designs were nearly all pre -post comparisons and none were judged to be high quality. Modest improvements in stair climbing (absolute median increase of about 4%) were noted in most studies during the intervention period. The combination of motivational and directional signs appeared to be more effective than motivational signs alone. Thre e of the four studies of stairwell enhancements showed similar results (absolute median increase in stair climbing of 4.4%) to the motivational and directional signs. The authors note d that elements of external validity (i.e., implementation) were \"largely underreported\" in the literature. No weight, BMI, or health outcomes were reported. 11 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Motivational and directional signs and stairwell improvements probably lead to modest increases in stair use, but the external validity of these studies remai ns uncertain. Malik et al., 2014 This is a narrative systematic review of health promotion interventions in the workplace to increase physical activity. The authors identified 58 studies including exercise interventions (6 studies), counseling and support interventions (13 studies), and informational or health promotion message interventions (39 studies). The primary outcomes were measures of physical activity. The exercise intervention studies were mostly RCTs or cluster randomized trials. Two of the six studies showed statistically significant increases in physical activity (increased step counts in both of the positive studies); the remaining studies did not demonstrate an effect. The counseling and support interventions, which included telephonic counse ling and peer support programs, used mostly RCT and quasi -experimental designs , but there were substantial issues with blinding, use of intention -to-treat, baseline group differences, and attrition. Of the 13 studies , 8 showed statistically significant inc reases in measures of physical activity or total energy expenditure. The informational and health promotion message interventions were diverse and mostly studied using RCT and quasi -experimental designs, but as with other included studies there were method ologic al flaws in most trials. Of the 39 studies , 22 showed statistically significant increases in physical activity; programs that included stage -of-change matched informational materials were more likely to report significant results. Weight, BMI, and health outcomes were not reported. The authors' conclusion was that the evidence for workplace health promotion interventions was mixed and inconclusive. Bottom line: Evidence that workplace health promotion interventions lead to increased physical activity is mixed. Gudzune et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of workplace or college -based interventions to prevent weight gain. The authors identified seven workplace and two college -based studies using randomized, cluster - randomized, or quasi -experimental designs. The age, gender, and other participant characteristics varied by study site. The studied interventions were diverse and included environmental changes, health promotion and informational programs, educational programs (including a 4 -month college course on preventing weight gain), supported self -management programs, or some combination of the interventions. Five of the workplace studies and both college -based studies reported BMI outcomes at 12 to 24 months. At 24 months, one of the wo rkplace studies showed that intervention group participants had a BMI 0.3 kg/m2 lower than the control group. Another showed that the intervention group had a BMI 0.2 kg/m2 higher than the control group at 12 months. Both of these results were statisticall y significant . Three other studies showed no difference between intervention and control groups. In both of the college -based programs , the intervention group had a lower BMI at 12 months ( -0.5 kg/m2 and -1.6 kg/m2), although only the former result was statistically significant. Overall, the authors deemed the evidence for BMI reduction to be low strength because of issues with bias in the nonrandomized trials and inadequate blinding of outcomes assessors. The authors concluded that there was limited evi dence for workplace and college -based interventions to prevent weight gain. Bottom line: There is mixed evidence that workplace interventions are effective to prevent weight gain. There is limited evidence that college -based interventions are effective. 12 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Sugar -sweetened Beverage Taxes Cabrera Escobar et al., 2013 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of the effects of sugar -sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes on SSB demand and obesity. Nine studies, six from the US and one each from Mexico, Brazil, and France were included. The primary outcomes were own -price and cross -price elasticity (measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded), and change in obesity rates or BMI. All studies showed negative own -price elasticity ranging from -0.85 to -4.45 with a meta estimate of -1.3 (95% CI - 1.089 to -1.509). These results suggest that the demand for SSBs is elastic and that SSB price increases are associated with reduced demand. Cross -price elasticities meant to measure the effects of SSB price increases on demand for other beverages were studied in five of the nine studies. The overall estimate is that SSB price increases result in slightly increased demand for fruit juice and milk and slightly lower demand for diet beverages. Meta -analysis coul d not be performed for the effect of SSB taxes on obesity and BMI. One study estimated that a 10% increase in SSB price would lead to a reduction in the point prevalence of obesity of -0.34% for men and -0.05% for women. A second study estimated that a 20% increase in the SSB price would reduce the point prevalence of overweight by -0.045% and obesity by -0.03%. A third study estimated that a 20% increase in the price of SSBs would reduce BMI by -0.065 kg/m2. A fourth study reported that 1% grocery soda tax es and soft drink vending machine taxes would increase BMI by 0.012 kg/m2 and 0.011 kg/m2 respectively, although neither result was statistically significant. The fifth study found that a 1% increase in SSB price would produce only small effects on BMI of -0.0031 kg/m2 for adults and -0.015 kg/m2 for children and adolescents. Overall, the authors conclude d that SSB taxes or price increases may benefit health. Bottom line: SSB prices are elastic and SSB taxes can reduce demand, but the estimated effects of S SB price increases on obesity prevalence and BMI are modest. Long et al., 2015 This is a modeling study of the cost -effectiveness of SSB taxes in the U.S. Key assumptions of the model are 1) an own -price elasticity for SSBs of -1.22 , 2) a reduction of SSB consumption of 8 oz/day leads to weight loss of about 1 kg in children , and 3) a reduction of 12 oz/day leads to a BMI change of -0.39 kg/m2 for adults. Health gains were estimated for a 10-year period using a Markov cohort model. The model accounts for d ownstream changes in a variety of obesity -related illnesses to produce estimates of quality -adjusted life years and disability -adjusted life years. The model also estimated differences in health care expenditures using inputs from the Medical Expenditure P anel Survey. Based on the model, a national SSB excise tax of $0.01/oz would lead to a 20% reduction in consumption , which in turn would reduce an average adult 's BMI by 0.08 kg/m2 and a youth 's BMI by 0.16 kg/m2. The prevalence of obesity among adults and children would decrease by 0.99% and 1.38% respectively. In the 10 -year period between 2015 and 2025, the SSB excise tax would lead to 871,000 quality -adjusted life years ( QALYs ) gained and reduce health care costs by $23.6 billion. Thus, the intervention was deemed cost -saving, a finding that was maintained across varied inputs in the sensitivity analysis. Bottom line : This modeling study suggests that a national SSB excise tax of $0.01/oz would reduce the prevalence of obesity by about 1% and avert near ly $25 billion in health care costs in a 10-year period . 13 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Financial Incentives Mantzari et al., 2015 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of financial incentives for changing health -related behaviors. The review identified 15 studies examining the effects of financial incentives on markers of healthier eating and physical activity and two studies on physical activity alone. Most of the studies were conducted in the U.S. in a variety of settings including workplaces, communities , health care, and academia. The magnitude and duration of the financial incentives varied greatly across studies , and some studies used financial incentives with other interventions such as counseling. The studies were a mix of randomized and cluster rand omized designs. Financial incentive s targeted at indicators of healthier eating and physical activity showed positive results at up to 12 months (OR for attainment of target behaviors 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88), but the improvements were not sustained afte r removal of the financial incentive (OR 1.11, CI 0.76 to 1.63). The authors observe d that higher -value financial incentives were more effective than lower -value incentives for smoking cessation , although they did not observe this effect in the diet and ph ysical activity trials. Bottom line: Financial incentives to change eating and physical activity habits are effective at up to 12 months, but the effects are attenuated beyond 12 months and appear to not be sustained after the incentive is removed. Note: A separate systematic review and meta -analysis ( Giles et al., 2014 ) included studies of financial incentives for smoking cessation, vaccinations, and physical activity, although the authors identified only one study on physical activity. Across all the stu dies, the relative risk for attainment of target behaviors was 1.62 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.91), but the authors observed that the effect size decreased at post -intervention follow -up. Their overall conclusion was that financial incentives are more effective than usual care. General Multisector Interventions for Children Ramsey Buchanan et al., 2016 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of interventions to reduce recreational sedentary screen time. It was prepared for the Centers for Disease Control and P revention (CDC) Community Guide. The authors identified 49 studies; 12 studies focused on reducing screen time only, and 37 studies examined interventions to reduce sedentary screen time and improve physical activity or nutrition. The interventions in the studies were diverse and included classroom -based education, tracking and monitoring of screen time, coaching or counseling, and family or peer social support. Additional intervention components were devices to monitor and limit screen time, media and educ ational campaigns, and contingent rewards (i.e. , screen time as a reward for physical activity). The authors defined high -intensity interventions as those that included electronic monitoring and limitation of screen time and at least three personal or comp uter -based interactions. Reported outcomes of interest included BMI, BMI z -score, and obesity prevalence. For children, two screen time -only and twelve screen time -plus studies showed an aggregate decrease in BMI z -score of -0.13 (interquartile interval [ IQI] -0.23 to -0.01). adults, showed BMI reductions of -0.18 kg/m2 and -0.19 kg/m2. In terms of obesity prevalence, 10 high -intensity screen time -plus interventions were estimated to decrease median obesity prevalence by -2.1% (IQI -3.9 to - 1.1, baseline obesity prevalence of 10.3%). Four studies of low -intensity screen time interventions 14 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 were estimated to reduce median obesity prevalence by -4.6% (IQI -7.6 to -1.1, baseline obesity prevalence of 12.3%). Among five studies that stratified an alysis according to socioeconomic status, four found greater effectiveness for reducing BMI and obesity prevalence among low -income participants. Bottom line: Interventions to reduce screen time are effective in reducing BMI and obesity prevalence. This effect has been observed mostly in children younger than 13 years old, but a smaller number of studies also support the effectiveness of these interventions in adults. Interventions that include electronic monitoring and control of screen time appear to be more effective. The results also suggest that screen -time interventions may reduce socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence in children with high and lo w socioeconomic status . Kader et al., 2015 This is a narrative systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of parental support interventions to promote dietary changes and increase physical activity . The authors identified 35 studies and divi ded the parental support interventions into four categories: individual counseling, group education, informational -only, and individual telephone counseling. Of the 35 studies , 16 reported on weight outcomes for children, but most of these studies were not powered to detect changes in BMI. One of the four studies of in-person counseling found a decrease in the prevalence of obesity among girls but not boys , and those results were not sustained at later follow -up. Four of the seven studies involving group ed ucation showed improvement in weight -related outcomes. Information -only programs appeared to be ineffective. One of the two studies on telephone counseling showed a reduction in BMI z -score. The authors conclude d that for weight -related outcomes, group edu cation programs appear ed to be more effective than other universal parental interventions. Among five studies conducted exclusively in low socioeconomic status or minority populations, 6 to 12 group education sessions for parents of preschool -age children were associated with \"desirable effects on weight status.\" Bottom line: Group education programs appear to be more effective than other types of parental intervention for weight outcomes, especially for low -socioeconomic status and minority children. Hilli er-Brown et al., 2014b This is a narrative systematic review of interventions applied at various levels to reduce socioeconomic disparities in childhood obesity. Interventions were classified as occurring at the individual, community, or societal levels. T he authors identified four studies at the individual level, 17 studies at the community level, and one study at the societal level. Among the individual interventions, screen - time reduction and mentored health -promotion programs showed the most promise for reducing disparities. The authors concluded that the evidence for community -level interventions was inconclusive , with mixed results in studies of school - and community -based health -promotion programs. The single societal -level study of environmental chan ges in Swiss preschools showed no significant differences in BMI or overweight prevalence, but there was a \"trend towards more beneficial effects in higher SES [socioeconomic status] children.\" There was no evidence that any of the interventions worsened i nequalities in obesity outcomes. The authors conclude d that there was limited evidence , but that some individual - and community -level interventions may be effective in reducing disparities in obesity -related outcomes for children. 15 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Bottom line: Some individ ual interventions (screen -time reduction and mentored health -promotion programs) show promising results for reducing disparities in childhood obesity, and reported outcomes for community interventions were inconclusive or mixed. Showell et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of home -based interventions on childhood obesity. The authors identified six studies including combined physical activity and diet interventions ( three studies), diet - only interventions ( one study), interventions spanning h ome, school , and primary care settings ( one study), and interventions with primary care and consumer health informatics components ( one study). Overall, none of the studies showed statistically significant reductions in BMI or obesity prevalence, although three studies showed improvements in diet or physical activity. The authors judged the evidence quality to be low or insufficient and called for better studies of home -based interventions. Bottom line: There is insufficient evidence that home -based interve ntions are effective for reducing BMI or obesity prevalence in children. School -based Interventions Sun et al., 2013 This is a narrative systematic review of trials examining school -based direct delivery of physical activity interventions. The authors ide ntified six large, high -quality RCTs of high -dose physical activity in schools. Three of the six studies found statistically significant reductions in BMI; the three remaining trials did not find statistically significant effects. Overall, the authors obse rved that high -dose direct delivery of physical activity in schools was associated with improved fitness measures, but that the effects on BMI, body fat, and waist circumference were inconclusive. Bottom line: High -dose physical activity interventions in schools improve fitness measures, but do not have a clear effect on weight -related outcomes. Lavelle et al., 2012 This is a systematic review and meta -analysis of school -based interventions to reduce BMI. The authors identified 43 RCTs, cluster -randomized, and quasi -randomized trials of school -based interventions that reported on BMI outcomes. These interventions were diverse (targeting physical activity, sedentary behavior, and nutrition) and varied in terms of which components were included: direct physic al activity, nutrition and activity education, self -management and self -esteem building, and environmental changes (i.e. , school meal changes or removal of vending machines). As expected, there was a high degree of heterogeneity. Two -thirds of the studies showed reductions in BMI ; 16 of those demonstrated statistically significant differences. In the meta -analysis, the estimate of BMI reduction was -0.17 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.26 to -0.08). Notably, in the stratified analyses, the results were only statistically significant for girls. Among the studies in which interventions were only targeted at overweight and obese children, the meta -analysis showed a reduction in CI - 0.58 to -0.12). Bottom line: School -based interventions, particularly those that contain a physical activity component, are associated with a statistically significant reduction in BMI and the effect is greatest in overweight and obese children. 16 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Childcare -based Interventions Zhou et al., 2014 This is a narrative systematic r eview of obesity prevention interventions delivered in childcare settings. The authors identified 15 randomized, cluster randomized , and nonrandomized controlled trials that reported on adiposity outcomes. The study participants were two- to six-year -old children in preschool childcare centers in several countries; about half the participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged. The interventions were varied and included structured age -appropriate nutrition education, healthy cooking classes, physical act ivity, and playful games. Several programs also included a component of parental education. The interventions lasted from six months to two years. Overall, the results were mixed : 7 of the 15 studies reported improvements in measures of adiposity including BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, or decreased prevalence of overweight compared to controls. All of the studies with positive results included both nutrition and physical activity components. Among the remaining studies , many reported positi ve effects on measures of physical activity or nutrition, but did not show improvements in adiposity outcomes. Bottom line: There is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of interventions delivered in childcare settings to reduce obesity. Studies with po sitive results for this outcome all included combined physical activity and nutrition interventions. OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource Allocation A recent artic le in Health Affairs (Gortmaker et al., 2015) summarized research on seven interventions to reduc e childhood obesity. The study estimated the effects of each of the seven interventions using an evidence review protocol. A microsimulation model was developed to calculate the costs and effectiveness of the interventions through their impact on BMI chang es, obesity prevalence, and obesity -related health care costs in a 10 -year period (2015 -2025). Three of the interventions were found to save more in health care costs than they cost to implement : Sugar -sweetened beverage excise tax of one cent per ounce Nutrition standards for food and beverages sold in schools outside of meals Elimination of the tax subsidy for advertising unhealthy food to children The other studied interventions cost more to implement than they save on health care costs , but are likely still cost -effective : Restaurant menu calorie labeling Nutrition standards for school meals Improved early childhood education policies and practices, including the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self -Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) program Four -fold increase in the use of bariatric surgery among adolescents . In particular, increasing adolescents' access to bariatric surgery was found to have a negligible impact on obesity prevalence. 17 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 POLICY LANDSCAPE Recommendations from others The following recommendations are from these major public health organizations: The Community P reventive Services Task Force The Institute of Medicine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Association of State and Territorial Health Officials World H ealth Organization White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity The Community Preventive Services Task Force \u2014Obesity Prevention and Control: Interventions in Community Settings 1. Behavioral interventions that aim to reduce recreational sedentary screen tim e among children Definition: These are behavioral interventions that aim to reduce recreational (i.e., neither school - related nor work -related) sedentary screen time by teaching behavioral self -management skills to initiate or maintain behavior change. Interventions may be screen -time only interventions as well as interventions that combine a focus on reducing recreational screen time with increasing physical activity and improving diet. Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in August 2014 and recommended behavioral interventions to reduce recreational sedentary screen time among children aged 13 years and younger. This finding is based on strong evidence of effect iveness in reducing recreational sedentary screen time, increasing physical activity, improving diet, and improving or maintaining weight -related outcomes. Evidence includes studies of interventions that focus only on reducing recreational sedentary screen time (screen -time -only) and studies that focus on reducing recreational sedentary screen time and improving physical activity and/or diet (screen -time - plus). Limited evidence was available to assess the effectiveness of these interventions among adults. 2. Worksite interventions Definition: These are a suite of interventions operating on both individual and systemic levels through a combination of policy and system change, as well as individual encouragement. Components include: Informational and educatio nal strategies that aim to increase knowledge about a healthy diet and physical activity (e.g., educational software or lectures) Behavioral and social strategies target the thoughts (e.g. awareness, self -efficacy) and social factors that affect behavior changes (e.g., individual or group counseling and skill building) Policy and environmental approaches aim to make healthy choices easier and target the entire workforce by changing physical or organizational structures (e.g., improve access to healthier options in cafeterias, provide on -site facilities for exercise, employers cover health club membership) 18 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Worksite weight control strategies may occur separately or as part of a comprehensive worksite wellness program that addresses several health issues (e.g. , smoking cessation, stress management, cholesterol reduction). Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in 2007 and recommended worksit e programs intended to improve diet and/or physical activity behaviors based on strong evidence of their effectiveness for reducing weight among employees. 3. Technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions to reduce weight and ma intain weight loss Definition: Technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions use technology to facilitate or mediate interactions between a coach or counselor and an individual or group, with a goal of influencing weight -related behaviors or weight -related outcomes. These interventions often also include other components, which may be technological or non -technological (e.g., in -person counseling). Evidence Base: The Community Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the evidence in 2009 and recommended technology -supported multicomponent coaching or counseling interventions intended to reduce and maintain weight loss on the basis of sufficient evidence that they are effective in improving weight -related behaviors or weight -related outcomes. The Institute of Medicine \u2014Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention Goal 1: Make physical activity an integral and routine part of life Recommendation: Communities, transportation officials, community planners, health professionals, and governments should make promotion of physical activity a priority by substantially increasing access to places and opport unities for such activity.

Association of State and Territorial Health Officials \u2014Recommendations for Preventing and Reducing Obesity 1. Support Infrastructure for State and Territorial Health Agencies to Address Obesity. Partnerships Promote partnerships across state, territor ial, federal, and local governments, private sector partners and businesses, community groups, and healthcare systems that provide safe, culturally competent, and appropriate programs. These partnerships should transform communities by affecting policy and implementing initiatives, cross -cutting programs, and consistent targeted messages. Promote partnerships within state and territorial health agencies to support coordination among all programs, such as nutrition and physical activity, heart disease and st roke prevention, injury and violence prevention, diabetes prevention and control, maternal and child health, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and other related chronic disease prevention programs. Promote partnerships across state and terri torial health agencies that support obesity prevention policy and environmental change in cooperation with agencies overseeing education, transportation, housing, agriculture, healthcare, and other sectors. Coordination Foster engagement among multiple sec tors, including state health agency leadership and to provide comprehensive systematic change to address issues such as food deserts, which encourage unhealthy eating and are most often found in low -income, rural, and minority neighborhoods. Address health y eating and active living policies and programs with an effective, coordinated, sustainable infrastructure within state health agency programs. Coordinate chronic disease programs to provide infrastructure for all programs in order to have adequate and co ordinated leadership that supports communication, evaluation, surveillance, and management of related programs. Leadership Adopt comprehensive healthy workplace policies within health agencies and throughout state government with the support of state leadership, including implementing health risk assessments; healthy food procurement policies that include agency food purchasing, events and meetings, vending machines, and cafeterias; and other incentives for employees to improve their health. 2. Support Policy and Environmental Changes across the Lifespan. National Guidelines 24 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 Implement policy, programmatic, and other system changes in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to ensure that he althy food and physical activity is accessible to all populations and consider regulatory approaches to implement and enforce obesity prevention measures. (For example, breastfeeding policies in government nutrition programs, such as the Women, Infants, an d Children program and Adult Care Food program; encouraging and supporting hospitals to pass Baby -Friendly Hospital practices; and supporting adequate time and space for breastfeeding or expressing milk in all workplaces.) Promote the food marketing princi ples developed by the U.S. Interagency Working Group that guides the food industry in determining which foods would be appropriate and desirable to market to children ages 2 to 17 to encourage a healthful diet and which foods the industry should voluntaril y refrain from marketing to children. Encourage and enforce nutrition labeling in restaurants and similar establishments and vending policies that provide consumers with appropriate information at the point of purchase and encourage support for state healt h agencies to provide the regulatory structure to enforce these policies. Education Support early childhood education policies that describe access to healthy foods and beverages through the Child and Adult Food Care Program and state child care licensing standards that include nutrition and wellness guidelines, age -appropriate physical activity time and intensity, limited screen time, and meals and snacks that meet nutrition guidelines. Support education policies that encourage healthy students through coo rdinated K -12 school health programs, adequate time and intensity of physical education and activity, access to healthy foods and beverages through the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program and throughout the school day that meet updated standards de veloped by USDA and the Dietary Guidelines 2010, and implementation of school wellness policies, farm to school programs, and joint use agreements. Improved Industry Standards Promote worksite wellness policies and accreditation programs that encourage a h ealthy work environment, such as incentive programs for individuals to maintain healthy weight; inclusion of preventive services in routine clinical practice, including reimbursement for proven clinical preventive services; healthy foods and physical activ ity at meetings and events, and healthy foods in vending machines; and policies for breastfeeding or expressing milk in the workplace.

Search Strategy A sea rch of MEDLINE\u00ae was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, and guidelines related to reducing obesity that were published since 2011. Search terms included \"Weight Reduction Programs\"[Mesh], \"Diet, Reducing\"[Mesh], and physical activity. In addition, a Google search was conducted for guidelines or recommendations related to obesity control. Systematic reviews were excluded if they did not report on at least one of the following outcomes: morbidity, mortality, weight loss, remission/prevent ion of diabetes, remission of hypertension. The included interventions were those that were not limited to clinical settings, such as community interventions, policy, systems, and environmental change. Due to the large number of systematic reviews for some interventions, the most recent and/or comprehensive review was used unless the overall conclusions of the reviews were divergent. 44 Multisector interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity For HERC meeting materials 10/6/2016 APPENDIX B.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in: Patients with BMI <35, or 3540 without the defined comorbid conditions above (weak recommendation) Children and adolescents (weak recommendation) Note: Definitions for strength of recommendation are provided in Appendix B: GRADE Informed Framework - Element Descriptions. RATIONALE FOR GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents important uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clinical care Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Coverage guidance development follows to translate the evidence review to a policy decision. Coverage guidance may be based on an evidencebased guideline developed by the Evidencebased Guideline Subcommittee or a health technology assessment developed by the Heath Technology Assessment Subcommittee. In addition, coverage guidance may utilize an existing evidence report produced by one of HERC's trusted sources, generally within the last three years. 2 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials GRADEINFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assessment of two independent reviewers from the Center for Evidencebased Policy. Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission. Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in adults? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Allcause mortality (Critical outcome) Odds ratio: 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64) Crude event rates 3.6% with surgery and 11.4% without surgery Number needed to treat = 13 Bariatric surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars per surgery, but has been shown to be cost effective across BMI thresholds and surgery types. Patients would balance surgery and its risks with risks of living with morbid obesity. Many patients who have failed conservative attempts at weight loss may elect surgery. The benefits of decreased mortality, dramatic weight loss, and regression of diabetes are important outcomes that patients and society would The greatest benefit may be with BMI 40 but otherwise specific subpopulations which would benefit the most from bariatric surgery are not well characterized. The preoperative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the rate of complications and need (low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) Major adverse cardiovascular events (Critical outcome ) Odds ratio: 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) Crude event rates 2.4% with surgery and 4.0% without surgery Number needed to treat = 62 (low certainty based on consistent but indirect observational studies) 3 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in adults?

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Rationale: Bariatric surgery appears to lower allcause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in obese adults (low certainty), and significantly reduces BMI, and results in resolution of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The greatest benefit appears to be with BMI 40. Though bariatric surgery is costly and carries significant perioperative risks, the clear longterm positive health benefits leads to a recommendation for coverage. The strength of the recommendation is based on the fact that there is a strong benefit on critical outcomes (particularly in diabetics), and patients desiring surgery would strongly prefer this intervention. For those without diabetes, and other comorbidities are present, the evidence is less clear, leading to a weak recommendation. Recommendation: Coverage of metabolic and bariatric surgery (including RouxenY gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy) is recommended for: Adult obese patients (BMI 35 and <40) with: o Type 2 diabetes (strong recommendation) OR o at least two of the following other serious obesityrelated comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea (weak recommendation) Adult obese patients (BMI 40) (strong recommendation) Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation). Metabolic and bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in: Patients with BMI <35, or 3540 without the defined comorbid conditions above (weak recommendation) Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B. A GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix C. 5 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in children and adolescents? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Allcause mortality (Critical outcome ) Insufficient evidence in this population High cost (tens of thousands of dollars) but may be cost effective especially given the long time horizon if weight loss is maintained. However, uncertainty about the longterm balance of benefits and harms could significantly alter estimates of cost effectiveness. High variability. If conservative treatments have failed, children, adolescents and their parents would be highly motivated to find an effective alternative intervention. Children may have a significant fear of surgery, but the profound social and emotional impact of obesity may override their concerns. Parents are likely to be more concerned about the long term health impacts of obesity than children, and may be concerned about the uncertainty about the long term benefits. Parental involvement in weight management plans is likely necessary to assist the effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet. Insufficient evidence Major adverse cardiovascular events (Critical outcome ) Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Type 2 DM remission/resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of T2DM ranged from 50 to 100% (very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects ) Hypertension remission/ resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of hypertension ranged from 50 to 100% (very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects) 6 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Coverage question: Should bariatric surgery be recommended for coverage in children and adolescents? Change in BMI (Important outcome ) Mean weighted difference in BMI at 1 year (from baseline): 10.5 to 17.2 kg/m2 (low certainty based on mostly small observational trials) Rationale: Bariatric surgery likely results in significant reductions in BMI (low certainty) and is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (very low certainty). However, coverage is not recommended because of the limited evidence about overall longterm benefits and harms of bariatric surgery in this population as well as the high variability in values and preferences. Recommendation: Bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in children and adolescents (weak recommendation). Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B. A GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix C. Coverage question: Should reoperative bariatric surgery for inadequate weight loss be recommended for coverage?

Others would be motivated to try a different procedure in hopes that it would work better. Patients seeking reoperation have likely no other good potential option given failure of multiple previous alternatives (e.g. clinical, pharmacological, nutritional, physical activity, and surgical). would be substantially different that those undergoing their first operation. A significant proportion of these patients would be going from a band to a RYGB (from a procedure with a higher failure rate to a lower failure rate). Insufficient evidence Hypertension remission/ resolution Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Change in BMI Mean change in BMI (from baseline): +2.4 kg/m2 to 17.2 kg/m2 (followup ranging from 8 to 48 months) (very low certainty based on small case series) Rationale: Reoperation is associated with higher complication rates but also effective weight loss (based on very low quality evidence). While there are not long term health outcomes available, there is no reason to believe that significant weight loss in the reoperation group would be associated with less future health benefits. Therefore, the subcommittee makes no recommendation that the coverage criteria should be different between reoperation and primary surgery. Surgeons will also evaluate their patients and consider reasons for failure when deciding if the patient is a good candidate for reoperation. Recommendation: No recommendation that coverage criteria for reoperation should be different than for primary surgery. Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B GRADE evidence profile is provided in Appendix C. 8 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Obesity, generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 in adults or above the 95th percentile of age and sexspecific BMI growth charts in children and adolescents, is common. Information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 2014 provides estimates of obesity prevalence of 35% of adults, 17% of 2 to 19 year olds, and 8.1% of infants and toddlers (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2014). Obesity is a risk factor for several medical conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), stroke, cancer, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis and others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death and will likely overtake tobacco use as the leading cause of preventable death within the next decade. Older estimates from 2009 found that medical spending attributable to obesity is between $147 billion and $210 billion annually with at least $60 billion of those costs accruing to Medicare and Medicaid programs (Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, 2009). Data from the Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system in 2009 found that the overall prevalence of adult obesity in Oregon is 24%, though the prevalence of obesity in adults covered by the Oregon Health Plan is greater at 38%. The Oregon Healthy Teens Survey in 2009 estimated that approximately 11% of 8th graders were obese. The Oregon Department of Public Health estimated that costs of obesity related medical care in the Medicaid program alone exceeded $333 million in 2006 (State of Oregon, Department of Human Services, 2012). There are a number of commonly used medical treatments for obesity including structured programs to promote improved nutrition and physical activity, intensive behavioral counseling for individuals or families, and medications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmaceutical treatments for obesity other medications and herbal supplements are also promoted for weight loss. The FDA also recently approved a weight loss device called the Maestro\u00ae Rechargable System that works by blocking signals along the vagal nerve. Bariatric surgical procedures (sometimes also referred to as metabolic surgery) are another treatment option for obesity. Indications Bariatric surgery (alone or in conjunction with nonsurgical treatments) is indicated for the treatment of obesity. Guidelines regarding indications for bariatric surgery vary based on BMI thresholds and the presence of obesityrelated comorbid conditions. Technology description Bariatric procedures commonly performed in the United States include adjustable gastric banding (AGB), vertical sleeve gastrectomy Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials duodenal switch (BPD/DS). An excellent overview of the anatomic details of these procedures is available in the executive summary of the Washington Health Technology Assessment (WA HTA) report published in April 2015 (WA HTA, 2015). The use of bariatric surgical procedures is growing, and approximately 179,000 procedures were performed in 2013 in the United States (U.S.). The distribution of procedure types in the U.S. has shifted with greater use of vertical sleeve gastrectomy and declining use of gastric banding. The estimated number and distribution of surgical procedures in the U.S. is summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Estimated number and distribution of bariatric surgical procedures in the United States between 2011 and 2013. 2011 2012 2013 Total 158,000 Adjustable gastric banding and VSG are procedures that either functionally or anatomically reduce the size of the stomach. Adjustable gastric banding, alone among the bariatric surgical procedures, is completely reversible. RouxenY gastric bypass and BPD/DS are more complicated procedures that reduce the size of the stomach and connect more distal portions of the small intestine to the gastric remnant thus bypassing varying lengths of small intestine and reducing the absorption of nutrients. For this reason, these surgeries are sometimes referred to as malabsorptive procedures, with the degree of malabsorption correlating to the length of small intestine that is bypassed. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy is sometimes performed as part of a two stage procedure for patients with extremely high BMIs (the second stage of the procedure is usually a malabsorptive procedure that is more technically feasible after the initial weight loss achieved by VSG). These procedures can be performed laparoscopically and with robotic assistance. Adjustable gastric banding is sometimes performed on an outpatient basis, but the other procedures generally require a hospital stay that varies from one to seven days after surgery depending on the procedure and patient specific characteristics. Recovery times vary from one to four weeks. All procedures require frequent followup, but AGB may require a greater number of followup visits to make adjustments to the band (done through a port located underneath the skin of the abdomen). 10 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials All of the bariatric surgical procedures entail operative and postoperative risks, though these vary by the type of procedure. Data regarding perioperative mortality, complications, need for reoperation, and serious adverse events reported in four systematic reviews are summarized in Table 2. It should be noted that definitions of complications and adverse events varied widely across studies. Operative risks include bleeding, infection, and damage to various abdominal organs. Nausea and vomiting are common after all these procedures and the malabsorptive surgeries sometimes cause persistent diarrhea. The malabsorptive procedures are associated with an increased risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and certain types of kidney stones may become more common. Gastrointestinal bleeding from ulcers occurring at the surgical anastamoses also occurs. Infections of the subcutaneous port and erosion of the gastric band into the stomach are risks unique to AGB. The overall median complication rates reported in the Washington HTA report range from 8.8% for VSG to 26.9% for BPD (WA HTA, 2015). Table 2. Mortality, complications, reoperations, and serious adverse events reported in four systematic reviews.

For additional details about the review scope and methods please see Appendix A. 1. Should coverage be recommended for bariatric surgery in each of the scenarios in the table below? (Note that the \"resolution of diabetes\" would not be an applicable outcome in scenarios 49) BMI 30 - 34.9 BMI 35 - 39.9 BMI 40 With DM2 Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 W/o DM2 nor other comorbidities Scenario 4* Scenario 5* Scenario 6* DM2 Scenario 7* Scenario 8* Scenario 9* *Resolution of type 2 diabetes isn't a relevant outcome for this population 2. What is the appropriate minimum age for bariatric surgery? 3. What components and systems of care are associated with improved health outcomes (e.g., centers of excellence, surgeon's experience, etc.)? 4. What preoperative assessments or requirements for preoperative weight loss should be recommended in patients being considered for bariatric surgery? Critical outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were allcause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. Important outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table were weight loss (change in BMI), and remission or resolution of T2DM or hypertension. Evidence review General Limitations The literature on bariatric surgery is voluminous. The search conducted by Center staff yielded more than 20 systematic reviews published in the last two years (see Appendix A for a detailed methods description). These reviews span more than 600 individual studies. It should be noted that there is little consistency in the inclusion of individual studies across reviews and that many of the systematic reviews did not perform metaanalysis, in part due to high levels of heterogeneity. Furthermore, there are important concerns about the quality of much of the published research on bariatric surgery. As the Washington HTA report summarized: While the comparative evidence base for either headtohead comparisons of bariatric procedures or comparisons of bariatric surgery to nonsurgical interventions has grown considerably over time, major challenges with the quality and applicability of available studies remains. Of the 179 comparative studies identified for this evaluation, we rated only 26 (15%) to be of good quality, 12 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials based on comparable groups at baseline, comparable duration of followup, and limited sample attrition. An additional 74 studies (41%) were rated fair quality; issues with comparability, duration of followup, and/or attrition were identified in these studies, but attempts were made to control for confounding in the analytic methods (e.g., survival analysis techniques, multivariate regression). However, we considered another 79 studies (44%) to be of poor quality because at least one key quality issue was present and not adequately addressed in either study design or analysis. (WA HTA, 2015, p ES6). Additionally, there are at least nine ongoing trials of bariatric surgery that are expected to publish results over the next four years. Systematic Reviews Addressing Effectiveness in Adults Eight good quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in adults (Chang et al., Puzziferri et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; WA HTA, 2015). These studies are summarized in Table 3 and discussed below by systematic review. Table 3.

(2014) is a good quality systematic review and metaanalysis of 164 contemporary studies (37 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 127 observational studies) of bariatric surgery published between 2003 and 2012. The included studies spanned over 161,000 patients with an average age of 45 years and an average presurgical BMI of 45 kg/m2. Twenty six percent of the included patients had T2DM and 47% had hypertension. More than two years of followup was available for 133,000 of the included patients. Results of RCTs and observational studies were reported separately in the meta analysis. The review and metaanalysis focused on surgical mortality and complications, change in BMI, and resolution of obesityrelated comorbid conditions. The overall rate of mortality within 30 days of surgery was 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01% 0.22% (95% CI 0.14% to 0.31%) in the observational studies. The overall complication rate was 17% (95% CI 11% to 23%) in the RCTs and 9.8% (95% CI 7.4 to 13.0) in the observational studies. 14 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials The overall mean change in BMI at 1 year was 13.53 kg/m2 in the RCTs and 11.79 kg/m2 in the observational studies. For those studies reporting outcomes at five years of followup, the overall mean change in BMI was 11.40 kg/m2 in the RCTs and 14.32 kg/m2 in the observational studies. In the RCTs, the T2DM remission rates in the surgical groups was 92% (95% CI 84.68 to 97.18) compared with a rate of 17.4% (95% CI 0.98 to 69.27) in the control groups. The observational studies found a T2DM remission rate of 86.5%. In the RCTs, the hypertension remission rate was 75% (95% CI 61.52 to 86.35) in the surgical groups compared with a rate of 49% (95% CI 0 to 99%). These comparisons are both indirect and imprecise because so few of the included studies compared surgical and nonsurgical groups directly. Additionally, duration of followup for the studies examining comorbid conditions was unclear. Colquitt (2014) Colquitt et al. (2014) is a good quality systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration that includes 22 RCTs, of which 7 studies, comprising approximately 600 patients, compared bariatric surgery to non surgical controls. Because of differences in the characteristics of participants, interventions, and comparators, metaanalysis was considered inappropriate, and the results were reported narratively. In terms of BMI, the included studies reported mean changes of 7.4 kg/m2 to 33.3 kg/m2 with surgery compared to 0.5 kg/m2 to 4.7 kg/m2 in nonsurgical controls. The authors conclude that \"the direction of the effect was consistently in favour of surgery\" based on moderate quality of evidence. In terms of remission of T2DM, the included studies reported rates of remission ranging from 42% to 90% at 12 to 24 months in surgical groups (73% to 90% if one study with a more stringent definition of A1c < 6 is excluded) compared to remission rates of 0% to 32% in nonsurgical controls. The authors conclude that \"more people experienced remission following surgery\" based on moderate quality of evidence. Three studies included in the Cochrane review also reported on hypertension outcomes. Two studies reported rates of reduction or discontinuation of antihypertensive medications ranging from 49% to 80% between 12 and 24 months in the surgical groups compared to 0% to 70% in nonsurgical controls. One additional study reported that the proportion of patients with systolic blood pressure less than130 mmHg at 12 months was 84% in the surgical group and 79% in nonsurgical controls. The authors did not draw any conclusions based on these data. Hayes (2014) Hayes (2014) is a good quality systematic review and health technology assessment based on 18 controlled or comparative studies of RYGB in adults with T2DM published between2007 and 2014. Seven of the included studies (5 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized controlled trials) compared RYGB with non surgical treatments while the remaining 11 compared RYGB with other bariatric surgical procedures. The average followup across the included studies was 12 months to 5 years. In patients undergoing RYGB, BMI was reduced by 20 to 33% compared to baseline and T2DM remission was reported in 38 to 90% of patients. In the nonsurgical treatment groups, BMI change ranged from 10% to 1%, and T2DM remission rates ranged from 0 to 33%. Based on this, Hayes concluded that RYGB 15 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials is superior to intensive lifestyle or medical interventions for the treatment of T2DM. The authors further conclude that RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy are equally effective in the treatment of T2DM. Finally, the authors note that preliminary evidence (from a single study) suggests the RYGB may be equally effective for treatment of T2DM in patients with BMI<35 kg/m2 and BMI>35 kg/m2, but that additional studies are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of RYGB in patients with lower BMIs. Kwok (2014) Kwok et al. (2014) is a good quality systematic review and metaanalysis of 14 comparative cohort studies reporting mortality and cardiovascular outcomes amongst 29,208 bariatric surgery patients and 166,200 nonsurgical controls. The followup period of the included studies ranged from 2 years to 14.7 years. The surgical procedures in the studies included AGB, RYGB, SG, banded gastroplasty, as well as other unspecified bariatric surgical procedures. Most of the included studies reported enrolling patients with BMI >35 kg/m2. Of the 14 included studies, 10 were deemed to be at low to moderate risk of bias, while four studies were deemed to be at moderate high risk of bias due to concerns over loss to follow up and inadequate adjustment for confounding. See Appendix D for a detailed description of the included studies. In the 14 studies included in the metaanalysis of allcause mortality, the crude event rate was 1059/29,208 (3.6%) in the surgical group and 18,962/166,200 (11.4%) in the nonsurgical control group. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality in the surgical group compared with the nonsurgical group was 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64). Considering only the 10 studies that reported adjusted estimates, the association was consistent but more conservative with an odds ratio for mortality of 0.60 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.74) favoring the surgical group over the nonsurgical controls. In the four studies included in the metaanalysis of composite cardiovascular adverse events, the crude event rate was 407/17,262 (2.4%) in the surgical group and 1108/27,726 (4.0%) in the nonsurgical control group. The odds ratio for composite cardiovascular adverse events in the surgical group compared with the nonsurgical group was 0.54 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70). The pooled estimates for the odds ratio of myocardial infarction and stroke for surgical patient compared to nonsurgical controls were 0.46 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.69) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.75) respectively. Overall, the authors conclude that longterm followup data from comparative cohort studies suggest that bariatric surgery is associated with lower rates of mortality (3.6% vs 11.4% for nonsurgical controls, number needed to treat [NNT] = 13) and composite adverse cardiovascular events (2.4% vs 4.0% for nonsurgical controls, NNT = 62). MullerStich (2014) MullerStich et al. (2014) is a good quality systematic review and metaanalysis of studies comparing surgical and medical treatment of T2DM in nonseverely obese patients. The systematic review included seven RCTs and six comparative observational studies comprising 818 diabetic patients. All of the studies included patients with BMI <35 kg/m2 and eight of the studies were performed exclusively in patients with BMI <35 kg/m2; among the remaining seven studies the highest average BMI was 37.1 kg/m2. The surgical procedures performed in the included studies were AGB, BPD, RYGB, and SG. The followup periods ranged from 12 to 36 months. 16 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials In the metaanalysis of studies reporting remission of T2DM, 129 of 280 patients achieved remission in the surgical group compared with 6 of 252 patients in the medical treatment group. The combined odds ratio for T2DM resolution after surgery compared with medical treatment was 14.11 (95% CI 6.67 to 29.86). In the metaanalysis of studies reporting change in BMI, the absolute mean difference in BMI was 5.5 kg/m2 (95% CI 6.7 to 4.3) favoring the surgical group. In the metaanalysis of studies reporting presence of arterial hypertension at the end of the study, the 76 of 274 patients in the surgical group and 101/189 patients in the medical treatment group had arterial hypertension. The combined odds ratio for arterial hypertension after surgery compared with medical treatment was 0.25 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.50). The authors performed a network metaanalysis to compare the treatment effects of the different surgical procedures. Although point estimates of the odds ratio for T2DM remission compared to medical treatment ranged from 12.23 for AGB to 55.05 for RYGB, the 95% confidence intervals overlapped for all four included procedures, and all were superior to medical treatment. Overall, the authors conclude that among nonseverely obese patients with T2DM bariatric surgery results in greater shortterm improvements in diabetes remission, weight loss, and arterial hypertension when compared with medical treatment. Puzziferri (2014) Puzziferri et al. (2014) is a good quality systematic review and metaanalysis of 29 studies with longterm followup and low rates of attrition. Specifically, only studies of gastric bypass, gastric band, or sleeve gastrectomy performed in patients with a BMI of >35 and that reported outcomes with a minimum of two years of followup and at least 80% of the original study participants were included in the review. Only 29 studies (of nearly 8,000 citations reviewed) met the inclusion criteria. Among the included studies were 10 RCTs, one matched cohort, six prospective cohorts, one retrospective cohort, and 11 case series. Weight loss outcomes in this review were reported as percentage of mean excess weight loss (EWL). The sample size weighted mean EWL was 65.7% after gastric bypass, 64.5% after sleeve gastrectomy, and 45% after gastric banding. Six of the included studies reported on remission of T2DM (defined as glycated hemoglobin <6.5% without medications). Sample size weighted T2DM remission rates were 66.7% after gastric bypass and 28.6% after gastric banding. Three of the included studies reported on remission of hypertension (defined as blood pressure <140/90 without medications). The reported hypertension remission rate was 38.2% after gastric bypass and 17.4% after gastric banding. Wang (2015) Wang et al. (2015) is a good quality, though narrowly focused, systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic RYGB with sleeve gastrectomy in overweight or obese adults with T2DM. Three RCTs judged to be at low risk of bias and one RCT with an unclear risk of 17 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials bias were included. The average baseline BMI in the studies ranged from 30 to 46 kg/m2. Laparoscopic RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy resulted in similar improvements in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, need for any diabetic medication, and BMI. Improvements in HDL and LDL cholesterol were statistically significantly greater in the RYGB group. The absolute or relative improvements in these outcomes compared to baseline were not included. Overall, the authors conclude that RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy offer equivalent results in terms of weight loss and T2DM remission, but that RYGB affords greater improvements in lipid parameters and may thus significantly decrease cardiovascular risk. Washington Health Technology Assessment Report (2015) The WA HTA report (2015) is a good quality systematic review and health technology assessment summarizing results from 179 comparative studies (35 RCTs, 59 prospective cohorts, 85 retrospective cohorts). Notably, one large cohort study with longterm followup, the Swedish Obese Subjects study, was not included as a primary source for the Washington HTA report because most of the patients in that study received a surgical procedure (gastroplasty) that is no longer widely performed. Only 15% of the included studies were judged to be of high quality, with an additional 41% deemed fair quality. When performing metaanalysis, the authors included only good or fair quality RCTs. Overall or causespecific mortality was not directly addressed in the WA HTA report because none of the included comparative studies reported those outcomes. However, the WA HTA report does note that evidence from at least one recent comparative cohort study found significantly lower allcause mortality at 1 to 14 years of followup in surgical subjects (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56) (Arterburn, 2015). The comparison of bariatric surgery to nonsurgical management included 21 good or fairquality studies (14 RCTs, 7 comparative cohorts). These studies reported on RYGB (13 studies), AGB (6 studies), VSG (4 studies) and BPD/DS (3 studies). The nonsurgical comparators included diet and lifestyle interventions and/or medical interventions (some variably defined as \"intensive\"). Metaanalytic results were available for weight loss and resolution of T2DM. The pooled mean difference in BMI was 7.4 (95% CI 6.2 to 8.6) favoring surgery, based on 10 studies. Resolution of T2DM had a log odds ratio of 3.62 (95% CI 2.49 to 4.73) favoring surgery, based on nine studies. Metaanalysis of studies reporting resolution of HTN was not done, but the report noted that \"[o]ther individual comorbidities commonly evaluated in these comparative studies included hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In studies evaluating resolution of these conditions and/or discontinuation of relevant medications as a binary variable, bariatric surgery was associated with two to threefold reductions in the prevalence of these comorbidities [hypertension and hyperlipidemia] at the end of followup, while nonsurgical management resulted in no appreciable change from baseline...\" (WA HTA, 2015, p. 34). The WA HTA report is the only systematic review staff identified that summarizes key clinical outcomes stratified by procedure and mean preoperative BMI. Those tables are included in Appendix G. Nine good or fairquality RCTs and prospective cohorts comparing bariatric surgery and nonsurgical management enrolled patients with BMI<35. Seven of those studies included presence of T2DM or metabolic syndrome as an entry criterion, while two did not report comorbid condition based entry criteria. The authors conclude that for those with a mean preoperative BMI of 30 to 35.9 \"patterns of 18 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials weight loss across procedures were similar to those in studies of patients at higher BMI\" (WA HTA, 2015, p. ES41). Furthermore, among studies of patients at lower BMI levels that reported on remission of T2DM at 12 to 24 months the results favored surgery (remission rates of 26% to 73%) over nonsurgical treatment (remission rates of 0% to 16%). Systematic Reviews Addressing Effectiveness in Children and Adolescents Three fair or good quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents (Aikenhead, Knai, & Lobstein, 2011; Black, White, Viner, & Simmons, 2013; Treadwell, Sun, & Schoelles, 2011). These studies are summarized in Table 4 and discussed below by systematic review. Table 4. Summary of Systematic Reviews - Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for Children and Adolescents Systematic Review (Quality) Total N No. and Type of Included Studies Population Outcomes of Interest Aikenhead, 2011 (Fair) N = 831 1 RCT 8 cohort studies 14 observational studies 12 case series 19 years old BMI Black, 2013 (Fair) N = 637 1 RCT 22 observational studies Presurgical BMI (mean): 46 - 52 Age: 5 - 23 years BMI Treadwell, 2008 (Treadwell) N = 644 18 Observational studies Presurgical BMI (mean): 46 - 52 Age: 9 - Abbreviations: BMI - body index; RCT - randomized controlled trial Aikenhead (2011) Aikenhead et al. (2011) is a fair quality narrative systematic review of 37 studies of effectiveness of bariatric surgery spanning 831 patients age 19 years old or younger. The authors note several general limitations of the pediatric bariatric surgery literature including predominately observational study designs, small sample sizes (the largest of the included trials had 68 patients), and sparse information on low frequency outcomes. Thirteen of the included studies (all but one observational) assessed gastric banding. Twelve of these studies reported mean BMI reductions of 8.5 kg/m2 to 43 kg/m2, while one study (a case report of gastric banding and truncal vagotomy in an adolescent with a rare mutation in a gene implicated in 19 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials regulation of appetite and energy balance) found an increase in BMI of 2.2 kg/m2. Rates of resolution of comorbid conditions ranged from 11 to 100%. Eight of the included studies (all observational) assessed RYGB. The studies reported mean reductions in BMI of 9 kg/m2 to 25 kg/m2. The authors note that four of the studies reported on comorbid conditions and three of those four studies found 100% rates of resolution for dyslipidemia, degenerative joint disease, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Fourteen of the included studies (all observational) reported on other bariatric procedures (sleeve gastrectomy, BPD/DS, vertical banded gastroplasty). These studies reported mean BMI reductions of 9 kg/m2 to 24 kg/m2. The authors note that changes in comorbid conditions were reported in 12 of the 14 studies, but additional details are not included. The authors' overall conclusion is that \"[i]n the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary prevention or behavioural treatment of obesity, surgical treatment may be advocated as a preferred and costeffective solution for certain children and adolescents\" (Aikenhead, 2011, p. 18) Black (2013) Black et al. (2013) is a fair quality systematic review and metaanalysis of bariatric surgery for obese children and adolescents. Twentythree studies (22 observational and 1 RCT) comprising 637 patients undergoing RYGB, AGB, or SG were included. The mean presurgical BMI was 52.4 kg/m2 in the RYGB studies, 49.6 kg/m2 in the SG studies, and 46.1 kg/m2 in the AGB studies. The ages of patients in the included studies ranged from 5 to 23 years old. Overall, the average weighted BMI difference from baseline to one year postoperatively was 13.5 kg/m2 (95% CI 15.1 to 11.9). The greatest BMI reductions were observed in patients undergoing RYGB (average weighted difference of 17.2 kg/m2) and the smallest BMI reductions were observed in the AGB group (average weighted difference of 10.5 kg/m2). The authors note that they were unable to provide summary estimates of the effects on comorbidity resolution because the data were of poor quality and adequate definitions of resolution were not provided. The rates of reported resolution of T2DM from baseline to followup ranged from 0 to 100% in the eight studies that reported this outcome. However, excluding one study with only a single T2DM patient who did not experience resolution, the rate of resolution for T2DM would range from 50 to 100%. The rates of reported resolution of hypertension from baseline to followup ranged from 50 to 100% in the 10 studies that reported this outcome. Treadwell (2008) Treadwell et al. (2008) is a good quality systematic review and metaanalysis of bariatric surgery for pediatric obesity. This review included 18 studies of children ages 9 to 21 years (mean age 16.7 years) with mean BMI ranging from 45.8 kg/m2 to 51.8 kg/m2. In 14 of the 18 studies, patients must have failed a trial of nonsurgical weight loss before undergoing bariatric surgery. Only one of the included studies reported a nonsurgical control group and significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups were noted including baseline BMI and comorbidities. Thus, the authors note that, in effect, the included studies were all case series. 20 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Metaanalysis of change in BMI in six studies of AGB found a 95% CI of 13.7 kg/m2 to 10.6 kg/m2 at mean length of followup of one to three years. Two of the studies of AGB reported T2DM remission rates of 80 to 100% and three of the studies reported hypertension remission rates of 50 to 100%. Metaanalysis of change in BMI in six studies of RYGB found a 95% CI of 17.8 kg/m2 to 22.3 kg/m2 at mean length of followup of one to six years. Only one of the studies of RYGB reported remission of T2DM. Three studies of RYGB reported rates of hypertension remission of 50 to 100%. Because of the small number of studies and patients undergoing other procedures, summary information on weight changes or comorbidity resolution was not presented. Overall, the authors conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence that AGB achieves weight loss at one year or longer and weak evidence of resolution of T2DM and hypertension. For RYGB, the authors conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence of weight loss at one year or longer, weak evidence of resolution of hypertension, and insufficient evidence of resolution of T2DM. There was insufficient evidence for any outcomes from other bariatric procedures. Systematic Reviews Addressing Bariatric Reoperation Procedures As the use of primary bariatric surgical procedures has increased, so too has the rate of bariatric reoperation. The term \"bariatric reoperation\" captures several types of procedures (conversion, correction, revision, or reversal) that are performed for various indications. Inadequate weight loss (commonly, but not uniformly, defined as <50% EWL) is the most common indication for revision or conversion procedures. Reoperation is also performed to address both acute complications (including anastomotic leaks, bleeding, strictures, obstruction, and perforation) and chronic complications (including protein calorie malnutrition, severe GERD, band erosion, late or recurrent leaks, late strictures, and band intolerance.) Reversal procedures are rare, but are sometimes performed to address intractable nausea and vomiting, excessive or uncontrolled weight loss, severe malnutrition, recurrent anastomotic ulcers, severe hypoglycemia, and recalcitrant hypocalcaemia. In general, bariatric reoperation is thought to be more technically challenging than primary bariatric surgery, at least in part because of the likelihood of surgical adhesions from the primary procedure. Nevertheless, many reoperative bariatric procedures can still be performed laparoscopically, though the complication rates may be higher when compared with primary bariatric procedures. Five fair quality and one low quality systematic reviews address the effectiveness of bariatric reoperative procedures (Brethauer et al., Small, 2015; Schouten, Japink, Meesters, Nelemans, & Greve, 2011). These systematic reviews of bariatric reoperation provide very low certainty evidence that revisional or conversion procedures performed after an initial bariatric surgery may achieve additional weight loss (particularly those procedures that convert AGB to RYGB or BPD/DS), but at the expense of a higher rate of complications. The systematic reviews offer no evidence that bariatric reoperation improved co morbidity resolution. Most of the studies included in the systematic reviews were not methodologically 21 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials rigorous and there are concerns about publication bias in this literature. Furthermore, the indications for bariatric reoperation varied across and within individual studies. Brethauer (2014) Brethauer et al. (2014) is a systematic review on indications for and outcomes of reoperative bariatric surgery that was conducted by the ASMBS Bariatric Surgery Revision Taskforce. The review was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Covidien, a company that manufactures equipment used in bariatric surgical procedures. While the review states that 175 articles were included in the systematic review, the majority of these were single center retrospective case series and the evidence tables in the review provide details on only 35 \"selected studies.\" Thus, the degree to which the narrative review and recommendations reflect an unbiased inclusion of studies identified in the systematic review is uncertain. Furthermore, the reporting of quantitative outcomes across indications and reoperative procedures was erratic. The conclusions of the authors, summarized here with the above caveats, are 1) reoperation for inadequate or failed weight loss generally improves weight loss, and 2) complication rates are generally higher with reoperative procedures. Cheung (2014) Cheung et al. (2014) is a systematic review of studies of revisional bariatric surgery following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The review includes 11 studies spanning a total of 218 patients. In most of the studies patients underwent revisional procedures because of insufficient weight loss or weight regain, although the former indication was variably defined. Intractable gastroesophageal reflux disease was an additional indication in 5 of the studies. The revisional procedures included laparoscopic butterfly gastroplasty, laparoscopic omega loop mini bypass, laparoscopic gastrectomy, laparoscopic duodenal switch, and laparoscopic or open RYGB. Nine of the studies were cases series and two studies were casecontrols. The largest single study enrolled 40 patients. The primary outcomes were change in BMI at various time points. At 24 months or greater, revisional procedures were associated with reductions in BMI. Revision of LSG to gastric bypass resulted in an average change in BMI of 6.2 kg/m2. Revision of LSG to resleeve gastric bypass resulted in an average change in BMI of 3.2 kg/m2. Revision of LSG to other surgical interventions (all other conversion procedures) resulted in an average change in BMI of 17.2 kg/m2. In the three studies that examined the effects of revisional procedures on GERD complications, there was a 100% complete resolution rate, though it should be noted that the sample size for this outcome was very small (n=15). The authors note that their review was limited by the small number of studies and patients, the very low methodological rigor of the study designs, and the absence of postoperative complication rates after revision. Coblijn (2013) Coblijn et al. (2013) is a systematic review of studies of revisional bariatric surgery (LSG or LRYGB) after an initial adjustable gastric banding procedure. The review includes 15 studies of LRYGB spanning 588 patients and 8 studies of LSG spanning 286 patients. Not all studies reported the indication for revisional surgery, but in those that did the most common indication was insufficient weight loss or weight regain (approximately 65% of patients). Most of the studies were consecutive case series and there were no randomized controlled trials. The primary outcomes of interest were perioperative morbidity and mortality. In the LRYGB studies that reported this outcome there were no perioperative deaths and the 22 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials overall perioperative complication rate was 8.5%. In the LSG studies that reported this outcome, there were 3 perioperative deaths and the overall perioperative complication rate was 12.2%. The rate of reoperation after the revisional procedures was 6.5% for LRYGB and 3.5% for LSG. Though weight loss was not of primary interest for this review, the authors did note that 11 of the 15 LRYGB studies reported mean EWL of 23% to 74%, though the followup time was not clear. Weight loss achieved with revisional LSG appeared to be nearly comparable. The authors note several limitations to their review including the very low methodological rigor of the study designs and the possibility of publication bias, particularly for studies reporting on morbidity and mortality. Elnahas (2013) Elnahas et al. (2013) is a systematic review of conversion bariatric procedures after failed adjustable gastric banding. The review includes 24 studies reporting outcomes of conversion to LSG (n=106 patients), LRYGB (n=514 patients), and laparoscopic BPD/DS (n=71 patients). Patients in these studies underwent the conversion procedure due to inadequate weight loss or surgical complications with AGB. All of the included studies were retrospective case series. The primary outcome of interest was weight loss measured by change in BMI or percentage EWL. The mean change in BMI at 24 to 48 months after reoperation was 2.8 kg/m2 for LSG, 8.5 kg/m2 for LRYGB, and 13.3 kg/m2 for BPD/DS. The weighted mean complication rates for conversion to LSG, LRYGB, and BPD/DS were 4.1%, 10.7%, and 24.4% respectively. The authors note several limitations to their study including the very low methodological rigor of the study designs and significant heterogeneity across studies. Mahawar (2015) Mahawar et al. (2015) is a systematic review of studies that compare the outcomes of revisional bariatric procedures to the outcomes of the same primary procedures. The review includes 14 studies comparing revisional and primary RYGB and 7 studies comparing revisional and primary SG. The designs of the primary studies were not made explicit, but all appeared to be casecontrol or retrospective cohort studies. Quantitative cumulative outcomes reported in the studies comparing revisional with primary RYGB included mortality (1.3% revisional leaks (5.8% revisional vs 1.0% primary). Quantitative cumulative outcomes reported in the studies comparing revisional SG with primary SG included mortality (0% revisional vs leaks (1.9% revisional vs 1.5% primary). Weight loss outcomes were not cumulatively analyzed because of heterogeneity in the studies, but the authors do note that most of the studies that reported on weight loss outcomes found that the weight loss achieved with revisional procedures was either inferior to (10/14 studies of RYGB, 2/5 studies of SG) or not significantly different from the weight loss achieved with primary procedures (4/14 studies of RYGB, 3/5 studies of SG). The authors do not comment on limitations of their review other than noting the absence of any level I evidence on revisional bariatric surgery. 23 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Schouten (2011) Schouten et al. (2011) is a systematic review of studies examining reoperation following gastric banding procedures. The review included 11 studies of rebanding, 12 studies of conversion to LRYGB, 5 studies of conversion to laparoscopic BPD/DS, and 5 studies of conversion to LSG. Among the 11 studies that examined rebanding, the most common indications were slippage, erosion, or pouch dilation. Ten of the 11 studies presented level III or level IV evidence, while one presented level II evidence. The followup period varied from 8 to 48 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 0% to 11%, the late complication rate ranged from 0% to 41%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 45%. Change in BMI was reported in 6 studies and ranged from +2.4 kg/m2 to 5.8 kg/m2. Among the 12 studies of conversion to LRYGB, the most common indications were insufficient weight loss, band, erosion, and pouch dilation. Ten of the 12 studies presented level III or level IV evidence, while the remaining 2 presented level II evidence. The followup period ranged from 8.3 to 36 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 3% to 36%, the late complication rate ranged from 2% to 23%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 20%. Change in BMI was reported in 9 studies and ranged from 6.1 kg/m2 to 13.2 kg/m2. Percentage EWL was reported in 2 studies and ranged from 33% to 43%. Among the 5 studies of conversion to BPD/DS, the most common indication was insufficient weight loss. All 5 studies presented level III or level IV evidence. The followup period ranged from 12 to 38 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 8% to 62%, the late complication rate ranged from 20.6% to >23.5%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 20.6%. Percentage of EWL was reported in 3 studies and ranged from 44% to 70%. Among the 5 studies of conversion to LSG, the most common indication was insufficient weight loss. Four studies presented level IV evidence while 1 study presented level II evidence. The followup period ranged from 12 to 24 months after reoperation. The early complication rate ranged from 0% to 13.8%, the late complication rate ranged from 0% to 10.3%, and the reoperation rate ranged from 0% to 10.3%. Percentage of EWL was reported in 2 studies and ranged from 20% to 65.7% while change in BMI was reported in 1 study as 4.4 kg/m2. The authors conclude that adjustable gastric banding should remain a first line procedure with re banding or conversion to RYGB or BPD/DS as options for managing band failure. Systematic Reviews Addressing Patient Selection One poor quality and two good quality systematic reviews address patient selection criteria (Ochner, Dambkowski, HTA, 2015). Ochner (2012) Ochner et al. (2012) is a good quality narrative systematic review of 29 studies examining the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on postoperative outcomes. The authors note that heterogeneity in the included studies precluded formal quantitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were 24 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials mostly observations and were mixed on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on postoperative weight loss outcomes. As the authors note, \"studies of the relation between pre and postoperative changes in body weight range from a positive relationship (preoperative weight loss associated with greater postoperative weight loss) to a negative relationship (preoperative weight loss associated with less postoperative weight loss) and many in between (no relationship)\" (Ochner et al., 2012, p. 1381). The only included RCT deemed \"viable\" by the authors randomized 100 patients undergoing RYGB to a group with a requirement of 10% preoperative weight loss or a group with no preoperative weigh loss requirement. At six months after surgery, patients in the preoperative weight loss group had lost 54% of excess body weight compared to 51% excess body weight loss in the in the group without a preoperative weight loss requirement, but because only 37% of the original sample was analyzed at six months there was insufficient power to detect an effect. The review also examined studies reporting on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements on other outcomes including resolution of comorbid conditions. One study of 90 RYGB patients found that preoperative weight loss of >5% of excess body weight was associated with shorter operative times (36 minutes on average) but no difference in complications or resolution of comorbid conditions. Another study demonstrated that patients with preoperative weight loss of >5% of excess body weight were less likely to have a postoperative length of stay of >4 days. The RCT referenced above found no difference in the complication rate or resolution of comorbid conditions at six months. A fourth study found no correlation between preoperative weight changes and remission of diabetes or hypertension. The authors' overall conclusion is that \"[g]iven the inconsistency and questionable validity of the extant research...on the question of the effect of preoperative weight loss on peri and postoperative outcomes, it is the opinion of these authors that insufficient evidence is currently available to justify a prebariatric surgery weight loss mandate\" (Ochner et al., 2012, p. 1386). Thomas (2012) Thomas & Agarwal (2012) is a poor quality systematic review of a preoperative risk stratification tool known as the obesity surgery mortality risk score (OSMRS). The OSMRS assigns one point each for age greater than 45 years, male gender, BMI > 50 kg/m2, hypertension, and known risk factors for pulmonary embolism. Scores of 0 to 1 are considered class A or lowest risk, scores of 2 to 3 reflect class B or intermediate risk, and scores of 4 to 5 are class C or high risk. This review included six studies reporting on 9,382 patients evaluating the validity of OSMRS to predict postoperative mortality risk. Overall, there were 83 death in the 9,382 patients (0.88%). There were 13 deaths among the 4,912 class A patients (0.26%), 55 deaths among the 4,124 class B patients (1.33%), and 14 deaths among the 346 class C patients (4.34%). The mortality difference between classes were statistically significant at p<0.05. The authors conclude that use of the OSMRS can stratify mortality risk in patients undergoing bariatric surgery (particularly RYGB which was the predominately studied procedure in the included studies). WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report included a single retrospective comparative cohort study that stratified outcomes by patient adherence to preoperative program recommendations. In the laparoscopic AGB group, patients who did not attend >75% of their preprocedure appointments had attenuated weight loss at 12 months 25 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 followup (23% EWL vs 32% EWL in patients with fewer missed appointment, p=0.01). There were no differences in RYGB performance related to preprocedure appointment adherence. A single study included in the WA HTA report concluded that patients with congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias had a significantly increased risk of postsurgical complications compared with the overall cohort (40% vs 13.4% for open RYGB, all pvalues <0.001). The same study reported that patients with peripheral vascular disease undergoing RYGB had significantly increased complication rates compared to those without peripheral vascular disease (32.0% vs 8.4%, p<0.001). The WA HTA report also notes that it did not find studies that stratified outcomes by smoking status or psychosocial health that met inclusion criteria. Systematic Reviews Addressing Systems of Care One good quality systematic review addresses the effect of systems of care on bariatric surgery outcomes (Zevin, Aggarwal, & Grantcharov, 2012). Zevin (2012) Zevin et al. (2012) is a good quality systematic review of volumeoutcome associations in bariatric surgery. The article reviews 24 observational studies comprising almost 460,000 patients. Metaanalysis was not performed due to a high level of heterogeneity that resulted, in part, from differences in duration of followup and riskadjustment. Thirteen studies addressed the relationship between annual surgeon case volume and patient outcomes. Across the five cohort studies that were included, there was consistent evidence of improved outcomes with increasing surgeon volume. The results of lower quality studies (primarily retrospective cohorts) were mixed, but six of the eight studies supported an association between surgeon volume and outcomes. Seventeen studies addressed the association between hospital volume and outcomes. While the two casecontrol studies that were included did not support an association between facility volume and outcomes, the preponderance of retrospective case series (14/15 studies) that were included found an association between facility volume and outcomes. The authors conclude that there is strong evidence to support the association between surgeon volume and patient outcomes, and that weaker evidence supports the association between hospital volume and outcomes. Overall, they conclude that the literature \"supports the BSCOE accreditation and the bariatric surgery fellowship training programs\" (Zevin et al., 2012, p. 70). WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report notes that preprocedure support groups have shown little benefit, but that there is some evidence that patients in postoperative support groups experience improvements in psychological comorbidities and achieve greater weight loss. The WA HTA report cites one RCT of 144 Hispanic American RYGB patients randomized to \"comprehensive nutrition and lifestyle support or brief, printed healthy lifestyle guidelines...\" At one year after surgery, patients in the comprehensive support group had greater reductions in BMI (6.48 kg/m2 vs 3.63 for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Systematic Reviews Addressing Costeffectiveness WA HTA (2015) The WA HTA report (2015) performed a costeffectiveness analysis based on a model constructed by the authors. This analysis assumed a public payer perspective. The basecase analysis compared RYGB with standard care over a 10 year time horizon; other basecase assumptions included a procedural cost of $24,277, 20% worsening in BMI after 12 months, mean BMI at baseline of 40 kg/m2, and a discounting rate of 3%. In the basecase analysis, the incremental costeffectiveness of RYGB compared to standard care was $37,423 per qualityadjusted life year (QALY) gained. In the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the incremental costeffectiveness estimates ranged from $5,444 per QALY to $84,971 per QALY. The estimates were most sensitive to changes in the time horizon, the cost of the bariatric surgical procedure, maintenance of weight loss after surgery, and baseline BMI. The WA HTA costeffectiveness estimates, stratified by procedure and baseline BMI, are included in Appendix H. There is very sparse evidence on the costeffectiveness of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents. The only included systematic review which addresses this question is Aikenhead et al. (2011). The conclusions of this review are limited by the small number of studies, use of economic models that are not directly applicable to the U.S., and inferences from costeffectiveness studies of bariatric surgery in adults. EVIDENCE SUMMARY Despite the existence of a large number of studies and systematic reviews, there remain substantial limitations to the evidence regarding bariatric surgery. Differences in patient characteristics, choice of surgical procedure, and individual components and intensity of nonsurgical management arms make it difficult to summarize effects across studies. Variable measures of weight loss and wide variation in definitions of remission or resolution of comorbid conditions pose additional problems. Many of the studies included in the reviews were noncomparative, and the comparative observational studies suffer from risk of bias related to patient selection and residual confounding. The data from RCTs is limited by questions regarding proper allocation concealment and the universal absence of blinding. Perhaps the greatest concern is the limited long term followup of patients from RCTs and incomplete outcomes data due to high rates of attrition in most studies. Overall, the following conclusions can be drawn based on review of the summary literature: 1. Bariatric surgery is associated with lower rates of allcause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on low certainty evidence from cohort studies with long term followup, with study populations consisting predominantly of patients with BMI 35). 2. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant reductions in BMI in adults, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on moderate certainty evidence from a mix of observational and randomized trials). The effects on weight loss appear to be greatest in patients with baseline BMI 40 based on the BMI stratification provided in the WA HTA report. 27 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials 3. Bariatric surgery is associated with remission or resolution of T2DM and hypertension in adults with BMI 35, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on moderate certainty evidence from a mix of observational and randomized trials). The effects on remission of T2DM appear to be greatest in patients with baseline BMI 40 based on the BMI stratification provided in the WA HTA report. Preliminary evidence suggests that adults with BMI < 35 may also achieve significant reductions in BMI and improvement in comorbid T2DM and hypertension, though the long term effects are not yet clear. 4. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant reductions in BMI in children and adolescents, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on low certainty evidence primarily from small, noncomparative observational trials of bariatric surgery for pediatric obesity). 5. Bariatric surgery is associated with remission or resolution of T2DM and hypertension in children or adolescents, despite a short term increased risk of perioperative mortality and complications (based on very low certainty evidence from a small number of trials). 6. There is no evidencebased minimum age recommendation for pediatric bariatric surgery. Patients as young as five years old were included in the studies reported in the summary literature. 7. There is low certainty conflicting evidence on the effects of preoperative weight loss requirements. 8. The obesity surgery mortality risk score (ORMRS) is a validated preoperative assessment of perioperative mortality risk (particularly for RYGB procedures) and may be useful in selecting patients for surgery or counseling them on surgical risks. 9. Harms of bariatric surgery include a perioperative mortality rate that probably ranges from 0.10 to 2%, and an overall complication rate that is probably on the order of 8 to 25%. The estimated reoperation rate is likely between 2 and 13%. There is limited evidence from a single study that comorbid congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and peripheral vascular disease are associated with higher rates of complications after bariatric surgery. 10. There is low certainty evidence that surgeon experience is associated with improved outcomes and very low certainty evidence that hospital bariatric surgical volume is associated with improved outcomes. 11. There is very low certainty evidence that revisional or conversion procedures performed after an initial bariatric surgery may achieve additional weight loss (particularly those procedures that convert AGB to RYGB or BPD/DS), but at the expense of a higher rate of complications. Systematic reviews offer no evidence that bariatric reoperation improved co morbidity resolution. 28 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource allocation Bariatric surgery for adults is costly, but improved outcomes compared with nonsurgical management may offset these costs. The WA HTA report cites total costs of bariatric surgical procedures as ranging from $17,483 for gastric banding to $36,160 for biliopancreatic diversion. By comparison, standard non surgical care has a reported total cost of $3,746. Accounting for reductions in BMI, resolution of comorbid conditions, and complications of surgery and projecting costs and effectiveness over a 10year horizon, bariatric surgical procedures are uniformly costeffective at a willingness topay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. This was true across BMI thresholds and surgical procedures. Excerpts from the economic analysis in the WA HTA report are provided in Appendix H. Bariatric surgery for children is also costly, but improved outcomes may offset these costs, and the beneficial effects could accrue over the longer time horizon afforded by earlier intervention in children and adolescents. However, there is very limited evidence of costeffectiveness of pediatric bariatric surgery. The pediatric costeffectiveness information included in the review by Aikenhead et al. in 2011 used assumptions from Australia that are likely too indirect to influence deliberations on resource allocation. Reoperations for additional weight loss are sometimes requested; a second high cost procedure (tens of thousands of dollars), with a history of prior failure is unlikely to show a favorable costeffectiveness ratio. Values and preferences Adults Most people would prefer to avoid surgery and its attendant risks if similar results could be attained through safer and less invasive interventions. However, patients who have failed to achieve adequate weight loss with less invasive interventions may decide that the superior outcomes of bariatric surgery (including long term improvements in allcause mortality, complete remission of diabetes, and significant weight loss) outweigh the upfront risks of surgery. Overall, there would be a moderate variability given these considerations. Children and adolescents Similar to adults, most children and their parents would prefer to avoid surgery and its attendant risks if similar results could be attained through safer and less invasive interventions. However, patients who may have failed to achieve adequate weight loss with less invasive interventions may decide that bariatric surgery offers the best chance at weight reduction. The significant social pressures of obesity at a young age may also push children and their parents to have strong interest in an effective treatment. Children though would likely have a great fear of surgery and the associated procedures and loss of social/academic participation. However, additional uncertainties related to malnutrition in this age group and its effects on growth, development, and reproductive capacity may make surgery less appealing in children and adolescents (to their caregivers). Long term remission rates of morbid obesity 29 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials and recurrence of the comorbidities are unknown; most studies report outcomes at one year, although a few studies report outcomes at up to three years. Given these considerations, there would be high variability in children's and parents preferences. Reoperations for inadequate weight loss There would be high variability in patient preferences regarding reoperation. With a prior failure of the procedure, some patients would be hesitant to try an additional procedure given the burdens of surgery and prior ineffectiveness, but others would be motivated to try a different procedure in hopes that it would work. Patients seeking reoperation likely have no other good option given failure of multiple previous alternatives (e.g. clinical, pharmacological, nutritional, physical activity, surgical). Other factors Adults The greatest health benefits may be with BMI 40 but otherwise specific subpopulations which would benefit the most from bariatric surgery are not well characterized. The preoperative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the rate of complications and need for reoperation reported in the summary literature, benefit plans may wish to consider alternative payment methodologies like bundled payments or a payfor outcomes approach. Surgeon case volume, and to a lesser extent hospital case volume, appear to affect outcomes for patients undergoing bariatric surgery and requirements regarding surgeon or facility volume may be reasonable. Children and adolescents Parental involvement in weight management plans is likely necessary to assist the effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet. Reoperations for inadequate weight loss It is unclear from the evidence which modifiable patient factors that resulted in surgical failure would predict a high likelihood of success or failure of a second procedure. 30 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials POLICY LANDSCAPE SOURCES Quality measures One bariatric surgeryspecific quality measure was identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse : Prevention and management of obesity for adults: percentage of patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 40 who have been provided with a referral to a bariatric specialist (Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement) Payer coverage policies Medicare (National Coverage Determination [NCD] 100.1 ), Washington Medicaid , Aetna , Blue Cross Blue Shield , and Moda all provide coverage of bariatric surgery. Each coverage policy outlines specific coverage criteria that must be met prior to bariatric surgery being approved. These criteria are described below and provided in more detail in Appendix E. Age All six payers provide coverage of bariatric surgery for adults (defined as at least 18 years), and Aetna and Cigna additionally provides coverage for adolescents (defined as an individual with completed skeletal growth). Washington limits the procedure type to LAGB only for individuals aged 18 to 20 years. Body Mass Index For adults, Aetna, Cigna and Moda require individuals have a BMI of greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2, or greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 with specific comorbidities. Washington and NCD 100.1 cover individuals with a BMI of greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, and Regence BCBS requires that an individual have a BMI of greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2 or a BMI of greater than, or equal to 35 kg/m2 with type 2 diabetes or at least two other specified comorbidities. Washington is the only identified payer that explicitly requires individuals not be pregnant at the time of the surgery. For adolescents, Aetna covers individuals with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 who have serious comorbidities, or individuals with a BMI of greater than 50 kg/m2 with less serious comorbidities. Cigna uses the same BMI criteria as the adult population. Comorbidities Diabetes is the only comorbidity specified by all five payers. Payers specify various combinations of other comorbid conditions including coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, lower extremity lymphatic or venous obstruction, mechanical arthopathy in major weight bearing joint, rare comorbid conditions (e.g., pseudo tumor cerebri), and obstructive sleep apnea. Aetna specifies several less severe comorbidities for adolescents with a BMI of over 50 including reflux disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, obesityrelated stress urinary incontinence. 31 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials PreSurgical Requirements Five payers require individuals to undergo a comprehensive psychosocial evaluation and participate in a formal weight loss program prior to being approved for bariatric surgery (Aetna, Cigna, Moda, Regence BCBS, and Washington). Three payers require a separate medical evaluation (Washington, Cigna, Moda), surgical evaluation (Washington, Cigna), and nutritional evaluation (Cigna, Moda) prior to surgery. The NCD 100.1 requires that individuals have been previously unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. Payers require an individual attend a formal weight loss program within six months (Washington) to two years of surgery (Aetna, Regence BCBS, Moda). The weight loss program must be greater than or equal to three (Cigna) to six months in duration (Washington, Aetna, Regence BCBS, Moda). Both Washington and Moda require that individuals lose 5% of their initial body weight as part of the weight loss program prior to surgery. Aetna's policy states that there can be no net weight gain during weight loss program attendance. Payer coverage policies include a variety of additional required program components including counseling by a registered dietitian, patient journal of participation, regular facetoface provider visits, behavior modification, supervised exercise regimen, and hypocaloric diet changes. Provider Requirements Washington Medicaid and Moda state that bariatric surgery is only covered if provided by an approved facility, defined by Moda as a Center of Excellence and by Washington with specific criteria. Bariatric surgery facilities approved by Washington Medicaid must have performed a minimum of 100 bariatric surgical procedures, be under the direction of an experienced boardcertified surgeon, been in operation for at least five years, have a 2% or less mortality rate, have a 15% or less morbidity rate, have at least five years of patient followup data, have an average of at least 50% patient weight loss at five years, and have a reoperation/revision rate of 5% or less. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare have approved six facilities in Oregon to perform bariatric surgery: Bay Area Hospital, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Salem Hospital, St. Charles Medical Center - Bend. Repeat Surgery Coverage Aetna, Cigna and Regence BCBS address repeat bariatric surgery and outline specific circumstances under which it is covered. All three payers provide coverage to correct complication from the initial surgery, and conversion from gastric banding to sleeve gastrectomy, RYGB or BPD/DS. Aetna and Cigna specify that conversion surgery is covered for individuals who have not lost more than 50% of their body weight two years following the primary bariatric surgery. Cigna will cover the adjustment of the silicone gastric band and repeat surgery for a failed dilation of a gastric pouch. Aetna will additionally cover removal of a gastric band, replacement of adjustable band, and repeat surgery for a failed dilation of a gastric pouch. NonCovered Procedures Aetna, Cigna, and Regence BCBS outline specific conditions and procedures that are not in the coverage of bariatric surgery. Across all three payers, gastroplasty (\"stomach stapling\"), laparoscopic suturing Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials TOGA\u00ae), are not covered. In addition, Aetna and Cigna do not cover gastrointestinal liners (e.g., EndoBarrier), intragastric balloon, loop gastric bypass, silastic ring vertical gastric bypass (e.g., Fobi pouch), or vagus nerve blocking. Aetna and Regence BCBS do not cover band over bypass surgeries, band or sleeve gastrectomy surgeries, sclerotherapy for the treatment of dilated gastrojejunostomy following bariatric surgery, or for gastroesophageal reflux disease in nonobese individuals. Cigna and Regence BCBS do not cover intestinal bypass (jejunoileal bypass) or restorative obesity surgery (e.g., ROSE). Regence BCBS specifically does not cover vertical banded gastroplasty; Aetna covers this procedure for members who are at increased risk of adverse consequences from RouxenY gastric bypass due to certain gastrointestinal conditions (see Appendix E). The NCD 100.1 does not provide coverage for open adjustable gastric banding, open sleeve gastrectomy, open and laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty, intestinal bypass surgery, and gastric balloon for treatment of obesity. Professional society guidelines Adults The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) (Fitch et al., 2013a) (good quality), Veterans Administration (VA) (Management of Overweight and Obesity Working Group, 2014) (good quality), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, Obesity Society, American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (Mechanick et al., 2013) (poor quality primarily), the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (NHMRC, 2013) (good quality), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (NICE, 2014) (good quality) provide recommendations on the use of bariatric surgery in adults. The guideline from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/The Obesity Society (Jensen et al., 2014) (good quality) provides a summary of the evidence related to the longterm effectiveness of bariatric surgeries and the longterm effects of these procedures on varying BMI levels with and without comorbidities. The guideline does not provide clinical practice recommendations. All identified guidelines consistently recommend bariatric surgery for individuals with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2, or greater than 35 kg/m2with significant comorbidities. There is some variance between guidelines in what comorbidities are considered significant. For example, only two of the five guidelines list gastroesophageal reflux disease as a significant comorbidity. Four guidelines (AACD/OS/ASMBS, ICSI, NHMRC, NICE) recommend bariatric surgery be considered for individuals with a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m2who have severe comorbidities such as diabetes, and NICE recommends bariatric surgery for individuals of Asian descent with recentonset diabetes who may have a lower BMI than other populations. The VA determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend the use of bariatric surgery for individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The AACD/OS/ASMBS and NICE guidelines recommend individuals have presurgical comprehensive medical and psychological evaluations. The use of multidisciplinary teams consisting of surgical, medical, nutrition, and psychological expertise is recommended by NICE and NHMRC. 33 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Children The ICSI (Fitch et al., 2013b) (good quality), the Australian NHMRC (NHMRC, 2013), and NICE (NICE, 2014) provide recommendations on indications for bariatric surgery in the pediatric population. Both the ICSI and NHMRC guidelines recommend bariatric surgery as an option for adolescents with a BMI greater than 40, or greater than 35 with severe comorbidities. The NHMRC specifies that only laparoscopic gastric banding performed by a specialist bariatric/pediatric surgical team is recommended for adolescents. The guideline from ICSI is the most comprehensive and recommends detailed pre surgical evaluations, failed attempts at weight loss through formal weight loss programs, and the use of multidisciplinary team at regional bariatric centers of excellence. ICSI further recommends that children have attained Tanner stage 4 or 5 or have bone age of 13 years in girls or 15 years in boys before considering bariatric surgery. Pediatric bariatric surgery is not recommended by NICE except in the case of exceptional circumstances. Assessment of congruence between guidelines and evidence In general, the clinical practice guideline recommendations for adults are supported by the available evidence. Patients with BMI 40 kg/m2 or with BMI 35 to 39.9 with obesityrelated comorbid conditions have been well studied in the literature, and the clinical practice guidelines reflect this stronger evidence base. The divergence in the recommendations for patients with BMI 30 to 34.9 probably reflects the smaller number of studies that specifically address this population and the shorter followup periods reported in these studies. Recommendations regarding presurgical evaluations may reflect expert practice tips, but are not directly supported by the summary literature. Similarly, recommendations regarding preoperative weight loss are based on expert opinion and are not directly supported by the summary literature. The wider variation in the recommendations for bariatric surgery in children reflects greater uncertainty about both the effectiveness and the adverse effects of surgery. When surgery is recommended for children, there is general agreement based on expert opinion that this should be performed at regional centers of excellence.

Center staff dual quality assessed the identified reviews and only included those that were rated as good quality. Studies were excluded if they were not published in English, did not address the scope statement, or were study designs other than systematic reviews, metaanalyses, technology assessments, or clinical practice guidelines. The following systematic review was excluded because it only included studies that were found in the other systematic reviews: Ashrafian, H., Toma, T., Rowland, S.

GRADE INFORMED FRAMEWORK ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confident that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating across studies for the treatment/outcome1 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limitations or wellperformed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention\u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed\u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issue about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 41 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery DRAFT for 10/6/2016 VbBS/HERC Meeting Materials Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low: The subcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

MORTALITY BENEFIT OUTCOMES FROM KWOK (2014) SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND METAANALYSIS Several large cohort studies with longterm followup comparing bariatric surgery patients to non surgical controls have demonstrated a consistent reduction in allcause mortality (as summarized in the metaanalysis in Kwok 2014). In the included cohort studies that performed direct subgroup analysis by BMI, the effects of bariatric surgery appear to be stronger in patients with higher BMI, though other cohorts that report proportional hazard ratios using BMI of 3540 kg/m2 as the reference find increasing mortality in BMI groups >40. Only two of the cohorts reported outcomes by baseline comorbidities. In the Swedish Obese Subjects study (Sjostorm, 2012), patients with T2DM may have benefited more than those without T2DM, while patients with SBP <140 may have benefited more than hypertensive patients; however, in both scenarios the 95% confidence intervals overlap. It should be noted that Sjostrom reported on the incidence of cardiovascular events rather than mortality and that 70% of the patients received vertical banded gastroplasty, a procedure that is no longer used in the United States. Scott (2013) reports on a cohort of bariatric patients compared to matched controls undergoing either orthopedic or gastrointestinal procedures. There were no significant differences based on the presence of HTN in either group or T2DM in the bariatricorthopedic comparison; among T2DM patients in the bariatricGI comparison, there was a slight increase in the proportional hazard of mortality. Two other cohort studies (Arterburn, 2013 and Johnson, 2013) only included patients with T2DM at baseline. Caution should be exercised in interpreting subgroup analyses from these cohorts given the potentially small number of patients involved. Individual studies with prespecified inclusion criteria based on comorbidities are more likely to provide accurate estimates of the effects in these groups. On balance, there is insufficient evidence from these cohort studies to conclude that the effects of bariatric surgery on longterm mortality vary based on preoperative BMI or the presence of comorbid conditions.

We agreed with standardizing the indications for surgery to come in line with current clinical practic e throughout the United States. We agree the information in the areas of adolescent surgery and surgical treatment of BMI less than 35 is incomp lete and rapidly evolving. We believe these two areas should be reassessed in two years. \" Thank you for your comment. The Oregon HERC assesses any new evidence every two years to determine if a new coverage guidance is needed. Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 1 Issue: The HERC is reviewing treatments for obesity as part of its biennial review. The Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee (H TAS) has performed a detailed assessment of the evidence and developed a Coverage Guidance on bariatric surgery for obesity. The Obesity Task Force met on 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 to discuss clinical interventions for obesity including bariatric/metabolic surgery. They reviewed the draft HTAS Coverage Guidance recommendations and made recommendations to VbBS on changes to the Prioritize d List of Health Services. Current Prioritized List Status: Line: 30 Condition: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (See Coding Specification Below) (See Guideline Notes 8,62,64,65) Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY, gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy) are only included on this line as treatment acco rding to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of E11 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a secondary diagnosis of E66.01, E66.09, E66.2, E66.8 or E66.9 (Obesity); AND, 3) e of Z68.35 -Z68.39 or Z68.4. Line: 325 Condition: OBESITY (ADULT PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5,64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE (See Guideline Notes 8,64,65) NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFI CANT COMORBID ITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 GUIDELINE NOTE 8, BARIATRIC SURGERY Lines 30, 589 Bariatric surgery is included under the following criteria: A) Age 18 B) The patient has 1) a BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes for inclusion on Line 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS; OR 2) BMI >=35 with at least one significant co -morbidity other than type II diabetes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypert ension) or BMI >= 40 without a significant co -morbidity for inclusion on Line 589 C) No prior history of Roux -en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, unless they resulted in failure due to complications of the original surgery. D) Partici pate in the following four evaluations and meet criteria as described. 1) Psychosocial evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed mental health professional) a) Evaluation to assess potential compliance with post -operative requirements. b) Must remain free of abuse of or dependence on alcohol during the six -month period immediately preceding surgery. No current use of nicotine or illicit drugs and must remain abstinent from their use during the six -month observation period. Testing will, at a minimum, be conducted within one month of the surgery to confirm abstinence from nicotine and illicit drugs. c) No mental or behavioral disorder that may interfere with postoperative outcomes1. d) Patient with previous psychiatric illness must be stable for at least 6 months. 2) Medical evalua tion: (Conducted by OHP primary care provider) a) Pre-operative physical condition and mortality risk assessed with patient found to be an appropriate candidate. b) Optimize medical control of diabetes, hypertension, or other co -morbid conditions. c) Female patien t not currently pregnant with no plans for pregnancy for at least 2 years post -surgery. Contraception methods reviewed with patient agreement to use effective contraception through 2nd year post -surgery. 3) Surgical evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed bariat ric surgeon associated with program2) a) Patient found to be an appropriate candidate for surgery at initial evaluation and throughout period leading to surgery while continuously enrolled on OHP. b) Received counseling by a credentialed expert on the team regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure3 and understands the many potential complications of the surgery (including death) and the realistic expectations of post -surgical outcomes. 4) Dietician evaluation: (Conducted by licensed dietician) a) Evaluatio n of adequacy of prior dietary efforts to lose weight. If no or inadequate prior dietary effort to lose weight, must undergo six -month medically supervised weight reduction program. b) Counseling in dietary lifestyle changes Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 3 E) Participate in additional evaluati ons: 1) Post -surgical attention to lifestyle, an exercise program and dietary changes and understands the need for post -surgical follow -up with all applicable professionals (e.g. nutritionist, psychologist/psychiatrist, exercise physiologist or physical ther apist, support group participation, regularly scheduled physician follow -up visits). 1 Many patients (>50%) have depression as a co -morbid diagnosis that, if treated, would not preclude their participation in the bariatric surgery program. 2 All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Qu ality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensi ve, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified b ariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation o f surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as w heel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk).

The benefits of decreased mortality, dramatic weight loss, and regression of diabetes are important outcomes that patients and society would strongly value. However, there would still be moderate variability because of the risks and costs associated with surgery, as well as the intensive peri - and post -operative follow up. The pre -operative requirements for achieving optimal outcomes are unclear. Given the rate of complications and need for reoperation reported in the summary literature, benefit plans may wish to consider alternativ e payment methodologies like bundled payments or a pay -for-outcomes approach. Surgeon case volume, and to a lesser extent hospital case volume, appear to affect outcomes for patients undergoing bariatric surgery and requirements regarding surgeon or facili ty volume may be reasonable.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Rationale: Bariatric surgery appears to lower all -cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in obese adults (low certainty), and significantly reduces BMI, and results in resolution of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The greatest benefit appears to be with BMI 40. Though bariatric surgery is costly and carries significant perioperative risks, the clear long -term positive health benefits leads to a recommendation for coverage. The strength of the recommendation is based on the fact that there is a strong benefit on critical outcomes (particularly in diabetics), and patients desiring surgery would strongly prefer this intervention. For those without diabetes, and other comorbidities are present, the evidence is less clear, leadi ng to a weak recomme ndation. bariatric surgery -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy) is for: Adult obese patients (BMI 35 and <40) with: o Type 2 diabetes (strong recommendation) OR o at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea (weak recommendation) Adult obese patients (BMI 40) (strong recommendation) Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation).

However, uncertainty about the long - term balance of benefits and harms could significantly alter estimates of cost -effectiveness. parents would be highly motivated to find an effective alternative intervention. Children may have a significant fear of surgery, but the profound social and emotional impact of obesity may override their concerns. Parents are likely to be more concerned about the long term health impacts of obesity than children, and may be concerned about the uncertainty about the long term benefits. effectiveness of obesity treatments (based on expert opinion). Pediatric bariatric surgery is likely to be available at only a few highly specialized centers. The American Academy of Pediatrics has 10 criteria that pediatric bariatric surgery programs should meet. Insufficient evidence Type 2 DM remission/resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of T2DM ranged from 50 to 100% (very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects ) Hypertension remission/ resolution (Important outcome ) Rates of remission of hypertension ranged from 50 to 100% ( very low certainty based on mostly small observational trials with imprecise effects) Change in BMI (Important outcome ) Mean weighted difference in BMI at 1 year (from baseline): -10.5 to -17.2 kg/m2 (low certainty based on mostly small observational trials) Rationale: Bariatric surgery likely results in significant reductions in BMI (low certainty) and is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes and hypertension (very low certainty). However, coverage is not recommended because of the limited evidence about overal l long -term benefits and harms of bariatric surgery in this population as well as the high variability in values and preferences. Recommendation: Bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in children and adolescents (weak recommendation). Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix B.

Bariatric/M etabolic Surgery for Obesity 7 Coverage question: Should reoperative bariatric surgery for inadequate weight loss be recommended for coverage? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Confidence in Estimate of Effect Critical outcomes All-cause mortality Insufficient evidence in this population A second high cost procedure (tens of thousands of dollars), with a history of prior failure may be more costly in total and less effective, however, the cost - effectiveness in this group is unknown. There would be high variability in patient preferences . With a prior failure of a bariatric procedure, some patients would be hesitant to try an additional procedure given the burdens of surgery and prior ineffectiveness. Others would be motivated to try a different procedure in hopes that it would work better. Patients seeking reoperation have likely no other good potential option given failure of multiple previous alternatives (e.g. clinical, pharmacological, nutritional, physical activity, and surgical). There is evidence of greater complications rates with reoperation. There is insufficient evidence in the reoperation group to know if their outcomes would be substantially different that those undergoing their first operation. A significant proportion of these patients would be going from a band to a RYGB (from a procedure with a higher failure rate to a lower failure rate). Insufficient evidence Major adverse cardiovascular events Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Important outcomes Type 2 DM remission / resolution Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Hypertension remission/ resolution Insufficient evidence in this population Insufficient evidence Change in BMI Mean change in BMI (from baseline): +2.4 kg/m2 to -17.2 kg/m2 (follow -up ranging from 8 to 48 months) (very low certainty based on small case series) Rationale: Reoperation is associated with higher complication rates but also effective weight loss (based on very low quality evidence). While there are not long term health outcomes available, there is no reason to believe that significant weight loss in the reop eration group would be associated with less future health benefits. Therefore, the subcommittee makes no recommendation that the coverage criteria should be different between reoperat ion and primary surgery. Surgeons will also evaluate their patients and c onsider reasons for failure when deciding if the patient is a good candidate for reoperation. Recommendation: No recommendation that coverage criteria for re -operation should be different than for primary surgery.

Metabolic a nd bariatric surgery is not recommended for coverage in: Patients with BMI <35, or 35 -40 without the defined comorbid conditions above (weak recommendation) Children and adolescents (weak recommendation) HERC Staff Assessment: Currently, bariatric surgery only pairs in the funded region of the Prioritized List with diabetes. The Coverage Guidance suggests that coverage should be expanded to those with diabetes or other comorbidities. Therefore, changing the primary indication for bariatric surgery on the List to be for obesity rather than diabetes makes sense and consolidating the bariatric surgery codes to the Obesity line is indicated . Having bariatric surgery codes on the lower obesity line (589) is confusing because of the comorbidity rule, when ther e are clearly defined comorbidities in the new proposed guideline note language. Because the weight loss is less, consider not covering gastric banding as a preferred surgical treatment. Obesity Task Force Phase 1 Recommendations (reflecting 3/3/16 and 3/17/16 task force discussions) : 1) Add bariatric surgery to Line 325 a. Change the Treatment title b. Add bariatric surgery codes (see Code Movement Table) 2) Remove bariatric surgery from Line 30, Type 2 Diabetes a. Change title of the Treatment to not include bari atric surgery b. Remove bariatric surgery codes from line 30 (see Code Movement Table) c. Remove coding specification about bariatric surgery d. Remove reference to Guideline Note 8 3) Remove bariatric surgery from Line 589 a. Change the Treatment title Bariatric/metabolic surgery for obesity 9 b. Remove bariatric surgery codes from Line 589 (see Code Movement Table) 4) Revise Guideline Note 8 a. Expand to BMI >40 without comorbidities, and 35 with specific comorbidities b. Continue to not cover surgery for children and adolescents c. Allow reoperations d. Discuss whether gastric banding should be covered only when there are contraindications or also in women of reproductive age with intent to conceive e. Add freedom from marijuana dependence/abuse to the 6 month contraindications f. Change language around the certification/accr editation requirements from the MBSAQIP g. Make other minor guideline changes Line: 30 Condition: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (See Coding Specification Below) (See Guideline Notes 8,62,64,65) Treatment: MEDICAL THERAPY gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy) are only included on this line a s treatment according to the requirements in Guideline Note 8 when paired with: 1) a primary diagnosis of E11 (Type II Diabetes with or without complication); 2) a secondary diagnosis of E66.01, E66.09, E66.9 or OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 PERCENTILE) (See Guideline Notes 5 ,8, 64,65) Treatment: INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING is recommended for deletion under a separate issue) Condition: OBESITY (ADULT BMI 30, CHILDHOOD BMI 95 Notes 8,64,65) Treatment: NON -INTENSIVE NUTRITIONAL/PH YSICAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS ; BARIATRIC SURGERY FOR OBESITY WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMORBIDITY OTHER THAN TYPE II DIABETES & BMI >=35 Bariatric /metabolic surgery (limited to Roux -en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding1, and sleeve gastrectomy) is included on Line 325 under when the following criteria are met : A) Age 18 Bariatric/metabolic surgery for obesity 10 B) The patient has obesity with a: 1) a BMI 35 with co -morbid type II diabetes for inclusion on Line 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS; OR 2) BMI >=35 with at least one significant co -morbidity other than type II diabetes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) o r BMI >= 40 without a significant co -morbidity for inclusion on Line 589 1) BMI 40 OR 2) BMI 35 with: a) Type 2 diabetes, OR b) at least two of the following other serious obesity -related comorbidities: hypertension, coronary heart disease, mechanical arthropathy in major weight bearing joint, sleep apnea B) No prior history of Roux -en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, or repeat gastric banding or unless they resulted in failure due to complications of the original surgery. Repeat bariatric surgery is included when it is a conversion from a less intensive (such as gastric band or sleeve gastrectomy) to a more intensive surgery (e.g. Roux -en-Y). Repair of surgical complications (excluding failure to lose sufficient weight) are also included on this and other lines. Reversal of surgical procedures and devices is included on this line when benefits of reversal outweigh harms. C) Participate in the following four evaluations and meet criteria as described. 1) Psychosocial evaluation: (Conducted by a licensed mental health professional) a) Evaluation to assess potential compliance with post -operative requirements. b) Must remain free of abuse of or dependence on alcohol or marijuana during the six-month period immediately preceding surgery. No current use o f nicotine or illicit drugs and must remain abstinent from their use during the six -month observation period. Testing will, at a minimum, be conducted within one month of the quit date and within 1 month of the surgery to confirm abstinence from nicotine a nd illicit drugs. c) No mental or behavioral disorder that may interfere with postoperative outcomes2. d) Patient with previous psychiatric illness must be stable for at least 6 months. 2) Medical evaluation: (Conducted by OHP primary care provider) a) Pre-operative p hysical condition and mortality risk assessed with patient found to be an appropriate candidate. b) Optimize medical control of diabetes, hypertension, or other co -morbid conditions. c) Female patient not currently pregnant with no plans for pregnancy for at le ast 2 years post -surgery.

If no or inadequate prior dietary effort to lose weight, must undergo six -month medically clinically supervised weight reduction program (including intensive nutrition and physical activity counseling as defined by the USPSTF). b) Counseling in d ietary lifestyle changes D) Participate in additional evaluations: 1) Post -surgical attention to lifestyle, an exercise program and dietary changes and understands the need for post -surgical follow -up with all applicable professionals (e.g. nutritionist, psycho logist/psychiatrist, exercise physiologist or physical therapist, support group participation, regularly scheduled physician follow -up visits). Option 1 : 1 Banding is only included when sleeve gastrectomy or Roux -en-Y are contraindicated OR Option 2 : 1 Banding is only included when sleeve gastrectomy or Roux -en-Y are contraindicated, or for a woman of reproductive age with intent to conceive a pregnancy who prefers a less intensive surgical treatment. 2 Many patients (>50%) have depression as a co -morbi d diagnosis that, if treated, would not preclude their participation in the bariatric surgery program. 3 All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) . , or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway - directed bariatric program in place; hos pital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric - grade equipment i n outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes.

Accreditation issue in bariatric surgery Question: Should the guideline note on bariatric surgery continue to require accreditation through the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP)? Relevant history Prioritized List When bariatric surgery was first covered on the Prioritized List, there was a strong interest i n ensuring quality outcomes. The current guideline note required that the hospitals either be certified by MBSAQIP or in pursuit of certificat ion. It also requires bariatric surgery programs to provide yearly data to DMAP. The required regular reporti ng of outcomes to DMAP never occurred. Here is the current Guideline Note 8 Bariatric Surgery excerpt: All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathwa y-directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/3 65;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the p rogram is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe card iopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). HTAS Coverage Guidance HTAS developed a Coverage Guidance on bariatric surgery. They asked a Key Question: What components and systems of care are associated with improved health outcomes (e.g., centers of excellence, surgeon's experience, etc.)? The Cove rage Guidance includes one systematic review on systems of care (Zevin, 2012) evaluating s urgeon and hospital volume. The Coverage Guidance concludes that \"t here is low certainty evidence that surgeon experience is associated with improved outcomes and very low certainty evidence that hospital bariatric surgical volume is associated with impro ved outcomes.\" The Washington HTA found limited evidence of post -operative support groups. The draft Coverage Guidance box language about accreditation is as follows: Metabolic and bariatric surgery is recommended for coverage in these populations only when provided in a facility accredited by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (weak recommendation). Obesity Task Force Ph ase I The obesity task force used the HTAS Draft Coverage Guidance as the basis for developing recommended changes to the Prioritized List. They became aware through expert testimony that there were two types of accreditation (comprehensive center or low acuity center) and thus recommended language limiting surgery to one of these two centers. It was understood at that time that this would include all of the bariatric surgery centers in the state. They suggested editing that section as follows: All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) . , or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; traine d and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to compleme nt surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medi caid Assistance Programs (DMAP). Interim update - Kaiser HERC staff became aware that Kaiser does bariatric surgery through a query raised through HealthShare, Helen Bellanca and Joyce Caramella. From Joyce Caramella , RN, Quality Improvement Coordinato r, HealthShare This proposed wording further restricts where OHP members can have this surgery. Currently there are 9 centers in Oregon that qualify, two in Portland that are comprehensive centers (OHSU and Legacy Good Samaritan and one that is a low acui ty center. Last case I had regarding this surgery, the member was on a 3 year wait list for his approved surgery at OHSU. We had hoped that Kaiser might be considered for approval, they now can do these surgeries on their members and Medicare members, but not OHP members. This is a lifesaving procedure for these members, and it feel cruel to deny them an approved service for such a long timeframe. From Helen Bellanca, MD, MPH, HealthShare Kaiser is not seeking MBSAQIP certification for several reasons: 1. Having that certification would obligate them to be open to anyone in the community seeking the surgery. Because Kaiser is a closed system, they didn't feel they could meet that obligation 2. Standards in bariatric surgery have shifted. It used to be though t that high - volume centers provided the best care, and so these certifications are based on volume. However, that standard was only true when the surgery was new and there weren't that many people doing it. Now that there is way more experience in the fi eld, quality can be determined by outcomes (data on complication rates) rather than volume, which is what Kaiser does. 3. It is prohibitively expensive to be certified. Not only are there direct costs to the certification itself, but there are indirect costs to use their specific data system, hire more nurses, require the surgeons to alter their call schedule, etc. It was the feeling at Kaiser that the only people who push for certification are the institutions who are already certified, but that their quali ty data is actually not as good as Kaiser's. Kaiser has no internal incentive to seek this certification and they don't feel it reflects the quality of the care they provide. In terms of solutions, they offered this one: They told me that a recent standar d for Medicare/Medicaid elsewhere was for patients to be notified that they have a right to receive the surgery at an MBSAQIP -certified center, that Kaiser was not such a center, but that they could waive this right and have the surgery at Kaiser if they c hose. They recommend including that language in the HERC guidance. Something like: Patients must be notified of their right to have all surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). Patients may waive this right if they choose, but must sign a consent form indicating that they understand that they are waiving that right in order to get the care at the institution of their choice. From Dr. Bruce Wolfe, MD ( HERC appointed expert on the Bariatric Surgery Coverage Guidance The systematic review by Drs. Azagury and Morton identifie d 13 papers that met inclusion criteria. 10 of the 13 found accreditation improved outcomes while 3 did not. The author of one of these and co -author of another, John Birkmeyer, requested a review of the accreditation requirements by CMS, a request that wa s granted as you know. Given the lack of unanimity of the reported analyses and the withdrawal of the accreditation required by CMS, Oregon would be justified in not requiring MBSAQIP accreditation for participation in the care of bariatric surgery patient s covered by Medicaid. The question at the committee meeting addressed by Dr. Halpin and myself was how can administrators of Oregon Medicaid be assured that each provider of bariatric surgical services is performing at an acceptable level? Our answer to t hat question is MBSAQIP accreditation. The key to the accreditation is the accumulation of outcomes among all patients undergoing bariatric surgery at the center and with reporting of the risk -adjusted outcomes in relation to the total MBSAQIP database. In this way, the centers receive analyses indicating what areas of their program require improvement. As reported by Birkmeyer, it is certainly possible for a given center to be performing at a level equivalent to others in the state or nation without necess arily being a part of the accreditation system with data analysis and reporting. Conversely, it is also possible for a given center to not be performing at such a level. Dr. Halpin and I have discussed the matter and have no objection to whatever decisio n you may make as, indicated above, that decision would be supportable by selected evidence. Background about the controversy Blackstone, 2014 1. Commentary, pro/con article that explains history of accreditation and arguments 2. Accreditation started in 2004, and in 2012, the two national accreditation programs ASMBS Centers of Excellence and ACS Bariatric Surgery Center Network merged into the the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program(MBSAQ IP). Univ of Michigan/BCBS collaborative created new model that was adopted. 3. CMS convened an expert panel and decided in 2013 to drop the accreditation requirement. Medical specialty societies were opposed. 4. Argument against accreditation - a. Concentrating medicare patients into centers of excellence did not improve outcomes b. Disadvantages minority patients. 17% decline in access to care among minority Medicare patients 5. Argument for accreditation - a. Articles arguing that COE are no better than non -COE have numerous limitations, including other 1) simultaneous initiatives in Michigan that would improve outcomes despite non -COE; 2) new adoption of accreditation caused misclassification b. 2 studies found increased mortality in non -COE hospitals c. Studies saying tha t differential access are self -contradictory Blondet, 2015 1. Summary of historical process and data supporting accreditation 2. No specific methodology identified 3. Strong recommends accreditation based on improved outcomes. Discredits the studies that demonstrate no improvement in morbidity/mortality. Evidence summary Morton, 2014 1. 2010 National wide inpatient sample of 117,478 weighted bariatric patient discharges corresponding to 235 unique hospitals. A total of 72,615 (61.8%) weighted discharges, corresponding to 145 (61.7%) named or AHA identifiable hospitals were included. 2. Among the 145 hospitals, 66 (45.5%) were unaccredited and 79 (54.5%) accredited. 3. Baseline characteristics between accredited and unaccredited hospitals are significant: 4. Patient characteristics also vary significantly between unaccredited and accredited hospitals: a. Procedures b. Race c. Age d. Insurance e. Charleston combordity index 5. Results: a. Compared with accredited centers , unaccredited centers had a higher: i. Mean LOS (2.25 vs 1.99 days, P < 0.0001) ii. Total charges ($51,189 vs $42,212, P < 0.0001) iii. Incidence of any complication (12.3% vs 11.3%, P = 0.001) iv. Mortality (0.13% vs 0.07%, P = 0.019) v. Failure to rescue (0.97% vs 0.55%, P = 0.046). b. Accredited centers had higher rates of: i. Deep venous thrombosis (1.43 v 2.12, P Cardiac arrhythmia (2.81 v 3.79, P<0.0001) c. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified unaccredited status as a positive predictor of incidence of complication [odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, P < 0.0001], as well as m ortality (OR = 2.13, P = 0.013). d. Teaching hospitals also increased risk of any in -hospital complication OR 1.32 (95% CI 1.26 -1.39, P<0.0001) e. f. 6. Author Conclusions : Hospital accreditation status is associated with safer outcomes, shorter LOS, and lower total charges after bariatric surgery. 7. Staff conclusions: The study does suggest that outcomes are better at accredited hospitals. However, t here are significant differences between baseline characteristics of patients and hospitals between unaccredited and accredited that make conclusions more challenging to interpret . For mortality, the highest risk predictor is being unaccre dited . For any complication, the highest system level risk predictors are Medicare insurance (OR 1.69), teaching hospital (OR 1.32 ) then unaccredited (OR 1.09) . High volume centers and private insurance are both protective against complications . For mortality, having private insurance is highly protective (OR 0.22). Zevin, 2012 (from the CG) 1. Systematic review of volume -outcome associations in bariatric surgery; good quality 2. 24 observational studies comprising almost 460,000 patients. 3. Meta -analysis was not performed due to a high level of heterogeneity that resulted, in part, from differences in duration of follow -up and risk -adjustment. 4. 13 studies addressed the relationship between annual surgeon case volume and patient outcomes. Across the 5 cohort studies that were included, there was consistent evidence of improved outcomes with increasing surgeon volume. The results of lower quality studies (primarily retrospective cohorts) were mixed, but 6 of the 8 studies supported an association between surgeon volume and outcomes. 5. 17 studies addressed the association between hospital volume and outco mes. While the two case -control studies that were included did not support an association between facility volume and outcomes, the preponderance of retrospective case series (14/15 studies) that were included found an association between facility volume a nd outcomes. 6. Authors conclusions: There is strong evidence to support the association between surgeon volume and patient outcomes, and that weaker evidence supports the association between hospital volume and outcomes. Overall, they conclude that the literature \"supports the BSCOE accreditation and the bariatric surgery fellowship training programs\" (Zevin et al., 2012, p. 70). Other payer policies CMS coverage Effective for dates of service on and after February 21, 2006, these procedures are only cover ed when performed at facilities that are: (1) certified by the American College of Surgeons as a Level 1 Bariatric Surgery Center (program standards and requirements in effect on February 15, 2006); or (2) certified by the American Society for Bariatric Su rgery as a Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence (program standards and requirements in effect on February 15, 2006). Effective for dates of service on and after September 24, 2013, facilities are no longer required to be certified. The Centers for Medica id and Medicare have approved six facilities in Oregon to perform bariatric surgery: Bay Area Hospital, Legacy Good Samaritan Hospita l and Medical Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Salem Hospital, St. Charles Medical Center - Bend. Moda Bariatric surgery is only covered if provided by an approved facility, defined by Moda as a Center of Excellenc e. Washington Medicaid Bariatric surgery facilities approved by Washington Medicaid must have performed a minimum of 100 bariatric surgical procedures, be under the direction of an experienced board -certified surgeon, been in operation for at least five years, have a 2% or less mortality rate, have a 15% or less morbidity rate, have at least five years of patient follow -up data, have an average of at least 50% patient weight loss at five years, and have a reoperation/revision rate of 5% or less. Aetna No specific requirement Cigna No specific requirement Regence BCBS No specific requirement HERC Staff Summary Since the HTAS and Obesity Task Force Phase I reviewed the Bariatric Surgery Coverage Guidance, new information became available that differed from their understanding at the time. The new information is that there is a bariatric surgery program in Oregon that is not accredited. The understanding that all bariatric surgeons in Oregon were practicing at an accredited center was one (of many reasons) why ongoing accreditation was recommended to be required. Historically, the Prioritized List guideline note dealing with bariatric surgery has required some element of proof of good outcomes from bariatric surgery programs . However, this requirement for d ata reporting has not been implemented and no guarantee of outcomes has been ascertained despite the fact that this requirement has been in place for many years . Studies generally support impro ved outcomes with accreditation (although there are a few contradictory studies ). There are also a number of other variables associated with worse outcomes that are not excluded from coverage . CMS no longer requires accreditation. There is at least one system in Oregon (Kaiser) which is not accredited and does not plan to pursue accreditation, however , has OHSU fellowship -trained bariatric surgeons . Including proposed language about informing patients about patients ' needing to be informed about their right to receive care at a MBSAQIP accredited center seems to be outside of typical Prioritized List territory. Requiring accreditation is not something the Prioritized List requires for other types of surgeries. Given this, it is worth a brief discussion to determine whether requiring accreditation for inclusion on the Prioritized List is still appropriate. HERC Staff Recommendation Discuss whether to: 1. Continue requiring accreditation (one center in Oregon will be excluded) All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification accreditation (as a comprehensive center or low acuity center) by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) . , or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicated, comprehensiv e, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 months; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidities (such as wh eel-chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP). OR 2. Adopt language similar to Washington, based on the Coverag e Guidance finding that addresses the association between surgeon volume and outcomes: All surgical services must be provided by a program with a minimum of 10 0 bariatric surgical procedures and be under the direction of an experienced board -certified surg eon. OR 3. Eliminate accreditation as part of the coverage requirement altogether. All surgical services must be provided by a program with current certification by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). , or in active pursuit of such certification with all of the following: a dedicat ed, comprehensive, multidisciplinary, pathway -directed bariatric program in place; hospital to have performed bariatrics > 1 year and > 25 cases the previous 12 months; trained and credentialed bariatric surgeon performing at least 50 cases in past 24 mont hs; qualified bariatric call coverage 24/7/365;appropriate bariatric -grade equipment in outpatient and inpatient facilities; appropriate medical specialty services to complement surgeons' care for patients; and quality improvement program with prospective documentation of surgical outcomes. If the program is still pursuing (MBSAQIP) certification, it must also restrict care to lower -risk OHP patients including: age < 65 years; BMI < 70; no major elective revisional surgery; and, no extreme medical comorbidi ties (such as wheel -chair bound, severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other excessive risk). All programs must agree to yearly submission of outcomes data to Division of Medicaid Assistance Programs (DMAP).

The programs established standards for practice to integrate a continuum of de ned structural elements, processes of care, reporting of all cases, and audits by site visits in a 3- year cycle. National accreditation was accepted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as arequirement within the 2006 National Coverage Determi- nation (NCD) in bariatric surgery. Accreditation also became widely supported by commercial insurance compa-nies as the baseline for participation in their networks. In April of 2012, the 2 national bariatric accreditation pro- grams (ASMBS Centers of Excellence and ACS BariatricSurgery Center Network) uni ed into 1 program \u2014the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP). The MBSAQIPfocuses on providing standards that allow for wider participation by new programs, provides well-de ned data denitions and standardized collection methods consistent with National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) standards, instituted 100% reporting of cases, and created a framework for local, state-wide and regionalcollaboration to improve outcomes through the local MBS Committee. The MBSAQIP currently has a strong sub- scription of over 700 programs.During this same time, the University of Michigan, in partnership with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan, led an effort to establish a statewide collaborative of bariatric surgery in the state of Michigan. While no formal accred-itation was established, over time almost all programs and surgeons in Michigan participated in data collection that were audited annually and 3 annual collaborative meetingsa year to share best practices. Analysis of the data by the University of Michigan staff provided feedback to the programs along with key ndings to improve safety and decrease cost [2]. This outstanding model of collaboration was recognized, adopted, and advanced within the new standards of the MBSAQIP. The rst national quality improvement project for MBSAQIP took place in Novem- ber 2013, and focused on decreasing readmissions. In January 2013, a letter was sent to CMS from John Birkmeyer, M.D., requesting reconsideration of whether accreditation should be required for providing MBS to Medicare recipients. The CMS, despite opposition fromevery surgical and medical society working with the obese and over 75% of MBS surgeons decided to drop the requirement for accreditation in September 2013 [3]. The question is not whether an outside payor or institution requires accreditation, but rather does accredita- tion have intrinsic value? Does it improve quality and lowercost? Does it establish a culture of safety and quality improvement? How does requiring accreditation affect access to care and effectiveness of care? Does accreditationprovide structure for new program development? Does accreditation facilitate gaining resources from the institution to care for the obese patient? Does the public know how tochoose a surgeon or program if accreditation is not available http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2014.01.012 1550-7289/ r2014 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.

The implementation of laparoscopy in the late 1990s revo-lutionized bariatric surgery. Between 1998 and 2003, there was exponentialgrowth in the number of bariatric operations being performed in the UnitedStates [1]. With reduction in the invasiveness of the operation, more patients were willing to undergo bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is now one of the most common gastrointestinal surgical procedures. During the early 2000s, there were questions regarding the safety of bariatric surgery [2].

All rights reserved.Advances in Surgery 49 (2015) 123-129 ADVANCES IN SURGERY third-party payers then initiated their own centers of excellence (COE) to improve the quality of care for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. A majorconsideration in the COE concept is the relationship between hospital case volume and outcomes. Multiple studies have reported lower morbidity and mortality associated with bariatric surgery when performed at high-volumecenters. Using the volume and outcome relationship in bariatric surgery asthe basis, the concept of bariatric surgery accreditation was rst developedby the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) andthe American College of Surgeons (ACS). This article reviews the relationshipbetween volume and outcomes in bariatric surgery, the history of bariatricsurgery accreditation, components of facility accreditation, and data regarding the value of accreditation. Relationship between volume and outcomes in bariatric surgery Bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is a complex operation performed in a high-risk patient population with many comorbid conditions. The complexity of the procedure and patient population lead investigators toevaluate for modiable and nonmodiable factors predictive of morbidityand mortality. One of these factors is the hospital or surgeon annual casevolume. The volume and outcome relationship is well known in severalhigh-risk, complex operations, such as esophagectomy, pancreatectomy,abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and coronary bypass grafting. The premisebehind the volume and outcome relationship is that patients treated at high- volume centers or by high-volume surgeons tend to have better outcomes than patients treated at low-volume hospitals [3]. Several studies have been published showing a relationship between hospital volume and outcomes in bariatric surgery [4-7] . In 2004, Nguyen and colleagues [5]reported that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed at hospitals with more than 100 cases annually is associated with a shorter length ofstay, lower morbidity and mortality, and decreased costs. In a comprehensivesystematic review of the literature published in 2012, Zevin and colleagues [7] analyzed 24 studies with a total of 458,032 bariatric patients and found a strong positive association between annual hospital volume and patient outcomes in14 of 17 studies. More recently, using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample(NIS) database, Jafari gastric bypass and laparoscopicsleeve gastrectomy) performed between 2006 and 2010 and compared theoutcomes between low-volume centers (centers performing <50 stapling bariat-ric cases per year) and high-volume centers (centers performing 50 or more stapling bariatric cases per year). They found that in the laparoscopic era, the in-hospital mortality rate was higher at low-volume (0.17%) thanat high-volume centers (0.07%). Multivariate analysis showed thatlow-volume centers higher rates of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95%condence interval, 1.3-4.8; P<.01) 1.1-1.4; P<.01).124 BLONDET, MORTON, & NGUYENIn contrast to hospital annual volume, other studies have shown a linear relationship between an annual surgeon's volume and outcomes in bariatricsurgery. In the Zevin and colleagues [7]systematic review, they found a strong positive association between annual surgeon volume and patient outcomes in 11 of 13 studies. In a study from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Sur-gery, Smith and colleagues [8]found that for every 10 cases per year increase in surgeon volume, the adjusted risk ratio for an adverse composite event (denedas venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, reoperation, nondischargeat 30 days, rehospitalization within 30 days, or death) decreased by 10%. HISTORY OF ACCREDITATION In 2004, the ASMBS initiated the COE concept to improve safety and qualityin bariatric surgery in response to the increasing number of bariatric surgeriesbeing performed in the United States. This initiative was followed by the cre-ation of the ACS Bariatric Surgery Center Network (BSCN) in 2005 [9].B o t h of these initiatives developed structure and processes that focused on estab- lishing an infrastructure to care for the morbidly obese that included a multi-disciplinary team, streamline standards of practice, a threshold of 125bariatric cases per year, experienced staff and surgeons, and establishing aprospective database for collection of pa tient-level data. In 2006, national bar- iatric accreditation was adopted by the Centers for Medicare and MedicaidServices (CMS) within the National Coverage Determination (NCD) in bar-iatric surgery. The CMS bariatric surgery decision mandated Medicare pa- tients to undergo bariatric surgery only at accredited centers, but this decision was later overturned in 2013. Bariatric facility accreditation alsobecame widely accepted and supported by insurance companies as the base-line for participation in their networks including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Op-tum, Aetna, and Cigna, to name a few. In 2012, the two national bariatricaccreditation programs (ASMBS-COE and ACS-BSCN) unied into a singleprogram: Surgery Accreditation and QualityImprovement Program (MBSAQIP). MBS AQIP focuses on providing stan- dards that allow for wider participation by new programs, provides well- dened data denitions and standardized collection methods consistent withthe ACS National Surgical Quality Imp rovement Program standards, insti- tuted 100% case reporting, and created a framework for local and regionalcollaboration to improve outcomes through the local institutional Metabolicand Bariatric Surgery Committees [10]. In September of 2013, CMS decided to drop the requirement for bariatric surgery accreditation largely because of concerns of limiting access to bariatric surgery [11]. Even before this decision was implemented, multiple publications in the literature have been trying to address the fundamental questionsregarding the value of accreditation: does accreditation improve quality, andlower morbidity, mortality, and costs? And does accreditation establish a cul-ture of safety and quality improvement? In contrast, a major argument againstaccreditation is the issue that requirement for bariatric surgery to only be125 HOSPITAL ACCREDITATION AND BARIATRIC SURGERYperformed at accredited centers may lead to an unintended consequence of impeding access to care. Components of accreditation The original ASMBS COE had a single level of accreditation with 10 criteria that included institutional commitment to in-service education, facility volumeof at least 125 cases per year, a designated bariatric medical director, fullconsultative staff and critical care services, full line of bariatric equipmentand instruments, qualied bariatric surgeons, standardized perioperative carepathways, designated nurse or physician extenders, availability of supportgroups, and a system for long-term follow-up and outcome reporting. The orig-inal ACS BSCN had two levels of accreditation. A level 1 bariatric surgery center performed at least 125 weight loss operations annually, with at least two experienced and credentialed bariatric surgeons capable of managing com-plex bariatric patients. A level 2 bariatric surgery center provided high-qualitycare with a lower volume of annual cases (a minimum of 25 per year) limited tolower-risk patients (ie, patients with lower body mass index) and no electiverevisional cases. In the current MBSAQIP accreditation there are four designa-tions: (1) comprehensive, (2) low acuity, (3) band center, and (4) adolescentcenter. Comprehensive center designation is the most common designation. This designation requires a facility to have a minimum of 50 stapling cases per year, a commitment to quality care, appropriate equipment and instru-ments, presence of critical care support, continuum of care and commitmentto long-term follow-up, data collection of 100% of cases, and a continuousquality improvement process. Currently there are more than 700 accreditedbariatric surgery centers in the United States and Canada [12]. Data regarding accreditation The advantages of participation in an accreditation program are the establish-ment of a uniform structure, processes of care, and collection of prospective data. Outcomes of individual centers can be compared with the national average and centers with outliers in morbidity or mortality can be identied,and feedback may result in interventions to improve outcomes. Many studieshave been published on the outcomes of bariatric surgery performed at ac-credited versus nonaccredited centers and also on the outcomes of bariatric sur-gery performed before versus after initiation of the Medicare NCD in 2006.Discussed next are relevant data supporting accreditation and data againstaccreditation. Data supporting accreditation Using the University Health Consortium database, Nguyen and colleagues [13] analyzed 35,284 bariatric operations and found that bariatric surgery per-formed at accredited centers was associated with shorter length of stay(mean difference, 0.3 days), lower mortality (0.06% accredited vs 0.21% nonac-credited), and lower cost (mean difference of $3758). Similarly, Kwon and col-leagues [14]used the national MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounter126 BLONDET, MORTON, & NGUYENDatabase to show that accredited centers had signicant reduction in inpatient mortality, 90-day reoperations, complications, [4]analyzed 277,760 laparoscopic stapling bariat- ric procedures and showed that high-volume centers (centers performing 50 or more stapling cases per year) that were also accredited COE had signicantlylower in-hospital mortality but higher rate of serious morbidity compared withnonaccredited centers. This combination of lower complications but highermortality at nonaccredited centers may suggest that patients experiencing com-plications at nonaccredited centers are more likely to die from their complica-tions. This may represent a concept previously described as ''failure to rescue.'' Recently, three more studies were published supporting the role of bariatric center accreditation. Morton and colleagues [15]used the 2010 NIS database and found that compared with accredited centers, nonaccredited centers hada higher mean length of stay (2.25 vs 1.99 days), higher total charges($51,189 vs $42,212), higher incidence of complications (12.3% vs 11.3%),higher mortality (0.13% vs 0.07%), and higher rate of ''failure to rescue''(0.97% vs 0.55%). Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis they identi-ed that nonaccredited status was a positive predictor for higher incidence ofcomplications and mortality. Another study from Young and colleagues [16] evaluated outcomes of 775,040 bariatric surgical patients performed over a 10-year period (2001-2010) using the NIS database. Compared with Medicarepatients who underwent bariatric surgery before the 2006 Medicare NCD,Medicare patients who underwent bariatric surgery after the NCD had a59% (statistically signicant) reduction of in-hospital mortality. They alsofound that since the 2006 NCD, access to bariatric surgery does not seem tobe an issue because the number of bariatric procedures performed in Medicarebeneciaries increased by 71%. They similarly found improvements in in- hospital mortality and serious morbidity when bariatric surgery was performed at accredited compared with nonaccredited centers. Lastly, Gebhart and col-leagues [17]reported that resources established for bariatric surgery accredita- tion may have the secondary benet of improving outcomes for morbidlyobese patients undergoing other general laparoscopic operations. Using theNIS database between 2008 and 2011, they analyzed 277,068 bariatric opera-tions. Multivariate at nonaccredited bariatric surgery centers had higher rates of serious complications compared with patients who underwent these opera-tions at accredited centers. Data against accreditation Three studies have been cited against bariatric surgery accreditation. The rststudy by Livingston [18]examined the 2005 NIS database and found no differ- ence in morbidity and mortality between the 24 COE versus the 229 non-COE. A major limitation of this study is the premature analysis of the effectof accreditation on outcomes because accreditation only started in 2004. By127 HOSPITAL ACCREDITATION AND BARIATRIC SURGERY2005, only a small number of centers had achieved accreditation (only 6% of the centers were COE in the study). The second study by Birkmeyer andcolleagues [19] compared 17 accredited with 8 nonaccredited centers in the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative (MBSC) and found no signicant difference in the rate of serious complications (2.7% accredited vs 2.0% nonac-credited). The main limitation of this study is that all hospitals in Michiganparticipating within the MBSC require an annual volume of 25 cases andparticipate in data submission and quality improvement efforts. Therefore,the nonaccredited centers within the MBSC have structure and processesthat are similar to that of accredited centers. Finally, Dimick and colleagues[20]compared the outcomes of Medicare beneciaries before versus after the NCD and used the non-Medicare population as a control. They found a signif- icant reduction of serious complication rates after the NCD for both Medicareand non-Medicare patients. When taking the trends in improvement of out-comes from the non-Medicare population into account, they concluded thatthere was no signicant difference in the rate of complications before versusafter the NCD. The non-Medicare population is a poor control group, how-ever, because the non-Medicare patient population was similarly exposed tothe accreditation process at around the same time period and improvement in outcomes in this population might be related to the initiation of accreditation by the ASMBS and ACS. Another limitation of this study was that mortalitywas not analyzed, even though mortality has been shown to be the most accu-rate end point within administrative data. SUMMARY National facility accreditation in bariatric surgery was rst implemented in2004 by the ASMBS and by the ACS in 2005. The two programs unied toa single program in 2012: the MBSAQIP. Accreditation in bariatric surgerysignies that the center has the infrastructure and equipment to care for themorbidly obese, has experienced and qualied staff and surgeons, has stan-dardized clinical pathways, and participates in 100% data reporting and qualityimprovement initiatives. Substantial data have shown that the presence of bariatric facility accreditation is associated with improved outcomes. Now that there are more than 700 accredited centers in the United States andCanada, accreditation of metabolic and bariatric surgery is here to stay.

Morton, MD, MPH,Trit Garg, BA,and Ninh Nguyen, MD Objective: To evaluate the impact of hospital accreditation upon bariatric surgery outcomes.Background: Since 2004, the American College of Surgeons and the Amer- ican Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery have accredited bariatrichospitals. Few studies have evaluated the impact of hospital accreditation onall bariatric surgery outcomes.Methods: Bariatric surgery hospitalizations were Classication of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9 ) codes in the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Hospital names and American HospitalAssociation (AHA) codes were used to identify accredited bariatric centers.Relevant ICD9 codes were used for identifying demographics, length of stay (LOS), total charges, mortality, complications, and failure to rescue (FTR)events.Results: There were 117,478 weighted bariatric patient discharges corre- sponding to 235 unique hospitals in the 2010 NIS data set. A total of 72,615(61.8%) weighted discharges, corresponding to 145 (61.7%) named or AHA-identiable hospitals were included. Among the 145 hospitals, 66 (45.5%)were unaccredited and 79 (54.5%) accredited. Compared with accredited cen-ters, unaccredited centers had a higher mean LOS (2.25 vs 1.99 days, P< 0.0001), as well as total charges ($51,189 vs $42,212, P<0.0001). Incidence of any complication was higher at unaccredited centers than at accreditedcenters (12.3% vs 11.3%, identied status as a positive predictor ofincidence of complication [odds ratio (OR) =1.08, P<0.0001], as well as mortality (OR =2.13, P=0.013). Conclusions and Relevance: Hospital accreditation status is associated with safer outcomes, shorter LOS, and lower total charges after bariatric surgery. Keywords: accreditation, bariatric, database, obesity, outcomes, quality, safety, surgery (Ann Surg 2014;260:504-509) Bariatric surgery has proven to be the most effective and endur- ing option in treating the morbidly obese.1,2Although mortality and other complications are risks associated with bariatric surgery,they have shown to be inversely correlated with the volume of casesperformed by the surgeon. 3-8Because of this demonstrated volume- outcome relationship, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) andthe American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS)initiated an accreditation process in 2004 whereby hospitals are desig-nated as Centers of Excellence (COE) if they perform a high volumeof bariatric surgery, dened as more than 125 cases per year, and areequipped with appropriate equipment, experienced surgeons, and amultidisciplinary team to care for patients. 9This policy of facility From theBariatric and Minimally Invasive (BMI) Surgery, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; and Gastrointestinal Surgery, University of Califor- nia, Irvine.

With 102,069 surgeries analyzed from over 8 years to show that accreditation status was associated with a signicant decreasein complications. 10Similarly, Nguyen et al11used the University Health Consortium database with 35,284 bariatric surgery patientsto demonstrate that accredited centers were associated with a signif-icant reduction in mortality, shorter length of stay (LOS), and lowercost. Finally, Kwon et al 12used the national MarketScan Commer- cial Claims and Encounter Database to show that accredited centershad signicant reductions in inpatient mortality, 90-day reoperations,complications, and readmissions. Most recently in 2013, Jafari et al 13used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data set to show that for laparoscopic of laparoscopic stapled proce-dures of greater than 50, that were also accredited had signicantlylower in-patient mortality, and also higher complications. This com-bination of higher complications but lower mortality for accreditedcenters may suggest that accredited centers are able to better iden-tify patients with complications and prevent mortality, and thus havea lower rate of failure to rescue (FTR). However, further researchis needed to specically assess differences in FTR between accred-ited and unaccredited centers. Three studies have againstaccreditation. 14-16However, the Livingston study predated accredi- tation and the Michigan study compared accredited versus nonac- credited hospitals in the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative where participation is predicated on criteria that are indistinguishablefrom national accreditation criteria. Finally, the Dimick study did notaddress mortality, FTR, and relied upon a little-used econometric an-alytic technique that utilized a non-Medicare population as a controlgroup for accreditation. The Dimick study did not account for the factthat the non-Medicare population was also exposed to private payoraccreditation also indistinguishable from Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services (CMS) accreditation. To our knowledge, no study has used the NIS data set to evaluate the impact of accreditation on outcomes after all 3 previous studies in-vestigating the impact of accreditation have analyzed mortality andcomplications, no study to our knowledge has investigated patientsafety indicators (PSIs), such as FTR, as developed by the Agencyfor Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). This study aimed touse the most contemporary NIS data set from 2010 to evaluate the im-pact of accreditation on outcomes after all types of bariatric surgery,including complications, mortality, and FTR.

Question source : Carl Ste vens, MD, OHP Medical Director with CareOregon Issue : Dr. Stevens requested that coverage for uncomplicated inguinal hernias in adults and for any type of umbilical or ventral hernia be reviewed. He feels that lack of coverage for uncomplicated hernias in adults limits many symptomatic patients and affects their ability to work. He feels that elective repair of hernias, especially in young patients with symptomatic abdominal wall hernias that limit their ability to work, would allow return to functional status. He also argues that such repair is the commun ity standard of care. The current guideline may result in undue morbidity and disability in members with symptomatic hernias. Historically, repair of uncomplicated hernias has not been covered as the complication rate with watchful waiting was felt to be very low. Hernia repair surgery is the most common elective surgery in the US. Coverage for repair of uncomplicated ventral and/or inguinal hernia has been discussed extensively at the H ealth Services Commission and HERC (see below). History : 1) In 1994, move uncomplicated hernias in children under age 18 to covered line due to significantly higher rate of complication if left untreated ( >30% in children vs <2% in adults). 2) 1998 biennial review considered moving uncomplicated hernias for patients over age 1 8 from the low uncovered line to a covered line. Noted that complicated/obstructed hernias had a death rate of 10% if untreated, and 0.5% if treated. No change was made with that review other than adding some surgical CPT codes missing from the covered line. 3) 2002 biennial review looked at coverage for uncomplicated hernia. In that review, ventral hernias were added to the lower, uncovered hernia line. 4) In 2005, ventral hernias were considered for addition to the upper hernia line, but not moved. Reducible umbilical hernias in children were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 5) In 2006, the current guideline was added to clarify when hernias were on the covered upper line. 6) In 2007, coverage for hernias in children were reviewed, and coverage maintained due to evidence of higher rates of complications for children. 7) In 2008, the guideline was clarified that all incarcerated hernias are on the upper line. Laparoscopic repair codes were added to the upper hernia line 8) In 2008, repair of large ventral hern ias was reviewed. The outcomes of repair of large ventral hernias, with our without mesh, was found to be poor. 9) In 2010, Dr. Gubler, a surgeon on the HOSC, recommended coverage of inguinal hernias, as femoral hernias were covered. He also felt that fat incarc eration rather than 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 2 intestinal incarceration, should be a covered indication for repair. No changes were made based on his recommendations. 10) In 2012, the ICD -10 general surgery review group proposed div iding the two hernia lines into 3 lines. The evidenc e supporting the safety of expectant management was discussed. Members decided to continue the current line structure for hernias. All ventral hernias were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 11) In 2014, ventral hernias were again discussed and the hernia g uideline modified to clarify coverage. 12) In 2015, ventral hernias were again discussed and lack of any coverage, even when incarcerated, was clarified again. Evidence Inguinal hernia, watchful waiting (WW) vs surgical repair 1) AHRQ 2012 , comparative effectiveness review of inguinal hernia repair a. For pain -free hernia, watchful waiting was compared to surgical repair b. Two studies met inclusion criteria. One compared WW with Lichtenstein repair, and the other compared WW with \"tension -free mesh repair\" (w hich might have been Lichtenstein repair). Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias for all outcomes reported. c. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: long - term QOL, which was reported as \"overall change in health status in previous 12 months\"; long -term pain; and acute hernia/ strangulation. The evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion for one outcome: long -term QOL, for which the results favored repair over WW. Estimated difference on a 0 -11 scale, 7 points (CI: 0.4 to 14.3) d. Evidence level was considered low 2) Fitzgibbons 2006 and 2013 , RCT of WW vs surgical repair a. N=720 men (364 watchful waiting, 356 surgical repair) b. At 4.5 years, p rimary intention -to-treat outcomes were similar at 2 years for watchful waiting vs surgical repair: pain limiting activities (5.1% vs 2.2%, respectively; P=.52); PCS (improvement over baseline, 0.29 points vs 0.13 points; P=.79). Twenty -three percent of pa tients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to receive surgical repair (increase in hernia -related pain was the most common reason offered); 17% assigned to receive repair crossed over to watchful waiting. Self -reported pain in watchful -waiting patien ts crossing over improved after repair. Occurrence of postoperative hernia -related complications was similar in patients who received repair as assigned and in watchful -waiting patients who crossed over. One watchful -waiting patient (0.3%) experienced acut e hernia incarceration without strangulation within 2 years; a second had acute incarceration with bowel obstruction at 4 years, with a frequency of 1.8/1000 patient -years inclusive of pat ients followed up for as long as 4.5 years. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 3 c. After 11.5 years, the es timated cumulativ e cross over rates using Kaplan -Meier analysis was 68%. Men older than 65 years crossed over at a considerably higher rate than younger men (79% vs 62%). The most common reason for cross over was pain (54.1%).A total of 3 patients have required an emergency operation, but there has been no mortality. d. Conclusions Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe because acute hernia incarc erations occur rarely. The later study added that patients should be counseled that symptoms will likely progress and an operation will eventually be needed. 3) Chung 2010, RCT of WW vs surgical repair a. N=160 mean , with painless inguinal hernia (80 surgery, 8 0 WW) b. Mean follow -up of 7.5 years i. 42 men had died (19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group) ii. 46 of the 80 men randomized to observation had conversion to operation. iii. The estimated conversion rate (using the Kaplan -Meier method) for the observation group was 16 (95 per cent confidence interval 9 to 26) per cent at 1 year, 54 (42 to 66) per cent 5 years and 72 (59 to 84) per cent at 7.5 years. The main reason for conversion was pain in 33 men, and two presented with an acute hernia. Sixtee n men developed a new primary contralateral inguinal hernia and three had recurrent hernias. iv. Conclusion: Most patients with a painless inguinal hernia develop symptoms over time. Surgical repair is recommended for medically fit patients with a painless in guinal hernia. 4) Mizrahi 2012 , systematic review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernia a. N=41 articles b. No significant difference in pain scores and general health status were found when comparing the patients who were followed up with the patients who had surgery. A significant crossover ratio ranging between 23% and 72% from watchful waiting to surgery was found. In patients with watchful waiting, the rates of IH strangulation were 0.27% after 2 years of follow -up and 0.55% after 4 years of follow -up. In p atients who underwent elective surgery, the range of operative complications was 0% to 22.3% and the recurrence rate was 2.1%. c. Conclusion: Both treatment options for asymptomatic IH are safe, but most patients will develop symptoms (mainly pain) over time and will require operation. 5) Hwang 2014 , retrospective cohort study in NHS of WW vs sur gery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. NHS instituted a nationwide policy of WW for asymptomatic inguinal hernias in 2010 b. A total of 1,032 patients undergoing inguinal her nia repair in the 16 months after the policy change were compared with 978 patients in the 16 months before. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 4 c. RESULTS The period after the policy change was associated with 59% higher odds of emergency repair (3.6% vs 5.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 -2.47). In turn, emergency repair was associated with higher odds of adverse events (4.7% vs 18.5%, Fisher's exact test). d. CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a watchful waiting policy for asymptomatic inguinal hernias was associated with a significant increase in need for emergency repair, which was in turn associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Current policies may be placing patients at risk . 6) Van den Heuval 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. The risk of incarceration is approximately 4 per 1,000 patients with a groin hernia per year. Risk factors for incarceration are age above 60 years, femoral hernia site and dur ation of signs less than 3 months. b. The recurrence rate after tension -free mesh repair in the management of emergency groin hernias is comparable to that of elective repair. c. There is no divergence in pain and quality of life after elective repair compared to watchful waiting. There is no advantage in cost -effectiveness of elective repair compared to watchful waiting. d. Conclusion Watchful waiting for asymptomatic groin hernias is a safe and cost - effective modality in patients who are under 50 years old, have an ASA class of 1 or 2, an inguinal hernia, and a duration of signs of more than 3 months . 1) INCA 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernias for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic inguinal hernia a. Mortality associated with elective hernia repair was investigated as a primary outcomes measure in 11 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 65. Mean mortality associated with elective hernia repair was 0.2% (range 0% to 1.8%) b. Mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was investigated as a pr imary outcomes measure in 13 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 7. Mean mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was 4.0% (range 0% to 22.2%) c. Rate of incarceration and/or strangulation has been investigated by 4 retrospective cohort stud ies as primary outcomes and 2 randomized trials as secondary outcomes. The yearly rate of irreducibility associated with a nonoperative approach was 0.4% (range 0.2% to 2.7%) d. The crossover from watchful waiting to operation has been reported by 2 randomize d trials. Combining these figures, 13% (range 8.0% to 19.5%) of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic inguinal hernia patients assigned to watchful waiting management will cross over for inguinal hernia repair. e. A meta -analysis of long -term follow -up studies co ncerning recurrence is reported by inguinal hernia guideline of the European Hernia Society.Data of all trials with a follow -up of >48 months were reported comparing recurrences after Lichtenstein and endoscopic repair. We converted the observed probabilit ies of recurrence into annual rates, assuming a constant rate of recurrence. Because 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 5 no substantial difference in recurrence rate between the Lichtenstein technique and endoscopic repair was reported, we calculated a mean yearly recurrence rate of 0.9% (ra nge 0.2% to 4.0%). f. Conclusions: the available data suggest that life expectancy for elderly male inguinal hernia patients associated with watchful waiting or operation differs very little. Therefore, the general doubt about operating on mild symptomatic and asymptomatic elderly hernia patients, illustrated by 2 recent randomized trials investigating pre and postoperative pain for these types of management, is justified. In case of asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients, there seems to be no difference i n pain relief between watchful waiting and operation. Ventral hernia repair, watchful waiting vs surgical repair 1) Bellows 2014 , longitudinal cohort study of WW a. N=41 patients i. 11 patients lost to follow up, 7 died of other causes b. 24 patients followed for 2 years i. 1 had incarceration ii. There was no deterioration in the AAS score (baseline vs 24 months 5 28 vs 25, P 5 0.60). There was deterioration of the physical functioning dimension of the SF -36 (baseline vs 24 months 5 40 vs 32, P \\0.01), but the mental func tioning dimension was improved (45 vs 51; P 5 0.01). c. Conclusions: Watchful waiting was a safe option for patients in this study with ventral hernias. 2) Stey 2014 , cohort study of WW vs surgical repair a. N=243 patients i. 80 were observed, 69 underwent repair of an incarcerated hernia, and 94 underwent repair of a nonincarcerated hernia. b. Quality of life as measured by utility score was less at 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 -0.71) in patients who did not undergo repair compared with th ose after repair of a nonincarcerated hernia, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73 of a nonincarcerated hernia was cost -effective with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,646 per quality -adjusted lifeyear. c. Conclusion. The prompt elective repair of ventral hernias is cost -effective. 2018 Biennial Revie w Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 6 HERC staff summary ; Based on two large RCTs as well as several meta -analyses, there appears to be a low r ate of progression of inguinal hernia to incarceration or obstruction. When obstruction or incarceration does occur, the complication rate for emergency surgery compared to elective repair appears to be similar. It is important to note that these studies were all done in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, and patients who develope d pain were no longer followed by watchful waiting. In several large studies, the rate of eventual surgical repair, mainly due to the development of pain, was very high. The AHRQ report found that quality of life was significantly improved with surgical r epair. Repair of inguinal hernia was not generally associated with improved function, but the functional measures may have been skewed by the repair of painful hernias . One cost study found no cost -effectiveness advantage in elective repair compared to watchful waiting. Based on several small studies, watchful waiting for ventral hernia appears to be a safe strategy that did not affect disability or quality of life. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Discuss what outcomes would lead to consideration for reprioritization of inguinal hernia repair a. Traditionally have only covered repair for children (higher risk of incarceration or other complication), and adu lts with obstruction, gangrene or otherwise complicated . Evidence still shows that watchful waiting is safe and that emergent repair has little increase in surgical complication compared to elective repair b. Does quality of life, pain, or function constitute an outcome which should lead to consideration for coverage? 2) Make no change in the current non -coverage of repair for ventral hernia a. Good evidence for lack of benefit for repair b. See separate issue for minor guideline clarification 1 Comparative Effectiveness Review Number 70 Surgical Options for Inguinal Hernia: Comparative Effectiveness Review Executive Summary Background An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents into the inguinal canal through an abdominal wall defect. The lifetime rate of inguinal hernia is 25 percent in males and 2 percent in females.1 The risk of inguinal hernia increases with age, and the annual incidence is about 50 percent in males by the age of 75 years.2 Approximately 10 percent of cases are bilateral.3 In children, the incidence ranges from 0.8 to 4.4 percent.4 It is 10 times as common in boys as in girls and also more common in infants born before 32 weeks' gestation (13-percent prevalence) and in infants weighing less than 1,000 grams at birth (30-percent prevalence).4 Surgical repair of hernias is the most commonly performed general surgical procedure in the United States.5 In 2003, U.S. surgeons performed an estimated 770,000 surgical repairs5 of inguinal hernia. (Note, however, that a more recent study, presently in press, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 600,000 and asserts that approximately 42 percent of males will develop an inguinal hernia in their lifetime.6) These repairs are typically performed on an outpatient basis (87 percent in 1996).5 Effective Health Care Program The Effective Health Care Program was initiated in 2005 to provide valid evidence about the comparative effectiveness of different medical interventions. The object is to help consumers, health care providers, and others in making informed choices among treatment alternatives. Through its Comparative Effectiveness Reviews, the program supports systematic appraisals of existing scientific evidence regarding treatments for high-priority health conditions. It also promotes and generates new scientific evidence by identifying gaps in existing scientific evidence and supporting new research. The program puts special emphasis on translating findings into a variety of useful formats for different stakeholders, including consumers. The full report and this summary are available at www.effectivehealthcare. ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm . Such a large volume of procedures suggests that even modest improvements in patient outcomes would have a substantial impact on population health.7 Effective Health CareEffective Health Care Program2 The primary goals of surgery include preventing strangulation, repairing the hernia, minimizing the chance of recurrence, returning the patient to normal activities quickly, and minimizing postsurgical discomfort and the adverse effects of surgery. The various surgeries include a constellation of benefits and risks, which presents some clinical uncertainty in the choice between approaches. Recurrence occurs in approximately 1 to 5 percent of cases.8 Balancing all the factors (e.g., recurrence, adverse events, time to return to work [RTW]) is a difficult yet critical process in making the best possible medical decisions. Surgical procedures for inguinal hernia repair generally fall into three categories: open repair without the use of a mesh implant (i.e., sutured), open repair with a mesh, and laparoscopic repair with a mesh. Within each of these categories, several specific procedures have been employed. Until the 1980s, open suture repair was the standard; however, the resulting tension along the suture line yielded relatively high rates of recurrence and patient discomfort. Nonsutured \"tension-free\" surgical mesh has gained in popularity, and many specific open procedures are used. One author estimates that in 2003, 93 percent of groin hernia repairs involved the use of a mesh, and of these, about three-fourths involved either a Lichtenstein repair or mesh plug.5 In the Lichtenstein procedure, surgeons suture the mesh in front of the hernia defect. Mesh plug repair involves a preshaped mesh plug that surgeons introduce into the hernia weakness during open surgery; they then position a piece of flat mesh on top of the hernia defect. The near-universal adoption of mesh means that the most important questions about hernia repair involve various mesh procedures. In terms of setting, most hernia surgeries are performed not in specialized hernia centers but by general surgeons who also perform many other types of surgeries.9 The laparoscopic surgical repair of inguinal hernia is generally recognized as a highly specialized skill, and patients receiving care from more experienced surgeons may fare better than patients receiving care from less experienced surgeons. This review specifically examines evidence on the association between laparoscopic surgical experience and hernia recurrence (See Key Questions below). The most commonly performed laparoscopic repair procedures are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair. During TAPP repair, surgeons enter the peritoneal cavity to place a mesh through an incision over the hernia site. With TEP surgery, surgeons do not enter the peritoneal cavity but use a mesh to cover the hernia from outside the peritoneum.Given the clinical uncertainty, a systematic review of the existing evidence on comparative effectiveness will help inform important medical decisions about surgical options for inguinal hernia. The findings of the review may affect clinical decisions by patients and surgeons, treatment recommendations by professional societies, purchasing decisions by hospitals, and coverage decisions by payers. Objectives We sought to thoroughly summarize the evidence pertaining to nine Key Questions (listed below and presented graphically in Figure A): Among adults with pain-free primary inguinal hernias: Key Question 1. Does hernia repair differ from watchful waiting in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Among adults with painful inguinal hernias without incarceration/strangulation: Key Question 2. Does open hernia repair with a mesh differ from laparoscopic hernia repair with a mesh in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? a. For primary hernias? b. For bilateral hernias? c. For recurrent hernias? Key Question 3. Do different open mesh-based repair procedures (e.g., Lichtenstein repair, mesh plug) differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 4. Do different laparoscopic mesh-based repair procedures (e.g., transabdominal preperitoneal repair, totally extraperitoneal repair) differ in patient- oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 5. Do different mesh products differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 6. Do different mesh-fixation methods (e.g., no fixation, sutures, glue) differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 7. For each type of laparoscopic mesh repair, what is the association between surgical experience and hernia recurrence? Among pediatric patients (age 21 years or younger): Key Question 8. For a possible contralateral hernia, does same-operation repair/exploration differ from watchful 3waiting in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 9. Does open hernia repair without a mesh differ from laparoscopic hernia repair without a mesh in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Methods We developed and refined the topic in late 2010 in collaboration with five Key Informants: two hernia surgeons, two individuals from payer organizations, and one individual from a mesh manufacturer. The Key Questions were posted on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Web site for public comments for 1 month. We finalized the review protocol in spring 2011 based on input from the public comment period and four Technical Experts (three hernia surgeons and a product specialist from a mesh manufacturer).Information professionals in the Evidence-based Practice Center Information Center performed literature searches and followed established guidelines and procedures as identified by the Director of Health Technology Assessment/Evidence-based Practice Center Information Center. We searched MEDLINE\u00ae and PreMEDLINE; Embase; the Cochrane Library, including the Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Methodology Reviews, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment Database; and the United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. The searchers applied no limits on language, and search dates were January 1, 1990, to November 17, 2011. For inclusion in the review, we selected only full articles published in English.

Analytic framework Note: Circled numbers are Key Questions.4 have either randomly assigned patients to treatments or used an analytic method to address selection bias, such as intentional baseline matching on multiple characteristics, propensity scoring, or other analytic approach. Studies could be prospective or retrospective, but retrospective studies must have used consecutive enrollment (or enrollment of a random sample of eligible participants). The treatments being compared must have been administered during the same time period, so any observed difference between treatment outcomes were not attributable to differences in other aspects of care during different timeframes. For a study to be included for a given Key Question, at least 85 percent of its patients must have had the condition specified in the Key Question. The study must have reported data on at least one of the included outcomes for at least one of the Key Questions; outcome data must not have relied on retrospective recall; data must have included at least 6 months' followup for hernia recurrence, quality of life (QOL), and patient satisfaction (SFN); and data must have been reported on at least 10 patients with the condition of interest, who represented at least 50 percent of enrolled patients. From each included study, we extracted all important information. This included author, publication year, country, study design, number of centers, dates of patient enrollment, type of setting, length of followup, funding source, which Key Question(s) the study addressed, all authors' reported patient enrollment criteria, specific procedure, specific mesh (if applicable), fixation method (if applicable), number of surgeons, surgeons' length of experience with the repair procedures performed, surgical setting (i.e., specialized hernia center, general surgery), type of anesthesia, methods of followup for data collection, and all reported baseline characteristics. We also extracted the numerical data needed to compute an effect size (such as an odds ratio [OR] or standardized mean difference) and its standard error for all included outcomes for each study. We assessed the risk of bias (i.e., internal validity) separately for each outcome and each time point of each study using 15 risk-of-bias items, such as randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessors, and whether the surgeons had similar experience performing the study procedures. Some studies involved one surgeon performing different procedures, whereas other studies assigned surgeons to procedures. Based on these items, each data point from each study was assigned a risk-of-bias category of low, moderate, or high. This assessment was performed in duplicate, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Within each treatment comparison, we examined all included outcomes from all relevant studies. The outcomes were divided into the following eight categories: hernia recurrence; hospital-related information, including the length of hospital stay and subsequent hospital/office visits; the time to return to daily activities (RTDA); the time to RTW; QOL; patient SFN; pain, including visual analog scale scores and the rates of chronic pain; and other adverse events not involving pain. We performed meta-analysis if appropriate and possible. This decision depended on the judged clinical homogeneity of the different study populations, cointerventions, and outcomes, as well as whether studies reported the outcome in the same way. In the choice of effect size metrics, for hernia recurrence we used the relative risk (RR) because of its ease of interpretation and because some studies reported only an adjusted RR. Thus, only a relative-risk meta-analysis for hernia recurrence would include all the studies. For all continuous outcomes, we used the weighted mean difference, which is on the same scale as the measured outcome. For adverse events and pain reported dichotomously, we analyzed ORs. To aid interpretation, for each outcome in the review, we estimated the smallest difference between groups that could still be considered clinically significant (minimum clinically significant difference). For example, for the outcome of hernia recurrence, we defined the minimum clinically significant difference as 3 percentage points (e.g., 1 percent vs. 4 percent for two separate treatments). This definition aids interpretation in two main ways: (1) determining whether a statistically significant difference is important and (2) determining whether a statistically nonsignificant difference is small enough to exclude the possibility of an important difference. Our estimates were based on published literature, guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, input from the Technical Expert Panel, and the consensus of the research team. If meta-analysis was deemed appropriate and possible for a given comparison and a given outcome, we performed DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analysis using comprehensive meta-analysis software (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ). To measure heterogeneity, we used both I2 and tau. If there was substantial heterogeneity and 10 or more studies of the same patient outcome of the same treatment comparison were available, we conducted meta-regressions using a variety of predictors (e.g., whether the study used concealment of allocation).5For major comparisons and outcomes, we rated the strength of evidence using the Evidence-based Practice Center system described by Owens and colleagues.10 This system includes four core domains (risk of bias, consistency, precision, and directness) as well as four optional domains (large magnitude of effect, all plausible confounders would reduce the effect, publication bias, and dose-response association). The directness domain does not encompass applicability, which is considered outside the evidence rating system. The various domains were considered together using transparent rules to rate the evidence for the outcome as high, moderate, low, or insufficient. We performed strength-of-evidence rating for all Key Questions except Key Question 7, which did not involve comparing treatments but rather an assessment of the relationship between surgical experience and hernia recurrence. To assess applicability, we first abstracted data from each included study on factors that may affect the study's applicability. Using the PICOTS (populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting) approach as a guide, we primarily focused on the three categories most relevant to inguinal hernia repair: Population\u2014demographic characteristics, comorbidity or general physical fitness, and types of hernia Intervention and comparators\u2014inguinal repair procedure being compared, timeframes of the procedure being performed, cointerventions, and experience of the surgical team Setting\u2014geographic and clinical factors Based on a review of the data abstracted, we narratively summarized any patterns reflected from these factors that might affect the applicability of the evidence. We made no attempt to generate any rating or score for the applicability of the evidence. Our narrative summaries are intended to draw stakeholders' attention to potential applicability issues embedded in the evidence. Results Searches identified 2,722 potentially relevant articles, and we excluded 1,878 of these at the abstract level (Figure B). We excluded another 621 articles at the full-article level, typically because of irrelevance to our Key Questions (252 publications), background/review/ commentary/protocol articles (80 publications), case- series design (81 publications), or nonrandomized designs with no control for selection bias (79 publications). The remaining 223 publications described 151 unique studies that we included in our review. The largest number of studies addressed Key Question 2a (38 studies), which compared open mesh repair with laparoscopic mesh repair in patients with primary inguinal hernia. We found other large evidence bases for Key Question 3 (comparing different procedures for open mesh repair, 21 studies), Key Question 5 (comparing meshes, 32 studies), Key Question 6 (comparing fixation methods, 23 studies), and Key Question 7 (the association between laparoscopic hernia repair experience and hernia recurrence, 32 studies). We included no studies for Key Question 8 (comparing surgical exploration vs. watchful waiting [WW] for pediatric contralateral inguinal hernia). We included 17 studies for multiple Key Questions (e.g., two studies were each included for four Key Questions) because they included three or more groups or reported subgroup analyses. Our synthesis of results included quantitative meta- analysis for seven of the Key Questions (2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, and 6). We conducted these analyses only where reasonable and appropriate (i.e., similar patients, comparisons, outcomes). Meta-analyses allowed us to extract greater statistical power from the evidence. Key Question 1 (Repair Vs. Watchful Waiting for Pain-Free Hernia) Two studies met inclusion criteria. One compared WW with Lichtenstein repair, and the other compared WW with \"tension-free mesh repair\" (which might have been Lichtenstein repair). Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias for all outcomes reported. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: long-term QOL, which was reported as \"overall change in health status in previous 12 months\"; long-term pain; and acute hernia/ strangulation. The evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion for one outcome: long-term QOL, for which the results favored repair over WW. Key Question 2a (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Primary Hernia) Thirty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. The most commonly compared specific surgical procedures were TAPP repair versus Lichtenstein (14 studies), TEP repair versus Lichtenstein (14 studies), TAPP repair versus mesh plug (3 studies), TEP repair versus mesh plug (3 studies), and TAPP repair/TEP repair versus Lichtenstein (4 studies). All but two studies (which were registry studies) were considered to have moderate risk of bias. 6 560: Not English language 516: Case series375: Did not address any Key Question 191: Background, commentary, protocol, guideline, or review44: Incarcerated or strangulated hernia43: Did not focus sufficiently on a patientpopulation of interest 6: Nonrandomized study that did not attempt to control for selection bias4: Exact duplicate of other included article 1: Abstract only 138: Other2,722 articles identified Abstracts reviewed Full articles reviewed1,878 articles excluded: 252: Did not address any Key Question 81: Case series 80: Background, commentary, protocol, guideline, or review79: Nonrandomized study that did not attempt tocontrol for selection bias18: Abstract only12: Did not attempt any outcomes of interest11: Did not focus sufficiently on a patientpopulation of interest8: Did not report data comparing the procedures1: Not English language1: Exact duplicate of other included article78: Other621 articles ecluded: Included 223 articles, describing 151 unique studies a KQ 1 (pain-free hernia): 2 studiesKQ 2a (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in primary hernia): 38 studiesKQ 2b (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in bilateral hernia): 6 studiesKQ 2c (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in recurrent hernia): 8 studiesKQ 3 (open mesh vs. open mesh): 21 studies KQ 4 (lap. mesh vs. lap. mesh): 11 studies KQ 5 (comparing meshes): 32 studiesKQ 6 (comparing mesh fixation methods): 23 studiesKQ 7 (surgical experience and hernia recurrence): 32 studiesKQ 8 (pediatric contralateral exploration vs. watchful waiting): 0 studiesKQ 9 (pediatric vs. open flap): 2 studiesFigure B. Literature flow diagram aThe counts for Key Questions add to more than the number of included studies because some studies were included for multiple Key Questions.7For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, RTW, QOL, SFN, long-term pain, injury, small-bowel obstruction, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. The evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: Results favored laparoscopy for five outcomes (RTDA, RTW, long-term pain, hematoma, and wound infection). Results favored open surgery for two outcomes (hernia recurrence and epigastric vessel injury). Results indicated approximate equivalence for one outcome (length of stay). Key Question 2b (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Bilateral Hernia) Six studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared TEP repair with the Stoppa procedure, two compared TAPP repair with Lichtenstein repair, and a Danish registry compared either TAPP repair or TEP repair with Lichtenstein procedure (authors combined data on TAPP repair and TEP repair procedures). We considered all but one study (which was the registry study) to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 2a. The only outcome for which evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion was RTW: patients with bilateral hernias returned to work sooner if they received laparoscopic repair. Key Question 2c (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Recurrent Hernia) Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The open mesh procedure was the Lichtenstein repair in six studies and the Stoppa procedure in the other two studies. For the laparoscopic mesh procedure, two studies reported results of TAPP repair; two reported on TEP repair; in one other study, investigators performed both and reported data separately; and in the final three, the investigators performed both TAPP repair and TEP repair and combined the data. All but two studies (which were registry studies) were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 2a. The evidence favored laparoscopic repair over open repair for hernia recurrence (lower rates after laparoscopy), return to daily activities (faster after laparoscopy), and long-term pain (lower rates after laparoscopy). Key Question 3 (Comparing Different Types of Open Mesh Repair) Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered the following comparisons to be major: Lichtenstein repair versus mesh plug (seven studies), Lichtenstein versus Prolene Hernia System (PHS) (five studies), Lichtenstein versus open preperitoneal mesh (three studies), mesh plug versus PHS (two studies), and Lichtenstein versus Kugel\u00ae patch (two studies). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias; a registry study was considered to have high risk of bias. For each comparison, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, return to work, short-term pain, intermediate- term pain, seroma, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. Evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: For Lichtenstein repair compared with mesh plug technique, recurrence rates were similar, but Lichtenstein yielded better results for RTW and rates of seroma. For Lichtenstein compared with PHS, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For Lichtenstein compared with open preperitoneal mesh, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For mesh plug compared with PHS, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For Lichtenstein versus Kugel mesh, outcomes were similar for both short-term pain and intermediate-term pain. Key Question 4 (Comparing Different Types of Laparoscopic Mesh Repair) Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered only the comparison of TAPP repair versus TEP repair to be major (nine studies). The remaining two studies compared different variant types of TEP repair (one study) or TAPP repair versus intraperitoneal onlay mesh (one study). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias.8 For the studies that compared TAPP repair versus TEP repair, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, RTW, short-term pain, intermediate-term pain, long- term pain, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. Evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: For TAPP repair compared with TEP repair, TAPP resulted in quicker RTW, and data on short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term pain suggested equivalence. Key Question 5 (Comparing Meshes) Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered the following seven comparisons to be major: standard polypropylene (PP) versus low- weight PP (6 studies), standard PP versus combination materials (17 studies), standard PP versus coated PP (6 studies), standard PP versus three-dimensional PHS (2 studies), standard PP versus porcine (2 studies), combination materials versus porcine (1 study), and low-weight PP versus combination materials (3 studies). Most evidence was considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered the following seven outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, QOL, patient SFN, long-term pain, feeling of a foreign body, infection, and bleeding. Standard PP mesh and combination materials had similar rates of recurrence. Three types of meshes (standard PP, low-weight PP, and porcine) had approximately equivalent rates of long-term pain. Key Question 6 (Comparing Fixation Approaches) Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered five comparisons to be major: tacks or staples versus no fixation (seven studies), fibrin glue versus staples (three studies), sutures versus tacks (three studies), sutures versus glue (seven studies), and absorbable sutures (short or long term) versus nonabsorbable sutures (one study). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 5. We found approximate equivalence in recurrence rates for tacks or staples versus no fixation and sutures versus glue. Also, for long-term pain, we found approximate equivalence between sutures and glue, but less pain with fibrin glue than staple fixation. Key Question 7 (Surgical Experience and Hernia Recurrence) Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Sixteen involved only TEP repair, 12 involved only TAPP repair, 1 reported separate data on TEP repair and TAPP repair, and 3 provided combined data on TAPP repair and TEP repair. Most studies failed to report data that factored out the length of followup; patients treated earlier in the series might have had higher recurrence rates simply because they were followed longer. Some studies reported changing important procedural aspects over time, such as the size of the mesh (which typically involved using larger meshes in later time periods), making it difficult to pinpoint the true impact of expertise. Among studies comparing an early set with later set(s) of repairs, the size of the early set varied from a low of 10 repairs to a high of 825 repairs. It was unclear how authors chose their cutoff points. The reporting differences mean that one cannot use the data to estimate the length of the learning curve for TEP repair or TAPP repair. Most studies reported results in the expected direction: lower recurrence rates with increased experience. This was also true when examined more specifically for TEP repair (11 of 17 studies) and TAPP repair (11 of 13 studies). Key Question 8 (Exploration Vs. WW for Pediatric Hernia) No studies met inclusion criteria. Key Question 9 (Open Vs. Laparoscopic for Pediatric Hernia) Two studies met our inclusion criteria. One study enrolled patients aged 4 months to 16 years; the other study enrolled patients aged 3 months to 9 years. Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, and patient/parent SFN. The evidence was sufficient to permit the conclusions that length of stay, long-term patient SFN, and long-term cosmesis favored laparoscopy, and RTDA data suggested equivalence.

Discussion The typical adult in the included studies was a man in his mid-50s, of average weight, experiencing a primary unilateral hernia. About a quarter of the men worked in physically strenuous jobs; for these men, a durable repair is relatively important to prevent recurrence. Our review can inform numerous treatment decisions faced by these men and their providers, including: Whether to undergo surgery or wait Whether to choose open surgery or laparoscopic surgery Which type of open surgery to choose Which type of laparoscopic surgery to choose Which type of mesh and fixation approach to choose Consideration of expertise with laparoscopic hernia repair The evidence-based conclusions listed in the previous section are applicable only to the types of patients enrolled in the studies underlying those conclusions. For example, for Key Questions 2 to 7, a large majority of enrolled patients were middle-aged men; therefore, how well the conclusions apply to women or to men of other ages is uncertain. Similarly, for Key Question 9 on pediatric hernia, open versus laparoscopic high ligation, both studies excluded cases less than 3 months old, so it is uncertain whether the conclusions apply to patients younger than 3 months old. One limitation of this review is that we included only studies published in English. In an attempt to address this 10 Table A.

Another limitation of this review is that for many outcomes, the evidence was inconclusive because of low precision. Generally, the included studies were well conducted but small. We maximized the power of the data by conducting meta-analyses wherever appropriate and possible. Nevertheless, the data often precluded conclusions because they suggested contradictory conclusions (i.e., the evidence could favor option A or B by a clinically significant amount). A third limitation is that no studies met our inclusion criteria for Key Question 8 on pediatric contralateral hernia: no studies have compared surgical exploration with WW in this population. Therefore, we informally described some of the existing research in this area, such as the percentage of pediatric patients with a unilateral inguinal hernia who have a contralateral patent processus vaginalis (which is a risk factor for inguinal hernia). Future Research Needs We identified several gaps in the evidence in the course of conducting this review. We discuss potential areas for future research in greater detail in the full report but highlight some here that we consider particularly important. For adult inguinal hernia, it would be helpful to know recurrence rates over the very long term. The typical patient was middle-aged, presumably with a few decades of life ahead in which a hernia might recur. Studies have generally not reported recurrence rates past 5 to 10 years, but conceivably patients and clinicians would be interested in much longer timeframes (e.g., 30 years). Projection factors have been proposed (e.g., to estimate the 25-year recurrence rates, multiply the 1-year rate by 5); however, they have not been tested empirically. We also encourage greater focus on outcomes that matter most to patients, such as chronic pain, long-term QOL, SFN, and the feeling of a foreign body. These outcomes may be associated with the type of mesh or mesh fixation methods, or size and severity of the hernia, but our evidence review neither revealed nor ruled out potential influencing factors because of low precision. To characterize the gaps in the overall review, we examined the 87 comparisons and outcomes for which the evidence was insufficient to permit a conclusion and determined the primary reasons for the rating of insufficient. In 31/87 cases (36 percent), the only component preventing a conclusion was imprecision. Thus, quite often, there were simply not enough studies and/or the studies had insufficient patient enrollment. In a further 51/87 cases (60 percent), there was a problem with consistency as well as precision. Problems with consistency involved either the existence of only a single study (and therefore the inability to assess consistency) or conflicting results among multiple studies. In the remaining four cases, precision was sufficient, yet there were problems with both consistency and selective outcome reporting. Much of the existing literature on inguinal hernia has been conducted outside the United States. The differences in health care systems and practice patterns between the United States and other countries might have an impact on the applicability of the evidence from the perspectives Table A.

Future U.S. studies could elucidate issues unique to the United States and describe any important differences from other health care settings. While a surgical registry could be useful for this purpose, existing registries are limited in part because of their voluntary nature. A large registry could address the widespread problem of imprecision, mentioned above. Many randomized trials have investigated important questions, but their modest size limits their ability to detect rare events, such as hernia recurrence, which require much larger sample sizes to permit clear inferences. Registry data require sophisticated analytic techniques, such as propensity scores or instrumental variables, to reduce the impact of confounding resulting from selection bias. The registries that we assessed (e.g., Swedish Hernia Registry) were large (e.g., 143,000 hernias), but authors did not use these techniques, so it was difficult to determine the potential impact of selection bias. Specific recommendations for future research addressing the Key Questions appear in the full report, but we highlight some of them here. For Key Question 1, there were no studies of laparoscopic repair versus watchful waiting for pain-free hernia. Furthermore, the available comparative studies in the adult population did not report long-term outcomes that could be useful for decisionmaking, such as the risk of an eventual acute presentation (e.g., strangulation, incarceration) in an unrepaired pain-free hernia, the likelihood of recurrence for a repaired pain-free hernia, or the likelihood of developing pain or impairment in function in the long term with either repair or watchful waiting. In addition, there were no studies comparing surgical repair with watchful waiting in the pediatric population (Key Question 8). In the studies comparing mesh products and fixation methods, several important outcomes were infrequently reported, such as recurrence rates, perception of a foreign body, and long-term pain and infection rates.

O. Gibbs, PhD,and Domenic J. Reda, PhD ;Investigators of the Original Trial Objective: To assess the long-term crossover (CO) rate in men undergoing watchful waiting (WW) as a primary treatment strategy for their asymptomaticor minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias.Background: With an average follow-up of 3.2 years, a randomized con- trolled trial comparing WW with routine repair for male patients with min-imally symptomatic inguinal hernias led investigators to conclude that WWwas an acceptable option [ JAMA . 2006;295(3):285-292]. We now analyze patients in the WW group after an additional 7 years of follow-up.Methods: At the conclusion of the original study, 254 men who had been assigned to WW consented to longer-term follow-up. These patients werecontacted yearly by mail questionnaire. Nonresponders were contacted byphone or e-mail for additional data collection.Results: Eighty-one of the 254 men (31.9%) crossed over to surgical repair before the end of the original study, December 31, 2004, with a median follow-up of 3.2 (range: 2-4.5) years. The patients have now been followed for anadditional 7 years with a maximum follow-up of 11.5 years. The estimatedcumulative CO rates using Kaplan-Meier analysis was 68%. Men older than65 years crossed over at a considerably higher rate than younger men (79% vs62%). The most common reason for CO was pain (54.1%). A total of 3 patientshave required an emergency operation, but there has been no mortality.Conclusions: Men who present to their physicians because of an inguinal hernia even when minimally symptomatic should be counseled that althoughWW is a reasonable and safe strategy, symptoms will likely progress and anoperation will be needed eventually.

In 2011, the longer-termresults of the United Kingdom trial were published. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, 72% of patients were predicted to crossover (CO) fromWW to surgery by 7.5 years causing the authors to conclude thatroutine repair should be recommended for minimally symptomaticpatients without medical contraindications to surgery. We now reportthe long-term results of the WW arm of the North American Trial. METHODS Data The methods and study design used for the American Col- lege of Surgeons (ACS) hernia trial have been previously reported in detail.5,6In brief, after informed consent, men who were 18 years or older and had an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinalhernia were recruited from 5 different geographical locations in NorthAmerica including both community and academic centers (Table 1).These patients were randomized to WW or a standard Lichtensteinopen tension-free repair. Patients with female gender, undetectablehernias, symptomatic hernias, acute hernia complications, and localor systemic infection; those in ASA (American Society of Anesthe-siologists) class IV; or those participating in another clinical trialwere excluded from the trial. The outcomes of the trial have beenpublished previously. 5After completion of the trial on December 31, 2004, study participants were invited to voluntarily enroll in a registryfor long-term follow-up after approval from the institutional reviewboard (IRB) of each participant center. Because of inability to ob-tain IRB approval for one site (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec,Canada), this center was excluded from the registry. After informedconsent, men who agreed to participate in the study were contactedby mail questionnaire in mid 2005, mid 2006, early 2008, early 2009,and late 2010. Nonresponders were contacted by phone or e-mail foradditional data collection. Patients initially randomized to WW eitherunderwent surgery during follow-up (CO group) or continued to re-main in the WW group. For the CO group, the questionnaire collectedinformation about reason for CO and details of surgery including date,side, type of surgery, whether mesh was used for the hernia repair,postoperative pain, and hernia recurrence. For those who remained in the WW group, details about their hernia including size, descent into scrotum, use of truss, and pain associated with hernia were collected.Patient satisfaction was recorded for both the groups. The question-naire was purposely kept very short and simple and did not containitems related to quality of life or standardized instruments for painand activity assessment to maximize compliance. Patients Patients assigned to the WW group in the initial RCT were divided into the CO group and WW group for this study.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of patients with a painless inguinal herniarandomized to observation or operation. Methods: Some 160 men aged 55 years or more with a painless inguinal hernia were randomized to observation or operation between 2001 and 2003. All were invited to attend a research clinic at 6 and12 months, and 5 years after randomization. Those unable to attend for clinical review were sent aquestionnaire based on the clinical review pro forma. Results: After a median follow-up of 7 \u00b75( r a n g e6 \u00b72-8 \u00b72) years, 42 men had died (19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group); 46 of the 80 men random ized to observation had conversion to operation. The estimated conversion rate (using the Kaplan-Meier method) for the observation group was 16(95 per cent condence interval 9 to 26) per cent at 1 year, 54 (42 to 66) per cent 5 years and 72 (59 to 84) per cent at 7 \u00b75 years. The main reason for conversion was pain in 33 men, and two presented with an acute hernia. Sixteen men developed a new primary contralateral inguinal hernia and three hadrecurrent hernias. There have been 90 inguinal hernia repairs in the 80 patients randomized to surgery compared with 56 in those randomized to observation. Conclusion: Most patients with a painless inguinal hernia develop symptoms over time. Surgical repair is recommended for medically t patients with a painless inguinal hernia. Presented to the International Surgical Congress of the Asso ciation of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, Liverpool, UK, April 2010 Paper accepted 14 October 2010 Published online 30 November 2010 in Wiley Online Library (www.bjs.co.uk). DOI: 10.1002/bjs.7355 Introduction The lifetime risk of inguinal hernia is 27 per cent in men and 3 per cent in women1. Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common general surgical operations, carriedout in 10 per 10 000 of the population per annum in theUK and 28 per 10 000 in North America 2. Hernias are a socioeconomic burden, with 13 per cent of individualstaking time off work because of the hernia, and almost 30 per cent indicating that the hernia interferes with their leisure activities 3. Previous studies have demonstrated that up to one-third of patients presenting with an inguinal hernia have fewsymptoms 3. The major concern with surgical repair in these patients is that some may go on to develop chronicpostoperative groin pain. This can be debilitating, and in 3-6 per cent affects their work and leisure activities4-7. Two randomized trials have addressed the issue of chronic pain after surgery in patients with no pain orminimal symptoms from a primary inguinal hernia 8-1 0. Both trials showed no increase in chronic pain in patientswho had early surgery compared with that in patients undergoing initial observation. Both trials also reported on the rate of crossover to operation for symptoms in patientsinitially randomized to observation. In one 10, 28 per cent of patients had crossed over to operation after a median of574 days, and in the other 923 per cent had crossed over at 2-year follow-up. The difference may be explained by the inclusion criteria for the respective trials. In the UK study10, only patients with a visible hernia on standing 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd British Journal of Surgery 2011; 98: 596-599 Published by John Wiley & Sons of patients wi th a painless inguinal hernia 597 were included, whereas in the US study940 per cent of patients had a palpable cough impulse only. The issue of what might happen to patients with minimal symptoms from their hernia in the longer term was notaddressed by either trial 9,10. The aim of the present study was to examine the long-term outcome of patients with nopain from their inguinal hernia randomized to observationor early operation. Methods Informed consent was obtained from men aged 55 yearsor above with an asymptomatic inguinal hernia between2001 and 2003 for randomization to early hernia repair or observation. Men who were unt for local anaesthetic hernia repair or who had an irreducible inguinal herniawere excluded. Patients randomized to operation had atension-free mesh repair under local or general anaesthetic.The men were given a contact number in the eventthat their hernia became symptomatic or there were anyrelated concerns. Patients in both groups were invited forexamination at 6 and 12 months after randomization. Theprimary outcome at 12 months from this trial has already been published 10. The hospital database was investigated to identify any deaths since the last review, to avoid family distress. All patients known to be alive were invited to attend a researchclinic for a clinical review by a research fellow, a minimumof 5 years after randomization. Clinical review was basedon a pro forma, which included history, examination andthe completion of a questionnaire on pain, symptoms andoutcome from the inguinal hernia or inguinal hernia repair.Twenty men who could not attend had a telephone reviewand were sent questionnaires based on the research clinicreview pro forma to complete. Statistical analysis The original study was powered to address the primaryendpoint of pain at 1 year 10. Baseline data were tabulated by treatment group (observation or operation). Categorical data were compared between the two groups by 2 test. Continuous data were given as mean(s.d.) and compared using t tests or ANOVA. In those randomized toobservation, a Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted for time tocrossover from observation to surgery. Survival curves forboth groups were also plotted and compared using the logrank test. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina,USA). P<0\u00b7050 was considered statistically signicant.Results On initial recruitment, there were 232 eligible men with an asymptomatic inguinal hernia, of whom 160 agreed to ran-domization ( Fig. 1 ). There were no signicant differences in patient demographics or clinical characteristics between the observation and operation groups 10. After a median follow-up of 7 \u00b75( r a n g e6 \u00b73-8 \u00b73) years, 42 men had died, 19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group; their median age at death was 82 (range 61-90) years. Most deaths were due to cardiovasculardisease or cancer. No patient died secondarily to anacute hernia, although one man in the observation group died from acute myocardial infarction after elective hernia repair. There was no difference in overall survival betweenthe two randomized groups ( P=0\u00b7459). Eighty-seven men attended for clinical examination; 20 were unable to attend, but completed a questionnaire. Crossover from observation to surgery Forty-six of the 80 men in the observation group crossedover to surgery during follow-up. Estimated conversionrates for the observation group were 16 (95 per centcondence interval (c.i.) 9 to 26) per cent after 1 year, 32 (23 to 44) per cent after 2 years, 54 (42 to 66) per cent after 5 years, and 72 (59 to 84) per cent after 7 \u00b75 years (Fig. 2 ). The most common reason for conversion was pain: 33 of 46 men. Twenty-two men noted an increase in the size of their hernia during follow-up, but in onlyve was this the sole indication for the surgery. Six menrequested repair as they felt that, although painless, the hernia was affecting their quality of life. Two patients presented with an acute hernia for repair, but neitherrequired bowel resection. The estimated median time between randomization and conversion (the point at which 50 per cent of the observation group had been converted)was 1678 (95 per cent c.i. 1274 to 2059) days. At a median follow-up of 5 years the median visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores were 1 (range 0-44) mm at rest and 1 (range 0-30) mm on movement in theoperation group compared with 1 \u00b75 (range 0-46) and 1\u00b75 (0-62) mm in the men randomized to no operation. There was no signicant difference in pain scores betweenthe two groups. Contralateral or recurrent hernia During follow-up 16 men developed a new primarycontralateral inguinal hernia, eight in each group. Allpatients in the surgery group requested to have the contralateral inguinal hernia repaired.

Of 143 inguinal hernia repairs in the study, three men (2\u00b71 per cent) developed a recurrence, two in the operationand one in the observation group; all went on to have a further repair. Discussion This study has conrmed previous ndings3that most patients with minimal symptoms from an inguinal hernia develop pain over time. Pain was the most common reasonfor requesting operation, followed by effect on quality oflife and an increase in size of the hernia. The estimated conversion rate of 72 per cent at 7 \u00b75 years was similar to the rate of 90 per cent at 10 years predicted from the previousstudy 3. Only two of the 80 patients in the observation group had an acute presentation. This may, however, indicate that the lifetime risk of acute presentation for conservatively managed inguinal hernia is higher than previously thought.Fitzgibbons and colleagues 8estimated that the lifetime risk of strangulation without operation for a 72 year old was one in 2941. In the present study the mean age was 72 years at inclusion in the observation group10and these patients were followed for just 469 patient years.Although it may not be safe to extrapolate this risk of acute presentation to all age groups, the nding from this study 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk British Journal of Surgery 2011; 98: 596-599 Published by John Wiley & Sons of patients wi th a painless inguinal hernia 599 is important because population-based studies indicate a tenfold increase in postoperative mortality associated withan acute operation 11 - 13. If a strategy of follow-up only for patients over 55 years with a painless hernia were adopted, based on the presentdata this would reduce the number of hernia operations byless than 10 per cent over the long term. Any cost savingsfrom this policy would have to be balanced against a smallincrease in morbidity and mortality from acute surgery.Delaying elective operation until the patient is older mayalso increase the risk of perioperative mortality 12. The recent guidelines published by the European Hernia Society14recommend that watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic inguinal hernia. However, they recognized that the results from the two controlled trials published in2006 9,10were not conclusive. The authors came to different conclusions: one group suggested that watchful waitingwas safe and acceptable, whereas the other indicated thatrepairing asymptomatic hernias did not cause chronicpain, improved general health and might reduce potentialpostoperative morbidity. The present long-term follow-up should help clarify some of the uncertainties; thereseems little point in watchful waiting because the majorityof patients will require an operation in the foreseeablefuture. One of the drawbacks of this study is that the results may not be generalizable to other regions. Many patients withan inguinal hernia in the UK have known that they have ahernia for a number of years before attending their doctor.Indeed, in this study, patients had their hernia for a meanof 3 years before attending a surgical clinic 10. In addition, rates of operation for inguinal hernia vary widely2.T h i s is unlikely to be related to differences in the prevalenceof this condition, and probably reflects the attitudes ofpatients and clinicians to intervention. Operation on aninguinal hernia that is not visible or palpable on standing is uncommon in the UK. In the US study, this accounted for 40 per cent of patients included in the trial 9. The natural history of such hernias is unknown, in particular whatproportion will progress to a visible symptomatic inguinalhernia. Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Scottish Executive.

O'Dwyer Commentary Long-term follow-up of patients with a painless inguinal hernia from a clinical 98: 596-599) Despite inguinal hernia repair being one of the most common operations and the fact that many are asymptomatic, the scientic evidence to provide valid recommendations concerni ng early repair or watchful waiting until symptoms occur continues to be debated1,2. In addition, the overall information available includes only about 400 patients, with about 25 per cent having surgery 2 years after watchful waiting, but 72 per cent after 7 \u00b75 years of observation1,2. The risk of death after an acute operation for strangulated hernia will require more data, in contrast to conclusive data that electiverepair is extremely safe, especially when performed under local anaesthesia. The overall cost benet with watchful waiting seems to be limited, at least based on the Scottish study 1. One argument for not repairing an asymptomatic inguinal hernia is the risk of persistent postoperative pain, although this r isk was not signicantly different between the two treatment approaches1,2. However, there are opportunities for identifying patients at high risk of persistent pain and optimizing surgical technique to reduce this complication3, which should be considered in the future approach to the asymptomatic inguinal hernia. In summary, I tend to agree with Chung and colleagues1that an inguinal hernia repair is recommended in patients with a painless hernia, but taking into consideration whether the patient is at high risk of persistent pain3, the use of the safest anaesthesia (local inltration) in patients with co-morbiditi es, the surgical technique (laparoscopy) with the lowest risk of nerve damage3, and estimated life expectancy.

Parker, FRCS Objective :To base, Embase, national guidelines (including the Na-tional Library of Guidelines Specialist Library), Na-tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenceguidelines, and the National Research Register weresearched for prospective randomized trials comparing sur-gical treatment of patients with asymptomatic IH withconservative treatment. Study Selection :The literature search retrieved 216 ar- ticle headlines, and these articles were analyzed. Of thosestudies, a total of 41 articles were found to be relevant and2 large well-conducted randomized controlled studies thatpublished their results in several articles were reviewed. Data Extraction :The pain and discomfort, general health status, complications, and life-threatening eventsof patients with asymptomatic IH managed by surgery or watchful waiting were determined. Data Synthesis :No significant difference in pain scores and general health status were found when comparing thepatients who were followed up with the patients who hadsurgery. A significant crossover ratio ranging between 23% and 72% from watchful waiting to surgery was found. Inpatients with watchful waiting, the rates of IH strangula-tion were 0.27% after 2 years of follow-up and 0.55% af-ter 4 years of follow-up. In patients who underwent elec-tive surgery, the range of operative complications was 0%to 22.3% and the recurrence rate was 2.1%. Conclusion :Both treatment options for asymptomatic IH are safe, but most patients will develop symptoms(mainly pain) over time and will require operation. Arch Surg. 2012;147(3):277-281 INGUINAL HERNIA (IH) OCCURS when a peritoneal sac protrudes through a weak point within thegroin area. It often contains ab-dominal content and is tradition- ally treated with surgery. 1As a rule, IH is diagnosed by a simple physical examina-tion except in cases where the diagnosisis obscure; in these cases, different mo-dalities are used for confirmation. 2Asymp- tomatic IH is a term used to describe the condition in a patient who has a groinbulge or impulse cough with only minoror no symptoms. On the other hand, anincidental operative finding of an inter-nal ring defect with no groin lump or othersymptoms is defined as an occult IH , a con- dition prevalent since the introduction oflaparoscopic surgery. Inguinal hernia repair (IHR) is the most frequent elective operation performed inthe United States and Europe, althoughwhen comparing the rate of surgery per-formed to treat IH there is great varietyamong different populations. 3,4For ex- ample, IHR is done in 10 per 10 000 peoplein the United Kingdom, while the rate is28 per 10 000 people in the United States. 5 There are several possible explanations forthis observable fact, including different pri-mary care management, costs, and insur-ance policies. As in any other operation, elective IHR carries its share of complications. Surgi-cal site infection, hematoma, urinary re-tention, and other short-term morbidi-ties well long-termcomplications including chronic groinpain, neuralgia, and IH recurrence. 6How- ever, postponing the operation might carrya risk of acute IH and visceral organ stran-gulation with additional risks of gan-grene, perforation, and infection of theperitoneal cavity. Hence, operations in theemergency setting for incarcerated IH havehigher morbidity and mortality rates. 7 The aim of this review is to establish a surgical approach to asymptomatic IH byAuthor Affiliations: Department Manor Hospital(Dr Parker), Kent, England.

Asymptomatic inguinal hernia repair was identified as a poten- tially cosmetic procedure, with limited clinical benefit. The Birmingham and Solihull primary care trust cluster introduced a policy of watchful waiting for asymptomatic inguinal hernia, which was implemented across the health economy in December2010. This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the effect of a change in clinical commissioning policy concerning elective surgical repair of asymptomatic inguinal hernias. METHODS A total of 1,032 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair in the 16 months after the policy change were compared with 978 patients in the 16 months before. The main outcome measure was relative proportion of emergency repair in groups before and after the policy change. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to adjust the main outcome for age, sex and hernia type. RESULTS The period after the policy change was associated with 59% higher odds of emergency repair (3.6% vs 5.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 -2.47). In turn, emergency repair was associated with higher odds of adverse events (4.7% vs 18.5%, p<0.001, Fisher 's exact test). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a watchful waiting policy for asymptomatic inguinal hernias was associated with a significant increase in need for emergency repair, which was in turn associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Current policies may be placing patients at risk. KEYWORDS Inguinal hernia -Emergency surgery -Commissioning -Guidelines E: sharad.karandikar@heartofengland.nhs.uk Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly per- formed surgical operations, at an estimated annual rate of over 70,000 in the UK and 20 million worldwide.1-3Con- ventional wisdom has been to arrange prompt surgicalrepair owing to the perceived risk of hernia related emer- gencies. Elective repair as a day procedure is an estab- lished, safe and effective treatment for uncomplicatedhernia. 4In contrast, emergency repair for incarcerated, obstructed or strangulated hernia can be associated with significant morbidity and even death. While the mortalityrate following elective repair is less than 1%, it is over 5% in emergency repair. 5,6 Two recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one from North America7and one from the UK,8have rekindled interest in asymp- tomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias, by comparing watchful waiting versus surgical repair. Bothtrials reported extremely low need for emergency repair in the observation arm. 7,8Based on these two RCTs, watchful waiting has been recommended as the first-line treatmentfor asymptomatic inguinal hernias in guidelines published by the European Hernia Society.9However, the active follow- up provided in these trials may not reflect 'real world 'prac- tice. Crossover rates to surgery were high (23% and 29%),7,8 which, paired with the low emergency intervention rate, we believe reflects the strict, active observation of a RCT. Such observation may not be possible in a 'real world 'setting, which would rely on routine community-based patient -doctor interaction. In 2009 the Department of Health instructed manage- ment consulting firm McKinsey & Company to provide advice on how commissioners might achieve world class National Health Service (NHS) productivity.10Asymptomatic inguinal, umbilical and femoral hernias were identified asinterventions with limited clinical benefit that could be decommissioned to drive financial savings. Widespread policy changes were implemented by NHS clinical commis-sioners, who withdrew funding for elective repair of asymptomatic hernias. To date, as far as we are aware, no assessment of this policy change has been published. ThisGENERAL SURGERY Ann R Coll 343study aimed to describe how this change has manifested itself at a large NHS foundation trust. Methods This study was a retrospective analysis of patients at theHeart of England NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest trusts in the UK, serving a population of over one million people. Permission to perform this study was granted fromthe hospital 's clinical audit department. Intervention A policy of watchful waiting and prior approval for elective asymptomatic hernia repair, introduced by the Birmingham and Solihull primary care trust cluster,11was implemented in the trust in December 2010. The new policy supported surgi-cal treatment for patients with symptomatic inguinal hernias, hernias not amenable to simple reduction or strangulated hernias. Based on the date of this policy change, patientswere divided into two groups: those from the 16 monthsbefore implementation (1 August 2009 -30 November 2010) and those from the 16 months after (1 December 2010 -30 March 2012). Outcome measures The primary outcome measure was the relative proportion of emergency surgery before and after implementation of the new policy. The proportion of emergency surgery acts as asurrogate marker for worse outcome. Since the overall rate of adverse events is low, a more frequent proxy marker makes differences easier to show. The adverse event rate was there-fore a secondary outcome measure, alongside postoperative mortality and length of stay. Patients Patients aged 18 years and older undergoing repair of uni-lateral or bilateral inguinal hernia during the study period were included. They were identified from the prospectivelymaintained hospital theatre database. Clinical data were obtained from discharge summaries, clinical letters and recorded inpatient episodes using the electronic integratedhospital information system. Adverse events Postoperative complications were classified according to theinternationally standardised and validated Clavien -Dindo scoring system for postoperative complications. 12In this clas- sification, the factor determining the severity of the unex-pected complication is the treatment required. Intraoperativecomplications are not considered, except intraoperative death (grade V). For this study, major complications were defined as grades III -IV, with grades I -II indicating a minor complication. All documented postoperative adverse events up to 30 days were included and the highest grade complication for each patient was recorded. Postoperative mortality was defined asdeath from any cause in the 30-day postoperative period. Statistical analysis Differences between demographic groups of categoricaldata were tested using the chi-squared test or Fisher 'sexact test as appropriate. In order to take account of the effect of confounding variables, binary logistic regressionmodelling was used. The first model assessed the likeli- hood of need for emergency surgery (with emergency sur- gery coded as '1'). The summary statistic was the odds ratio (OR), which was assumed to approximate the relative risk. An OR of >1.0 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not cross 1.0 indicated a significantly higher asso-ciation with the outcome of interest. Subsequent modelswere constructed using occurrence of any complication and major complications as a target. Mortality was not included as a specific target of regression analysis aloneowing to its low occurrence. It was, however, included as an adverse event and compared using Fisher 's exact test. The age and sex of the patient, and the primary versus recurrent type of the inguinal hernia were judged a priori to be likely to be relevant to the rate of emergency presen- tation and adverse events. In order to prevent a loss of dataassociated with categorising age, it was maintained as acontinuous variable and log transformed. As interpretation of log-transformed ORs are difficult owing to their magni- tude, these values were transformed to allow the OR torelate to a 10% increase in age. Models were repeated using age as an unadjusted continuous variable to confirm validity. These variables were included in multivariate binary logistic models based on their clinical importance (rather than reliance on their statistical importance in stepwisemodels, which can be misleading). 13Interaction between categorical variables was tested sequentially and signifi- cant pairings were included in the model if they improvedthe Akaike information criterion (a measure of quality ofmodel selection). Overall model performance was assessed using the C statistic as a measure of discrimination, which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating char-acteristic curve for fitted values. Data handling was per- formed in SPSS \u00aeversion 21.0 (IBM, New York, US) and statistical modelling in R statistical software version 3.0.0(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results Patient demographics and outcomes in the period before and after the policy change are shown in Table 1. Patient age, sex and hernia type were similar in both groups. Themost common reason for emergency repair was incarcera- tion (ie irreducibility without obstruction or strangulation, n=50, 54.3%), ( 10.9%). In six cases (6.5%), the indication was not recorded. One hundred and seven patients (5.3%) suffered at least one recorded postoperative complication. This was associ- ated with a minor complication rate of 4.4% ( n=88) and a major complication rate of 0.9% ( n=19). Effect of policy change on presentation type There was a crude relative increase of 52.8% in the rate of emergency repair (Table 1). When adjusted for age, sexand hernia type, policy change was associated with CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIAShigher odds of emergency repair (adjusted OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.03 -2.47). Increasing age and female sex were signifi- cant predictors of the need for emergency repair in the multivariate model (Table 2). The C statistic of this model was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68 -0.79), indicating adequate discrimi- native value. When this model was repeated for men only,the effect of the time period after the policy change remained significant, with an increase in odds to 68% (adjusted OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04 CI: 1.05 -2.72, p=0.030). Effect of emergency surgery on adverse event rate Emergency presentation was associated with a significantly higher rate of any complications (18.5% emergency vs 4.7% elective, p<0.001), major complications mortality vs 0.1%, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex, hernia type and time period, emergency presentation remained significantlyassociated with occurrence of any complications (OR: -35.87). Effect of policy change on adverse event rate The postoperative mortality rate was not significantly dif- ferent between the periods prior to and following the pol-icy change (Table 1). In adjusted models, the time period after the policy change predicted neither occurrence of any complications (adjusted OR: 1.26, 95% 2.85). Successful completion of day-case surgery was notdifferent before and after the policy change. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of a change in clinical commissioning guidelines on elective surgery for inguinal hernia in the UK. In thecatchment area of a large foundation trust, the proportion of patients undergoing emergency surgery increased sig- nificantly following the policy change. The absolute per-centage change in the rate of emergency presentation was small (1.9%) but this is correlated to increased odds of 59% in an adjusted model (68% in men). Such relativeincreases may be important to the individual patient when considering the morbidity profile associated with emer- gency repair. The main strength of this study is its assessment over a large geographical region. This allowed for high numbers and inclusion of patients from a 'real world 'population. Although no direct link was made between timing of thestudy period (ie before or after policy change) and adverse events, when extrapolated across the country, such an increase is likely to be detected. Additionally,detailed clinical outcome assessment at source likely afforded higher accuracy than routinely collected admin- istrative data alone. 14Table 1 Demographics and outcomes before and after policy change Before change After change p-value 63 (6.1%) 0.902 Type hernia (91.1%) Recurrent 106 (10.8%) 92 (8.9%) 0.148 Day case Yes 253 (24.5%) (5.5%) 0.037 Any complication No (95.4%) 970 (94.0%) Yes 45 (4.6%) 62 (6.0%) 0.160 CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIASThe main limitation is underlying assumptions that the increased number of patients presenting as emergencies were asymptomatic and had either been seen by their gen- eral practitioner (GP) but not referred or had been referredbut were not offered surgery. These assumptions are important confounders of the theory that the changes observed were due to policy change. This study thereforeprovides evidence of association rather than direct cause.Other limitations should be considered. With only the catchment area of one UK hospital, the ability to generalise to other areas requires confirmation. However, the founda-tion trust is comprised of three hospitals with two emer- gency departments and is likely to be representative of other UK hospitals. This study did not test quality of life or pain measures from patients. Large cohort studies have shown that elective repair of an inguinal hernia enhances life quality. 4Ak e y argument against surgical repair of an asymptomatic ingui- nal hernia is the risk of surgical morbidity, such as postop- erative chronic pain, which is quoted to patients in theorder of 5 -10%. 15,16Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of the UK trial by O 'Dwyer et al showed equivalent median vis- ual analogue scale pain scores between men randomised to operative and non-operative groups at five years.8,17This confirms findings from the North American trial, where analysis by both intention-to-treat and as-treated showed equivalence between observation and surgery for pain inter-fering with activity. 7These findings suggest that the risk of chronic pain should not be a barrier when considering surgical repair.18In order to answer the primary study question, it was decided a priori to adjust for the factors that we judged would be clinically relevant to affecting elective versus emergency presentation: age, sex and primary/recurrenthernia type. Data on pre-existing co-morbidity, use of lapa- roscopy and other desirable (but not necessary) factors were not included. These are unlikely to be relevant con-founders following the adjustment already performed.Finally, the proportion of patients successfully managed conservatively by GPs was not investigated in this study. Such data may reveal a high success rate and reduce theproportional size of emergency presentations although it would not affect the relative increase seen. Changes in commissioning policy were based on evi- dence from two RCTs. In the largest RCT, by Fitzgibbons et al, the estimated cross-over rate from observation to sur- gery, through Kaplan -Meier analysis, was 68% at ten years. 7,19The second RCT did not find significant differen- ces in pain scores but showed an overall change in SF-12\u00ae health status of 7.0 (95% CI: 0.2 -13.7, p=0.045), favouring the operation group over the observation group.8,17Out of 80 men randomised to observation, 46 crossed over to operation, which was estimated by Kaplan -Meier methods as a rate of 72% at 7.5 years. The high rate of conversion to operative intervention, accompanied by a low rate of emergency intervention, seen in the two RCTs is in contrast to the rates from thepresent study for before and after the policy change. This is likely explained by the careful, active observation afforded in RCTs, which may not be feasible in non-trial,Table 2 Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression association of patient and policy factors to adverse events (emergency presentation and complications) Univariate Multivariate OR (95% CI) p-value = confidence interval *OR relates to a 10% increase in age. All models were repeated using age as an unadjusted continuous variable; there were no alterations to significance and the maximum change to the Akaike information criterion was 0.8%. CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIAScommunity settings. The North American authors sug- gested that watchful waiting is reasonable and safe (recog-nising the high likelihood of future operation) 19but the UK authors suggested that there is little point in observation.17 The European Hernia Society issued guidelines in favour of watchful waiting for men with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic inguinal hernias, without clarifying the method of implementation in practice.9While this may remain the best policy for some patients, the ideal candi-date and process will only be identified after further research. Elderly patients with co-morbidity have been suggested as targets of this strategy although they may beat highest risk of morbidity and mortality if emergency sur- gery is required. In the present study, increasing age was associated with both emergency presentation and compli-cations. This suggests that age alone should not be a bar- rier to elective surgical repair. Despite this, patients choosing observation may be reassured that the risk ofemergency repair remained below 10%. It is notable from this study that the proportion of patients undergoing elective repair differed only slightly between time periods (96.4% to 94.5%). Although thedecrease is small, it reflects the important increase in emergency presentation. The fact that elective referrals are still being made in volume suggests that only a small pro-portion of patients are asymptomatic. Additionally, pene- trance of guidelines may not yet be complete and if proportion of elective repair falls further, even more emer-gency presentations may occur in the future. Day-case, ambulatory inguinal hernia repair may also prove to be more cost effective than active observation incommunity settings. Ongoing observation comes at a finan-cial cost that should be quantified and compared with that of early repair. The UK RCT showed that operative strat- egies were over \u00a3400 more expensive per patient than forthe observation group, taking into account clinic and observation costs. 8However, with longer-term community- based follow-up and more adverse events (when applied toa wider population), these costs may increase and deserve prospective reassessment. Conclusions This study suggests that the current policy is associated with an increased proportion of emergency presentationsand may be putting patients at risk. It may also be less cost effective than a policy of early elective surgery. For these reasons, we advocate further studies at a national level aswell as a timely clarification of clinical commissioning pol- icies to allow expert surgical assessment and follow-up if awatchful waiting policy is to be adopted.

Annually, more than20 million groin hernias are repaired worldwide. The gen-eral approach towards groin hernias is surgical repairregardless of the presence of symptoms.

Results The risk of incarceration is approximately 4 per 1,000 patients with a groin hernia per year. Risk factors for incarceration are age above 60 years, femoral hernia siteand duration of signs less than 3 months. Morbidity andmortality rates of emergency groin hernia repair are higherin patients who are older than 49 years, have a delaybetween onset of symptoms and surgery of more than 12 h, have a femoral hernia, have nonviable bowel and have an ASA-class of 3 or 4.

Keywords Inguinal \u00b7 Hernia \u00b7 Asymptomatic \u00b7 Therapy Introduction Groin herniorrhaphy is the most common operation per- formed by general surgeons. Annually, over 20 million groin hernias are repaired worldwide [ 1]. In the United States, 800,000 groin hernia repairs were performed in2003 [ 2]. Groin hernia repairs account for 10-15% of all general surgical procedures [ 2]. The general policy towards groin hernias is surgical repair regardless of the presence of symptoms. The ratio- nale to recommend surgery for asymptomatic visceral incarcer ation and subsequently ische- mia (strangulation). There is a low threshold to proposesurgery in patients with groin hernias because the repair isconsidered safe and e Vective, and is associated with a low morbidity. However, little is known about the natural his- tory of untreated groin hernias, and morbidity of groin her-nia repair appears underestimated [ 3]. The goal of this study was to review outcomes of surgical and conservativeapproaches in patients with a groin hernia, and to determinethe appropriateness of surgery in patients with an asymp- tomatic or minimal groin hernia.

Bonjer QE II Health Sciences Center, Dalhousie University, Halifax, BC, CanadaCOLLECTIVE REVIEW Operation Compared with Watchful Waiting in Elderly Male Inguinal Hernia Patients: A Review andData Analysis INCA T rialists Collaboration Inguinal hernia repairs are mainly performed in male pa- tients older than 50 years.1Although watchful waiting can be considered in mildly symptomatic and asymptomaticpatients, according to the inguinal hernia guideline 2inguinal hernia patients with- out contraindications are usually treated operatively. The rationale for surgical treatment is to cure inguinal pain and discomfort associated with the hernia and to pre- vent emergency surgery in case of incarceration and/orstrangulation, which is clearly associated with higher mor-bidity and mortality. 3,4The indication for elective surgery, however, should not only depend on consideration of themortality rate that is associated with emergency and elec-tive repair. The risk of incarceration or strangulation re-quiring emergency repair should be considered as well. Ad-ditionally, risk of recurrence and crossover rates fromconservative to operative management in this group of pa-tients should be taken into account. Recently, 2 randomized trials have reported that pain is not substantially different at 1 or 2 years after assigningopen tension-free hernia repair or watchful waiting in caseof asymptomatic mildly symptomatic inguinal herniacompared with preoperative pain levels. 5,6In addition, one third of patients presenting with an inguinal hernia at amean age of 60 years (range 45 to 71 years) have beenreported to be asymptomatic. 7Another study reported that 81% of patients (62% older than 50 years of age) did notsuffer from any inguinal pain at rest, which included 27%with no pain at all. 8 All the factors mentioned here are important when con- sidering repair of inguinal hernia in elderly male patients.Neuhauser conducted a life-expectancy analysis includingmost of these factors in 1977 and concluded that elective hernia repair does not prolong life in the elderly, it might ormight not improve quality of life, and life expectancywould be determined mainly by the yearly rate ofstrangulation. 9 The aim of this study was to investigate which treat- ment, operation or watchful waiting, would be better incase of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic elderly maleinguinal hernia patients by means of a literature review anda Markov model integrated relevant parameters. METHODS Review Studies in which the following outcomes measures were studied were included: risk of incarceration and/or stran-gulation, mortality associated with elective and emergencyhernia repair (in case of incarceration and/or strangula-tion), and risk of recurrence and crossover rates fromwatchful waiting to operation. Studies were identified bysearching PubMed, the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2007),scholar.google.com, and Current Controlled T rials (search across multiple registers including the National Health Ser-vice in England and US ClinicalT rials.gov). Search terms used and cross-checked were hernia, inguinal, strangula- tion, incarceration, mortality, elective, emergency, and hernia repair. Studies containing data about femoral and in-guinofemoral hernia were excluded from analysis. Ran- domized trials published after 1990 comparing open and lapa-roscopic hernia repair were also included with respect toelective mortality rates because there is no evidence of a sub-stantial difference in mortality between these types of repair.Randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospec-tive cohort studies were included. Reviews and references ofthe articles retrieved were checked for additional studies. Let-ters to the editor, abstracts, and comments were excluded.Only articles written in English were reviewed. Additionally, studies investigating pain before and after assigning operative or conservative management in case ofmildly symptomatic and asymptomatic elderly hernia pa-tients repair, pain, postoperative, and pain, chronic.

DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas; and Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska Ventral hernias are a common clinical problem. Immediate repair is recommended for most ventral hernias despite significant recurrence rates. This practice may be related to a lack of un- derstanding of the natural history of ventral hernias. The purpose of this study was to determine the natural history of ventral hernias and to determine if watchful waiting is an acceptable andsafe option. Forty-one patients with ventral herni as were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of watchful waiting. Primary outcomes were functional impairment resulting from hernia disease as measured by the Activities Assessment Scale (AAS) and changes from baseline to two years in the physical and mental component score of the SF-36 Health Survey. Secondary outcomes includedcomplications such as incarceration. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures and Student's ttests were used to evaluate scale performance. The mean age of enrollees was 64 years, and the mean hernia size was 239 cm 2. Eleven patients were lost to follow-up, and seven patients died of other causes. All remaining patients were followed for two years. There was one incarceration during the follow-up period. There was no deterioration in the AAS score (baseline vs24 months 528 vs25,P50.60). There was deterioration of the physical functioning dimension of the SF-36 (baseline vs24 months 540vs32,P\\0.01), but the mental functio ning dimension was improved (45vs51;P50.01). Watchful waiting was a safe option for patients in this study with ventral hernias. THE CURRENT ACCEPTED treatment of ventral hernia is repair at diagnosis regardless of the presence of symptoms. The primary reason for this recommendationis to prevent the development of a hernia accident, de-fined as either strangulation of hernia contents or bowelobstruction. Another reason ventral hernias are repairedat diagnosis is to address the generally accepted conceptthat hernia repairs become more difficult with time asa result of chronic scarring and enlargement. Addition- ally, there is the belief that hernia repair will improve the patient's quality of life. As a result, over 200,000 ventralhernias are performed annually in the United States ata cost of nearly $3.2 billion every year. 1Although usually considered a low-risk operation, incisional her-nia repair is associated with morbidity (up to 60%),mortality (up to 5.3%), frequent complications such aswound infection and cardiovascular abnormalities, reoperations, readmissions, and time off from work. 2-4 For years physicians and their patients have struggled with a decision to undergo surgical repair of their in-guinal hernias when they were minimally symptomaticbecause of a lack of knowledge concerning the natural history of an untreated inguinal hernia. A better un- derstanding of the natural history has now been obtainedafter a large prospective randomized trial sponsored bythe American College of Surgeons. 5This was a multi- center trial in which patients were assigned to routinerepair or watchful waiting (WW). The risk of a herniaaccident (strangulation or bowel obstruction) was foundto be quite low in the WW group (1.8 per 1000 patient- years) and quality-of-life measures showed no differ- ence at two years between the two groups. These datahave allowed patients with inguinal hernia to avoidunnecessary surgery and have undoubtedly saved thehealthcare system millions of dollars annually. A strategy of WW for minimally symptomatic ventral hernias would be a logical next consideration.However, data regarding the natural history of un- treated ventral hernias are lacking just as it was for inguinal hernias before the trial described. Currentlya multicenter trial comparing WW versus routine repair funded by the German Research Foundation isaccruing patients with ''oligosymptomatic'' ventralhernias. 6Anticipating tha t results from that trial will n o tb ea v a i l a b l ef o ry e a r s ,w er e p o r tt h er e s u l t so fa prospective longitudinal cohort study of 41 patientsAddress correspondence and reprin t requests to Charles F.

Patient-reported outcomes are an important metric of the effectiveness of care. Ventral hernia repair is a procedure where the effectiveness can best be quantied using health-related quality oflife. This study sought to quantify quality of life with respect to costs of ventral hernia repair. Methods. This observational study of patients diagnosed with a ventral hernia between 2004-2011 in a single center identied 3 groups of patients: (1) Patients diagnosed with ventral hernias managed withobservation, (2) patients diagnosed with ventral hernias who underwent operative repair only when incarceration occurred, and (3) patients with ventral hernias who underwent herniorraphy before incarceration. The Short Form (SF)12v2 was administered to measure quality of life. The direct costs ofcare were obtained from Financial Services. Patients were surveyed about direct, non-health costs to obtain a societal perspective. A cost-utility analysis was performed. Results. The SF-12v2 was administered to 243 patients; 80 were observed, 69 underwent repair of an incarcerated hernia, and 94 underwent repair of a nonincarcerated hernia. The response rates weresimilar among groups---59%, 55%, and 52%. Quality of life as measured by utility score was less at 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65-0.71) in patients who did not undergo repair compared with those after repair of a nonincarcerated hernia, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73-0.79; a nonincarcerated hernia was cost-effective with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,646 per quality-adjusted life- year. Conclusion. The prompt elective repair of ventral hernias is cost-effective. (Surgery 2014;155:1081-9.) From the Department of Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY VENTRAL HERNIAS can compromise quality of life. Pa- tients may suffer from obstruction and pain in upto 69% of cases, 1,2as well as experience limitations in their daily life owing to loss of important func-tions of the abdominal wall, such as protection ofthe viscera, stabilization of the core, spine support,and generation of Valsalva pressures. Nonetheless,many patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair may be asymptomatic. 3In these cases, fear of incarceration and strangulation is cited as areason for seeking operative repair 1although inci- dence is 3-10%.2,4,5The effectiveness of electiveventral hernia repair across the full range of pa- tients with these varied symptoms is unclear. The effectiveness of operative treatment is be- ing measured increasingly using patient-reportedoutcomes. These outcomes may be particularlyimportant in common, relatively low mortalityoperations such as hernia repairs. 6Several studies note improvement in quality of life after ventral hernia repair.7,8Observing patients may not be a benign act, because not only is quality of lifepoorer for these patients, but the progressive lossof peritoneal domain may make delayed repairmore difcult. Should patients be observed untilthe occurrence of incarceration or strangulation,the technical approaches may be very different.The technical steps of the operation may be fairly different if incarcerated viscera (any tissue within visceral peritoneum, including but not limited toomentum, bowel, and liver) are in the defect andrequire adhesiolysis, reduction, and possibly resec-tion, depending on the viability of the tissues.Extra-manipulation of the viscera may increase Presented at the Academic Surgical Congress, February 2012, San Diego, California.

GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non -reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic incarceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation.

Incarcerated hernias (defined as non-reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding incarcerated ventral hernias.

Section 9.0 New Discussion Items Back Surgery Guidelines 1 Questions : 1) Should cervical fusion be included on the upper surgical line with cervical decompression surgery? 2) In what situations should lumbar fusion be included on the upper surgical line with lumbar decompression surgery? 3) Is fusion included on the upper surgical line for treatment of spondylolisthesis? 4) Is radiculopathy that meets the clinical criteria in GN37 eligible for surgery on the upper line ? 5) When is spinal surgery emergent for the purposes of the spinal surgery smoking cessation guideline? Question source : HERC staff, OHSU Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery , CCO Medical Directors, HSD Issue: New back surgery guidelines went into effect July 1, 2016 with the new back line changes . The back surgery group at OHSU has had multiple questions an d concerns about the new guidelines. Additionally, similar questions have been raised by CCO medical directors and by community based neurosurgeons/orthopedic surgeons and by Health Services Division at OHA . These questions mainly concern when spinal fus ion should be covered with decompression surgery. A second question has been raised about when radiculopathy is covered for surgical treatment ; specifically, why there is a definition of radiculopathy in GN3 7 when that particular diagnosis ICD -10 code is n ot included on the upper surgical line. Additionally, questions have been raised about the spinal cessation prior to spinal surgery guideline and when a surgery is considered urgent enough to justify not requiring smoking cessation . Based on input from th e spinal surgery community and the CCO medical directors, HERC staff has drafted revisions to the back surgery guideline and the smoking cessation in back surgery guideline. 1) Regarding coverage for cervical spinal stenosis: the CCO medical directors and OH SU back surgery group felt that the current national neurosurgical guidelines and the evidence support the use of fusion with cervical decompression because of the increase in complications including kyphosis when fusion is not included. 2) Regarding other exceptions to the clause not allowing fusion for spinal decompression: the OHSU back surgery group recommended the following exceptions to the non -coverage of spinal fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: a. If >50% of joint resected for foraminal stenosis, th is create s instability and therefore need s fusion b. Spondylolisthesis c. Scoliosis >10 degrees d. No evidence that multilevel surgery causes lumbar spinal insta bility. Ok to not have fusion. 3) There is general confusion among the CCO medical directors and surgeons regarding the back surgery guideline in terms of the coverage for spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis. Currently, there is confusing wording about spondylolisthesis which requires spinal stenosis to be present before spondylolisthesis is covered, but then the spinal stenosis clause restricts fusion eve n when spondylolisthesis is present. E xperts argue is not standard of care. Review of the Back Pain Lines Reorganization Task Force (BPLRTF) meeting notes finds that the intent was to pair Back Surgery Guidelines 2 spondylolisthesis with decompression AND fusion. The guideline appears poorly worded and should be clarified. 4) GN3 7 includes a definition of radiculopathy. However, radiculopathy was not included o n the upper surgical line intentionally by the BPLRTF . The intent was to not cover surgical correction of radiculopathy unless there was another diagnosis such as spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis. Review of the BPLRTF meeting notes finds that the neu rosurgical member, Dr. Keenan, did not feel that this definition was needed, as the diagnoses on the upper surgical line had neurologic complications included by definition. The two surgical lines would be differentiated by diagnosis rather than by a defi nition of neurologic complication. However, the definition was left in the guideline as the OHP medical directors at that time felt that they would be useful and requested their continued inclusion. The only diagnoses included on the upper surgical line include myelopathy, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or spinal instability. Radiculopathy is only included on the lower back surgery line . The Prioritized List prior to the new back lines contained a GN37 with this definition of clinically significant radiculopathy. This GN37 tied into another previous guideline (GN41), and which defined when spinal stenosis w as clinically significant: \" Clinically significant spinal stenosis is defined as having MRI evidence of moderate to severe central or foraminal s pinal stenosis in addition to a history of neurogenic claudication, or objective evidence of neurologic impairment consistent with MRI findings (see Guideline Note 37).\" 5) The OHSU back surgery group was strongly in support of our smoking cessation guidelin e for spinal surgery . The OHP medical directors ha ve requested clarification on when back surgery should be considered emergent and the smoking cessation requirement waived. The back surgery group at OHSU provided HERC staff with wording regarding when ba ck surgery is considered emergent .

N=4 retrospective cohort studies b. For patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ), data from 3 class of evidence III retrospective cohort studies suggest that there is no difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy or pain: 2 studies reported no significant difference between treatme nt groups in severity of myelopathy, and 3 studies found no significant difference in pain outcomes between treatment groups. For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, one small class of evidence III retrospective cohort study reported significant improvements in myelopathy severity after laminectomy and fusion compared with laminoplasty, but no differences in long -term pain between treatment groups. The overall evidence on the comparative safety of laminoplasty compared with la minectomy and fusion is inconsistent. Reoperation rates were lower after laminoplasty in 2 of 3 studies reporting. However, the incidence of debilitating neck pain was higher after laminoplasty as reported by one study; results on neurological complication s were inconclusive, with 2 studies reporting. Results on kyphotic deformity were inconsistent, with opposite results in the 2 studies reporting. After laminectomy and fusion, 1% to 38% of patients had pseudarthrosis. Infection rates were slightly lower af ter laminoplasty, but the results are not likely to be statistically significant. c. Conclusion. For patients with CSM, there is low -quality evidence that suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy and fusion procedures are similarly effective in treating CSM . For patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is insufficient. For both patient populations, the evidence as to whether one procedure is safer than the other is insuffi cient. Higher -quality research is necessary to more clearly delineate when one procedure is preferred compared with the other. 2) Ryken 2009 , systematic review of cervical laminectomy without fusion for the treatment of CSM a. N=26 studies, mostly case series fr om the 1960's and 1970's b. Studies suggested that the incidence of postlaminectomy kyphosis ranged from 14 to 47%. c. Recommendations: i. Indications. Laminectomy is recommended as a surgical treatment option for symptomatic CSM in selected patients in whom the risk of postoperative kyphosis is felt to be minimal (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). ii. Technique. Laminectomy is recommended as a surgical treatment option for symptomatic cervical myelopathy. The limitations of the technique are an increased risk of postoperative kyphosis compared to anterior techniques, laminoplasty, or laminectomy with fusion. However, the development of kyphosis does not appear to diminish clinical outcome (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recom mendation, D) 3) Anderson 2009 , systematic review of cervical laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of CSM a. Three studies compared results of laminectomy and fusion to other surgical techniques. These were all class III studies and had important methodologi cal defects that limited their conclusions Back Surgery Guidelines 4 i. Comparison of results according to surgical method revealed that laminectomy and posterior fusion yielded significantly better neurological recovery compared to all other methods. b. Summary: Class I or II evidence t o support the use of laminectomy and fusion for treatment of myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not exist. Class III evidence shows consistently that 70 -95% of patients show posto perative neurological improvement. Laminectomy and fusion consistently results in ventral and dorsal spinal cord decompression. a. Recommendation s: i. Indications: Cervical laminectomy with arthrodesis is recommended in the treatment of patients with CSM and OPLL (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). ii. Technique: Cervical laminectomy with arthrodesis is recommended as an equivalent strategy to laminectomy or laminoplasty for functional improvement in the treatment of patients with CSM and OPLL. There is conflicting data as to whether fusion improves functional outcome relative to laminectomy with one study showing arthrodesis superior and one showing equivalency (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). 2) Fehlings 2 013, cohort study of decompression with fusion for cervical myelopathy a. N=260 patients at multiple centers, follow up for 1 year after surgery b. Results: There was a significant improvement from baseline to one year postoperatively (p < 0.05) in the mJOA scor e, Nurick grade, NDI score, and all SF -36v2 health dimensions (including the ment al and physical health composite scores) except general health. With the exception of the change in the mJOA, the degree of improvement did not depend on the severity of the p reoperative symptoms. These results remained unchanged after adjusting for relevant confounders in the multivariate analysis. c. Fifty -two patients experienced complicatio ns (prevalence, 18.7%) d. Conclusions: Surgical decompression for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy was associated with improvement in functional, disability -related, and quality -of-life outcomes at one year of follow -up for all disease severity categories. Furthermo re, complication rates observed in the study were commensurate with those in previously reported cervical spondylotic myelopathy series. e. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level II. Evidence /Society Guidelines \u2014Lumbar Laminectomy +/ - Fusion 1) Resnick 2014 , Evid ence review and Neurosurgical Society guidelines on spinal fusion for spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis a. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration. Since publication of the original guidelines there have been a significa nt number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials Back Surgery Guidelines 5 have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion proc edure. b. Recommendations: i. Surgical decompression and fusion is recommended as an effective treatment alternative for symptomatic stenosis associated with a degenerative spondylolisthesis in patients who desire surgical treatment. (Grade B) c. Evidence based on 31 articles (5 systematic reviews) 2) Resnick 2014 , Evidence review and Neurosurgical Society guidelines on spinal fusion for spinal stenosis with out spondylolisthesis a. For those patients [with lumbar stenosis] who do not improve with conservative care, surge ry is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelih ood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without unde rlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower -level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; ther efore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended. b. Recommendations: i. Surgical decompression is recommended for patients with symptomatic neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis w ho elect to undergo surgical intervention (Level II/III evidence). Grade B recommendation ii. In the absence of deformity or instability, lumbar fusion has not been shown to improve outcomes in patients with isolated stenosis, and therefore it is not recommend ed. (Level IV evidence). Grade C recommendation c. Evidence based on N=36 studies HERC staff summary of evidence : Based on case series studies, many from the 1960's and 1970's, fusion in addition to laminectomy for cervical myelopathy appears to result in equivalent clinical outcomes to laminectomy alone but has lower risk of complications such as kyphosis. Special ty society evidence -based guidelines recommend laminectomy without fusion for spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis or other instability. For spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis or other instability, these guidelines and expert input support decomp ression with fusion. Back Surgery Guidelines 6 HERC staff recommendations : 1) Discuss possible changes to GN 37 as shown below . Several changes are generally agreed upon by the back surgeons and the CCO medical directors; other changes appear to require further clarification a. Allow fusion with decompression surgery for cervical spinal stenosis b. Clarify that spondylolisthesis grades 2 and 3 that results in spinal stenosis can be paired with decompression and fusion procedures i. There has been a request for c larification of whether grade 1 spondylolisthesis should be paired with fusion procedures c. Allow fusion with lumbar decompression without spondylolisthesis in situations of spinal instability i. Needs further work to better define when spinal instability exists or is created . For e xample, the medical directors have questions about how to determine when >50% o f the foraminal joint is resected , as this is never documented in chart notes d. Consider whether central canal stenosis and foraminal stenosis should be combined together or bette r separated out e. Consider deleting the definition of radiculopathy, or somehow indicating that this definition applies to foraminal stenosis f.

Tim Yoon , MD, PhD , * Robin E. Hashimoto , PhD Annie MPH Riew , MD \u00a7 DOI: 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3182a7eb7c Study Design. Systematic review. Objective. To determine the effectiveness and safety of cervical laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical myelopathy, and to identify any patient subgroups for whom one treatment may result in better outcomes than the other. Summary of Background Data. Cervical laminoplasty and cervical laminectomy plus fusion are both procedures that treat cervical stenosis induced myelopathy by expanding the space available for the spinal cord. Although there are strong proponents of each procedure, the effectiveness, safety, and differential effectiveness and safety of laminoplasty versus laminectomy and fusion remains unclear. Methods. A systematic search of multiple major medical reference databases was conducted to identify studies that compared laminoplasty with laminectomy and fusion. Studies could include either or both cervical myelopathic spondylosis (CSM) and ossi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Case reports and studies with less than 10 patients in the comparative group were excluded.

Reoperation and complication rates were evaluated for safety. Clinical recommendations were made through a modi ed Delphi approach by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria. Results. The search strategy yielded 305 citations, and 4 retrospective cohort studies ultimately met our inclusion criteria. For patients with CSM, data from 3 class of evidence III retrospective cohort studies suggest that there is no difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy or pain: 2 studies reported no signi cant difference between treatment groups in severity of myelopathy, and 3 studies found no signi cant difference in pain outcomes between treatment groups. For patients with ossi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament, one small class of evidence III retrospective cohort study reported signi cant improvements in myelopathy severity after laminectomy and fusion compared with laminoplasty, but no differences in long-term pain between treatment groups. The overall evidence on the comparative safety of laminoplasty compared with laminectomy and fusion is inconsistent. Reoperation rates were lower after laminoplasty in 2 of 3 studies reporting. However, the incidence of debilitating neck pain was higher after laminoplasty as reported by one study; results on neurological complications were inconclusive, with 2 studies reporting. Results on kyphotic deformity were inconsistent, with opposite results in the 2 studies reporting. After laminectomy and fusion, 1% to 38% of patients had pseudarthrosis. Infection rates were slightly lower after laminoplasty, but the results are not likely to be statistically signi cant. Conclusion. For patients with CSM, there is low-quality evidence that suggests that laminoplasty and laminectomy and fusion procedures are similarly effective in treating CSM. For patients with ossi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is insuf cient. For both patient populations, the evidence as to whether one procedure is safer than the other is insuf cient. Higher-quality research is necessary to more clearly delineate when one procedure is preferred compared with the other. Copyright \u00a9 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Laminectomy is recommended as a sur - gical treatment option for symptomatic CSM in selected patients in whom the risk of postoperative kyphosis is felt to be minimal (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). Technique. Laminectomy is recommended as a sur - gical treatment option for symptomatic cervical myelop - athy. The limitations of the technique are an increased risk of postoperative kyphosis compared to anterior techniques, laminoplasty, or laminectomy with fusion. However, the development of kyphosis does not appear to diminish clinical outcome (quality of evidence, Class III; strength of recommendation, D). Timing. There is insufficient evidence to make a rec- ommendation regarding timing. Rationale. The purpose of this evidence-based re - view is to specifically examine the data on the use of laminectomy in the treatment of CSM and the informa - tion available on the development of postlaminectomy spinal instability.

Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania Object. The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to examine the efficacy of cervical laminectomy for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Methods. The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to cervical laminectomy and CSM. Abstracts were reviewed after which studies meeting inclu - sion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Results. Laminectomy has improved functional outcome for symptomatic cervical myelopathy (Class III). The limitations of the technique are an increased risk of postoperative kyphosis compared to anterior techniques or laminoplasty or laminectomy with fusion (Class III). However, the development of kyphosis may not necessarily to diminish the clinical outcome (Class III). Conclusions. Laminectomy is an acceptable therapy for near-term functional improvement of CSM (Class III). It is associated with development of kyphosis, however.

Moderate and severe cases are frequently considered for operative intervention. Both anterior and posterior ap - proaches have been developed in an attempt to halt or reverse the symptoms. Posterior approaches have tradi - tionally been considered less complicated; laminectomy in particular has been commonly undertaken with this concept in mind. The theoretical effects of the decom - pression are to permit dorsal migration of the spinal cord away from anterior compressive osteophytes, to decrease compression of the spinal cord itself, and to improve vas - cular perfusion. Potentially significant complications of multilevel laminectomy performed for CSM are the de - velopment of postoperative spinal instability, kyphosis, and/or spondylolisthesis. SearchCriteria Our search of the National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Database for the period from 1966 through 2007 using the MeSH subject headings of \"cervical\" and \"surgery\" and limited to humans generated a broad base of studies (9589 references). We reviewed the titles and abstracts with attention to those titles addressing clini - cal management. We followed the initial search with a secondary search crossing \"myelopathy\" with \"surgery\" and \"cervical\" and\" myelopathy,\" and then reviewed the bibliographies of selected papers for additional relevant references. We selected articles if they addressed issues related to surgical management of cervical myelopathy. We in - cluded articles with data on anterior approaches if they contained comparative data for posterior surgical ap - proaches; articles were excluded if they addressed ante - rior approaches only because this topic is addressed in a separate section of these Guidelines. Finally, we also excluded articles that did not contain clinical information relevant to laminectomy outcomes. Only papers provid - ing data in a minimum of 15 patients undergoing cervical laminectomy for CSM with a minimum of 1-year follow- up data were included in the evidentiary table (Table 1). ScientificFoundation The review process identified no papers providing Class I or II data specifically addressing decompressive laminectomy for CSM. Twenty-four articles provided Class III information. Historical Review A number of large series have been reported that did not meet our inclusion criteria based on lack of full fol - low-up information or for methodological concerns. Nu - rick's classic report26 in 1972 compared 36 conservatively treated patients with 43 patients who underwent surgical treatment, with the majority undergoing laminectomy. The author found basically no difference between the 2 groups, but the follow-up period was not described and the reason for assignment to either group was not clear. This clearly illustrated the need for higher quality studies to address the issue.Gonzalez-Feria and Peraita-Peraita 12 described a large cooperative multicenter survey of 521 patients with cervi - cal myelopathy, 242 of whom underwent laminectomy. They reported a mean improvement for this group as 0.92 on the Nurick scale. Little additional data specific to the laminectomy group were available; in particular, the au - thors did not report the follow-up period and there was no indication of the selection criteria. Gorter13 reviewed data in 567 patients who underwent laminectomy, and 164 patients who received conservative treatment (adding 75 new patients). This author did not report any statistics nor did they give any indication of the method of patient se - lection or assignment. The study did not use any validated outcomes measures. The report included a historical sum - mary of 22 studies in patients with CSM who underwent laminectomy, resulting in an overall reported cure in 10%, improvement in 47%, and symptom arrest in an additional 23%. Conservative measures described in a summary of 5 studies resulted in a reported cure rate of 0%, improve - ment in 50%, and an arrest of symptoms in 36%. Guidetti and Fortuna's retrospective report 15 in 105 patients who underwent laminectomy or anterior de - compression demonstrated rather modest improvements (reported as percentage of \"very good\"), with poste - rior decompression ranging from 16 to 43% very good compared to 51% for the anterior procedures. The lack of valid outcome measures, selection criteria, adequate follow-up, and statistical analysis limit the applicability of this and other similar contemporary studies. Jeffreys 19 reported a prospective single-surgeon experience in 137 patients who underwent either cervical laminectomy (in 29 patients) or anterior decompression (in 108) according to predefined criteria. He used a nonvalidated functional outcome scale, and the follow-up period was short (6-9 months). The results were not reported according to treat - ment group, which complicated data interpretation. The results of these studies suggest that the expec- tation of success in treating CSM with decompressive laminectomies ranges from approximately 15 to 60%. These studies all were generally lacking in follow-up, but most were published in the 1970s and were representative of the publication style at that time. Class III Studies: Retrospective Single-Arm Studies of Laminectomy for CSM The studies detailed in this section comprised ret - rospectively reviewed experiences with laminectomy for CSM. Most of these studies were published in the 1970s but formed the basis for subsequent comparative studies. They described success rates ranging from 42 to 92%. A brief summary of the relevant studies follows. Adams and Logue 1 reported on a series of 24 patients who underwent laminectomy for CSM. They focused on a comparison of 2 groups: a good outcome and a poor out - come group. These authors were looking for indicators of improved outcome and found that both a decreased ROM postoperatively and a lesser degree of change of the spi - nal curvature were significantly correlated with the good outcome group. Bishara 6 reported long-term results in 59 patients who underwent laminectomy, reporting a 56% improvement rate at 5 years, and 51% improvement at the T. C. Ryken et al. 144 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 200910-year follow-up with no reported instability in any of the patients. Casotto and Buoncristiani8 described 46% good or excellent results in 44 patients who underwent laminecto - my for myelopathy. They evaluated risk factors for a poor outcome and found a significant relationship with preop - erative duration of symptoms and severity of the preop - erative motor deficit. Epstein et al. 10 found a 92% good or excellent rate of improvement in 24 patients who under - went laminectomy. The outcome measures used were not validated, and no statistics were provided; however, the authors felt strongly that the procedure beneficial in these patients. Fager's report 11 summarized 35 patients who un - derwent laminectomy with 1-7 years of follow-up. In this series 68% of patients improved, and an additional 26% had an arrest of symptom progression. Although the majority of their report was a review of previously published cases, Gorter and associates 13 did include data and follow-up in 75 new patients who under - went laminectomy. In the new patient groups (standard laminectomy versus wide laminectomy), the authors re - ported 60 to 68% as cured or improved with mean follow-up of 5.9 and 2.5 years, respectively. Kato et al. 22 described the outcome in 44 patients who underwent laminectomy with a 44.2% 1-year recovery rate that decreased slightly to 43 and 33% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. These au - thors found a 23% incidence of late deterioration (mean 9.5 years), and a 47% rate of postoperative kyphosis. The development of kyphosis did not appear to correlate with neurological deterioration. Miyazaki and Kirita 25 report - ed an 82% overall improvement rate in a study of 155 patients who underwent multilevel laminectomies; 11% of patients worsened, however. Follow-up was relatively short at only 1 year. Postoperative Kyphosis and Effect on Clinical Outcome Although excluded from grading because of meth - odological concerns, Batzdorf and Batzdorff4 presented a series of 28 patients who underwent decompressive laminectomies with a rather in-depth and complex sys - tem of postoperative radiographic analysis. Despite the absence of validated outcome measures and the lack of reported statistics, the authors raised the issue of evalua - tion of pre- and postoperative spinal alignment, and sug - gested that changes in alignment could account for some of the variability in both short- and long-term outcomes seen after decompressive laminectomy. Their historical report highlighted the concern about destabilizing the cervical spine with laminectomy alone. As a result, we reviewed a number of studies which provided information regarding the development of postoperative kyphosis and instability. These studies suggested that the incidence of postlaminectomy kyphosis ranged from 14 to 47%. How - ever, none of these studies could correlate outcome in any fashion with the development of radiographic post - operative kyphosis. Not surprisingly, when compared to laminoplasty, the rate of kyphosis appeared significantly higher (34 vs 7%). 18,23 Guigui et al.16 described 58 patients who underwent multilevel laminectomy. They reported the development of postoperative kyphosis in 31% with 15 patients (25%) believed to be unstable, and 3 (5%) requiring surgical stabilization. The authors proposed the careful study of preoperative dynamic radiographs in assisting with selec-tion of patients at risk for postlaminectomy kyphosis and instability. Ishida et al. 18 compared 55 patients undergoing laminectomy with 55 patients undergoing laminoplasty. Although the 2 groups were comparable demographi - cally, assignment to treatment groups was not random - ized, and the criteria used was not clear from the methods described. In the laminectomy group, a kyphotic defor - mity developed in 13 patients (24%) with a 71% overall recovery rate, compared to the laminoplasty group with 3 patients (5%) with kyphotic deformities and an 80% over - all recovery rate. The extent of decompression was as - sessed, and those judged to have had full decompression had an approximately 90% recovery rate in both groups. The ROM was decreased from 30 to 21 \u00b0 after laminec- tomy, and 31 to 17 \u00b0 in the laminoplasty group. Statistical analysis did not indicate significant differences in overall recovery or ROM between the 2 groups. Kaptain et al. 21 reported on 46 patients undergoing laminectomy who underwent pre- and postoperative ra - diography. The development of a postoperative deformity (kyphosis) was more than twice as likely in patients with a \"straight\" preoperative spine (loss of lordosis) than in those with a normal preoperative lordosis. However, the preoperative spinal alignment was not shown to be pre - dictive of outcome. Kato et al. 22 described the outcome in 44 patients undergoing laminectomy with a 44.2% 1-year recovery rate that decreased slightly to 43 and 33% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. These authors found an inci - dence of 23% late deterioration (mean 9.5 years) and a 47% rate of postoperative kyphosis. The development of kyphosis did not appear to correlate with neurological de - terioration. Matsunaga and colleagues 23 compared postoperative kyphosis rates in 37 patients who underwent laminectomy to those in 64 patients who underwent laminoplasty with mean follow-up periods of 79 and 66 months, respectively. Postoperative kyphosis was noted in 11 patients (34%) in the laminectomy group and 4 patients (7%) in the lamino - plasty group. This report did not address functional out - come. Mikawa et al. 24 described 64 patients undergoing laminectomy and found that 36% had a change in post - operative alignment, and kyphosis developed in 14% with no effect noted on outcome. Comparison Studies Many authors have attempted to compare various procedures for the surgical management of cervical my - elopathy. The studies identified that specifically include data regarding laminectomy are included. The compara - tive studies summarized below are all Class III studies and are subject to bias. Overall it appears that laminecto - my in selected patients compares favorably to alternative strategies. Arnasson et al. 2 described 29 patients undergo - ing laminectomy for myelopathy with a 69% overall rate of improvement, compared to only 20% improvement with ACD and fusion, or 0% with conservative measures only. Age or preoperative duration of symptoms did not appear to impact results.J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009 Laminectomy for treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy 145Table 1: e videntiary summary of posterior laminectomy for cervical degenerative disease * Authors & Year Study DescriptionData Class Conclusions A dams & Logue, 1971 2 4 patients treated w/ laminectomy reviewed retrospec - tively.

(continued)J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009 Laminectomy for treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy 147Arnold et al.3 reported on 44 patients who under - went laminectomy in a nonrandomized series of 70 pa - tients treated for CSM. They observed early improvement (within 6 months) in 77% of patients who underwent laminectomy, and this improvement was maintained at late follow-up (mean 8 years) in 52%. This rate of im - provement was slightly less than that reported in patients who underwent anterior decompression, the majority of which were done using ACD (90% with early improve - ment, and 74% with late improvement). Most cases of late deterioration were in the laminectomy group. The authors hypothesized that late deterioration was related to post - operative instability. Benzel and associates 5 reported on 18 patients who underwent laminectomy, 40 patients who underwent laminectomy and dentate ligament section, and 17 who had anterior fusion. In this nonrandomized study there was no difference between any of the groups, with modi - fied Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improve - ments of 3.1, 2.7, and 3.0, respectively. There was no impact of dentate ligament sectioning and no increase in instability noted with posterior decompression. All pa - tients who underwent laminectomy and had substantial improvement ( 6 points) had normal radiographic align - ment preoperatively. Carol and Ducker 7 reported on a total of 206 patients with CSM including 125 treated with laminectomy, 81 with anterior decompression and fusion, and 10 with a combination. The authors reported long-term follow-up (mean of 10 years) in the nonrandomized groups. The study did not use standard outcome measures and did not provide any statistical analysis. The improvement rate of 68% for the laminectomy group was comparable with the 73% improvement rate in the anterior surgical group.

Ryken et al. 148 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009Ebersold et al.9 reported outcomes in 84 patients who underwent surgical treatment for myelopathy, 51 with laminectomy and 33 with anterior decompression and fusion. Six-month outcomes showed improvements of 69 and 73% in these groups, with long-term improvements of 37 and 55%, respectively. Despite the trend toward later deterioration in the laminectomy group, this outcome was noted in both groups, and the authors provided no statistical comparison. Only the preoperative duration of symptoms was shown to be associated with a worsened outcome. Age, severity of disease, extent of decompres - sion, and preoperative grade were all not predictive in this study. Gorter 13 published a review of the literature with a detailed report of 55 new cases comparing limited lamin - ectomy with wide laminectomy. The results between the 2 groups were comparable. In patients who underwent limited laminectomy, 60% were cured or improved ver - sus wide laminectomy in whom 67% were cured or im - proved (follow-up periods of 5.9 and 2.4 years, respec- tively). Gorter did not use validated outcome measures. Gregorius et al. 14 retrospectively reviewed 55 patients with cervical myelopathy including 29 who underwent laminectomy, and 26 who underwent ACD and fusion. The study did not use a validated outcome measure and treatment assignments were not randomized. There was a concerning trend of long-term late deterioration in the laminectomy alone group. Hamanishi and Tanaka 17 reported on their experi - ence with 69 patients with CSM. Thirty-four were judged as \"unstable\" on preoperative radiographs and under - went laminectomy and fusion. The authors compared this group to the remaining 35 patients who underwent laminectomy alone. The authors did not observe any significant differences between them, noting 51% im - provement in both groups (51.2 vs 50.8%) after a mean follow-up period of 3.35 years. Ishida et al. 18 compared 55 patients undergoing laminectomy with 55 patients under - going laminoplasty. This study was analyzed above in the kyphosis subsection. The authors assessed the extent of decompression. Those judged with \"full\" decompression had approximately a 90% recovery rate in both groups. The report by Kaminsky et al.20 had a case-control study design, and could possibly have qualified as Class II data. However, the authors did not perform their analysis in this fashion, and the study group was relatively small; some interesting data were provided, however. The design matched 22 laminectomy patients with 20 laminoplasty patients. Both groups showed improvement in their my - elopathy scores (Nurick scale), and an increase in motor recovery was demonstrated in the laminoplasty group. In the laminectomy group, a better outcome was associated with a smaller degree of preoperative deficit (r = 0.84; p < 0.0001). This result was consistent with the obser - vations of Nurick in the historic 1972 paper mentioned previously. Matsunaga et al. 23 compared postoperative kyphosis rates in 37 patients who underwent laminectomy with 64 patients who underwent laminoplasty with mean follow- up periods of 79 and 66 months, respectively. The au - thors reported postoperative kyphosis in 11 (34%) of 37 patients in the laminectomy group compared to 4 (7%) of 64 in the laminoplasty group; functional outcome was not addressed. Perez-Lopez et al. 27 compared a cohort of 19 patients with laminectomies to 17 patients who under - went laminectomy and fusion. They found a similar im - provement in Nurick score (0.84 vs 1.24) and an increase in postoperative kyphosis with laminectomy alone (7 vs 24%). Phillips 28 reported a study of 102 patients among whom 24 were treated with a cervical collar, 24 with laminectomy, and 65 with anterior decompression; over - all improvement rates were 37, 50, and 74%, respectively. In all groups, better results were seen in patients who had experienced preoperative symptoms for less than a year. Yonenobu et al. 29 reported the outcomes of 3 treat - ment groups: laminectomy in 24 patients, anterior seg - mental discectomy in 50, and anterior corpectomy in 21. The laminectomy group had a similar overall improve - ment to the anterior segmental decompression (both 3.3 points improvement on the Japanese Orthopaedic Asso - ciation scale). The best results were observed when 3 seg - ments were treated with corpectomy. The authors recom - mended laminectomies for 4-segment disease or more. Patients who underwent laminectomy had a 29% rate of late deterioration. Summary Historically, cervical laminectomies have been a safe and direct method for decompressing cervical spinal cord compression causing myelopathy. Large case series from the 1960s and 1970s and earlier have supported the use of this technique. At present laminectomy remains a vi - able consideration for the surgical management of cer - vical myelopathy. Concern has been raised over the de - velopment of postlaminectomy spinal instability, which may occur in 14-47% of patients who have had surgery for CSM. Whether this is related to reports of delayed deterioration in selected patients is not clear. Although postlaminectomy kyphosis may be frequently observed radiographically, it is less clear how it relates to the de - velopment of clinical symptoms. A straight or kyphotic alignment of the spine may predict a greater chance of late instability and kyphosis. Thus far, however, no study has clearly demonstrated a relationship between post - laminectomy kyphosis and deterioration in the quality of life of the patient. KeyIssuesfor FutureInvestigation Despite many years of experience reported with cer vical laminectomies, controversy remains over opti - mal patient selection. Many authors advocate always us - ing fusion in decompressed individuals, while others do not agree with this strategy, and others have focused on laminoplasty. None of these techniques may be consid - ered the best in all situations. Additional data collection would still be of benefit for this patient population, and randomization appears to be a feasible option. The development of specific predictors of success - ful clinical outcome, such as radiographic data, remains promising. Specifically, the study of any early radio -J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009 Laminectomy for treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy 149graphic evaluation that assists in predicting the develop - ment of postoperative kyphosis and instability would be beneficial.

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to examine the efficacy of cervical laminectomy and fusion for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Methods. The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to cervical laminectomy, fusion, and CSM. Abstracts were reviewed, after which studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Class I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations which contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer-review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Results. Cervical laminectomy with fusion (arthrodesis) improves functional outcome in patients with CSM and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). Functional improvement is similar to laminectomy or laminoplasty for patients with CSM and OPLL. In contrast to laminectomy, cervical laminectomy with fusion it is not associated with late deformity (Class III). Conclusions. Laminectomy with fusion (arthrodesis) is an effective strategy to improve functional outcome in CSM and OPLL. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.2.SPINE08727) Ke y practiceguidelines longitudinal ligament.

Cervical fixation: there is insufficient evi - dence to indicate whether the addition of cervical fixation improves functional outcome. Timing. There is insufficient evidence to make a rec- ommendation regarding timing of surgery. Rationale The purpose of this systematic review was to evalu - ate laminectomy and posterior fusion for treatment of CSM using an evidence-based approach. The authors of many studies have examined the technique of combin - ing posterior decompression with fusion. In this study, we included both laminectomy and laminoplasty techniques combined with posterior fusion. Laminectomy has been the traditional approach to spinal canal decompression in patients with CSM. Because of concern over deterioration from the long-term effects of resultant segmental instabil - ity and/or kyphosis, practitioners have developed - tives to cervical laminectomy. Laminoplasty preserves the neural arch and skeletal anchors for paraspinal mus - culature. This modification theoretically decreases the adverse effects of laminectomy while allowing adequate canal expansion. This technique is thought to work best in patients with neutral or lordotic spines and may not fare as well in kyphotic spines. Another alternative is lamine - ctomy and fusion, which allows posterior canal expansion and maintains stability. This modification theoretically avoids problems associated with laminectomy alone. Fur - thermore, with the use of internal fixation devices, it may allow reduction of kyphosis to lordosis, thereby broaden - ing indications for posterior spine surgery in the treat - ment of myelopathy. SearchCriteria We performed a computerized search of the National Library of Medicine database and the Cochrane database of the literature published from 1966 to 2007 using key - words and MeSH headings. Search terms included \"my - elopathy, cervical spine, fusion, laminectomy, lamino - spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament.\" A search using the subject heading \"laminectomy and cervical and arthro - desis\" yielded 345 citations. The following subject head - ings were combined: \"laminectomy and outcome and arthrodesis\" (244 citations) and \"laminectomy and ar - throdesis and myelopathy\" (329 citations). We acquired a total of 614 citations after accounting for redundancy. We selected only citations in English and reviewed titles and abstracts of the articles, and culled additional references from the reference lists of the remaining articles. Among the articles reviewed, we found 11 studies that dealt with cervical laminectomy and arthrodesis and outcome. Eight of these were internal case series examin - ing outcome pre- and postoperatively (Evidentiary Table 1), and 3 studies compared this treatment to other modali - ties (Evidentiary Table 2). The Cochrane database review on surgery of cervical myelopathy published in 2006 by Fouyas et al. 2 was reviewed. ScientificBackground No Class I or II evidence was available to determine the efficacy for laminectomy and fusion in patients with CSM or OPLL. We compiled evidentiary tables for the 8 Class III case series (Table 1) and for the 3 Class III stud - ies (Table 2) comparing laminectomy or laminoplasty to laminectomy and fusion. All of the studies that retrospec-tively reviewed the results of laminectomy and fusion demonstrated significant improvement of neurological function in the vast majority of patients (> 70%). Class III Investigations Gonzalez-Feria3 reported on 20 patients with CSM who underwent laminectomy with either facet wire fu - sion or spinous process plating augmented with polym - ethylmethacrylate. Five patients received Kiel bone (lyo - philized bovine bone) with wires. The Kiel bone acted as a strut between anchor points. The remaining 15 patients had fixation done with a \"crab plate,\" a long plate that anchored to the first full spinous process above and be - low the decompression. 3 The authors assessed follow-up using a modified Nurick scale over a period of 1-7 years. The authors reported neurological improvement in 85%. Four patients improved 1 grade, 5 improved 2 grades, and 8 improved 3 grades. There were 3 hardware failures re - quiring repeated operation. No critical radiographic anal - yses were performed. Gonzalez-Feria's paper provided Class III medical evidence. Study limitations included: retrospective small case series, multiple surgical tech - niques and absence of critical radiographic analysis. Al - though the neurological results were encouraging, it was unknown whether the fixation was effective in obtaining treatment goals. Mauer et al. 10 reported on their experience in the treatment of 10 patients with CSM who underwent mul - tilevel laminectomy and posterior lateral fusion using Luque rectangle and facet wires. The study evaluated pa - tients preoperatively and postoperatively using the Harsh scale (a 6-point ordinal scale evaluating gait). The aver - age length of follow-up was only 10.1 months with a range of 6-14 months. Nine of the 10 patients had subjective and objective improvement according to the Harsh scale. There were no neurological complications. However, the authors reported 3 wound seromas and 1 superficial infec- tion. At follow-up, all patients were thought to have bone fusion, although follow-up dynamic radiography was not performed. This paper provided Class III evidence be - cause of its retrospective nature, small sample size, short follow-up period, and lack of objective outcome criteria other than gait evaluation. Epstein 1 retrospectively reviewed 5 cases of OPLL treated with laminectomy and lateral mass fusion with facet wire fixation. Patients were evaluated with the Nu - rick scale, over an average follow-up of 13 months (range 6-20 months). Epstein reported improvement in the Nu - rick scale in all 5 patients. The average Nurick score im - proved from 4.4 (preoperatively) to 1.4 (at follow-up). Fu - sion occurred by 3.6 months in all patients. This study was Class III because of the small sample size, relatively short follow-up period, and lack of documented complications.P. A. Anderson et al. 152 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009Kumar et al.9 retrospectively reviewed their experi - ence in 25 patients with CSM at a mean 48-month fol - low-up. All patients underwent posterior laminectomy with lateral mass fusion and fixation. To be included, all patients had to have a minimum of 2 years of follow-up. The authors assessed patients preoperatively and postop - eratively by the Harsh scale for gait, and postoperatively with a modified Short Form-36. The authors reported im - provement on the Harsh scale in 76% of patients. Patients with less severe myelopathy (Grade IIIA or better) were statistically more likely to improve than more severely affected patients. Patients with poor outcomes according to the Harsh scale demonstrated a statistically significant increase in depression but not in social functioning. The authors did not report any change in alignment from the preoperative to postoperative period. Two patients had neurological complications, 1 from an epidural hematoma. This study provided Class III evidence showing the effi - cacy for laminectomy and fusion. The study was limited by its retrospective nature, the lack of precise inclusion or exclusion criteria that could have produced selection bias in indications for a posterior technique over an anterior technique, and the potentially lost patients who were ex - cluded because they did not have a 2-year follow-up. Huang and associates 8 retrospectively evaluated their experience in 31 patients with CSM or OPLL at a mini - mum of 6 months of follow-up (average 15 months). All patients underwent postoperative MR imaging at a mean of 3.8 months to assess adequacy of decompression and changes in cord signal. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Nurick scale. Twenty-two (71%) of 31 patients had improvement in Nurick score of 1 point. The pre - operative Nurick mean score was 2.6, and the postopera - tive score was 1.8; the difference was statistically sig - nificant. Postoperative MR imaging revealed that only 1 patient had residual mild cord compression, and this patient demonstrated significant neurological improve - ment. All 15 patients with preoperative myelomalacia had residual spinal cord abnormalities. There was no dif - ference in clinical improvement between patients with or without myelomalacia. Similarly, there was no difference based on neurological recovery with regard to patient age or duration of symptoms greater or less than 12 months. Pseudarthrosis developed in 1 patient, requiring a repeat - ed operation. The authors reported that all patients were thought to have solid arthrodeses at the last follow-up. Three deep wound infections requiring reoperation devel - oped in 3 patients, and 2 patients had C-5 root palsies that resolved. The study of Huang and colleagues provided Class III evidence for efficacy and safety of laminectomy and fusion for CSM. The study was limited because of its retrospective study design and potential selection bias on indications for surgery. The authors did demonstrate that laminectomy and fusion at appropriately selected levels resulted in adequate ventral and dorsal decompression of the spinal canal in the majority of cases. In addition, the study demonstrated a lack of improvement in cord signal changes after surgery; however, the presence of cord sig - nal changes did not correlate with neurological outcome. Houten and Cooper 7 retrospectively reviewed the charts of 38 patients with CSM or OPLL and straight or lordotic spines who underwent laminectomy and lat - eral mass plating. The study assessed outcomes using the modified JOA and Cooper scales and on imaging. Clini - cal follow-up was a mean 30.2 months with a minimum 6-month follow-up. Radiographic follow-up was only a mean of 5.2 months. Significant improvement in neuro - logical function occurred in 97% of patients. The modi - fied JOA score improved from 12.9 to 15.6. Radiographic alignment by the cervical index was unchanged postop - eratively. Postoperative MR imaging imaging revealed excellent decompression in all cases. Two neurological complications, a C-5 nerve root palsy and a radiculopathy from a misplaced screw, occurred along with one wound infection. The authors concluded that laminectomy and lateral mass fusion prevented kyphosis and resulted in neurological recovery equal to or greater than anterior approaches. However, the study did not provide a com - parison group. This study provided Class III evidence for efficacy of laminectomy and fusion. Only a small per - centage of patients treated for decompression were treat - ed with this approach at the authors' institution. Further - more, relatively short follow-up, inadequate radiographic evaluation to determine the fusion status, and potential hardware complications all limited this study. Morio and colleagues 12 reviewed 51 patients with my - elopathy from CSM or OPLL treated with French door laminoplasty and on-lay posterior lateral fusion. The au - thors assessed follow-up according to JOA score, radiog - raphy, and MR imaging at a mean 48 months (range 12- 108 months). Overall, the JOA recovery rate was 50.9%. The average JOA score increased from 9.7 to 13.4. Signif - icantly reduced motion was present at all fused levels, but pseudarthrosis was common. There was a significant cor - relation of better outcomes in patients who had < 30% of the preoperative motion. Other significant positive corre - lations were greater preoperative and postoperative spinal cord area and lordotic alignment. The spinal canal was adequately decompressed by MR imaging in all cases. This study provided Class III evidence for the efficacy of laminoplasty and fusion with on-lay bone graft. Similar to the report by Haminishi and Tanaka, 5 the laminoplasty technique resulted in adequate spinal canal decompres - sion. Neurological recovery was found to be related to the preoperative severity of spinal cord compression, that is, patients with less spinal cord plasticity having better neurological outcomes. However, the lack of the control group and retrospective nature of the study limited these conclusions. Miyazaki et al. 11 reported on 46 patients with CSM or OPLL who had spinal instability or deformity. Their patients underwent French door laminoplasty and on-lay posterolateral bone graft placement, with an average fol - low-up of 53 months (range 12-118 months). The authors evaluated patients using the JOA scale and plain radiog - raphy. Neurological improvement occurred in 89% of pa - tients. The authors reported improvement of 5 JOA points in 46% of patients, 3-4 points in 13%, and 1-2 points in 30%. Radiographic results were not as encouraging, however. Kyphosis increased 40%, and fusion failed in 35% of cases. However, the authors surmised that clini - cal stability was achieved despite nonunion in 80% of J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009 Laminectomy and fusion for degenerative cervical myelopathy 153cases. Progressive instability developed in 1 patient, and paraplegia developed 7 hours postoperatively in another. This Class III study included more seriously involved patients who had structural instability or deformity. The authors reported satisfactory neurological outcomes, but the radiographic results were poor; the noninstrumented technique of posterolateral fusion may have contributed to these poor radiographic results. Interestingly, the au - thors found no correlation between radiographic results and neurological outcome.TABLE 1: Summary of case series studies of laminectomy and fusion for degenerative cervical myelopathy * Authors & Year Description Results Class Conclusions Go nzalez-Feria, 197520 patients underwent CSM laminectomy & either wire facet fusion or spinous pro - cess plate. 1-7 year urological improvement in 17/20 (85%). 4 patients improved 1 grade, 5 two grades, & 8 three grades. 2 patients had plate failure.

Anderson et al. 154 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009Class III Comparative Studies Three studies compared results of laminectomy and fusion to other surgical techniques. These were all class III studies and had important methodological defects that limited their conclusions. Gonzalez-Feria and Peraita- Peraita4 performed a multicenter retrospective review of 525 patients with CSM treated in the Iberian Peninsula. The authors used the anterior approach in 195 patients, laminectomy in 242, a combined anterior and posterior approach in 42, and laminectomy and fusion with spinous \"crab plates\" process plates in 41 patients. In all treat - ment groups, 60% of patients improved neurologically and 6.5% deteriorated. There was an overall mortality of 3%. The average improvement by Nurick scale was 0.9. Comparison of results according to surgical method revealed that laminectomy and posterior fusion yielded significantly better neurological recovery compared to all other methods. Patients who underwent laminectomy and posterior fusion improved an average of 2.0 Nurick grades, whereas the mean improvement with the anterior approach was 1.2, and with laminectomy was 0.9. The average follow-up period was not specified. This report provided Class III evidence for the efficacy of laminec- tomy and fusion over other techniques. However, there were many methodological problems including surgical indication bias, lack of follow-up statistics, surgeon re - porting of neurological outcomes, and lack of radiograph - ic analysis. Hamanishi and Tanaka 5 reported on 69 patients with CSM who underwent laminectomy or laminectomy and fusion withs on-lay bone grafting onto the lateral masses. Thirty-five patients underwent laminectomy, and 34 un - derwent laminectomy and fusion. Indications for fusion were instability or lack of lordosis. Outcomes were as - sessed at a mean of 3.5 years postoperatively using the JOA scale and percent recovery. The authors found simi - lar rates of recovery (51% improvement in JOA score) in both groups. The time from onset of symptoms or injury strongly correlated to neurologic recovery in both groups. Radiographically, instability developed in 2 patients who did not undergo fusion, and progressive kyphosis dev - loped in 5. In the fusion group, only an 80% fusion rate was noted, and instability developed in 2 patients. Six of 35 (17%) patients who did not undergo fusion devel - oped kyphotic malalignment compared with 4 (12%) of 34 patients who underwent fusion. This study provided Class III evidence that fusion does not significantly add to neurological outcome. However, the 2 treatment groups were dissimilar in that the fusion group had instability or kyphosis and worse JOA scores. Any comparison of out - comes is therefore biased against the fusion group. Heller et al. 6 performed a matched cohort study in 26 patients with CSM or OPLL who underwent either by laminoplasty or laminectomy with lateral mass plate fixation and autogenous grafting. The mean follow-up pe - riod was 26 months (range 9-46 months). Patients who underwent fusion had worse kyphosis but less maximum stenosis. The study evaluated patients using the Nurick scale, subjective symptom reporting, and gait. The au - thors reported no statistically significant differences in neurological recovery between the 2 groups, and there were no differences in postoperative axial pain scores. In all instances, however, the authors observed better re - sults in the laminoplasty group. These patients had bet - ter functional outcomes as evidenced by better gains in Nurick scores; they also had a lower complication rate. Radiographically, there was no difference in alignment between the groups, although severe kyphosis developed in 1 patient who underwent fusion. There was a signifi - cant difference in complications rates between the 2 groups with no complications occurring in the lamino - plasty group. In the fusion group, 2 patients experienced neurological deterioration, a deep infection developed in 1 patient, 5 patients had pseudarthrosis, 2 patients had hardware failure, and in 1 patient, adjacent degeneration requiring anterior cervical decompression and fusion oc-TABLE 2: Summary of comparative studies on laminectomy and fusion for degenerative cervical myelopathy* Author & Year Description Results Class Conclusions G onzalez-Fer - ia & Peraita- Peraita, 19755 21 patients w/ myelopathy 41 who had & posterior fusion.

Fusion does not appear to make a difference in outcome in this series.J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 11 / August 2009 Laminectomy and fusion for degenerative cervical myelopathy 155curred. This study provided Class III evidence because of the selection bias that may have occurred in develop - ing the matched cohorts and due to the small sample size that probably resulted in insufficient power to measure the primary outcome variables. Additionally, there was a surgical selection bias, as kyphotic patients were more likely to undergo fusion. The data on complications were worrisome and favored laminoplasty over laminectomy and posterior fusion with plates. However, other authors with similar studies did not report these complications af - ter using similar fusion techniques. 7,8 Effect of Laminectomy and Fusion on Spinal Cord Compression There is evidence that laminectomy and fusion results in adequate decompression of both the ventral and dorsal aspects of the spinal cord as defined by MR imaging. Mo - rio et al.12 performed pre- and postoperative MR imag - ing at 3-6 months in 51 patients who underwent French door laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion. The spinal cord area increased by 25%, whereas the dural tube area increased by 230%. The authors found a positive correla - tion between larger preoperative and larger postoperative spinal cord area and recovery according to the JOA scale. Huang et al. 8 compared pre- and postoperative MR im - ages obtained at 3.8 months in 32 patients who underwent laminectomy and posterolateral fusion. All but 1 patient had complete spinal cord decompression. Spinal cord sig - nal changes (myelomalacia) were present in 40% of cases and did not change after surgery; this did not correlate to neurological recovery, however. Houten and Cooper 7 also reported complete decompression in all cases on postop - erative MR images. Fusion Technique The technique of fusion has evolved. Initially it was performed with on-lay posterolateral bone grafting into laminoplasty troughs or into facets. Documentation of fu - sion success was inadequate in all studies, but there ap - peared to be high rates of failures. Also deformity and instability occurred in some patients despite attempted fusion. The use of lateral mass wires and screw-plate constructs theoretically resulted in more stable constructs and higher fusion success. Although high fusion rates have been reported, the follow-up was often too short and adequate radiographic evaluation was lacking. Neurologi - cal complications related to misplaced screws have been reported. Accordingly, at this time, no evidence is avail - able to determine the best means to achieve stabilization and fusion. Summary Class I or II evidence to support the use of lamine - ctomy and fusion for treatment of myelopathy secondary to cervical spondylosis or OPLL does not exist. Class III evidence shows consistently that 70-95% of patients show postoperative neurological improvement. The overall re - covery is ~ 50% of the JOA score deficit. Laminectomy and fusion consistently results in ventral and dorsal spi -nal cord decompression. Insufficient data are available to adequately assess whether fusion occurs, although radio - graphic results do not seem to correlate with neurological outcome. Complications related to fixation include hard - ware failure with loss of alignment, radiculopathy, screw malposition, and the need for a repeated operation. KeyIssuesfor theFuture Indications for laminectomy and fusion compared with other techniques must be developed and tested with randomized, controlled studies. Theoretically laminec- tomy and fusion would be indicated when there is as - sociated instability or perhaps kyphotic deformity. It is possible that fusion may result in greater neurological recovery than maintaining motion by other techniques. This hypothesis necessitates carefully designed random - ized controlled studies to prove. The technique of fusion would best be evaluated using lateral mass plate or rod constructs. These techniques must be validated with long- term follow-up using dynamic radiography or CT to de - termine fusion status and complication rates.

Sasso, MD, Mark B. Dekutoski, MD, and Ziya L. Gokaslan, MD Background: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of surgical decompression on functional, quality-of-life, and disability outcomes atone year after surgery in a large cohort of patients with this condition. Methods: Adult patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of spinal cord compression were enrolled at twelve North American centers from 2005 to 2007. At enrollment, the mye-lopathy was categorized as mild (modied Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] score 15), moderate (mJOA =12 to 14), or severe (mJOA < 12). Patients were followed prospectively for one year, at which point the outcomes of interestincluded the mJOA score, Nurick grade, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2). All outcomesat one year were compared with the preoperative values with use of univariate paired statistics. Outcomes were alsocompared among the severity classes with use of one-way analysis of variance. Finally, a multivariate analysis that adjustedfor baseline differences among the severity groups was performed. Treatment-related complication data were collected andthe overall complication rate was calculated. Results: Eighty-ve (30.6%) of the 278 enrolled patients had mild cervical spondylotic myelopathy, 110 (39.6%) had moderate disease, and 83 (29.9%) had severe disease preoperatively. One-year follow-up data were available for 222(85.4%) of 260 patients. There was a signicant improvement from baseline to one year postoperatively (p < 0.05) in themJOA score, Nurick grade, NDI score, and all SF-36v2 health dimensions (including the mental and physical health com-posite scores) except general health. With the exception of the change in the mJOA, the degree of improvement did notdepend on the severity of the preoperative symptoms. These results remained unchanged after adjusting for relevantconfounders in the multivariate analysis. Fifty-two patients experienced complications (prevalence, 18.7%), with no signif-icant differences among the severity groups. Conclusions: Surgical decompression for the treatment of cervic al spondylotic was with im- provement in functional, disabi lity-related, and quality-of-l ife outcomes at one year of follow-up for all disease severity categories. Furthermore, complication rates observed in the study were commensurate with those in previously re-ported cervical spondylotic myelopathy series. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level II.

Although the majority of individuals over the age of fty years exhibit pathological orradiographic evidence of cervical degeneration, only aboutone-quarter of these develop symptoms of neurological im- pairment from mechanical neural compression 2-4. When signs and symptoms of myelopathy are present, the optimal treatmentapproach, specically the suitability of surgical spinal cord de-compression, remains controversial. This is largely due to mixedreports regarding the natural history of cervical spondyloticmyelopathy; although some patients experience progressivedisability, others remain static or improve with conservativenonoperative treatment 5. To date, we are aware of only one randomized controlled trial that has evaluated the efcacy of surgical decompressioncompared with nonoperative treatment for patients with cer- vical spondylotic myelopathy 6. trial mild myelopathy (modied Japanese OrthopaedicAssociation [mJOA] score 12) and failed to detect a difference in functional outcome between those treated conservativelyand those treated operatively. However, those ndings must bebalanced against results obtained from numerous observa-tional studies that indicate that between 30% to 50% of patientswith cervical spondylotic myelopathy will experience clinicalworsening over the course of follow-up when treated non-operatively, as summarized in reviews published in 2009 5,7. Traditionally, surgical decompression has been performed for cervical spondylotic myelopathy to arrest neurological dete- rioration and prevent further disability. However, several studieshave indicated improved clinical outcomes among patients with amajor preoperative decit who were treated surgically 8-10.T oo u r knowledge, no prospective analysis evaluating surgical outcomesin patients with mild, moderate, or severe cervical spondyloticmyelopathy has been published to date. The primary aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the impact of cervical spine decompressive surgery onfunctional, quality-of-life, and disability-related outcomes at oneyear of follow-up in a large cohort of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. We also compared outcomes among patients classied preoperatively as having mild, moderate,or severe myelopathy. Finally, to evaluate the safety of decom-pressive surgery for patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, we prospectively gathered complication data in the immediatepostoperative period as well as in the outpatient setting at up toone year of follow-up. Materials and Methods Subjects Patients with clinically and radiographically conrmed cervical spondylotic myelopathy were enrolled in a multic enter, prospective cohort study at twelve North American institutions from December 2005 to September 2007. Participating centers were all contributing members of the AOSpine NorthAmerica clinical research network SpineNet, which is a North American con-sortium dedicated to the research of spine-related disorders. The key inclusion criteria were an age of eighteen years or older, symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy, objective cervical cord compression as determined by magneticresonance imaging (MRI)11, no prior surgical treatment for myelopathy, and the absence of symptomatic lumbar stenosis. There were no restrictions onthe duration of symptoms or prior nonsur gical treatment. The study received approval from the institutional review boards at all participating sites and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00285337). Enrolled subjects received surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord combined with an instrumented fusion procedure. Specic surgical details, including the surgical approach (anterior, posterior, or circumferential) andthe number of vertebral segments decompressed and fused, were determinedby the attending spinal surgeon. Postoperative rehabilitation utilized the standard care at the treating institution and was not prescribed by the protocol. Outcome Measures and Follow-up Preoperatively, the baseline status of all patients was assessed with use of a variety of outcome measures including the mJOA scale12, the Nurick grade1,13, the Neck Disability Index (NDI)14,15, and the Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2)16. The mJOA and Nurick instruments are investigator-administered cervical spondy-lotic myelopathy-specic indices measuring the severity of functional and neuro-logical impairment. The mJOA instrumen t consists of four categories: motor dysfunction in the upper extremity, motor dysfunction in the lower extremity, sensory decit, and sphincter dysfunction. It evaluates the severity of myelopathy by allocating points according to the degree of dysfunction in each category. The total score is a sum of the scores in the individual categories and can range from 0 (worst) to 18 (best). The Nurick instrument is a six -grade ordinal scale based on an evalu- ation of gait abnormality. The minimum clini cally important difference (MCID) has not been established for the mJOA or Nurick instruments. The NDI evaluates patient self-reported disability related to neck conditions. The NDI score can range from 0 (best) to 100 (worst). The SF-36v2 is a widely used measure of patient generic healthstatus. The SF-36v2 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental ComponentSummary (MCS) scores were calculated with use of the 1998 U.S. norms and an orthogonal approach to transformation . These SF-36v2 subscores in a standard population have a mean value (and standard deviation) of 50 \u00b110. The reported MCID in cervical spine conditions is 7.5 for the NDI and 4.1 for the SF-36v2 PCS 14. Subjects were classied on the basis of the preoperative mJOA score as having mild (mJOA 15), moderate (mJOA =12 to 14), or severe (mJOA < 12) cervical spondylotic myelopathy; this represents a modication of the classi-cation used by Kadanka et al. 6. The primary follow-up time point was one year after surgery, at which time each of the described outcome assessments was repeated for each patient. In addition, complications were followed prospectivelywith use of a predetermined list of thirty anticipated complications associated withthe surgical treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Participating investi- gators prospectively evaluated the entire list of complications at six and twelve months after surgery and at all unplanned visits. External professional monitorsfurther veried the complication information by comparing reported events withpatients' medical charts and other available medical documentation. All reported events were categorized as either treatment-related complications or treatment- unrelated events by an independent spine surgeon with expertise in the surgicaltreatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Data Collection and Quality Assurance Professional clinical research monitors performed more than eighty site visits to ensure that the data were accurate, reliable, and complete. All data were transcribed into an electronic data capture system and were processed at theAOSpine North America clinical research network data management center. Statistical Methods Baseline descriptive statistics were calculated and characteristics were com- pared among the three severity classes with use of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Pearson chi-square test. Missing follow-up scores were as-sumed to be missing at random, and these scores were accounted for with use ofa multiple-imputation procedure involving ten imputation iterations. Such im- putation is recommended as being less susceptible to bias and more efcient than performing a completed-case analysis by dropping those cases with incomplete1652 THEJOURNAL &J OINT SURGERYdJBJS.ORG 2013EFFICACY AND SURGICAL DECOMPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHYvariables17,18. Utilizing the imputed data sets, paired t tests were used to compare patient outcomes at one year after surgery with preoperative patient status. T o evaluate the effects of preoperative disease severity on outcomes, one-wayANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used on the imputed sample to evaluatehow the changes in outcome varied among the three severity classes. T o adjust for differences in baseline confounders among the severity groups, we utilized a two- step procedure in which we rst screened for possible confounders by performinga univariate Pearson linear correlation between each predictor variable and the v a l u eo ft h eo u t c o m ev a r i a b l ea tt w e l v em o n t h sa n dr e t a i n i n gt h o s ev a r i - ables with a correlation coefcient p value of <0.2. The screened variables included demographics, baseline outcome parameters, the duration of symptoms,comorbidities, and the anatomical source of the stenosis. In the second step, we performed multivariate linear regression utilizing the predictors identied during the rst step and eliminated those covariates with a partial correlation coefcient of>0.1 in a step-wise fashion. This process was performed separately for each out-come variable. Finally, we performed two-way repeated-measures analysis of co- variance (ANCOVA) with time (baseline and twelve months), group (three severity groups), and the time \u00b7group interaction adjusted for the confounders identied in the previous step. The study had 80% power to detect a difference of 1.4 in them J O As c o r ea m o n gt h eg r o u p s ,b a s e do na no b s e r v e ds t a n d a r dd e v i a t i o no f2 . 7 .

Results Atotal of 278 patients met the eligibility criteria and under- went surgery for symptomatic cervical spondylotic my- elopathy. Patients were classied according to disease severity on the basis of the preoperative mJOA score; eighty-vepatients (30.6%) myelopathy, and eighty-three (29.9%)had severe myelopathy. Table I provides a summary of baselinecharacteristics for the entire study population according to pre-operative disease severity. Patient age at presentation differedsignicantly among the severity groups (p < 0.01), with the meanage decreasing from severe to moderate to mild disease. Meanpreoperative SF-36v2, NDI, and Nurick scores became progres-sively more favorable from severe to moderate to mild disease.The number of vertebral levels decompressed differed signi-cantly among the groups, with a more extensive decompression performed in patients with severe disease compared with those with moderate or mild disease (p < 0.01). There were no sig-nicant differences among the severity groups with respect to sex,smoking status, and preoperative symptom duration (p > 0.05). Seventeen of the 278 patients originally enrolled withdrew and one died of an unrelated cause prior to the twelve-monthfollow-up visit. Of the remaining 260 patients, 222 (85.4%) hadfollow-up data available at one year after surgery, includingseventy-one (91.0%) of seventy-eight with mild myelopathy,eighty-nine myelopathy, andsixty-two (80.5%) of seventy-seven with severe myelopathy. All outcome analyses were based on the 260-patient study group, with missing data imputed for the thirty-eight patients withoutavailable one-year follow-up. Table II presents the one-year outcomes in relationship to the preoperative baseline values. Overall, the mJOA score,TABLE I Preoperative Subject Characteristics According to Severity (7.55%) 2 (1.8%) 9 (10.8%) *The values are given as the mean and the standard deviation.1653 THEJOURNAL OF BONE &J OINT SURGERYdJBJS.ORG 2013EFFICACY AND SURGICAL DECOMPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHYNurick grade, and NDI score improved signicantly from base- line to one year postoperatively (p < 0.05). Signicant im- provements in health-related quality-of-life were observed for nine of the ten components of the SF-36v2 (p < 0.05), witha trend toward improvement for the remaining general healthcomponent. Table III compares outcomes among patients ac-cording to preoperative disease severity. Patients with mild diseasepreoperatively experienced the smallest improvement in themJOA score and those with severe disease experienced the largest(p < 0.01). No differences in improvement among the severitygroups were observed for the remaining functional, disability-related, and quality-of-life outcome measures that were assessed.The Appendix presents a comparison of outcomes among patients according to preoperative disease severity after adjust- ment for baseline covariates. Again, patients with mild dis- ease preoperatively experienced the smallest improvement inthe mJOA score and those with severe disease experienced thelargest (time \u00b7severity interaction [the interaction between improvement over time and preoperative disease severity],p < 0.01). No differences in improvement among the severitygroups were observed for the remaining functional, disability-related, and quality-of-life outcome measures at the time offollow-up.

Three patients had worsening myelopathy in the immediate postoperative setting,and two of these had improved to the baseline functional statusat the one-year follow-up visit. Discussion We believe that this study represents the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of surgical outcomes in a pro- spective cohort of patients with symptomatic cervical spondyloticmyelopathy reported to date. The broad eligibility criteria andprospective design indicate that the surgical outcomes describedshould be generally applicable to the majority of patients whopresent with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of cervicalspondylotic myelopathy and a compatible diagnosis on imagingstudies. The overall nding was that surgical intervention resultedin improvement in functional, disability-related, and quality-of-life outcomes at one year of follow-up. Furthermore, the degree of improvement observed at the time of follow-up did not depend on the severity of preoperative symptoms and was not affected byadjustment for baseline confounders. The one exception to thisobservation was the mJOA score, for which improvement wasdirectly related to preoperative disease severity, with patients withsevere myelopathy improving the most and patients with mildmyelopathy improving the least. This nding is likely attributableto a ceiling effect for this outcome measure: patients with milddisease are expected to experience smaller increments of im-provement as they cannot improve past a perfect score. The complication rate of 18.7% observed in this cohort was commensurate with documented rates ranging from 11% to 38% in comparable series of patients treated surgically forcervical spondylotic myelopathy 19,20. Moreover, the reporting of complications in our study was done in a rigorous, prospectivemanner with external monitoring. Hence, the rates of adverseevents reported in our study would be expected to be higherthan those reported in retrospective studies in the literature.The fact that the complication rates in the present study were inkeeping with those in the literature is noteworthy, as is the factthat most complications were transient and without long-termfunctional impact. The most common complication was post- operative dysphagia in a total of ten patients. Although three patients had worsening of the myelopathy in the initial postop-erative period, two of these patients improved to at least thebaseline functional level at one year of follow-up. In the present study, we grouped patients into three different categories according to the preoperative disease severity: mild(mJOA 15), moderate (mJOA =12 to 14), and severe (mJOA < 12). This is at variance with the approach used by Kadanka et al.,who dichotomized the mJOA score at 12 to distinguish mild cervical spondylotic myelopathy (mJOA 12) from severe myelopathy (mJOA < 12) 21. We incorporated the separate moderate level on the basis of a consensus among the study au- thors that an mJOA score of 12 to 14 reflects a substantial level of disability not compatible with a mild designation. The results of the current study with respect to treatment options for cervical spondylotic myelopathy must be consid-ered in the context of the existing literature. To date, the onlyrandomized controlled trial comparing surgical with conservativetreatment that we are aware of revealed no difference betweenthese therapies with respect to long-term functional outcomesin patients with mild cervical spondylotic myelopathy 6,21.H o w - ever, the conclusions of that study must be tempered by itsnotable methodological weaknesses, including unbalanced treatment groups, an underpowered analysis, and a substantial loss-to-follow-up rate 22,23. Second, the natural history of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy is unpre-dictable, with a large percentage of patients known to experiencea progressive functional deterioration when followed prospec-tively over time 24-27. At present, there are no reliable means to determine which patients will improve or remain stable andwhich will deteriorate. Third, there is convincing neuroanatomi-cal evidence that prolonged periods of spinal cord compression, asis seen in cervical spondylotic myelopathy, are associated withirreversible, detrimental pathological processes 28,29. We have shown that surgery for cervical spondylotic my- elopathy was associated with improvement in functional, disability-related, and quality-of-life outcomes over time, regardless ofbaseline disease severity. We did not incorporate a randomizedcontrolled design as this was considered logistically and ethicallyunfeasible. From an ethical standpoint, there was consensus amongthe authors that there was no treatment equipoise and that it wouldtherefore be inappropriate to withhold surgery from a patient withsymptomatic myelopathy and radiographic evidence of spinal cordcompression. Furthermore, from a logistical standpoint, if a ran-d o m i z e dt r i a lh a db e e nu n d e r t a k e n ,t h ec r o s s o v e rr a t ef r o mt h e nonoperative arm would likely have undermined the randomized study design, as has been observed in other recent clinical trials ofsurgical intervention for spinal disorders 30. Our design, in spite of its limitations, was deemed by the study investigators to be themost practical and ethical approach available to evaluate theimpact of surgical treatment on cervical spondylotic myelopathy. B e c a u s ep a t i e n t sw e r ep r o s p e c t i v e l ye n r o l l e da tt w e l v ed i f - ferent centers throughout North America, the ndings of thecurrent study have a greater degree of external validity than nd-ings of single-center studies. The use of many recruitment sitesallowed the accrual of almost 300 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, which is a substantially larger sample size than any other study performed to date. In addition, our use of four dif-ferent outcome measures allowed a comprehensive evaluation ofthe impact of surgery on patient outcomes. Lastly, the presence ofongoing external data monitoring helped to ensure the collectionof high-quality data including tre atment-related complications. In addition to the lack of a nonsurgical control group, the study has several other limitations. First, a 15% attrition ratewas observed at the one-year time point. We compensated forthese missing data through the use of a multiple-imputationprocedure, as is the recommended practice. A standardized sur-gical protocol was not utilized and different investigators might have opted to treat the same patient differently. However, in all cases the same goals of spinal cord decompression and sub-sequent stabilization were achieved regardless of the specicapproach employed. Furthermore, this treatment heteroge-neity is more reflective of current surgical practice, adding to1656 THEJOURNAL OF BONE &J OINT SURGERYdJBJS.ORG 2013EFFICACY AND DECOMPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH CERVICAL SPONDYLOTIC MYELOPATHYthe generalizability of the study ndings. W e have not explored the relative effectiveness of different surgical approaches on sur-gical outcomes; this question will form the basis of future analysesutilizing this data set. We compensated for the possible differencesamong the severity groups by performing adjusted analyses. Al-though such analyses have limitations, they represent the best possible approach to dealing with the confounding influence of extraneous variables in nonexperimental data. Finally, data re-garding the patients who were screened for study eligibility but notenrolled were not retained throughout the study period. In spiteof this, our decision to incorporate very broad enrollment criteriahelps to ensure the external validity of the study ndings. It isnoteworthy that the prospective data collection at the lead centerin the study included over 90% of the patients screened for en-rollment, which speaks to the generalizability of the data analysis. Overall, this large prospective multicenter analysis dem- onstrated that surgery for patients with cervical spondylotic my- elopathy resulted in improved functional, disability-related, and quality-of-life outcomes at one year of follow-up compared withthe preoperative status. Future studies will be required to moreaccurately dene which patients stand to benet the most fromsurgical intervention for cervical spondylotic myelopathy and todetermine the optimal surgical techniques used in a given patient.

The primary objective of surgery, when deemed appropriate, is to decompress the neural elements. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration. Since publication of the original guidelines there have been a significant number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion procedure. There is insufficient evidence, however, to recommend a standard approach to achieve a solid arthrodesis. When formulating the most appropriate surgical strategy, it is recommended that an individualized approach be adopted, one that takes into consideration the patient's unique anatomical constraints and desires, as well as surgeon's experience. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2014.4.SPINE14274) Key WoRDs fusion lumbar spine spondylolisthesis TLIF = transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; VAS Part Lumbar fusion for stenosis with spondylolisthesis 55 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 21 / July 2014Rationale Patients presenting with clinically relevant steno - sis associated with a spondylolisthesis may report signs and symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and/or low-back pain. A decompressive procedure is often required to alleviate the symptoms associated with the neurological compression syndrome; however, decompression alone can result in progression of the vertebral misalignment. In the original version of the Lumbar Fusion Guidelines, incorporating a postero - lateral lumbar fusion (PLF) as an adjunct to a lumbar decompression was considered an appropriate treatment alternative to prevent deformity progression and improve patient outcomes. Supplementation of the PLF with pedi - cle screw stabilization was considered an appropriate op - tion in the presence of a kyphosis or if instability was suspected. 26 The purpose of the current Guideline Update was to examine the current literature investigating the role of surgical intervention for patients with symptom - atic stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis and focus on the utility of lumbar fusion in this patient population. LiteratureSearch Several well-publicized randomized controlled clini - cal trials have been published since the last systematic review published in 2005.25 Accordingly, the literature search strategy was designed to reflect the existence of potentially high-quality evidence. The National Library of Medicine and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between July 2003 and Decem - ber 2011, using an electronic literature search engine (PubMed and the Cochrane Search Engine, respective - ly) with the following subject headings: (((\"Lumbosa - English[lang]). A total of 134 refer - ences were identified. The titles and abstracts of these 134 references were reviewed. Duplicates were discarded, as were nonsystematic reviews, case series, and retrospec- tive cohort studies with fewer than 100 patients. Studies focused on nuances of technique (i.e., choice of bone graft material for fusion) without comparison with nonoper - ated or nonfused patients were discarded. Studies com - paring substantially different procedures (i.e., interbody vs posterolateral fusion) were included in the literature review. Non-English language references were included if there was sufficient translation of key portions of the reference to allow review. The reference lists of previ - ously published systematic reviews were also reviewed to confirm completeness of the literature search.

This large (> 600 patient) multicenter prospective study was originally designed as a randomized trial, but flaws in the study design and the substantial crossover rate between treat - ment cohorts have led most, including the authors of this study, to focus on the results of the as-treated analysis. As a result, the randomization process was abandoned and the study regarded as a large well-controlled prospective cohort study. The SPORT group demonstrated that when patients are able to select their treatment strategy based on their symptoms, values, and surgical recommendation, those who choose surgery experience superior outcomes in every clinical measure and at every time point for at least 4 years following treatment. It is important to note that surgeons treated patients with decompression and fu - sion and were free to offer patients whatever technique of decompression and fusion they thought appropriate. 29,30 As a result of the study limitations, the SPORT provides Level II evidence in support of decompression and fusion for stenosis associated with a spondylolisthesis. In a companion study, Pearson and the SPORT in - vestigators reviewed preoperative radiographic measure - ments and 1-year follow-up data in an attempt to identify prognostic indicators of outcome following operative or nonoperative management. 24 Patients in the surgical co - hort exhibited superior outcomes compared with those treated nonoperatively; however, there were no preopera - tive radiographic features that predicted ultimate success. This finding was confounded by the fact that the choice of fusion technique was left to the discretion of the treat - ing surgeons. In the nonoperative arm, better outcomes were paradoxically associated with increased mobility at the level of the listhesis. Confounding factors between the \"stable\" and \"hypermobile\" groups such as sex, work status, and compensation status make it difficult to inter - pret these results. The strength of this study is reduced to Level III evidence supporting the role of surgery for stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis. 24 Surgical Technique Abdu et al.1 reviewed the results from the SPORT lumbar spondylolisthesis study and compared results across fusion techniques. The beneficial effects of surgery were maintained over 4 years, and patients reported sig - nificant improvement in every primary outcome measure (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and visual analog scale [VAS]) com - pared with their baseline status. No differences in out - come were detected between the different fusion cohorts (noninstrumented PLF, instrumented PLF, and PLF with an interbody graft). The potential for bias exist, however, because surgeons were free to choose the fusion technique, there were impor -D. K.

These confounding factors limit the ability to formulate relevant conclusions regard - ing the equivalence or nonequivalence of the various fu - sion techniques.1 Cheng and colleagues9 performed a randomized trial to evaluate the differences between PLF and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) following decompression in a group of 138 patients with degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis (Grade I or II). They found that fusion rates were higher and instrumentation-related complica - tion rates were lower in the PLIF group. However, func- tional outcomes were identical between the groups, and the study relied on static radiographs for the assessment of fusion. The fact that the majority of patients had isth - mic spondylolisthesis and that a high percentage of pa - tients had Grade II slips decreases the generalizability of these data to the degenerative population. Due to the heterogeneous patient population and questionable crite - ria to assess fusion status, the study was downgraded to Level II evidence in support of a PLF or PLIF following decompression for the treatment of degenerative spondy - lolisthesis. Consideration of interbody techniques may be appropriate in patients with higher-grade slips. 9 Fern\u00e1ndez-Fairen and colleagues12 performed a ran - domized trial in a cohort of 82 patients in whom they examined the effect of unilateral versus bilateral screw fixation as an adjunct to PLF following decompression for degenerative spondylolisthesis. While the sample size was relatively small, the study was powered to detect sig - nificant differences on validated outcomes measures and CT scanning was used to determine fusion status 3 years after surgery. The authors group observed no differences in functional outcomes or in fusion rates between the 2 groups and found that complication rates, blood loss, and operative time were lower in the group in which unilat - eral screws were placed. This study provides Level II evidence that unilateral screw fixation is associated with similar outcomes as bilateral screw fixation, but because the data are generated from a single study with a relative - ly small patient population, the validity of this conclusion is limited.

Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were limited to 1 year. Fusion status was assessed using static radiographs. Al - though no differences were detected between the treat - ment groups, the small sample size, short follow-up du - ration, and questionable method of fusion assessment compromise the conclusions formulated by the authors; therefore, this study is downgraded to Level II evidence in support of PLF over PLIF (Level II for outcomes and Level III for fusion status). 16 Kornblum and colleagues19 f o l l o w e d u p t h e n o n i n - strumented cohort from the Fischgrund et al. study13 for a mean of 7.7 years.

Resnick et al. 58 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 21 / July 2014was disabled from a stroke, and 1 declined to participate. They found that patients in this group who were thought to have a solid arthrodesis (based on dynamic radio - graphs) enjoyed better functional outcomes (as measured using VAS for pain assessment and the Stucki inventory) than patients treated with the same procedure in whom a solid arthrodesis was not achieved. 13,19 It was noted that those patients in whom arthrodesis was not achieved had significantly greater preoperative angular mobility. This paper provides Level III evidence as a case-control study showing that efforts to increase fusion rates are associ - ated with better outcomes in patients treated with fusion as an adjunct to decompression. McGuire and Amundson 20 studied a military popula - tion of patients with stenosis and spondylolisthesis and randomized a total of 27 patients to decompression and fusion with or without instrumentation. Fusion rates at 2 years, based on assessment of flexion-extension ra - diographs, were similar between the groups (72% with - out instrumentation vs 78% with instrumentation). This paper is felt to provide Level III evidence (small study, nonblinded, very select population with mean age of 35 years) that the addition of instrumentation does not im - prove fusion rates. 20 This paper was not included in the previous systematic review.25 Other papers have been discussed previously or pro - vide lower-quality evidence. Since some of these pro - vided the basis for the past recommendations, they are briefly discussed below. Andersen et al. 2 d e s cri bed l o n g - te rm o u tc o m e s f o l - lowing instrumented and noninstrumented fusion for chronic low-back pain but did not separate out patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. This is the same patient cohort previously described by Bjarke Christensen et al.6 Athiviraham and Yen5 described a cohort series of patients treated nonoperatively, with decompression alone, or with decompression and fusion. Only patients with spondylolisthesis underwent fusion. Due to this important difference between the patient groups in this prospective comparison, this paper is felt to provide only Level IV evi - dence. Bridwell and colleagues7 performed a pseudo-ran - domized study involving 43 patients treated operatively for stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis. Nine pa - tients decompression and instrumented PLF. Functional outcomes were bet - ter in the fusion group, and better functional outcomes were associated with arrest of slip progression and solid fusion. The use of instrumentation appeared to improve fusion rates as well as patient outcomes. The study was downgraded to a Level III study because the investigators used nonvalidated outcomes measures and relied on static radiographs for the determination of fusion. 7 This paper was previously reviewed in the 2005 Fusion Guidelines.25 Carreon and colleagues8 p e r f o r m e d a s y s t e m i c r e - view of the literature to evaluate the effects of fusion on different patient populations. They found that the pres - ence of an established diagnosis such as spondylolisthesis was associated with better functional outcomes compared with patients treated with similar procedures for chronic low-back pain without a demonstrable deformity. Because the analysis included very few spondylolisthesis patients (96 of 2002) and because the index studies are discussed elsewhere in this Guideline Update, the Carreon et al. re - view does not provide unique information regarding the treatment of this patient population. It does provide sup - porting evidence confirming that good outcomes may be expected in patients treated with fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Chou et al. 10 performed a systematic review of the literature regarding the surgical versus nonsurgical man - agement of low-back pain. While fusion for patients with stenosis was evaluated, spondylolisthesis and nonspondy - lolisthesis groups were considered together. No specific information regarding the treatment of patients with ste - nosis and associated spondylolisthesis is given. Christensen and colleagues 11 r a n d o m i z e d 1 3 0 p a - tients with isthmic spondylolisthesis, primary degenera - tive instability (back pain associated with movement and degenerative disc disease), or secondary degenerative instability (same as primary but with history of having undergone decompression) to PLF with or without in - strumentation. No differences between the 2 groups were detected; however, the patient population is not relevant to a discussion of patients with stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis. Andersen et al. 2 described long-term outcomes following instrumented and noninstrumented fusion for chronic low-back pain but did not separate out patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. This is the same patient cohort previously described by Bjarke Christensen et al.6 Fischgrund and colleagues13 performed a prospective clinical trial of 68 patients with stenosis and degenera - tive spondylolisthesis who were randomized into one of 2 groups: decompression and PLF in one group and de - compression and PLF supplemented with pedicle screw fixation in the other. Fusion status was assessed using plain and dynamic radiography, and clinical outcomes were assessed using a VAS for pain as well as a patient satisfaction scale. The patients treated with pedicle screw fixation had a statistically significantly higher fusion rate (83%) than those treated with noninstrumented fusion (45%). Both groups demonstrated significant score im - provements on the VAS for both back and leg pain (p = 0.001), and the majority of patients in both groups report - ed their outcomes as good or excellent (78% in the instru - mented group and 85% in the noninstrumented group). This paper provides Level I medical evidence that pedicle screw fixation, as an adjunct to decompression and PLF, improves fusion success, and Level III medical evidence (due to the nonvalidated patient satisfaction scale and in - adequate sample size), suggesting that pedicle screw fixa - tion does not improve functional outcome following PLF in this patient population. 13 This paper was previously discussed in the 2005 Fusion Guidelines.25 Gibson and Waddell14 performed a systematic review of randomized trials for the Cochrane Review in 2005. The authors did not review any references not reviewed in the previous guidelines document and did not consider patients with stenosis and spondylolisthesis separately. 25Part 9: Lumbar fusion for stenosis with spondylolisthesis 59 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 21 / July 2014Kanayama and colleagues17 perf ormed a small ran - domized controlled trial comparing osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) to autograft plus ceramic as fusion materials in a group of 19 patients undergoing instrumented PLF fol - lowing - dylolisthesis. The OP-1 group was found to have a slightly lower fusion rate as judged by CT scans, dynamic radio - graphs, and exploration. While new bone formation was noted in both groups, patients who underwent surgical reexploration for planned instrumentation removal were found to have a relatively high incidence of nonunion despite CT- and dynamic radiography-documented evi - dence of fusion. This paper does not contribute much to the discussion of treatment options for patients with ste - nosis and spondylolisthesis but does provide information regarding the limitations of imaging studies to provide information regarding the presence or absence of fusion (Level III diagnostic study as patients without radio - graphic fusion were not surgically explored to confirm/ refute fusion status). Kondrashov and colleagues 18 followed up 18 patients treated with the X-STOP device and found that beneficial effects appeared to be durable for a mean of 4.2 years of follow-up in their series (Level IV evidence). McNeely et al.21 performed a systematic review of the effect of physiotherapy on back pain in patients with vari - ous diagnoses including spondylolisthesis. They found that there was a paucity of evidence to support the effec- tiveness of physiotherapy for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. This paucity is the result of very few studies and the fact that patients with degenerative spon - dylolisthesis were not necessarily considered separately. Two randomized studies were reviewed: one on younger patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis 23 and the other on patients with chronic low-back pain and a variety of spi - nal alignments but without claudication.27 Mirza and Deyo22 performed a systematic review of trials evaluating the surgical management of low-back pain. The review did not separately consider patients with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Thomsen et al.28 performed a randomized controlled clinical trial of 130 patients who underwent lumbar fusion for low-back pain. The patients were randomized to in - strumented (pedicle screw fixation) and noninstrumented PLF groups. Overall, there was no significant difference in functional outcome (as measured by the Dallas Pain Questionnaire). Although this paper describes a random - ized controlled trial with validated outcome measures, the overall patient population was not that of stenosis and associated spondylolisthesis (isthmic spondylolisthesis, primary and secondary degenerative instability). Only a small subgroup of patients underwent decompression, and it is unclear whether these patients had associated spondylolisthesis. This paper was previously reviewed in the 2005 Fusion Guidelines. Welch et al. 31 provided information regarding a pro - spective case series of patients with stenosis and degener - ative spondylolisthesis who were treated with a dynamic fixation device. Overall results appeared promising; how - ever, no comparison cohort was described. This paper is felt to provide Level IV information regarding the poten -tial utility of dynamic fixation in select patients with ste - nosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis. 31 Zucherman et al.32 performed a prospective random - ized study to assess the efficacy of the X-STOP device for the treatment of mild to moderate neurogenic claudi - cation. The results relevant to this discussion have been presented by Anderson et al. 3 and discussed previously. Summary The current medical evidence continues to support the role of surgery over nonoperative therapies for pa - tients with symptomatic stenosis associated with spondy - lolisthesis. The vast majority of patients across these stud - ies underwent an instrumented PLF. The achievement of a solid arthrodesis is associated with superior outcomes, and therefore, efforts to maximize fusion potential should be considered. A variety of surgical alternatives may be considered. Surgeons should choose the technique based on their own experience, the risk of complications, and the individual patient's anatomical and physiological characteristics, comorbidities, and preference. It is rec-ognized, however, that within this patient population sig - nificant heterogeneity exists that may have an impact on treatment response. KeyIssuesfor FutureInvestigation The utility of surgical intervention in this patient population is well established. Future work should focus on identifying prognostic indicators of surgical outcome and stratify these factors among the various fusion tech - niques. Establishing well-designed randomized control trials to address these issues will be extremely difficult if not impractical (as exemplified by the SPORT), but rel - evant data may be obtained by establishing a prospective diagnosis-based registry.

When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

Patients typically describe activity-related low-back and leg pain that worsens with prolonged stand - ing or ambulation, compromising their quality of life. This is a relatively common disorder, particularly among the elderly, that can lead to significant disability. In the absence of an associated spinal deformity or instability, symptoms of neurogenic claudication typically respond to decompression in patients whose presentation and gen - eral health warrant operative intervention. The inclusion of lumbar fusion in the surgical management of this pa - tient population is unclear. Literature Search The National Library of Medicine was searched from July 2003 to December 2011 using the Internet- based search engine PubMed with the following search terms: OR ste - nosis[title]). The search was limited to the English lan - guage and human subjects. A total of 174 references were retrieved. The Cochrane database was also searched us - ing the same search terms, and no additional references were identified. The titles and abstracts of these references were reviewed, and papers dealing with basic science or patients presenting with spondylolisthesis or degenerative scoliosis were excluded, as were case reports, editorials, and nonstructured reviews. Thirty-six references were identified that provide either background information or new data regarding the role of fusion in patients with stenosis without spondylolisthesis or scoliosis. Studies providing comparative data between fusion and nonfu - sion procedures serve as the scientific foundation of this review and are summarized in Table 1. ScientificFoundation The benefits of surgical decompression for lumbar stenosis, coupled with a fusion in the presence of radio - graphic instability or spondylolisthesis, have been well documented. Malmivaara et al. conducted a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of surgical ver - sus nonsurgical intervention in 94 patients with mild to moderate symptoms of neurogenic claudication due to spinal stenosis. 8 Although the investigators performed a power analysis to determine sample size, the number of patients included in each cohort did not meet the prede - termined threshold. Objective validated outcome instru - ments were used to assess clinical status prior to surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. At the discre - tion of the treating surgeon, 10 of the 50 patients in the surgical cohort underwent fusion, with or without instru - mentation, because of the presence of spondylolisthesis. Patients who were treated surgically had statistically sig - nificant clinical improvements in the Oswestry Disabil - ity Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) compared with those treated nonoperatively, which persisted over the study period. Study limitations, however, did exist, including small sample size, heterogeneity of the patient population and surgical intervention, and unblinded as - sessment of clinical and radiographic outcome. Due to these limitations, the paper was downgraded to Level II evidence, supporting surgical decompression as an effec - tive modality for patients with mild to moderate symp - toms of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis. Because of the small number of patients undergoing fu - sion, no valid comparison between decompression and decompression with fusion can be performed. Athiviraham and Yen performed a prospective co - hort study in a group of 125 patients comparing operative to nonoperative management for neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis. 1 Patients with isolated stenosis underwent lumbar decompression, while those with an associated spondylolisthesis underwent fusion. Overall outcomes were substantially improved in both surgical groups compared with the nonsurgical cohort. Due to several study design limitations, including small sample size and potential for selection bias, this investigation provides Level III evidence in support of operative inter - vention for the treatment of spinal stenosis. Despite the evidence supporting the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with spondylolisthesis or ra - diographic instability, there remains considerable debate with respect to patients presenting only with stenosis. Al - though clinical success has been documented in patients undergoing both decompression and fusion for stenosis, the majority of these studies are based on a compromised study design and provide low levels of evidence. Grivas et al. performed a retrospective review of 23 patients who were treated with decompression and fusion with or without instrumentation for neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis. 4 Five of the 23 patients had an asso - ciated spondylolisthesis. The authors found that all pa - tients showed improvements on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, with the instrumented group showing a greater improvement. This case series provides Level IV evidence that improved outcomes can be achieved with decompression and fusion in the lumbar stenosis popula - tion, but it does not provide any evidence regarding the relative benefit of fusion in addition to decompression. Gu et al. performed a retrospective review of 81 pa - tients who underwent surgery for neurogenic claudica - tion due to lumbar stenosis. treated with decompression and posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF), and 38 were treated with decompression and instrumented PLF. All patients were subsequently treated with 3-4 weeks of bed rest followed by gradual mobilization. Both groups of patients improved, and there were no differences in outcomes between the groups at a mean follow-up of 6.2 years. Both groups included a fair number of patients with spondylolisthesis or radiographic evidence of instability. While there were no overall dif - ferences between the groups with regard to the presence or absence of spondylolisthesis or radiographic instability preoperatively, the authors stated that they preferred to use instrumentation in younger or more active patients. The overall success rate was just over 70% in both groups. D. K. Resnick et al. 64 J Neurosurg: Spine / Volume 21 / July 2014This paper does not address the issue of fusion versus no fusion in the lumbar stenosis population without defor - mity or instability. Jansson et al. performed a retrospective review of 9664 operations performed for lumbar stenosis in the Swedish population with 10-year follow-up and reported a reoperation rate of 11%.6,7 E i g h t y - n i n e p e r c e n t o f p a - tients were treated with laminectomy alone, and 11% were treated with laminectomy and fusion with or with - out instrumentation. They noted that reoperation rates were lower in patients who had undergone a fusion in addition to decompression as opposed to decompression alone. Because the data were drawn from an administra - tive database and because no information is provided re - garding why the patients were selected for fusion versus nonfusion procedures, the study does not provide useful information with regard to the benefit of fusion as an ad - junct to decompression for lumbar stenosis without defor - mity or instability. Rampersaud et al. performed an interesting study comparing benefits measured by standard health utility indexes between patients treated with surgery (decom - pression with or without fusion) for lumbar spinal steno - sis or with joint arthroplasty of the hip and knee. 9 The authors found that benefits were comparable or superior in the group treated for lumbar stenosis over 2 years. Pa - tients with spondylolisthesis were included in the stenosis group. While no differences were detected between the fusion and nonfusion subgroups of patients who under - went surgery for lumbar stenosis, differences in selection criteria make a direct comparison impossible. This pa - per provides Level IV evidence regarding the relative ef - fectiveness of surgery for neurogenic claudication due to lumbar stenosis but does not provide useful information regarding the utility of fusion in patients without defor - mity.Trouillier and colleagues performed a retrospective review of 85 patients who underwent surgery for neuro - genic claudication. 11 Patients were treated with minimal decompression, extensive decompression, or extensive decompression and instrumented fusion. Surgical deci - sion making was dependent on the severity of stenosis, as determined by preoperative myelography, and/or the pres - ence of instability, defined either on preoperative imaging or during intraoperative assessment. Patient response was measured utilizing validated outcome measures, includ - ing the ODI and VAS, for a mean follow-up period of 79 months. All patients improved; however, patients with less extensive surgery tended to do better. Six of 16 pa - tients with extensive decompressions without fusion de - veloped radiographic evidence of instability, defined as greater than 5-mm translation on dynamic radiographs. The paper provides Level IV evidence on the effective - ness of decompression for symptoms of neurogenic clau - dication and supports the role of fusion in cases in which there is preoperative radiographic or intraoperative evi - dence of iatrogenic instability. Yamashita et al. studied the relationship between functional disability, patient satisfaction, and walking ability in a cohort of 77 patients who were treated with decompression with or without fusion. 13 They found that patients improved in all outcomes measures but that pa - tient satisfaction was not always tied to functional im - provement as defined by the ODI. Persistent difficulty in walking was associated with lower patient satisfaction. Patients were chosen for fusion based on the preoperative diagnosis of spondylolisthesis, so no comparison between decompression alone or decompression plus fusion can be made. Zouboulis and colleagues performed a prospective evaluation of a group of 41 patients who were treated with laminectomy and instrumented fusion for stenosis. 14 The TABLE 1: Lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis: summary of evidence* Authors & Year Description Level of Evidence Results Conclusion Malmivaara et al., 2007Randomized controlled trial comparing surgical intervention w/ nonsurgical intervention in a group of pts w/ moder- ate symptoms of neurogenic clau- dication.

Overall, functional outcomes were improved over a mean of 3.7 years. Ninety-five percent of patients reported satisfactory results; however, 3 patients required further stabilization surgery during the follow-up period. This paper provides Level IV evidence that decompres - sion and fusion provides benefit to some patients with lumbar stenosis, but it does not provide useful evidence regarding the role of fusion in patients without deformity or instability. 14 Previous structured reviews of the literature have been performed using a variety of methodologies. Res - nick et al., Gibson and Waddell, Watters et al., and Chou et al. all reviewed the available literature and all concluded that in the absence of deformity or instability, the perfor - mance of lumbar fusion was not associated with improved outcomes compared with decompression alone. 2,3,10,12 Summary Recent publications continue to support the role of surgical intervention over nonoperative management strategies for the treatment of symptomatic lumbar ste - nosis. For those patients presenting with uncomplicated lumbar stenosis, the literature has consistently demon - strated a beneficial role of lumbar decompression. To date, there have been no high-quality studies com - paring the efficacy of simple decompression with decom - pression and fusion in patients presenting with stenosis without an associated degenerative deformity. The major - ity of studies are compromised by a heterogeneous cohort of patients with respect to presenting diagnosis and a lack of standardized surgical approaches. Formulating valid conclusions comparing decompression with decompres - sion and fusion is therefore impossible. In fact, the true effect of lumbar fusion for uncomplicated stenosis can - not be determined since most, if not all, of these studies reserve lumbar fusion for those patients presenting with stenosis and an associated spondylolisthesis. KeyIssuesfor FutureInvestigation It seems highly unlikely that a well-designed inves - tigation will be conducted or is required to compare the efficacy of lumbar decompression with decompression and fusion in patients presenting with uncomplicated lumbar stenosis. It seems more plausible that creation of prospective patient registries will allow the identification of a specific subgroup of patients presenting with routine lumbar stenosis that may benefit from the inclusion of a lumbar fusion. Once this profile is established, a more comprehensive well-designed comparative study could be conducted to determine the true treatment effect of lumbar fusion.

Question source : Kim Wentz, MD, HSD medical director; Hill -Rom Issue : Chest wall oscillation involves using devices/systems for clearing excess mucus from lung airways (bronchi and bronchioles ). It is principally used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis , but is gaining use in the treatment of other diseases, such as bronchiectasis , COPD , cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy , in which excessive mucus can block airways due to excessive production or impaired clearance. Chest wall oscillation was a new CPT code for 2014. This code was reviewed during the CPT code review in late 2013. At that time, a Cochrane review (Morrison 2011) was reviewed, which did not find good evidence that chest wall oscillation was more or less effective tha t other tre atments (mainly PT). Other major insurers (CMS, Aetna, NHS) were covering this procedure and the initial staff recommendation was for coverage. The VBBS discussion involved the fact that this modality was no more effective that other treatment modalities; a cost -effectiveness comparison was requested. That cost comparison was done in January, 2014, and mechanical chest was oscillation was found to be substantially more expensive that other treatments ($37 -45/month rental or $1,100 purchase vs one time PT training for caregivers); although comparable to some therapies ($50/mo for flutter device, $39/mo for PEP device). The VBBS/HERC decision was to add this therapy to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage List as being less cost effective than equally efficacious therapies . Dr. Wentz has requested reconsideration of coverage for mechanical chest wall oscillation due to multiple requests for this service that have been received by HSD. The cases HSD are seeing are those in which a patient fails other therapy or for whom therapies like home PT are not feasible. The HSD request is for consideration of chest wall oscillation as a second line therapy. Evidence --cystic fibrosis I. Morrison 2014 (update of previous review), Cochrane review of chest oscillation devices for cystic fibrosis (CF) i. N=35 studies (total of 1050 participants) ii. One long -term study (seven months) compared oscillatory devices with either conventional physiotherapy or breathing techniques and found statistically significant diffe rences in some lung function parameters in favour of oscillating devices. iii. One study identified an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure . iv. There were some small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devices. v. Authors' conclusions There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. The findings from one study showing an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscillating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may have significant re source implications. More adequately -powered long -term randomised controlled trials are necessary and Mechanical Chest Wall Oscillation 2 outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, patient preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Increased a dherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters, such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined with other forms of airway clearance is efficacious i n people with cystic fibrosis. II. Main 2013, Cochrane comparison of PT vs other airway clearance techniques for cystic fibrosis i. N=15 studies (475 participants) ii. There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude any differences, between CCPT and other airwa y clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function measured by standard lung function tests. Studies undertaken during acute exacerbations demonstrated relatively large gains in respiratory function irrespective of airway clearance technique. Longer -term studies demonstrated smaller improvements or deterioration over time. Ten studies reported individual preferences for technique, with participants tending to favour self - administered techniques. Heterogeneity in the measurement of preference precluded these data from meta -analysis. iii. Authors' conclusions: This review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of CCPT over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equ ivalence between methods. There was a trend for participants to prefer self - administered airway clearance techniques. Limitations of this review included a paucity of well -designed, adequately powered, long -term trials.

N=5 studies (51 participants) 1. 4 adult, 1 pediatric 2. Looked at a variety of airway clearance techniques, including mechanical chest oscillation ii. Heterogeneity between studies precluded these data from meta -analysis and the review was therefore narrative. iii. One study on 20 adults comparing an airway oscillatory device with no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low -quality evidence). iv. No data were available to assess the impact of ACTs on the time t o exacerbation, duration of, incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in health -related quality of life in both disease -specific and cough -related measures. While based o n a small number of participants and the data were skewed, the median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 8.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon), low -quality evidence). v. Two studies reported mean increases in volume of sputum expectorated with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% CI 3.4 to 13.4 mL) Mechanical Chest Wall Oscillation 3 and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02), with no significant effect on lung function. vi. One study re ported an immediate reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation in adults with non -positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared to no ACTs. A similar decrease in pulmonary hyperinflation (difference in FRC of 6%) was found in children using an airway oscillatory device for 3months compared to sham therapy. vii. No studies reported on the effects of gas exchange, people's symptoms or antibiotic usage. viii. Authors' conclusions: ACTs appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis, where there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health -related quality of life. The role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. In view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, more data are needed to establish the clinical value of ACTs over the short and long term on patient -important outcomes, including symptoms, on physiological outcomes which may clarify the rationale for each technique and on long -term parameters that impact on disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis. This is necessary in order to provide further guidance of specific ACT prescription for people with bronchiectasis. It may also be important to establish the comparative effect of different types of ACTs in people with bronchiectasis.

Oscillatory techniques such as high -frequency chest wall oscillation and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation should be considered in children who have difficulty mobilising secretions or who have persistent atelectasis, despite use of other airway cleara nce techniques.

Cohort study of claims data, patients with a variety of neuromuscular disease b. N=426 patients c. Total medical costs pe r member per month decreased by $1,949 (18.6%) after initiation of HFCWO (P = 0.002). Inpatient admission costs decreased by $2,392 (41.7%) (P = 0.001), and pneumonia costs decreased by $514 (18.1%) (P = 0.015). d. Conclusions: Total medical costs, hospitalizations, and pneumonia claims were less after than before initiation of HFCWO in a broad group of patients with neuromuscular disease. Subject to the limitations that administrative data did not capture how HFCWO was used and that HFCWO may be a m arker of generally better care, our findings lend support to the routine use of this intervention in the care of patients with neuromuscular diseases .

Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cysti c brosis (Review) Morrison L, Agnew J This is a reprint of a Cochrane review, prepared and maintaine d by The Cochrane Collaboration and published in The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 7 http://www.thecochranelibrary.com Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cys tic brosis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Main results The searches identied 68 studies with a total of 288 reference s; 35 studies (total of 1050 participants) met the inclusion crit eria. Studies varied in duration from up to one week to one year; 20 o f the studies were cross-over in design. The studies also varie d in type of intervention and the outcomes measured, furthermore data were not published in sufcient detail in most of these studie s, so meta- analysis was limited. Few studies were considered to have a lo w risk of bias in any domain. It is not possible to blind partici pants and clinicians to physiotherapy interventions, but 10 studies di d blind the outcome assessors. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the most frequently measured outcome. One long-term study (seven months) compared oscillatory devices with either conventional physiotherapy o r breathing techniques and found statistically signicant dif ferences in some lung function parameters in favour of oscillating devices . One study identied an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure. There were so me small but signicant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devi ces. Participant satisfaction was reported in 15 studies but this w as not specically in favour of an oscillating device, as some par ticipants preferred breathing techniques or techniques used prior to th e study interventions. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufcient detail to provide a ny high level evidence. Authors' conclusions There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less ef fective intervention overall than other forms of physiother apy; furthermore there was no evidence that one device is superior t o another. The ndings from one study showing an increase in fr equency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscill ating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may hav e signicant resource implications. More adequately-powered long-term ran domised controlled trials are necessary and outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, patient preference, adher ence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Incre ased adherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters , such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Addition al evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined wit h other forms of airway clearance is efcacious in people with cyst ic brosis. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y The use of vibrating devices to help people with cystic bros is clear their airways of mucus Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vibrating devices (e .g. Flutter, acapella, cornet, Quake\u00ae, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, high frequency chest wall oscillators (e.g. Vest), VibraLung and MetaNeb) to help people with cystic brosis clea r their airways of mucus. Background People with cystic brosis have too much sticky mucus in their lun gs which can lead to constant infection and inflammation. This damages their airways and worsens lung function over time. Pe ople with cystic brosis use chest physiotherapy to clear the mu cus from their lungs. They can use different methods alone or in com bination with others - manual techniques, breathing techniqu es and mechanical devices. Vibrating devices (also sometimes known as o scillators) use pressure generated either inside or outside of the body to clear the mucus. Search date We last looked for evidence on 13 January 2014. Study characteristics The review included 35 studies with 1050 people with cystic br osis aged between 4 and 63 years of age .Studies compared different physiotherapy treatments and people were selected for one tr eatment or the other randomly. Not many studies looked at the same types of physiotherapy over the same period of time; studies range d in duration from 2 days to 13 months. Key results Given the differences in study design, it was difcult to combin e the results from these studies in a useful way. 2 Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cys tic brosis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.We did not nd any clear evidence that vibrating devices were bet ter than any other form of physiotherapy which they were compar ed to in these studies, or that one device was better than another. O ne study found that patients using an vibrating device needed additional antibiotics for a chest infection more often than those using po sitive expiratory pressure. When recommending the most suita ble method of airway clearance, physiotherapists should consider the needs of the people they are treating. For the future, larger and longer trials are needed to measur e the frequency of lung infections, preference, adherence to and general satisfaction with treatment. We think adherence is important , because if people with cystic brosis are willing to stick to th eir physiotherapy regimen, there may be improvements in other o utcomes such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Quality of the evidence Overall, we thought most studies had some design problems wh ich might affect our condence in some of the results. In about a quarter of studies there were concerns that not all the results were reported clearly and in about a third of the studies the re asons for people withdrawing from a trial were not clearly explained. I n comparisons of different types of physiotherapy, a person a nd their physiotherapist will always know which treatment they are re ceiving and this might affect their answers to some questions, such as which treatment makes them feel better, but we only thought th is was a problem in a few studies. B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Cystic brosis (CF) is a common inherited life-limiting geneti c disorder. The genetic defect causes mucus hypersecretion withi n the airways leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging (Zach 1990 ). Airway damage and progressive loss of respiratory function is a consequence of persistent infection and inflammati on within the lungs ( Cantin 1995 ;Konstan 1997 ). Description of the intervention Chest physiotherapy is currently implemented at initial dia gnosis. It is recommended that it should be carried out for the mainte- nance of a clear chest with an additional recognition for altered or more aggressive therapies during times of respiratory ex acerba- tion. Dependent on the age of the individual, chest physiothe r- apy will traditionally take the form of manual therapies. Co nven- tional manual therapies would require the assistance of anot her person to perform the techniques of percussion and vibrations , with the addition of postural drainage when this was felt to a dd to the technique. With the advent of a more modern approach to physiotherapy, self-administered techniques are more frequ ently used. These self-administered techniques do not necessitate p os- tural drainage or indeed the assistance of another person. Th ey can be done in a sitting position (if preferred) and use differe nt methods of breathing or different devices to assist mucus clear - ance. Oscillatory devices are designed to interrupt the expira toryairflow. are either intra- or extra-thoracic. Intr a-tho- racic oscillatory devices are placed in the mouth and provide res is- tance during exhalation which results in the airways vibratin g thus loosening the mucus. Extra-thoracic oscillatory devices, such as an inflatable vest attached to a machine, vibrate at variable freq uen- cies and intensities as set by the operator to ensure the indiv idual's comfort and associated concordance. Fuller descriptions of all th e interventions to be compared in the review can be found below in Types of interventions . In this review we have considered the use of oscillation and osci l- latory devices as a means of airway clearance and the consequent impact this type of intervention has on the individual with CF and in particular when compared with other recognised forms of airway clearance. How the intervention might work Respiratory infections are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF and therefore chest physiotherapy is consider ed to be an important treatment for the assistance and clearance of the sticky mucus found within the airways of people with CF . Oscillations, or interruptions in expiratory airflow have be en postulated to mechanically reduce the viscoelasticity of sputum and enhance mucociliary clearance ( Newbold 2005 ). Oscillations, both internally and externally, have also been considered to im- prove airway patency by preventing spontaneous compression through the introduction of alternating positive pressure w here the consequent vibration loosens mucus allowing ease of expect o- ration ( Oermann 2001 ;Pryor 1994 ). 3 Oscillating devices for airway clearance in people with cys tic brosis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Cystic brosis is an inherited life-limiting disorder, chara cterised by infections and thick airway secretions. C hest phys- iotherapy has been integral to clinical management in facilita ting removal of airway secretions. Conventional chest physio therapy techniques (CCPT) have depended upon assistance during treatm ents, while more contemporary airway clearance techniques are s elf- administered, facilitating independence and flexibility. Objectives T o compare CCPT with other airway clearance techniques in terms o f their effects on respiratory function, individual preferen ce, adherence, quality of life and other outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorder s Group T rials Register which comprises references identied f rom comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also search ed CINAHL from 1982 to 2002 and AMED from 1985 to 2002. Date of most recent search: 01 September 2008. Selection criteria Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials including thos e with a cross-over design where CCPT was compared with other air way clearance techniques. Studies of less than seven days duration were excluded. Data collection and analysis T wo authors allocated quality scores to relevant studies and i ndependently extracted data. If we were unable to extract data , we invited authors to submit their data. We excluded studies from meta-an alysis when data were lost or study design precluded compariso n. For some continuous outcomes, we used the generic inverse variance method for meta-analysis of data from cross-over trials and dat a from parallel-designed trials were incorporated for comparison. W e also examined efcacy of specic techniques and effects of treat ment duration. 1 Conventional chest physiotherapy compared to other airway clearance techniques for cystic brosis (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Wolfe2, and Kevin D. Frick3 1Department of Medicine and3Carey Business School and Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; and2Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois Abstract Rationale: People with neuromuscular disease frequently have dif culty clearing pulmonary secretions, which leads to pneumonia and respiratory failure. High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is one intervention used to facilitatesecretion clearance. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine if H F C W Ot h e r a p yl e a d st oi m p r o v e do u t c o m e sa sm e a s u r e dby lower healthcare use for patients who have a chronic neuromuscular disease. Methods: We performed a cohort study comparing healthcare claims before and after initiation of HFCWO. Data were obtainedfrom two large databases of commercial insurance claims. Study subjects were commercial insurance members with an International Classi cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code for a neuromuscular disease and a claim for HFCWO between 2007 and 2011. The study included both children and adults.Measurements and Main Results: There were 426 patients in this study. Their mean age was 29.9 622 years. Total medical costs per member per month decreased by $1,949 (18.6%) afterinitiation of 0.015). To account for the possibilities of misclassi cation based on diagnosis and bias due to loss to follow-up, we compared outcomes between those lost to follow-up and those not, and we found similar results. Conclusions: Total medical costs, hospitalizations, and pneumonia claims were less after than before initiation of HFCWO in a broad group of patients with neuromuscular disease. Subject to thelimitations that administrative data did not capture how HFCWOwas used and that HFCWO may be a marker of generally better care, our ndings lend support to the routine use of this intervention in the care of patients with neuromuscular diseases.

These include illnesses such as muscular dystrophies(2, 3) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) (4, 5). Respiratory muscleimpairment leads to dif culty with coughing and clearing respiratory secretions and subsequent mucous plugging and pulmonary infections (6 -8). These events are a prominent source ofhealthcare needs comprising prolongedhospitalizations and use of costly medical devices (7, 9). Techniques to assist with secretion clearance are widely recommended and caninclude both mucus-mobilizing techniques(10) and assisted cough techniques (11, 12). 904 AnnalsATS Volume 13 Number 6 |June 2016 "}
