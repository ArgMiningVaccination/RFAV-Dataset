Wrung out? Stressed out? Feel like you are burning out? Take a meditative time out with Dee. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, over worked, stressed or invisible? Feeling like an imposter in your own skin, doubting your own ability, constantly pleasing others and feeling guilty about even trying to put yourself first? What about these? Loss of perspective, trouble sleeping, loss of focus, just not being able to switch off? Our modern life constantly bombards us with information that overstimulates us and knocks our nervous and hormonal systems into overdrive as they struggle to keep us safe and healthy. When we stay in this state of overdrive for prolonged periods our bodies become stressed, which then manifests as a myriad of negative physical symptoms. Immersive Guided Meditation is a tool for individuals to tune into their own bodies and turn down the effects of the external stimulation. Immersive Guided Meditation with Dee is a self-care programme for busy people that draws upon the scientifically proven outcomes from the therapeutic disciplines of Mindfulness, Breath Work, Yoga, Behavioural Therapy and Sound Healing and makes them easily accessible to you. Through guided meditations, breathing techniques, creative visualisations and introspection you will learn to turn down the noise of the outside world, prioritise your needs and most importantly take your own system out of overdrive. You will be able to bring your nervous and hormonal systems back into balance, reduce your levels of stress and anxiety, increase your concentration, clarity, productivity and take control of your own wellbeing. There's no woo woo, just straight talking with meditation techniques tailored specifically for you. Take time out just for you, time to remember who you are and what you need to make sure that you take great care of you.
