Two most common types are Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by exacerbated uncontrolled intestinal inflammation that contributes to worsening of QOL and prolonged medical and/or surgical interventions. IBD is the result of a complex combination of four main factors: multiple genetic variations, alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, changes in the surrounding environment, and over -reactivity of the intestinal mucosal immune response.
