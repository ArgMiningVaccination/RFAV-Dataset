According to ADHS, i n 2017, only 63% of women in SCC accessed pren atal care services (PNCS) with in the first trimester compared to 76% o f women statewide. Studies con ducted to understand the barriers to access PNCS in the first trimester f ound that women at the border region were often unaware of their pregnanc y status and therefore did not seek serv ices until later in the pregnanc y. Methods/Activities: To increase the utilization o f PNCS in the first trimester among women in SCC, the Mariposa Community Health Center, forme d partnerships with multiple stak eholders to develop a technologi cal platform (chatbot) that promotes PNC and other clinic services among you th 14-24 years of age. Results/Outcomes: This presentation will disc uss lessons l earned from multiple stakeholders including clinic staff, university and st ate health depart- ment experts, funders and intended users. We will also discuss building the chatbot starting with the Google Design Sprint process to ident ify the target audience, determine an intervention type, develop, and test pro totypes. Moreover, we will showcase resul ts from prototype testing and d iscuss the utilization of state and clinic data to drive decision making a nd develop indi- cators for measuring project suc cess. The chatbot is currently in the testing phase and is anticipated to go public in SCC by April 2019. Discussion: Initial testing indicates great potential for the chatbot to i n- crease utilization of PNC and ot her Mariposa clinic services. 14 Challenges to HIV service deliver y for the prevention of mother to child transmission Nidal Kram, Breanne E. Introduction : In 2016, Nigeria had more new pediatric HIV infections than any other country, accounting fo r 26.9% of all mother-to-child transmission cases in the world ( UNAIDS, 2017). In Nigeria, prevention of mo ther-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services a re decentralized and delivered t hrough primary health centers as part o f comprehensive antenatal care. Coverage of these services is poor; a thir d of HIV-positive women receiv e testing and treatment during pregnancy. Methods/Activities: To better understand the challenges of delivering PMTCT services from the provider perspective we conducted nine focus groups as a part of a phenomenol ogical qualitative study. Data were collect- ed from 59 health professionals working in primary care facilit ies in Lagos. Results/Outcomes: Findings indicate challenges can be grouped into categories based on three types o f interactions: 1) interaction s between patients and individual providers, 2) patients' experiences wit h the healthcare system, and 3) provider experiences with the healthc are system. Providers discussed general chal lenges related to HIV care like stigma and discrimination, and barriers unique to pregnant women including domestic abuse, fear of separation/divorce and social isolation. Discussion: Solutions to overcoming challenges may inform future implementation of PMTCT, a high-impact global health strategy. 15 \"We Can't Suspend Our Way Out of This:\" Addressing the Rise in Ado- lescent Vaping Lisa Floran Introduction : E-cigarettes are now the third most commonly used illegal substance by high schoolers, out paced only by alcohol and marij uana. At Pima County Teen Court, a diversi on program for arrested youth ages 12- 17, offenses increasingly involv e e-cigarettes. This poster exp lores drivers of adolescent e-cigarette use in or der to provide recommendations beyond criminalization and regulation. Methods/Activities: A literature review of m ore than 30 sources was conducted to compile local and national data on adolescent e-ci garette use, factors contributing to adolescent substance abuse, and local/n ational e-cigarette efforts currently underway. Pima County Teen Court served as a case study and resource for subs tance abuse screening and inter vention. Results/Outcomes: A 2018 survey of Pima Coun ty youth showed that more than 40% have tried e-cigarettes. Top motivations for using ill egal substances included having fun; feeling good; dealing with stre ss; and trying something new. While 73% say t hat disappointing their parents i s a factor in their decision not to use drugs , only 39% talked with their par ents about tobacco in the past year. Discussion: Punitive responses can reduce y outh access to e-cigarettes, but communities must also address other contributing factors: c uriosity, ignorance, acceptability, stress , and addiction. Public health efforts should account for identified risk and pr otective factors. Full recomm endations from this project will be shared with Pima County Teen Court to inco rporate into their wellness processes and workshops. 16 Saludable: Investigating Factors Influencing Latino Children's Health Erin Pelley, Celina Valencia, Cecilia Rosales Introduction : Metabolic diseases are a growing concern in the United States, particularly among the Latino population. The literatur e shows that factors such as toxic stress and food insecurity are challenges facing the Latino community, and may contri bute to health disparities. Min dfulness- based stress reduction has emerged as a promising method to int errupt the link between toxic stress and metabolic disorders, but has not yet been utilized in the community se tting with Latino children . Methods/Activities: This project involved the implementation of a pilot intervention study, entitled Sa ludable, which aimed to teach La tino children mindfulness techniques along with health topics with the hopes of preventing future chronic disease. The program took place in tw o locations: Aguila, Arizona, and the City o f South Tucson, Arizona; the res earch team was thus able to compare differ ences in food access and stress between children living in both rural and urban settings. Focus groups with parents of the children were conducted in order to qualitatively determ ine factors affecting the children's mental and physical health. Results/Outcomes: The Saludable program was associated with decreased levels of elevated cholesterol glucose in program par ticipants. Focus groups revealed that both rural and urban participants' f amilies live in food deserts. Discussion: The community setting can be used to teach Latino children mindfulness techniques that may decrease their risk of metaboli c disorders. Future research should be done to determine food policies that can increase Latino children's access to nutritious meals. 17 Barriers to Improving Access to Wat er, Sanitation and Hygiene i n Rural Tanzania Jessie Wrona, Ruvini Samarasinha, Giv en Mwambope, Irene John, Aminita Kilungo Introduction : Poor Water, Sanitation and Hygi ene (WaSH) practices poses significant threats to individ uals in rural Tanzania, contribut ing to diarrheal diseases and malnutrition for ch ildren. The study assessed stat us and barriers to improving access to WaSH. Methods/Activities: Six focus group sessions were held within village areas in rural Tanzania (Ifakara ), with a total of 31 household s (N=31). Each session comprised five to six female heads of households with children under the age of five. Foc us group sessions collected information on water access such as retriev al distance, rel iability, cost, safety, and behavioral aspects such as prope r hygiene practices. Participa nt responses were analyzed to understand and identify gaps and cha llenges. Results/Outcomes: Findings indicate 69% of par ticipants had water safety knowledge, with only 44% of these individuals treating their wa ter (i.e. boiling, chlorination, WaterGuar d, filtration). Participants e xpressed major challenges to water access (even when water was available) incl uding reliability (45% of participants) , high cost (20% of participan ts), time it takes to fetch water due to distance or long queues (20% of participa nts), and hardware issues (15% of partici pants). 62% of participants use toilet facilities shared by multiple households. Discussion: Results indicate a majority of the population does not have access to improved water and sa nitation, and even those with ed ucation do not ensure drinking water safet y. In these communities, even wh en water is available there are many other challenges including: access, re liability, availability , retrieval time, and cost. 18 Community Health Workers and the Opportunity to Improve Migrant 's Mental Health Abby Lohr , Cynthia Espinoza, Alma Valles, M aia Ingram, Ada Wilkinson-Lee, Scott Carvajal Introduction : Individuals who migrate experie nce stressors that can impact their well-being such as adjustin g to cultural norms. Because o f historical, cultural conditions around vul nerability and emotion, Latinx mi grants are concerned they will be judged for expressing negative emotions. Bilingual behavioral health workers are rar e, some migrants may prefer no t to share problems with translators, and m any migrants have limited finan cial resources. Our setting and commu nity partners are: Yuma County , Sunset Community Health Center, and Yu ma County Health District. Methods/Activities: In LINKS (Linking Individual Needs to Community and Clinical Services), CHWs foster collaboration between clinic an d community sectors to improve access to c hronic disease, emotional well-be ing, and social determinant services. Wit h referrals from the clinic-bas ed CHW, the community-based CHW identifi ed participant priorities and adapt ed the intervention to their needs. Co mmunity partners led research d evelopment. The LINKS intervention has prac tical implications for the devel opment of community-clinical linkage in public health. Results/Outcomes: LINKS CHWs discovered that thei r migrant participants were unable to access behav ioral health services. In response, they referred participants to Loving Yourself which filled a common emotional well-being g ap among migrant participants. A 7-session, support group-style program led by a CHW, Loving Yourself seeks to eliminate m ental health stigma. L INKS is an ongoing p roject. Discussion: Ongoing contact with CHWs plus t he Loving Yourself curriculum helped individuals overcome stig ma, integrate physical and emot ional health, and address the stressors they face. 19 Decomposing caste-based disparities in India's national health insurance program Preshit Ambade, Tauhidur Rahman, Smita Pakhale, Elizabeth Calhoun, Joe Gerald Introduction : Casteism significantly affects healthcare access and health outcomes in India. Caste-based discrimination results in higher poverty rates and worse health outcomes in people at the lower-end of t he caste hierarchy. The RSBY, a national health insurance program, was c reated to improve health care access for the poor. Methods/Activities: This study has objective to measure caste-based disparities in RSBY enrollment in India and decompose the contr ibution of relevant factors in e nrollment differentia ls for different cast e groups. Using data from the 2015-16 National Fam ily Health Survey, we compare RSBY enrollment rates for different cas te categories (Scheduled Cast e (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), and Other B ackward Caste (OBC) against Ge neral Category households). We use non- linear extension of Oaxaca-Bli nder decomposition and estimate two decomposition models, by pooling coefficients across the comparis on groups and all caste groups. Enrollment differentials are decomposed into household head and individual characteristics, household lev el determinants, media access, an d state- level fixed effects, allowing 2000 replications and random orde ring of variables. Results/Outcomes: Data on 698,901 households shows that ST households had the highest enro llment (20.0%) followed by SC (1 4.6%), OBC (10.8%) and General (9.5%) categories. Our models account f or 40- 93% of differential enrollments by caste. Household factors (44 -74%) and state level fixed effects (3 4-40%) account for most of the gap in enrollment. Discussion: Results confirm that caste influences access to RSBY in India. Higher RSBY enrollments am ong lower castes are significa ntly explained by their low socioeconomic status. 20 Ethnic Disparities in Gastric Ca ncer Presentation and Screening Practice in US Ana Florea , Heidi E. Brown, Robin B . Harris, Eyal Oren Introduction : Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori is the strongest r isk factor for distal gastric cancer (GC). While GC incidence has d ecreased, variation by race and ethnicity is observed. This study describ es GC presentation and screening service s among Medicare patients by race/ ethnicity, place of birth, and h istory of GC-related conditions . Methods/Activities: Using demographic, location and disease staging information, extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results - Medicare gastric cancer databas e (1997-2010), we compared frequ encies of (H. pylori testing and endoscopy) from inpatient and outpatient ser vices claims by selected /ethnicity and place of birth. Results/Outcomes: Data included 47,994 incident GC cases with Medicare claims. The majority (48.0%) of A sian/Pacific Islanders (APIs) were foreign- born, compared to Non-Hispanic Wh ites (NHWs), Hispanics and Bla cks US-born, r espectively). For was the cardia (35.6%) compared to <15% (P<0.001) for APIs, Hispanics a nd Blacks. While more than 57% o f all cases had a history of GC-related condi tions, H. pylori testing was r eported in only 11.6% of those cases. H. pylori testing was highest for APIs 22 .8%) and lowest for Blacks (6.5%). Discussion: Non-cardia GC, associated wi th H. pylori in fection, was diagnosed more frequently among APIs, Blacks, and Hispanics tha n NHWs. Testing for H. pylori was low am ong all GC cases despite eviden ce of risk factors for which screening is recommended. Studies are needed to increase appropriate testing for H. pylor i among higher risk populations . 21 Evaluation of the Tucson Village Farm/El Rio Health FARMacy program Natalie Shepp, Elizabeth Sparks, Leza Carter Introduction : The FARMacy program began in 2017, and is a partnership between the University of Arizona Cooperative Extension's Tucso n Village Farm (TVF), UA College of Medici ne, and El Rio Health Centers. El Rio pediatric patients and their fam ilies are referred to TVF throu gh a written prescription, to attend a FARMacy program, w here they experienc e hands- on nutrition, gardening and culinary education, physical activi ty and mindfulness coaching and access to fresh food. In 2018, TVF 4-H Healthy Living Ambassadors (youth ages 14-18) were recruited and traine d to lead the educational programs. Methods/Activities: Participants were asked to complete an evaluation survey, assessing if they planned to use the information they l earned during the program, at home. The teen fa cilitators were evaluated with the 4-H Common Measures instrument for Healthy Living Teen Leaders, and focus groups that were held at the end of their 5-month long commitme nt. These data will be utilized to determine if the program should be con tinued or expanded as a method of incorporati ng prevention education into traditional medical care practices. Results/Outcomes: The vast majority of participants stated that they intended to make lifestyle changes , such as eating more fruits and vegetables, drinking less sugary drinks and more water, increa se they physical activity and save money on healthy food items. Three m ore programs will be held in the spring of 2019. Discussion: These results show that the educational components of the program are effective at convin cing program participants to uti lize simple strategies in their life to imp rove their health and that the model is worth pursuing for expansion. 22 Exploring Birth Preferences and Delivery Options to Improve Bir th Outcomes Caitlin Meyer Krause, Diana Jolles, Holly Valentine, Greta Cohn Gill Introduction : Birth center prenatal care and delivery are shown to have improved maternal and infant birth outcomes for women without m edical complications and should be utilized for women who prefer this method of delivery to improve population health. This project aims to und erstand birth preferences of patients and the design for prenatal care and de livery at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FDHQ). Pregnant women are ra ndomly assigned to one of three options fo r prenatal care: the OB/GYN clinic with physicians, the Midwifery Clin ic (MC), and the underutilized Bi rth Center (BC) with midwives. Most patients without medical complications deliver at a hospital, while those receivi ng midwifery care can deliver at BC. The goal of the project is to explore pat ient preferences and the FDHQ's prenatal care system to improve patient outcomes by matching preferences and medical risk factors to the care team. Methods/Activities: Semi-structured intervie ws were conducted with women at the MC where most pati ents deliver at a hospital but m edically qualify for BC delivery. From t he preliminary data, surveys wer e created and completed by pregnant patient s. Data are currently being an alyzed. Results/Outcomes: Preliminary results show that only 44% of those interviewed are aware of BC. Nea rly 60% interviewed were intere sted or maybe interested in delivering at BC. Discussion: The lack of knowledge of BC by medically qualified and interested patients adds to the underutilization of BC. Asking initial screening questions and providing information prior to prenatal care can guide patients to their appropriate care team and place of deli very. Utilization of BC and patient heal th would potentially improve. 23 Impact of a hand sanitizer with a residual effect on bacterial exposures Veronica Lugo Lerma, Sasha R. Sepulveda, Amanda M. Wilson, Kelly A. Reynolds, Charles P. Gerba Introduction : Some bacterial pathogens are tr ansmitted via the fecal-oral route, and human exposure can occu r through hand contacts with contaminated surfaces. Underst anding the reduction in dose by u sing hand sanitizers with residual effects will inform hand hygiene proto cols. The objective of this study was to use a simulation model to co mpare bacterial concentrations and doses during hand-to-mouth contacts for thos e with treated hands and thos e without treated hands over a 24 hour pe riod. Methods/Activities: A hand sanitizer with a res idual effect was applied to one hand of participants, and t he other hand served as a contro l. The concentration of indigenous hand bacteria were measured at 2, 4 , 6, 16, and 24 hours after the single hand sanitizer application. Curve s fit to experimentally measured concentra tions on untreated (baseline) and treated (intervention) hands wer e used in quantitative microbia l risk assessment equations to estimate ba cterial dose during hand-to- mouth contacts. Results/Outcomes: The average doses for a 24 hour exposure period were 1.13 x 10^7 colony forming un its (CFU) and 5.37 x 10^4 CFU for baseline and intervention scenar ios, respectively. The percent reduction in mean dose was 99.5%. Discussion: The simulation demonstrates quantitatively that hand hygiene products with residual effects are helpful in reducing exposure s. Further exploration into the influence of human behavior on hand hygien e efficacy is needed. 24 Microgreenery and Health in the Urban Environment *Koby Jargstorf and Shikhar Kumar Introduction : Recent research has suggeste d that there is a link between the availability of large-scale green space and health in the u rban environment. However, the relation ship between mi crogreenery an d the health of the residential populatio ns in these urban environmen ts are less well established. To illuminate th is connection, this investiga tion builds on previous work by de Vries et. a l. to investigate the correlatio n between quantity and quality of greenery, and health outcomes indicated by the 500 Cities 2016 dataset for Tucson neighborhoods. Methods/Activities: For this investigation, pr eexisting data in the form of four data metrics from 15 random ly selected census tracts was c ompared against original data quantifying and qualifying greenery in th e associated tracts. The specific metrics tes ted were self-reported census d ata on: poor mental health, poor physical health, leisure time physical acti vity, and number of nights with enough sle ep. These data were compared by regression analyses to investigat e the strength of their correl ation, with the random selection of neighborhoods isolating the association of greenery with health outcomes. Results/Outcomes: This research is still in progress and will be completed before the conference. Discussion: If results follow the trend of g reenery showing a positive association with health outcome s, these results might indicate that cities can positively impact the health of their citizens by relativel y low-impact streetscaping activities. These would include the planting of s treet trees and the diversification and maintenance of existing micro-green-spa ces in urban neighborhoods. 25 Screening for traumatic brain in jury after intimate partner vio lence Agniezska Radziszewska, Maurice Lee, Paul Kang Introduction : Social factors play a powerful role in determining health outcomes of patients and comm unities. In order to achieve a comprehensive view of the burde ns facing individuals in the co mmunity we designed an open-ended survey where patients from free clinics (St. Vincent de Paul and Mercy Care), F QHC (Mountain Park Gateway an d Maryvale) and private clinics (Desert Ridge and Family View)) c ould express their opinions. Methods/Activities: Our primary aim was to identify the main barriers impeding patient populations in P hoenix from living the highes t possible quality of life. Information ob tained from three different clin ic types included demographic information, open en ded information on the top 3 pa tient identified needs, as well as an assessment of health literacy. Results/Outcomes: A total of 300 patient surve ys were completed; based on the responses 15 categories w ere identified amongst the pati ents. Overall there was a difference between clinic type and patient identified needs distribution (p=.001). We al so collected information from providers in all three clinic types which will be presented in future resear ch. Discussion: There needs to be a change fr om treating disease oriented outcomes (DOEs) to Patient orient ed outcomes that matter (POEMs ). This survey was the first step toward s gaining insight to what patie nts truly need to have the highest pos sible quality of life. 26 Salinomycin and its derivatives as potent RET inhibitors *Tariq Alqahtani, Muthuraj Kumarasamy, Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) accounts for most mortality related to thyroid cancer, despite being relatively u ncommon. Although MTC is charac terized as indolen t, it is still one of t he most aggressive forms of thyroid cancer . REarranged du ring Transfect ion kinase (RET) is a validated molecular target in medullary thyroid canc er. Activated RET proteins are considered to be the Achilles' heel of MTC, ow ing to the major contribution of germline mu tations in the RET proto-oncog ene to the development of this cancer. In th is study, we introduce the pot assium ionophore salinomycin as a potential ther apeutic agent t RET and its downstream signaling pathways. Methods/Activities: TT and MZ-CRC- 1 both cells were used as a model for MTC while the normal thyroid cell (Nthy-Ori 3-1) used as co ntrol. Western blotting was utilized to validate the effect of Salinom ycin in MTC cells. MTS assay and Caspase-3 as say were used to evaluate the cell viability and cell apoptosis, respectively. Results/Outcomes: Salinomycin profoundly decreases RET expression by inhibiting RET transcription and the intracellular PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signaling pathway. Salinomycin i nduces G1 arrest. reductio n by Salinomycin can lead to LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) a ttenuation in MTC. Discussion: The current study demonstrates that salinomycin possesses potent antitumor activity agains t MTC by reducing RET expressio n. Similar observations have been made with selected salinomycin analogs a nd known Wnt inhibitor niclosamide . features support fur ther preclinical evaluation of salinomycin and its analogs as novel therapeutic agents for treatment of MTC. 27 A transitional clinic for the uni nsured: Effects on chronic dis ease management Erin Hartnett, Maurice Lee, Paul Kang Introduction : Data on methods for stabilization and the establishment of long-term care in a medical hom e for uninsured populations is s carce. Currently, discharged uninsured patients face numerous barrier s to follow- up care. This leads to costly vi sits to critical and emergency care facilities. This study intended to analyze t he effectiveness of a novel sys tem of transitional care from the St. V incent de Paul free clinic (SVd P) to an FQHC as the long-term medical home for the uninsured population livi ng with chronic diseases. Methods/Activities: A retrospective chart review of diabetic patients transitioned from SVdP to an FQ HC was performed. Hospital datab ases were reviewed for ED visits, hos pital readmissions, and A1C le vels. Phone surveys were conducted with trans itioned patients regarding the transition and their experiences. Results/Outcomes: 50% of these patients were able to successfully establish care with an FQHC afte r control was achieved while in the free clinic and after transition. Thos e who were abl e to establish care maintained that level of control at 6-12 months of follow up wi th an average initial A1C of 10.2%, time post-t ransition A1C of 7.4%. Additionally, incidents of hospitalization after trans ition were reduced by 91% for all patients and Emergency Room usage was re duced by up to 79%. Discussion: Free and charity clinics can be used as transitional clinics f or the uninsured. If the clinic has the proper resources they can control a patient's chronic conditions and transition a patient who needs periodic 'check ups' to save money, but m ost importantly to avoid preven table complications of chronic diseases. 28 Screening for traumatic brain in jury after intimate partner vio lence Bridget Ralston, Jonathan Lifshitz, Jill Rable, Hirsch Handmaker, Todd Larson Introduction : Intimate partner violence (I PV) causes harm to an estimated 42 million victims each year. Rout ine forensic examination excl udes specific evaluation of traumatic brain i njury (TBI), thereby missing an opportunity to diagnose and offer treatment. This project was designed to dete rmine whether TBI signs are detected in IPV patients using existing forensic nursing protocols. Methods/Activities: A retrospective review was performed on 19 strangulation cases collected ov er 31 days in June and July 201 7 at the HonorHealth Mesa Family Advocac y Center. TBI signs and symptoms were cataloged from medical records to infer the incidence of TBI an d inform an expansion of the nursing exam. Dat a were combined to determine frequency of symptoms, signs , and mechanisms of injury. Results/Outcomes: Retrospective review identified a predominance of young (average age 32.3), female ( 89.5%) patients with obstetri c history (76.5% with 1 or more pregnancy) , presenting with symptoms incl uding lightheadedness (84.2%), headache (78.9%), difficulty breathing (78.9%), and throat pain (68.4%). Subject ive mechanism of injury include d strangulation (100%), blow to the head with the perpetrator's h and (52.6%), and fall to the ground (36.8%). Discussion: TBI signs and symptoms are common in victims of IPV as indicated by our sample populat ion. Our team proposes expansion of the exam to ensure detection of TBI s igns in IPV victims. The prop osed expanded exam integrates near poi nt of convergence, balance, an d hand- eye coordination into the evaluat ion of IPV victims. By detecti ng TBI signs early, community efforts can guide patients towards recovery, appropriate treatment options and succe ssful return to society. 29 Severity Perception of Malaria and Treatment-Seeking in Western Kenya Valerie Madera-Garcia, Jenna Coalson, Kacey C. Ern st, and Melanie L. Bell Introduction : Perception of malaria severit y may affect the decision to see k treatment which is key to effe ctively manage malaria in endemic areas. The study objective was to determine whether perceived malaria seve rity was associated with treatment-seeking and with source of treatment (formal or informal) for febrile illness in lowlands and hi ghlands of West ern Kenya. Methods/Activities: We analyzed secondary dat a from a cross-sectional study of households in Kenya from 2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test associations between treatment-seeking and with source of treatment for febrile illness and total severity perc eption score (SPS) after controlling for other covariates. Results/Outcomes: Increasing SPS was significantly associated with lower odds of treatment-seeking for febrile illness [OR Moderate highla nds, increasing SPS was associated wi th lower odds o f formal treatme nt-seeking amongst participants that sough t treatment for ]. In the lowlands, increasing SPS was asso ciated with higher odds of for mal treatment -seeking amongst participants t hat sought treatment at last feb rile illness [OR Moderate SPS = 2.21, 95%CI: Discussion: Perceived malaria severity was associated with treatment- seeking behaviors for febrile illness in the highlands and lowl ands of Western Kenya. Understanding the driver s of treatment-seeking behavior after febrile illness are important to contr ol malaria transmission. 30 The Health & Wellness Initiative: A Cl\u00ednica Amistad Pilot Progr am Jessica Seline Introduction : Located in South Tucson, Cl\u00ed nica Amistad is a free clinic offering medical services to un - or under-insured patients. In efforts to continue providing the highest quality care to patients, Cl\u00ednic a Amistad piloted a health and wellness program. Methods/Activities: Targeted qualitative interv iews were conducted with a small sample of clinic patients in Fall 2018. Participants indicated interest in waiting room classes, specifically around nutrition and ment al health. Secondary data from a 2017 survey was also analyzed. Bilingual health classes on topics including patient empowerment, nutrition, and stress, among others, were thus implemented in the waiting room. Partne rships with community organizations were also established, including o utreach at a monthly food distribution even t. By both providing direct hea lth education and connecting patients with commu nity resources , the Health & Wellness Initiative functions as both an individual and community-level public health intervention. Results/Outcomes: An evaluation tool was dev eloped for participants of all literacy levels to provide feedback. 92% of participants ha ve reported finding waiting room classes val uable. Since September 2018, Cl \u00ednica Amistad has also tabled at every monthly food distribution even t. Discussion: In addition to the provision of d irect clinical services, it i s worthwhile to incorporate efforts of health education and outre ach in a clinical setting. The Health & Wellness Initiative also demonst rates the importance of addressing public health at multiple levels. Both individual and community-level interventio ns work together to strengthen h ealth outcomes. 31 Using Whole Measures to Defin e Community Food Systems: STFS Report 2018-2019 Keegan Krause, Megan Carney Introduction : The 2018-2019 State of the Tucson Food System Report uses the Whole Measures for Co mmunity Food Systems (2009) to en gage stakeholders and address six val ues-based fields: Vibrant Farms , Healthy People, Justice and Fairness, T hriving Local Economies, Sustain able Ecosystems, and Strong Communities. This poster highlights the community-based data collection process from the report in the context of a values-based whole measures ass essment tool, and offers commen tary and recommendations moving forward. Methods/Activities: Secondary data was collected from stakeholders in southern Arizona's food system fo r 8 weeks during October-Novem ber 2018. Upon coding data, follow-up qualitative interviews were done, supplemented by a variable-based review of peer-reviewed and gr ey literature through Web of Science and archived publications fro m the College of Agriculture and Life S ciences (CALS) at the Universi ty of Arizona. Results/Outcomes: The report outlines the five key recommendations to improve the overall health of sout hern Arizona's food system mo ving forward. Discussion: 1) Develop a binational appli ed research agenda; 2) Support more small-scale and beginning farmers and renewable energy; 3) Existing food policy councils should est ablish community-wide public fo ra, and initiate the value-based planning process; 4) Counties in south ern Arizona should appoint councils and allocate the required resources to develop and implement integrated agrifood polic ies; 5) Improve the incorpor ation of social justice by addressing agriculture-related struggles of s pecific populations (i.e., refugees and immi grants, Latinx, Native Amer ican tribes, the urban poor) in southern AZ. 32 Validation and assessmen t of a student social justice attitudes and empathy tool Elizabeth Anderson , Shannon Vaffis, Rebekah Jackowski, Terri Warholak, Elizabeth Hall-Lipsy Introduction : While infrequently taught to heal th professions students in a formal capacity, the Center for Advancement of Pharmacy Educati on (CAPE) outcome measures include concepts related to social just ice and empathy. This analysis assessed the validity and reliability of a social justice self-efficacy tool for doc tor of pharmacy (PharmD) stud ents. Methods/Activities: Retrospective pre-post surveys completed by PharmD students at two school s of pharmacy were us ed to evaluate chang es in social justice and professio nal empathy after a population heal th course. A partial-credit Rasch model was u sed to test for unidimensionali ty, person and item fit, and rating scale func tioning, as well as construc t and content validity. Multiple linear regr ession was used to predict the e ffect of demographic covariates on the extent of pre-post change. Results/Outcomes: Of 396 participating student s, 60% were non-Hispanic White and 57% were male. The sc ale demonstrated evidence of unidimensionality of a construct d esignated \"social justice sel f-efficacy\". The rating scale functioned bes t with three points. Four items were removed to optimize person-item distribution, though few items were difficult to endorse. Only attendi ng the private school was sig nificantly associated with increased pre-post change. Discussion: The Social Justice and Empathy Assessment (SJEA) survey is functional as a criterion-re ferenced assessment to determine whether minimum competency in social jus tice self-efficacy is experienc ed before or after participation in a CAPE-in formed educational program. The SJEA may be applicable to other health profession students though more e vidence of validity and reliability should be established. 33 Directly providing Healthcare to Community members without Heal th Insuranc e Casey McKaughan Introduction : Clinica Amistad is a small c linic located south of Tucson focusing on community outreach and reliant on volunteer work. P roviders in various fields volunteer their time to come down and provide fr ee healthcare to our patients. We set up appoint ments for our patients based on their needs, but we also accept pati ents without appointments. Becaus e we offer services free of charge, we are only open two nights a week and the first Saturday of every month. Methods/Activities: This work is important becau se our patients cannot get healthcare services anywhere else . Local students, many of whic h are coming from the University of Ari zona, volunteer in multiple of fice positions including front desk, filing pa tient folders and even helping t he providers directly in the exam rooms. They gain experience in the medical field while also working closely with a vulnerable population. Results/Outcomes: Clinica Amistad is celebrating its 15th year of helping people in the community. In the fu ture, we would like to utiliz e the student body at the University of Arizona for continued volunteer work and establish long-term positions for internships. We rely on them to help th e clinic run smoothly. We want to continue outre ach by creating relationship s with organizations in the area to provide information about other se rvices available to our patients in the area. Discussion: The significance of working at a non-profit clinic is seeing fi rst hand the need for free medical services for the vulnerable popu lation in our community. It shows how community members who need the most att ention and help are not getting the reso urces they need - which is als o a theme in Public Health. 34 Efficacy of antimicrobial ear drops for microbial reductions Mandie White, Amy Zimmer-Faust, Jennie Pearce-Walker, Marc Verhougstraete Introduction : Surfers are 1.5 times more lik ely to acquire infections than non-surfers due to exposure to potentially contaminated water. One of these infections types can be ear infections. In order to preve nt ear infections in surfers this pro ject will test an antimicrobial e ar drop intervention by completing the following objectives: 1) Determi ne efficacy of antimicrobial drops against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus au reus, and Coliphage MS2 virus; and 2) Determi ne an effective antimicrobia l drop dosage amount. Methods/Activities: The methods include serial dilutions of S. aureus, E. coli, and MS2 that will be exposed to three doses of BigWave Dr ops (250ul, 500ul, and 125ul). These mi croorganisms will be grown o n selective media to promote the growth of the desired organisms while inhibiting the growth of undesirable organisms. The bacteria's will be counted by visible colonies and the virus will be counted as cl earing and host lawn. Results/Outcomes: The anticipated results ar e that the antimicrobial drops will be effective at reduc ing bacteria and viruses. We an ticipate that the recommended dose (500ul) will be most effective at reducing environmentally expect ed concentrations of bacteria and viruses compared to twice and half the recommended doses. Discussion: These drops will reduce micro bial concentra tions in the laboratory and therefore have the potential to reduce ear infec tions in surfers, a major adverse health outcome associated with recreat ional activities in marine settings. Children and elderly surfers are at particular risk of infection due to weakened immune systems and will there fore, benefit most from the tested intervention. 35 Exploring PA-PB1 inhibitors as Ne xt-Generation Anti-Viral Zhang, Rami Musharra fieh, Chunlong Ma, Jun Wang Background : Influenza viruses ar e respiratory pat hogens that are responsible for seasonal influen za and sporadic influenza pande mic associated with significant mor bidity and mortality, and a huge cost. The therapeutic efficacy of curren t influenza vaccines and small mo lecule antiviral drugs is limited due to the emergence of resistance i n influenza viruses, therefore innovative i nhibitors with a different mode of action are urgently needed. The influenza po lymerase complex consists of P A, PB1 and PB2 subunits, and the subunits interactions (PA-PB1 and PB1 -PB2) are essential for polymerase ac tivity. Currently there are a fe w polymerase inhibitors at different stages of clinical trials, so it is wid ely recognized as a validated drug target, given its cr itical role in virus replica tion and high degree of conservation among influenza A and B viruses. Methods/Activities: Molecule docking was applied for initial screening, SAR studies was used to optimize the initial hit compounds and the mechanism of lead compounds were c onfirmed by ELISA in vitro an d time of addition and real-time qPCR in cell cultures. Results/Outcomes: One hit compound 5 was confirmed to inhibit PAC- PB1N interactions in an ELISA a ssay and had potent antiviral ac tivity in an antiviral plaque assay. Subsequen t structure-activity relations hip studies led to the discovery of 12a, whi ch had broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a higher in vitro genetic barri er to drug resistance than oselt amivir. Discussion: The discovery of compound 12a as a influenza antiviral with a high in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance is significant , as it offers a second line of defense to comba t the next influenza epidemics a nd pandemics if vaccines and oseltamivir fail to confine the disea se outbreak. 36 Implementing the Active School N eighborhood Checklist in the SN AP- Ed Lauren McCullough, Vanessa Farrell, Scottie Misner Introduction : As a part of a multi-level obesity-prevention approach, the SNAP-Ed encourages walking and bi king (w/b) so that youth can a chieve the recommended sixty minutes of da ily physical activity. To as sess the walkability, bikeability, and sa fety of the SNAP-Ed schools, th e University of Arizona Nutrition Network (UANN) implemented the Active School Neighborhood Checklist (ASNC) in 10 elementary schools in Pima County. Methods/Activities: The ASNC contains 57 quest ions divided into eight sections related to supportive policies, built environment, and infrastructure. Total scores of 0-41 were conside red poor, scores 42-83 were mo derate, and scores 84-113 were good. The UA NN visually surveyed a one-m ile radius of each school for built- environment factor s. Other ques tions were answered by, consulting with sch ool officials, city and county planners, public health representatives, and Safe Routes to School (SRTS) coordinators. Results/Outcomes: Schools' total scores ra nged from poor to moderate (17-47). Nine of the schools surv eyed scored poorly (<31); one school scored moderately (47). All sc hools surveyed had many physical barriers (high-speed traffic, multiple lanes, etc.). All schools scored highly (14-16 out of a possible 20 points) in t he supportive policies section . The ASNC assessment identified to the UANN that two schools had sufficie nt infrastructure, built environment assets and supportive program s to encourage w/b to school via the cr eation and dissemination of w /b plans. The SRTS program was contracted by the UANN to create the w/b p lans. Discussion: The results identified appropr iate schools for w/b plans, assets, and challenges. . 37 Lutheran Social Services of the Southwest Kathryn Cremer Introduction : Lutheran Social Services of t he Southwest (LSS-SW) is a nonprofit organization who has assisted with resettling refugee s and asylees by offering quality serv ices and resources for over 30 years. An essential service offered, the Medical Intensive Case Managemen t (ICM), provides specialized help to thos e with physical and mental hea lth needs. This program engages with all ty pes of physical and mental heal th medical centers, multiple government officials for immigration and empl oyment services, community members, and more. Methods/Activities: Mandatory health screenings show those that require specialized health management and are then enrolled in the ICM program. Each client is assessed, and an individualized plan is created specific to their healthcare needs. Refugees are often conf used by the comp lex U.S. healthcare system and struggle with the language barrier. The I CM program advocates for the refugee populati on in order for them to recei ve appropriate healthcare. Results/Outcomes: For refugees, there are ma ny barriers they must overcome. The ICM prog ram attempts to ease the transition of re settling in the United States. The program is always available to clients o f LSS-SW. There are guidelines for a one-y ear enrollment period. However, clients can be re-enrolled if needed. Discussion: Working with refugees' health is a complex process with many aspects involved. An ICM case m anager advocates for refugees wh o cannot speak up for themselves . The ICM program attempts to clo se the gap between refugees and challenges with receiving proper healt hcare. 38 Nonprofit Data Management & R eporting at Cl\u00ednica Amistad Christina Baum Introduction : This poster will provide an o verview of the Cl\u00ednica Amistad Peace Corps Fellowshi p in Data Management. Cl\u00ednica Amistad is a free medical clinic that provides care to the uninsured population of Tucson. The clinic was established in 2003 and is fully funded by donat ions and grants. In addition, almost all o f the providers, interpreters, receptionists, and medical assistants are vol unteers. This poster will highli ght the current Peace Corps Fellowship Data Management position which involves the collection, analysis, and reporting of clinic data. Methods/Activities: This Fellowship serves to strengthen public health skills by exposing the Fellow to nonprofit management, data col lection, and analysis. Cl\u00ednica Amistad is a community-led organization that engages in outreach by providing education and medical care to vulnerable members of the Tucson community. Results/Outcomes: This activity is still in progress. Data collection and entry has been completed, and t he analysis and creation of the report are underway. Discussion: This project allows interns to become versed in large dataset management, how to design data coll ection tools to maximize eff iciency and response rate, and how to wri te an effective Annual Report . The results from the report will be used to better understand patie nt demographics and to inform fundrai sing efforts for Cl\u00ednica Amis tad. 39 Prebiotic Supplement Use and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Post- Menopausal Women *Meghan Skiba, Lindsay Kohler, Tracy Crane, Ikuko Kato, Shadyab, Linda Snet selaar, Lihong mson Introduction : Fiber-based prebiotic sup plements are marketed for promoting the growth of beneficia l microorganisms and to mainta in bowel health. Prebiotic available over-t he-counter may be composed of either soluble or insoluble fiber. Wh ile the association between dieta ry fiber intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been studied, the association b etween prebiotic use and CRC remains unclear. Methods/Activities: The association between prebiotic use and CRC risk was studied using data from the Wo men's Health Initiative. Self -reported prebiotic use was documented a t study enrollment. Adjudicated C RC cases were captured using medical an d death records. Cox proportiona l hazards models were used to estimate t he hazard ratio (HR), related to prebiotic use and CRC risk. Results/Outcomes: A total of 3,032 CRC cases were diagnosed during an average 15.4 years of follow-up. P rebiotic supplement users (n= 5,944, 3.7%) were predominately non-His panic whites, non-smokers, with a normal BMI. Overall, use of prebi otics not associated with CRC risk (HR: 0.91-1.38). T he type of prebiotic supplement (insoluble vs. soluble) was not associated with CRC risk. Likelihood ratio tests indicated no significant interactions between prebiotic use and CRC risk with other CRC risk factors including metabolic syndrome. Discussion: These results suggest that prebiotic fiber supplement use is not have a statistically signifi cant association with CRC risk in post- menopausal women. These finding s do not support the promotion o f prebiotic fiber supplements to r educe CRC risk in post-menopaus al women. 40 Phenology with a New Approach Brenda Mbaabu Background : The purpose of this project is to engage the USA-NPN phenology tools with public health practitioners and researchers to conduct disease surveillance in the south west of the U.S. Methods/Activities: 1. Conduct a comprehensive resea rch on vector borne diseases an d surveillance projects/apps i n the Southwest of the U.S. 2. Compile a report and create a needs assessment survey to ass ess the role of USA-NPN in disease vector data. 3. Interview public health pra ctitioners, researchers and under served populations to inform program development. 4. Collaborate with stakeholde rs to develop tools/programs. Results/Outcomes: 1. Comprehensive research on vec tor borne diseases and existing projects/applications being us ed in the Southwest of the United States that are focused on vector surveillance. 2. A compiled report on prevalen t vector borne diseases of conc ern in the Southwest of the United St ates and the current projects/ technological applications that are being used to study them. 3. A survey informed by aforem entioned resear ch and report that will allow public health practitio ners and community to identify wha t role the National Phenology Network c an add to existing disease vect or surveillance efforts. Discussion: Research was conducted from various databases and two spreadsheets were created focus ed on vector borne diseases. The reafter, a report was written highlighti ng the primary stakeholders (res earchers and public health practitioners) . We created a needs assessment survey and are currently in the process of interviewing researchers an d public health practitioners to assess t he gaps that USA-NPN can fill i n disease vector surveillance. 41 The Coverdell Fellows Program's Social Accounti ng & Economic Impact: 2000 - 2018 Lauren Jaeger Background : Participation in civic engagem ent and community service build s social capital, strengthens communities , and boosts economies by addin g human capital resources for social capacity. T hrough the Peace Corps Coverdel l Fellows program at the University of Arizona, student s across 25 academic programs have partnered with over 150 agencies to work with underserved populations from 200 0 to present. By updating the Social R eturn on Investment, staff aims to calcula te the economic impact of added human capital provided by the Coverdell Fellows progra m to Southern Arizona. Methods/Activities: In 2015 the Graduate College created a Social Return on Investment highlighting the im pact of the Peace Corps Coverdell Fellows program. Staff updated the repo rt though 2018, and ke y informant intervi ews were conducted to better capture the pr ograms social impact. T o measure economic impact, the Independent Sector value of volun teer time was used to capture the contributions to the community from 2000 to 2018. Results/Outcomes: Coverdell Fellows have completed over 407,390 hours of service from 2000 to 2018 and has generat ed $8,800,280 to the local eco nomy through Outreach Assistantships. This wo rk will be used to create an u pdated Social Return on Investment for the Universit y of Arizona Peace Corps Coverd ell Fellows program through the 2018-2019 academic year. The final report will be r eady in June of 2019. Discussion: Measuring the economic impact of t he Coverdell Fellows program can be used to make a persuasive and logical argument for its conti nuation and financial support from local agencies, U.S . Peace Corps, and the Universi ty of Arizona's Graduate College. 42 The Use of Plastic Straws on University of Arizona e Introduction : Despite increasing awarene ss of environmental impact of plastic straws there is little published research on underlying human behaviors involved in plastic str aw use. This research aims to understand plastic straw use at the Univer sity of Arizona campus to contri bute to improved design of interventions aimed at reducing plastic stra w use, given its contribution to environmental pollution. Through qualitativ e research we examine the role of intentional decision- making, habit, and so cial and environmental cues in determining plastic straw use. Methods/Activities: Researchers used several forms of qualitative methods to develop understanding o f on-campus plastic straw use and possible reduction solutions. Key informant interviews were con ducted with retail servers, retail managers , and environmental activists. A series of observations were conducted in four sites on campus. Additional ly, six semi -structured interviews were cond ucted with consumers of plastic straws on campus to assess straw use freque ncy and attitudes of plastic s traw use. Two focus groups were conducted with on-campus environmental ac tivists and retail managers to assess possi ble barriers and impacts of implementing a future chan ge to straw use policy. Results/Outcomes: Preliminary results of t he observations indicated interventions should be focused at the system level instead of the customer level. Results of the study are o ngoing but will be prepared by the date of the poster forum. Discussion: The results of this study have the potential to impact University of Arizona policy, and will provide a strong initial assessment and guide for future environmental health research on campus. 43 44 PARTICIPANT LIST (DEGREE SOUGHT) Tariq Alqahtani, COP/T, Health Health Prom FCH: Family OH: h; PHP: Public Health Policy & Management 45 Degree: DrPH = Doctor of Public H ealth; MPH = Master of Public Health; MS = Master of Science; PhD = Doctor of Philosophy; BS = Bachelor's of Science PARTICIPANT LIST (DEGREE SOUGHT) Brenda Mbaabu, EPI (MPH) b rendam@email.arizona.edu Casey McKaughan, OH epelley@email.arizona.edu Agniezska Phoenix bralston@email.arizona.edu Jessica Jessie Wrona, PH (BS) jwrona812@gmail.com 46 Notes Pages 47 Notes Pages 48 "}
