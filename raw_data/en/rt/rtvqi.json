The following is information I've excerpted from an article by a group of 56 German doctors who wrote to the German Parliament with their concerns. Their paper was entitled '7 arguments against compulsory vaccination' and I feel it has great relevance for the Bill you are poised to vote on. Sincerely, Louisa Hart Brunswick, ME. 04011 Due to the growing politicization, there has been an interdisciplinary ideological standardization in academic research as \"science\". This represents a disregard of the plural, free discourse on the urgently needed gain in knowledge about the benefits and risks of vaccination. Fundamental questions about the new vaccines have not been adequately clarified and are controversial in research. This includes in particular the duration and strength of the vaccination protection as well as the type, frequency and severity of the side effects. No law should be based on controversial research questions. One goal of the general compulsory vaccination is to create a population immunized against SARS-CoV2. It is questionable whether this goal can actually be achieved with the vaccines available that are still conditionally approved. It is critical to allow time for safety testing. 1.) The immunization by the current vaccines is much weaker and shorter lasting than expected and promised. 2.) These vaccines do not produce 'sterile' immunity. Despite vaccination, infections and the transmission of viruses are possible at any time. The extent and duration of the external protection are unknown. Full vaccination of the population - with vaccination that does not produce sterile immunity - can increase selection pressure on the virus and therefore even be counterproductive. 3.) The risk potential of the vaccines is too high. Since the start of the vaccination campaign, no systematic research - including the long-term - risk potential of the new vaccines, has taken place. What is particularly important for the gene-based COVID19 vaccines is that the vaccines and their modes of action are fundamentally new and have not been researched in long-term studies. Vaccine damage could occur in a different way than experience with conventional vaccines suggests. Furthermore, the current research shows warning signs of a considerable risk potential of these vaccines. If the shots were safe, the number of US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports would remain relatively steady, not varying much from previous years, but what we see is a staggering spike in vaccine injuries reported in 2021. VAERS is an early warning system and is supposed to alert our government to potentially hazardous vaccines once they've been rolled out. The signal from VAERS is so clear there's simply no doubt we have a safety problem on our hands. The average number of adverse event reports following vaccination for the past 10 years has been about 39,000 annually, with an average of 155 deaths. That's for all available vaccines combined. The COVID jabs alone now account for 701,126 adverse events in U.S. territories as of December 17, 2021, including 9,476 deaths. If you include international reports that make their way into the VAERS system, we're looking at 983,756 adverse event reports and 20,622 deaths.1 As staggering as these numbers are, they are just the tip of the iceberg. When you add in the underreporting factor, which is believed to be anywhere from five to 40. There is unusually strong increase in cardiovascular and neurological diseases since the start of the vaccination campaign. There's a very tight temporality to the shots in most deaths. Half have occurred within 48 hours of injection, and 80% have died within one week of their jab (be it the first, second or third dose).2 The effect of the spike proteins on the human cell metabolism is largely not understood. There is serious evidence that it can cause undesirable side effects. Research results indicate that these side effects can be individual and deviate from the previously known patterns. The risk potential of multiple administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations has not been adequately researched. The vaccination requirement will presumably provide for continued booster vaccinations, as vaccination protection decreases rapidly and new virus variants emerge. The conditionally approved vaccines lose their effect after a very short period of time (3 to 6 months) and, in any case, are not suitable for the long term. The multiple vaccination (more than two) is an ongoing experiment on the population. footnotes: 1OpenVAERS Data as of December 17, 2021 2Dare to Seek the Truth Dr. Peter McCullough "}
