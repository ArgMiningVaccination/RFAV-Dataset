Data were obtained from the Tianjin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Prevention program. Our goal is t o evaluate the association of TCF7L2 genotype and weight change from pre -pregnancy to postpartum 1 -5 years and association of TCF7L2 and gestational weight gain. Methods: We eliminated 67 women who did not have TCF7L2 genotype information from the 1,263 el igible participants; therefore, a total of 1,196 participants were analyzed in our study. We performed multiple linear regression analyses of the association b etween gestational weight change from pre -pregnancy to 1 -5 years postpartum and TCF7L2 genotype, and between gestational weight change and TCF7L2 . The analyses were adjusted for: age, pregnant age, pre -pregnant BMI, family diabetes history, sitting time, activity time, total energy intake, fiber intake, energy percent of mono unsaturated fat, energy percent of polyunsaturated fat, and energy percent of saturated fat. A two -sided P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.4 for Windows. Results/Outcomes: We found that TCF7L2 RS7901695 is associated with higher gestational weight gain after adjusting for other traditional risk factors (P -value=0.016). RS7901695 is also associated with higher weight gain from pre -pregnancy to postpartum 1 -5 years in the fully adjusted mo del. Our results suggest that women carrying two T alleles may have a greater gestational weight gain and tend to gain more postpartum weight, independent of traditional risk factors. Name: Gerber, Monica Practicum Site: Boston University School of Pub lic Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant, Department of Community Health Sciences Introduction: There is an increasing interest in how the marijuana -related policies may influence youth marijuana use. Currently, there is a natural experiment occurring as states liberalize marijuana laws with respect to decriminalization, medical use, and legalizat ion. A dichotomous variable reflecting medical marijuana laws (MMLs) or decriminalization obscures important aspects of these laws. The goal of this practicum was to develop an enhanced measure of state -level marijuana policy that recognizes the heterogeneity of these laws and that will help us understand how specific policies effect youth marijuana use. Methods: We conducted a litera ture review to assess important aspects of marijuana policies and how these have been measured in the past. A measure of state -level marijuana policy environment was developed based on a review of marijuana laws in 50 states and Washington, DC for the year 2011. State -based data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey for individual -level marijuana use was also obtained. We used generalized estimating equations, adjusting for YRBS sampling weights and clustering of individuals wi thin sampling units, to pr edict the odds of individual -level youth outcomes. Results/Outcome: An absolute 10 percentage point increase of policy score was associated with a 5% decreased odds of youth lifetime use (OR=0.95, 95%CI=.92, .97) and a 4% decreased odds of youth use before age 13 (OR=0.96, 95%CI=.93, .99). I became familiar with the existing literature on the effects of marijuana liberalization policies on youth marijuana use. I also gained experience in c reating datasets and performing statistical analysis using datasets f rom large population -based surveys. Name: Parameswaran, Vidhya Practicum Site: Boston University School of Public Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Graduate Research Assistant Introduction: The Data Coordinating Center at Boston Univer sity School of Public Health has served primarily as a data management consultancy center since its inception in1984. The DCC has been involved in assisting with questionnaire development, implementation of study protocols, double -data entry, and statistic al programming. As a Graduate Research Assistant for the Fall semester, I had the opportunity to get experience in data management and SAS programming. Methods: I was involved in assisting with finalizing study instruments and protocols, maintaining projec t documentation and creating study binders, assisting with programming and testing of electronic forms and verifying data collection forms using the TELEF orm optical scanning data capture system for the Narcan overdose reversal project. Further, I was also involved in performing the second data entry to enter survey information into REDCap for the Ft. Devons project which aims at studying the Gulf War exposure and developme nt of a wide range of illnesses among veterans. I also had the opportunity to learn a bout performing checks for quality control by monitoring for discrepancies between the first and second data entry using PROC COMPARE in SAS. Results/Outcomes: Working at the DCC has widened my understanding of performing quality control for large datasets . I have understood the importance of time management and performing data entry paying scrupulous attention to detail. Further, I have also realized that having an Electronic Data Capture system for clinical data management ensures cleaner data, more effic ient data entry and speedy access to the analysis dataset. BIOSTATISTICS 8 Name: Sachdeva, Shruti Practicum Site: Data Coordinating Center, Boston University School of Public Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: The Data Co ordinating Center (DCC) at BUSPH is a data management resource center that assists investigators with case report form design, implementation of study protocols, data management and statistical analysis. As an intern at DCC, I have got the opportunity to l earn more about and case report form design, data entry and management. Methods: I worked on two projects that were at different stages. Oncogrid: I assisted in finalizing study instruments and protocols; and I learned how to create study binders to guide doctors for online data entry; and I audited the online case report forms. The project meetings were helpful in learning more about the challenges of conducting a clinical trial. I edit -checked the study (test) data received from study site with the help of SAS. Analysis for this project is ongoing; more data from the study site is awaited. URBAN -ARCH: I attended project meetings and helped in auditing the data entry from hand written CRF to the electronic database. The analysi s for this project is ongoin g. Results/Outcomes: I learned about various steps taken in Data Collection process, Quality Control and Validation of data. I gained experience in working with a team. This internship provided me with a deep insight of conduct of clinical trial, process o f randomization, IRB issues, collection of study data, and data management. Name: Sachdeva, Shruti Practicum Site: Division of Developmental Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Data Analyst Intern Introducti on: The Division of Developmental Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital aims to focus on children who face developmental and behavioral challenges and to support their families throughout their child's life span. As a data analyst intern, I learn ed about ICISS Health (Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System) , a web -based platform that provides remote monitoring, real -time analysis, and tracking of patients' disease symptoms and response to therapy over time. Methods : I worked with the team to condu ct a chart review and analysis to determine the effect of ICISS on rates of ADHD documentation in a large subspecialty practice 2 years post -implementation. We reviewed medical records for rating scales that were documented at follow -up ADHD visits, and we randomly sampled documents quarterly over 3 time periods: pre -implementation, roll -out, and post -implementation. We assessed change in visit -based documentation rates of parent and teacher ADHD rating scales using statistical process control charts for pr oportional data (p -charts), stratified by eDMC user vs. non -user status. Results/Outcomes : We reviewed 920 follow -up ADHD visits (~50 per quarter) for 548 patients with ADHD (mean age at first visit=9.9 \u00b1 3.1 years, 77% male, 74% white). Pre -implementation , mean documentation rate for any parent or teacher rating scale was 37. Post - implementation, the mean documentation rate increased to 63%. Name: Tsacogianis, Theodore Practicum Site: Boston University School of Public Health Location: Boston, MA Uni ted States Title: Data Management Intern Introduction: Using data from two previously completed household contact studies in Brazil and Uganda, I worked with Professor White and Professor Hochberg in collaboration with the TB Data Coordinating Center at B oston University/Boston Medical Center on a project investigating the differences in Tuberculosis infection by age and gender. I was responsible for conducting the analysis with guidance from Professor White. Methods: Using SAS Version 9.3, I cleaned and analyzed variables that were comparable across the two separate datasets from Brazil and Uganda to provide demographics tables and to assess variables of interest that could potentially be included in a final model predicting incident infection. Generalize d Estimating Equation (GEE) logistic regression models including age, gender, their interaction term, and a single measure of index case disease severity (extent of disease on x -ray, cavitation, etc.) are being used to assess which severity measures could be included in a final model predicting incident infection. The final model is still being created at this time. Results/Outcomes: Although analysis is still ongoing, it was found that the results in Brazil and Uganda were too different to be combined into a singular model as the household contacts in Uganda had a much higher prevalence of TB infection. BIOSTATISTICS 9 Name: Mehta, Divya Practicum Site: Massachusetts Health Location: Dighton, MA United States Title: Dighton Board of Health Intern Introduction: Illegal discharges into stormwater systems are an environmental health concern as they have the potential to contaminate drinking water sources. Dighton is a small town in Southeastern Massachusetts with 3 rivers in its town boundaries. Du e to the town's proximity to these water sources, the Board of Health began a mapping project to obtain the GPS coordinates of its stormwater system. The objective of this practicum was to create maps of the stormwater system elements to provide informatio n about water flow within the town. This project will allow the town to remain in compliance with EPA Stormwater regulations and NPDES standards. Methods: A Garmin GPS device was used to collect the coordinates of the drainage system, which includes catch basins and manholes. Each element was labeled using a numbering system to allow for easy identification in the future and paper maps were generate d of each street. ArcGIS was used to generate a shapefile with the coordinates of the drainage system. Resul ts/Outcomes: There were 1300 stormwater elements mapped during the course of this project. The shapefile will be added to the town's MapGeo system to provide information for town officials and residents. Paper maps were drawn to document the locations of the storm water system and to aid in future maintenance and surveillance. This mapping project allowed Dighton to gain more infor mation about its storm water drainage system that it can use to protect its drinking water resources. This increased surveillanc e of the basins will allow for rapid identification of contaminated water sources and prevent illegal discharges into the rivers. Name: Miller, Stephen Practicum Site: MA Department of Public Health, City of Revere Healthy Markets Initiative Location : Revere , MA United States Title: Improving Access to Healthy Foods in Revere Introduction: The goal of Revere's Healthy Markets Initiative is to improve access to healthy foods in the community in order to reduce escalating obesity rates, currently at 33 % for adults and 44% for youth under 18. To address this problem, the initiative is partnering with local convenience stores in low -income neighborhoods that agree to stock a recommended variety of healthy items, display marketing materials, and keep items and prices visible. The project objective is to increase convenience store participation and maintain existing partners. Methods: Three new stores were identified to participate and were presented with program information. Stores were provided with the following: education on produce handling; publicity through social media; store assessments to determine inventory; store layo ut improvements; initial interviews to determine store goals; sales tracking methods for produce inventory to help owners reduce waste; and multilingual shelf signs to guide customers to healthy choices. Customer surveys were created for two new stores to deter mine demands for healthy items. During a one -day period, all customers entering and exiting both stores were asked to complete a survey, totaling 30 completed surveys. Results: Two new stores signed participating agreements; four currently enrolled stores have maintained initiative standards. Store ow ner surveys determined a willingness to stock more healthy items, particularly produce, as long as customers demand them, but perceive demand to be low. Customer survey results suggested customers are likely to purchase produce if variety and quality are offer ed at competitive prices. The initiative is targeting three new stores per year. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH 10 Name: Almirol, Ellen Practicum Site: Fenway Community Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research and Policy Intern Introduction: Data has shown that people at high -risk for HIV may underestimate their HIV risk an d subsequently continue at -risk behaviors. Thus, regular HIV screening is an important component for HIV prevention, particularly in high -risk populations. Fenway 500 is a study designed to identify individuals acutely HIV -infected and assess acceptability of HIV home self -testing (HST) among at -risk men and transgender women who have sex with men (MSM). The objective of this practicum was to explore the relationship between high -risk sexual behaviors and HST acceptability in MSM, over a 3 -month period. Met hods: HIV-negative MSM were given HIV home self -tests and were trained to perform HST biweekly. Participants completed computer surveys regarding sexual behaviors and HST acceptability at baseline and 3 months. Using R, I performed descriptive statistics, paired t -tests and correlation analyses between sexual behavior and HST acceptability over time. Results/Outcomes: Among 199 MSM participants (m=36.5yo, 69.1% Caucasian), 145 (72.9%) completed the 3 month follow -up assessment. At -risk sexual behaviors (nu mber of partners and anal sex acts, with and without condoms) decreased during the study period (p0.03). A rise in general HST acceptability was significant over time (p0.01). Significant positive correlations we re observed among several sexual behaviors and HST acceptability at both time points. As high -risk behaviors increase, attitudes on HST increase as well. This relationship shows promise that frequent HIV screening may be an effective tool for prevention in MSM, such that a s those at high -risk appe ar to be the most comfortable with regular HST.

Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company develop ing a novel treatment for chronic heart failure (CHF). Chronic heart failure is a condition that affects nearly 5 million people in the United States and has no real cure aside from heart transplantation. Zensun, U.S.A. is currently performing Phase III tr ials in China and has been approved to begin Phase III trials in the United States. Methods: I assisted in adverse event safety analysis that was to be submitted to the FDA. I generated SAS programs to merge and perfor m statistical procedures on CDISC SDTM /ADaM databases on 12 Phase I and Phase II clinical trials completed in China, Australia, and the United States. I created individual subject and study summary reports regarding specific adverse events. The proportion of ad verse events in the investigation al drug group was compared to the placebo group using a Chi -square test. Results/Outcomes: I practiced clinical trial data analysis skills such as merging datasets and performing statistical procedures. I gained exposure to the major statistical deliverabl es in the pharmaceutical development process. Through my work, I was able to provide the company with adverse event information required for submission to the FDA. Name: Berdjis, Noushin Practicum Site: Dana Farber Cancer Institute Location: Boston, M A United States Title: Intern Introduction: The Survey and Data Management Core (SDMC) is part of the Center for Population Sciences of the Dana -Farber Cancer Institute located in Boston, MA. The SDMC provides research expertise and technical support for both behavioral and clinical research projects for various institutions within the Harvard medical research community. More specifically, SDMC staff design surveys and other research tools, develop and implement data collection, conduct quality control, da ta management, as well as statistical and qualitative analysis of data. The SDMC is a fee -for-service organization and does not receive funding from the Dana -Farber Cancer Institute. Methods: Throughout my internship at the SDMC, I will be assisting with the Internal Quality Improvement Study. This study consists of interviewing key informants with the purpose of evaluating the SDMC and their services. The goal is for the SDMC to be able t o improve upon and expand existing services. Thus far my responsibil ities have included assisting with the development of the interview tool, contacting key informants to schedule interviews, as well as conducting interviews for the data collection phase. Additionally, I have received qualitative research and interviewer training from SDMC staff. Concurrently, interview transcription and coding is taking place. Once all interviews have been conducted, transcribed and coded, I will assist with data analysis. Results/Outcomes: The Internal Quality Improvement Study is curre ntly ongoing. Twenty -eight key informants have been contacted, 20 interviews have been scheduled, and 10 interviews have been conducted. As we are still collecting data, we are in the preliminary stages of data analysis. EPIDEMIOLOGY 11 Name: Bova, Mark Practicum Sit e: Health Map at Children's Hospital Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Simple SIR Model of Chikungunya in India Introduction: Chikungunya (CHIKV), an arbovirus of the genus Alphavirus, is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes mosquito. The two primary Aedes spp. responsible for Chikungunya transmission are Aedes albopictus. There is currently no spe cific treatment or vaccine for Chikungunya. The first local outbreak of Chikungunya in Singapore began in January of 2008 and was i nitially contained, but a second wave of clusters appeared causing an island -wide outbreak during 2008 -2009. Methods: An SEIR infectious model with a mosquito component was created to quantify the parameters of the outbreak. Data was collected from the Sin gapore Ministry of Health web site and HealthMap's database. HealthMap is an online disease surveillance system that maps disease outbreaks. The data consisted of weekly Chikungunya case counts from 2008 -2009. The SEIR model with mosquito and human compone nts was created to model the parameters of the second wave of the outbreak in late -2008 into 2009 using the statistical software R. Results/Outcomes: The results of the model indicated an R0 of approximately 1.0 symbolizing the average number of infections from human -to-mosquito and mosquito -to-human. The average number of secondary infections resulting from human infections was also estimated to be 1.0. Due to the small number of weekly cases, traditional fitting of the model to case data could not be perf ormed. Instead, optimization of the parameters was performed manually. The small size of the outbreak can be attributed to the aggre ssive control measures performed in Singapore. Name: Garcia, Carmen Practicum Site: Boston University School of Dental Med icine Location: Boston, MA United States Title: D.D.S., M.D. Clinical Instructor Department of General Dentistry, Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine Introduction: With the increase in life expectancy a larger number of elderly patients wi th chronic diseases are taking more medications that affect oral health. Dental students are expected to provide dental therapy to medically compromised patients. The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate the prevalence of systemic disea ses and medication use in a cohort of dental school patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the electronic medical records was conducted for all new patients aged 18 or older, seeking denta l care at BUSDM from July 8, 2013, through March 8, 2014. We described the distribution of patient's demographics, tobacco and alcohol use and past medical and drug use history. Differences between gender and diseases were detected by Pearson's chi -squared test. All p values were considered to be statistically si gnificant at p<0.05. Results/Outcomes: A total of 15,796 patients (54.3% females) were included in this analysis. The mean age was 43.9 year -old (SD: \u00b116.1).Tobacco use was reported by 24% of patients, alcohol consumption by 32.4% and recreational drug use by 4.5% (higher prevalence in males, p<0.01). Use of medications was reported by 64.9% of patients. The most prevalent diseases were: hypertension (22.9%), psychiatric (19.5%) and rheumatologic (6.0%), HIV positive/AIDS individuals, (5.4%) and other cardio diseases (4.17%). Hypertension, hematological disorders, psychiatric conditions, rhe umatologic, respiratory and thyroid diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus and medication use were more prevalent among females (p<0.01).Liver diseases, AIDS and HIV infections were more prevalent among males (p<0.01). Name: Ho, Tiffany Practicum Site: B oston Medical Center Boston , MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: To understand the impact of research participation, we examined 14 years of survey data through BU's Medical Student Summer Research Program (MSSRP). We analyz ed factors that drove students to a positive experience. Through our analysis, we can draw conclusions to create a more suitable environment for medical student research and use an evidence -based approach to incite long -term career interests in research. Methods: Data was collected in questionnaires from 2000 to 2013. Students reported their research experience, ability to achieve goals , possibility to continue research, possibility to publish findings, and project length appropriateness. Preceptors graded their students on categories such as effort, originality, reliability, relation with staff, communication, and attendance. Basic summary statis tics were obtained. Student responses were matched with corresponding preceptor responses, and bivariate analyses between each student and preceptor response was performed. A logistic transformation analysis was performed on each binary response to determine poten tial research factors contributing to a positive or negative response. Results: The average student ratin g on overall research experience was 1.349 out of 5, and the average preceptor rating was 1.550 out of 5, indicating that student and preceptor experiences were positive. Two categories returned statistically significant values in the bivariate analysis: t he preceptor's evaluation of the student's interaction with staff and the preceptor's evaluation of the student's attendance. Factors which influenced a positive rating in the logistic transformation analysis included: student's overall experience, st udent 's rating of the preceptor's availability, student's possibility in publishing the data, project continuity, and achievement of student's goals. EPIDEMIOLOGY 12 Name: Hoesing, Ashley Practicum Site: Harvard Medical School Department of Genetics Location: Boston, MA Unit ed States Title: Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors of Multiple Sclerosis Study Intern Introduction: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting 2.5 million people. Early intervention is crucial for delay ing progression of disea se. However, there is currently no clinically suitable tool to detect those at highest risk. We employed an algorithm using genetic and environmental markers to create a weighted risk score and applied it to individuals with at least one first degree relat ive with MS. Methods: We applied our algorithm to individuals from the Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) study, a defined cohort of high -risk individuals. Each individual was assigned a Genetic Risk Score (GRS) that included 64 MS loci and an overall Genetic and Environmental Risk Score (GERS) that incorporated the GRS plus sex, smoking and mono history. To assess the contribution of the strongest genetic risk factors, we created two additional GRSes, one without 5 HLA alleles of chromosom e 6 (GRSnonHLA) and another with only HLA alleles (GRSHLA). The GRSes and GERS were compared between MS cases and controls. Results/Outcomes: Of the 1696 participants, 113 (6.6%) have a confirmed diagnosis of MS. Individuals with MS have a higher mean GR S (p=4.4 x 10 -6, AUC = 10 = 0.625) than controls. When removing HLA alleles, we still see a significant difference between MS cases and controls (p=8 x 10 -4, AUC = 0.561). This is also seen when comparing the AUC of the GRS HLA to that of the GRS, suggesting that the non -HLA alleles contribute to the assessment of risk in MS. Name: Jin, Yinzhu Practicum Site: Boston University Medical Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: The p revalence of knee arthritis/pain is high in China, limiting patients' daily physical activities. However, there is no data supporting this epidemiological problem at a national level. The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) aime d at estimating the prevalence of knee arthritis/pain and the effect of knee arthritis/knee pain on patients' physical impairments. Methods: Data was obtained from a national survey among Chinese retired populations. During the study period, exposure status and baseline information were obtained through questionnaires, and outcome measures were conducted through series of physical examinations. One of the physical activity indications was measured by five times chair standing test. Time used to stand up straight fr om chair was measured as one outcome. Linear regression model was used to estimate the association between exposure and outcome, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, education level, smoking/drinking history, injury history, hip fracture, fall, and Charlson Como rbidity Index. Results/Outcomes: There were 17708 subjects participated in this study. The self -reported prevalence of knee arthritis was 9.2%, and the prevalence of knee pain was 12.7%. Among these subjects, 12869 completed questionnaires and participated i n the five times chair standing test. For knee arthritis patients and non -patients, the adjusted mean time to finish the test was 11.2 seconds, and 10.4 seconds, respectively, with difference of 0.8 seconds (95% CI 0.6, 1.0). Results were similar for knee pain subjects versus non -pain subjects, with difference of 0.7 seconds (95% CI 0.5, 1.0). Knee arthritis/pain significantly affects the basic physical activity of patient s. Name: Jordan, Melissa Practicum Site: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Location: Boston , MA Unite d State s Title: Drug Safety Eval uation Intern Introduction: The project was to design and implement a historical database using reports generated by outside contract organizations for some of the compounds Vertex has investigated since 1989. Vertex has done research on Cystic fibrosis, autoimmune diseases, cancer, IBD, neurological disorders and infectious diseases. The purpose was to pull all pertinent general, safety, and efficacy information on the compounds from the PDF reports containing preclinica l trial information into a database where it could be searched and trends could be studied. Methods: To do this, collaboration was required with LeadScope where I had to reformat their platform, generate a compatible user - friendly template and write a smal l content loader application to bridge the template with the database. The final step was to go through different reports, pull out the important information, enter it into the template, upload the template and then troubleshoot any issues with the querie s. Searching databases, pulling pertinent information from studies and studying trends are all skills used by an epidemiologist. Results/Outcomes: The outcome of this project was a functioning, searchable database with 27 historical studies worth of infor mation including: compound level, site, efficacy, safety and study design information. This information will eventually be used by the research and development team to streamline all pre -clinical studies, find previously unseen trends, determine dose, est ablish a safety profile and ultimately help to deliver much needed safe, efficacious drugs to human clinical trials in a more efficient manner. This will eventually help thousands of people across all of Vertex's disease areas. EPIDEMIOLOGY 13 Name: Karlinskaya, Olga Practicum ChemRisk United States Title: Epidemiology Intern Introduction: Although several studies have reported anatomical differences between male and female hips, total hip prostheses do not vary by gender. Total hip replacement (THR) failure is quantified by surgery revision rate, which several authors have reported to vary significantly between males and females. A medical device manufacturer, under fire for some of its previous hip prosthesis de signs, tasked Cardno ChemRisk to ascertain whether its future hip prosthesis designs should vary by gender. I performed a meta -analysis to determine whether a significant difference in revision rate exists between males and females. Methods : Using strict eligibility crit eria, I included all cohort studies in which the exposure was primary THR for any reason, the outcome was revision surgery for any reason, and the study adjusted for confounding by age and type of prosthesis. My systematic review included English and non -English articles identified from PubMEd, Embase, and Scopus. I collected Hazard ratio data on THR revision, stratified by gender. Data were synthesized by random -effects meta -analysis and narrative review. Results/Outcomes : I identified 12 studies, from 4 23 articles, to include in the statistical analysis. My findings indicate that the rate of revision surgery in males is 1.20, compared with females (95% CI: 1.08 -1.34). Heterogeneity among studies was moderate, quantified by an I2 of 51%. Thus, in this st udy, males were at a higher risk of revision surgery than their female counterparts. These results indicate that total hip prostheses may need to be structured differently for males and females. Name: Kathman, Alexandra Practicum Site: Boston Univers ity School of Medicine Location: Boston MA United States Title: Literature Review Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders among females. It results in a hormonal imbalance in women that is thought to be one of the lea ding causes of female infertility. Overweight, obesity, and insulin resistance are strongly implicated in its etiology. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify lifestyle factors that affect PCOS and to evaluate the success of lifestyle modification interventions. Varying standards of diagnostic criteria were assessed and compared. Results/Outcomes: 24 articles were identified and analyzed. Diet and exercise intervention programs designed for modest reduction in overall body wei ght (5% to 10%) were as effective as severe weight reduction in reducing metabolic disease and improving ovulatory function. Therefore, modest lifestyle changes appear to represent the first line management for overweight patients with PCOS and may be more sustainable. This information will contribute to the evidence base, guide medical and public health practice, as well as prov ide recommendations to direct future research. Name: Kern, Julia Practicum Site: Brookline -Quezalguaque Sister City Project, Inc. Location: Cambridge, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: In Nicaragua, the prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown origin (CKDu) is estimated to be between 17.9% and 21.1%. CKDu touches 50,000 individuals in late -stage disease worldwide and affects young men below the age of 30. The objective of this practicum was to investigate the community's knowledge and awareness of CKDu (its symptoms, causes, and available treatments) , in addition to engaging with students on sexua l health. Methods: MPH students selected by the Brookline -Sister City Organization designed and implemented interviewer -administered questionnaires to obtain information on nephrotoxic drug use, natural remedies and peritoneal dialysis in relation to CKD u. Literature on etiology and symptoms of CKDu was reviewed to create questionnaires administered to 250 Quezalguaque residents in 25 comarcas. Pharmaceutical -specific questionnaires were given to 15 pharmacies and shops to evaluate nephrotoxic drug avail ability and distribution. In addition to CKDu research, a three -part sexual health education lecture (charla) was created based on the Peer Health Exchange curriculum. These were provided to 250 primary and secondary school students from select ed classroom s in three schools. Results/Outcomes: Substantial use of nephrotoxic medication among those suffering from CKDu was found. Also, 67% of CKDu participants worked in agriculture and professional occupation seemed to be protective of CKDu, although specific a ssociation between agriculture occupation and CKDu disease status is unknown. Among students involved in charlas, awareness of sexually transmit ted infections and contraception use ranged from 30% to 89%. A report including findings and appropriate recomme ndations were provided to the local Quezalguaque administration and to the Brookline Sister City Project. EPIDEMIOLOGY 14 Name: Kogan, Vadim Practicum Site: Harvard Medical School Location: Cambridge, MA United States Title: Metrics and Evaluation Fellow Introduction: The Zero TB Deaths Campaign is a project of the DGHSM at Harvard Medical School that aims to create a grassroots movement to achieve Zero TB deaths in India. Together with two other BUSPH students, our team sought to catalyze this movemen t by partnering w ith local Tuberculosis NGOs to train and support a group of 26 activists to bring attention to key issues surrounding TB treatment access, diagnosis, and quality of care. This activist training institute sought to share resources and expertise wi th activis ts so that they could begin organizing their communities to advocate for policy change. Methods: Working with the ZTB team, I conducted key informant interviews and lit searches to create a campaign memo, policy briefs, and an M &E plan for our activist cam paign. I drafted MOUs and led partnership building efforts with academic institutions and Indian NGO's to train a network of TB activists who would kickoff the ZTB campaign. I led the planning of the community organizing p ortion of the ZTB training curricu lum and oversaw the drafting of an Activist guide for this training. Results/Outcomes: I oversaw a three day activist training institute from September 4 -6 in Delhi that convened speakers, partners, and 26 former TB patients to learn leadership skills, com munity organizing, TB treatment literacy and legal rights, and media outreach. These activists left the training with personalized campaigns for their regions and a network of support, including a campaign dire ctor hired by our main TB partner, the partner ship for TB Care and Control. Name: Lee, Taeyeon Practicum Site: Boston University Medical Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: analysis of study of knee osteoarthritis and balancing function in elderly in China: CHARLS cohort / research assistant Introduction: Knee arthritis increases in prevalence with age and prevents the elderly engaging in daily activities; however, large population based studies for older adults in China are not available. Methods: We related static balancing functi on to prevalence of knee arthritis/knee pain from the survey data in China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011 to 2012). The cohort included 13,521 people who participated in the static functi on test. Information of knee arthritis and kn ee pain was collected based on self -reports. Knee arthritis was only identified when both pain in knees and the diagnosis of arthritis by a doctor were present. The function of static balance was classified as four categories acc ording to the performance i n the test. A multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relation of knee arthritis/knee pain to capacity of balance, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), education level, smoking and drinking history, history of injury, fal ling down and hip fracture, a nd Charlson comorbidity Index. Results/Outcomes: The prevalence of knee pain and knee arthritis was 12.7% and 9.2%, respectively. Major impairment in static function, failure to all level of tests, was reported in 0.58% of the study pop ulation. The odds ratio of impaired static function in those who have knee pain was 1.71 (95% CI 1.26, 2.31) and 1.40 (95% CI 0.98, 2.00) in those who have knee arthritis (as compared to those wh o without such conditions). Name: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Coordinator for the Program to Enhance the Health and Development of Infants and Children Introduction: Despite recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatri cs (AAP) rates of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) are low among pediatricians. The goal of this project was to better understand the practices an d attitudes of pediatric primary care clinicians regarding SBIRT for adolescen t substance use. In 2013, the AAP fielded a needs assessment survey to gather information regarding SBI among pediatric clinicians. The purpose of this practicum was to analyze the results of the needs assessment and subsequently, conduct key informant int erviews to gain deeper insights into current SBI behaviors and practices. Methods: In order to meet the goals of this project, several activities were completed: 1) cleaned the results from the needs assessme nt survey, 2) analyzed the clean data using SPS S version 20.0, 3) developed an interview guide for key informant interviews, 4) recruited participants for the key informant interviews who had indicated prior interest, 5) conducted audio -recorded key informant interviews over the phone, 6) analyzed the results of the key informant interviews, and 7) developed a report with key findings. Results/Outcomes: The outcomes of this practicum include two presentations (one that summarized the quantitative analysis from the needs assessment survey and one that p resented the qualitative analysis from the key informant interviews) and a written report that summarized both results to be disseminated to the team. Next steps will be to publish recommendations for better use of SBIRT methods among pediatric primary car e clinicians. EPIDEMIOLOGY 15 Name: Maloo, Zehra Practicum Site: Partners In Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Intern Introduction: In 1987 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a law that would allow drugs that had not yet been ap proved to be available to certain individuals through Compassionate Use (CU) and Expanded Access Programs (EAP). Use of these progra ms has not been documented in the United States. This project is the first large scale listing of CU/EAP drug use in the Uni ted States. Methods: A Google and PubMed search was performed using the terms \"compassionate use\", \"expanded access\" and \"early access program\". Articles were reviewed for the drug name and disease associated with the drug. The approval date for the drug w as then obtained through the FDA website. Results/Outcomes: A total of 184 drugs were identified. Among these 162 (88%) have already been approved by the FDA and the remaining 22 (12%) are under FDA review; 57 (31%) are intended to treat cancer, 32 (17%) are for HIV/AIDS and 31 (16%) are for infectious disease. The majority of the identified drugs have been approved since 2000 (75%). Limitations of this analysis ar e that only drugs that were submitted for CU/EAP and were subsequently approved can be determ ined from the FDA website; drugs that were not approved are not listed. It is important to document the use of CU/EAP since these programs assure the accessibility of usefu l drugs to people who are in critical need of them. Name: Okwali, Diana Practi cum Site: National Institutes of Health Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Summer Graduate Student Intern Introduction: The Metabolic, Cardiovascular and Inflammatory Disease Genomics Branch (MCIDGB) is part of the National Human Genome Research Institute a t the NIH. This branch studies the social and genomic determinants of complex diseases, with a focus on the effects of socio -environmental determinants on gene expression and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality among disproportionately affected sub-populations. To examine the pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases, the researchers combine biomedical informatics, noninvasive imaging, genomic ep idemiology, and system biology. Methods: The project I worked on was with the Minority Health Genomics a nd Translational Research Bio -Repository Database (MH - GRID). The MH -GRID dataset integrates genetic, behavioral and socio -environmental determinants with clinical assessments in minority patient cohorts. Data was collected on demographics, lifestyle factor s psychosocial factors, and genetic information. My role was in data management and preliminary descriptive analysis of the MH -GRID database and other population -based data sets. I created SAS codes to produce data dictionaries, derive variables and score social determinant instruments as well created documentation for the datasets. In addition, I ran logistic regression models to perform exploratory analyses between variables in the dataset. Results/Outcomes: The associations between the variables in the m odel cannot be discussed; however the results from the study will have significant impacts on public health. The study has increased the available genetic data on African ancestry populations , which is the most genetically diverse population in the world. The data will help to uncover genetic bases of disease in African ancestry populations that hasn't been explained by previous research studies that relied predominantly on European genetic samples. Name: Penningroth, Benjamin Practicum Site: Harvard Medical School Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Zero Tuberculosis Deaths: Evaluation of an Activist Training Institute Introduction: Zero Tuberculosis (TB) Deaths is a Harvard Medical School initiative designed to reach zero TB deaths in India t hrough a grassroots movement based on advocacy and activism. Together with two other BUSPH students, our team designed and implemented an Activist Training Institute for persons affected by TB and former TB patients. The goal of the institute was to build local activist capacities by equipping attendees with knowledge and skills to advocate for policy changes on a local, state and national level. In addi tion to helping with program planning and logistics, my role as a monitoring and evaluation fellow was to measure the success of the program and highlight areas for improvement for future Institutes. Methods: I led the process of designing three one -page, post -training questionnaires for each day of training. The questionnaires were administered to 25/26 atte ndees after day one, 24/26 attendees after day two, and it was not administered on day three due to time. Questionnaires were a mix of short answer and scaled questions designed to capture participant's feedback on the training com ponents to better inform future workshops. Results/Outcomes: Preliminary results indicate that participants found the educational session on TB Patient Rights and the intro session detailing the need for a grassroots TB advocacy movement as most helpful. Participants identified Public Narrative: Story of Us and Now as a program component that needs to change. These results, along with the rest of the questionnaire data will determine futu re enhancements to the Institute curriculum. EPIDEMIOLOGY 16 Name: Poon, Ka Lai Practicum Site: New York C ity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Location: Queens, NY United States Title: Summary and Analysis of Tick -Borne Diseases Reported Among NYC Residents 2012 -2013 Introduction: The New York City's Health Code Article 11 requires the following tick -borne diseases to be reported to NYC Department of Health (NYCDOH) within 24 hours: Babesiosis (BAB), Mo untain Spotted Fever (RMSF). Patients who are infected with tick -borne diseases often suffer from various unpleasant symptoms and their conditions can become fatal if left untreated. Since these diseases can pose serious threats to public health, it is importan t for NYCDOH to closely monitor their annual trend and identify risk factor s. The main purpose of the internship was to describe factors associated with NYC residents diagnosed with tick -borne diseases in 2012 and 2013. This included clinical presentation, hospitalization, testing methodology and risk factors associated with the infections. Methods: Data collected by standardized questionnaires was first entered into the Access and Maven databases. Data cleaning was then performed and SAS 9.3 was used to analyze the cleaned data. An annual summary report for each of the five tick -borne diseases was generated, which was essential for disease surveillance and enabled NYCDOH to provide educational materials for the public. Results/Outcomes: In 2012, 28 cases of BAB, 19 cases of HGA, 11 cases of HME, 12 cases of RIP, and 7 cases of RMSF were reported in NYC. In 2013, 75 cases of BAB, 23 cases of HGA, and 15 cases of HME were reported in NYC and no cases for RIP and RMSF. Overa ll, most cases resided in Manhattan and traveled outside of NYC before disease onset. Name: Rogers, Ale xandra Practicum Site: ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Location: Cambridge, MA United States Title: Market Research Intern Introduction: Lung cancer kills 1.38 million people each year. Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Positive, Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer (ALK+ NSCLC) is a rare form of cancer marked by a chromosomal translocation that creates a fusion gene. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a drug, AP26113, which treats this rare form of cancer. In order to understand the marketability of this drug, it is important to determine the incidence of the disease both in North America and globally. Methods: A literature review was conducted to understand the incidence of ALK+ NSCLC in North America, Japan, and EU countries. Results/Outcomes: We found that 4. 6% of North American patients with NSCLC are ALK+, 5.5% of European Union patients with NSCLC are ALK+, and 3.3% of Japanese patients with NSCLC are ALK+ for a given year. One limitation of this literature review was the fact that each study was included regardless of which method of analysis was used to determine ALK positivity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH Vysis Assay (FISH), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) were all used to determine ALK positivity. All were included in our review due to the fact that ALK positivity, determined by any of these methods, will ultimately allow the patient to rece ive the drug. A patient flow model was created using this ALK+ incidence data as well as data on the incidence of the different s tages of the disease. This model allows ARIAD Pharmaceuticals to understand the number of patients that will be treated with AP26113 annually. Name: Shah, Nishita Practicum Site: Boston United Resear ch Assistant, Atrial Fibrillation Cohort Study Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm, and is a risk factor for heart failure and strokes. There are still a lot of unanswered questions regarding its etiology and how it affects overall quality of life. A cohort study is taking place to investigate the experience and symptoms related to atrial fibrillation that focuses on identifying and addressing racial disparities. The stu dy's purpose is to examine the amount of time people sp end in AF, their symptoms, quality of life, and medical history. Methods: I was responsible for working with subject recruitment and enrollment, as well as contributing to the overall study design. I worked on optimizing recruitment into the study by con tributing feedback to various methods such as developing a study brochure for clinics. I was responsible for meeting participants in the clinic to perform informed consent and enrollment. This involved c onducting standardized medical and lifestyle intervie ws with subjects, as well as administering heart rhythm monitors. Results/Outcomes: 89 subjects have been enrolled in the cohort study, with 44% identifying as black or African American and 47% as white. Most subjects experience other co -morbidities placi ng them at high risk for stroke, such as diabetes and hypertension. 59% of subjects are taking warfarin, the standard anticoagulant for controlling AF. As the study continues, the information collecte d will help inform better care techniques for patients w ith AF to help prevent stroke. EPIDEMIOLOGY 17 Name: Spilkia, Allison Practicum Site: Boston Public Health Commission Location: MA United States Title: Boston MRC Program Manager Introduction: A program of the Boston Public Health Commission, the Boston Medi cal Reserve Corps (MRC) is a community -based volunteer corps that prepares for and may respond to emergencies in Boston. Additionally, the Boston MRC seeks to ensure that all Bostonians, especially the most vulnerable, have access to the resources they nee d to stay safe and healthy before, during, and after a public health emergency. The purpose of this practicum was to evaluate the current status of the program, develop a new organ izational strategy to increase member engagement, and obtain public funding for new volunteer opportunities and trainings. Methods: I pooled information on volunteer demographics, skills, trainings, history of participation, and other factors from various sources. To increase volunteer engagement, I used this information to restru cture the Boston MRC program around six functional groups that reflect the types of volunteer opportunities offered. To obtain federal funding for program development, I crafted a gra nt proposal for a Train -the-Trainer model that would allow Boston MRC mem bers to provide emergency preparedness education within the Boston community. Results/Outcomes: Interpretation of program data revealed areas for improvement and identified a core group of active members. This information will be used to guide the future d irection of the Boston MRC. Restructuring of the program around functional groups allows for volunteer opportunities to be more narrowly tailored to members' interests, thus increasing engagement and participation. Additionally, we will use members' prefer ences to determine where to create additional volunteer opportunities. By the conclusion of the practicum, a decision will be made regarding our grant application for NACCHO funding to launch the Train -the-Trainer model. Name: Vu, Cecilia Practicum Si te: Boston Medical Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: A Practical Approach to Adapting the Patient Centered Medical Home to Address Psychosocial Adversity Introduction: When ignored, psychosocial adversity can negatively affect patients' hea lth outcomes and treatment success. The purpose of this study is to understand the perspectives of various hospital stakeholders to improve trauma - informed care within patient -centered medical homes. Methods: From June to September 2015, 25 hospital work ers (i.e. providers, quality improvement specialists, nurses, and medical assistants) and patients at Gunderson Health Systems in La Crosse, WI were interviewed in semi -structure formats for 30 min to one hour. Each interviewee was given a hypothetical cas e patient and answered questions about the scenario. Topics explored ways to ask difficult questions about psychosocial adversity, responding to the patient case, and retaining patients with trauma histories. Each in terview was coded independently by two r esearch assistants using Dedoose software and the discussed to agree on a final consensus. A total of 17 interviews were completely coded. Results/Outcomes: From 17 of the 25 interviews, the major themes that emerged included (1) using the patient's prefe rred electronic means to remind them of appointments and medicine, (2) the importance of understanding patients' complex psychosocial and fin ancial barriers to health, (3) building patient trust, and (4) risking privacy when documenting sensitive psychosoc ial topics. We aim for the results from this qualitative analysis to open discussion and inform policy for a more trauma -informed medical practice. Name: Wang, Joyce Practicum Site: MAVERIC Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Clinical Data Man ager Introduction: The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) is a Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSP CC) for large multicenter clinical trials in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the direc tion of a Clinical Data Manager, I contributed to the implementation of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) investigating the effect of lithium us e on suicidality in depressed and bipolar veterans. Methods: After familiarizing myself with the protocol, I cr eated a protocol map, which charts the meaningful endpoints to support study and regulatory objectives. During the development and finalization of case report forms (CRFs), I used the protocol map to en sure each CRF accurately and consistently captured dat a as specified in the protocol. Next, I helped create a Study Specification Document in Microsoft Access to specify programming parameters for the electronic data capture system, which includes information on vari ables, instructions for edit checks, and o ther considerations for data entry. I also reviewed a data management plan for the study that specified the workflow process. Finally, under the direction of the study biostatistician, I independently programmed a CONSORT diagram using SAS code in order to create the Intention to Treat cohort. Results/Outcome: By assisting with the development of study documents and databases during the start -up phase of this RCT, I was able to apply skills and concepts of study design I learned in classes. Further, these components will be vital for the conduct of the clinical trial, which is due to start in January of 2015. EPIDEMIOLOGY 18 Name: Ward, Kristin Practicum Site: Cambridge Public Health Department Location: Cambridge , MA United States Title: Division of Epidemiology and Dat a Services Intern Introduction: The Division of Epidemiology and Data Services at the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) monitors the health of the city of Cambridge by tracking disease and identifying emerging health issues. Case management, in pa rtnership with the Division of Public Health Nursing, is one of Epidemiology's key roles, yet a lack of standardized protocols stymied the efficiency and sp eed of follow - up. Additionally, CPHD needed assistance updating the Cambridge Health Indicators 2015 publication, which compares a variety of health measures in Cambridge with those of Massachusetts and the United States. Methods: I interviewed epidemiologists and public health nurses at CPHD and reviewed existing sources of written information to find discrepancies between what protocols are supposed to be followed and what protocols are actually followed. I used that to crea te new workflows, segmented by disease type (e.g., routine vs. urgent). I also tracked down surveillance data on national and local levels from a variety of government sources to update the Cambridge Health Indicators 2015 publication. Results/Outcomes: Standardized workflows have been developed for routine, urgent, and foodborne illnesses with a special focus on the complex follow -up process for Hepatitis B. Protocols for outbreaks and post -outbreak reports are in development. Additionally, the Cambridge Health Indicators publication has been updated with the most recent available surveillance data and is on track to be published in J anuary 2015.

The goal of the SNA study is to (1) examine patterns by which HIV is/could be transmitted within networks by identifying individuals o r groups at high risk for HIV and (2) identify the venues where individuals recruit sex partners a nd examine structure of sexual affiliation. The purpose of this practicum was to assist with data collection, analysis and presentation of findings. Methods: I worked with the principle investigator of the study to: (1) interview men who have sex with men , (2) input and cleaned data in excel and SPSS for data analysis, (3) analyze data, and (4) create a PowerPoint and poster presentation for an HIV/AIDS confe rence. Results/Projected Outcomes: Data is now clean for data analysis. Excel and SPSS are availabl e for the input of additional study participants. There are PowerPoint and poster outlines specifically for presenting the SNA study findings. Sexual and social networks can now be visualized with graphs created using R. Name: Aguilera, Ana Practicu m Site: Grounds for Health Location: Waterbury, VT United States Title: Spring 2014 Program Intern, Asistente de Programas en el Peru Introduction: As a part of Grounds for Health, an NGO that works to create sustainable cervical cancer prevention and tr eatment programs for rural coffee -growing communities, I assisted in the program implementation and evaluation of cervical cancer screening programs in the La Coipa district. I worked hand -in-hand with the Peruvian Ministry of Health and three national cof fee cooperatives to build capacity in the public health system to more adequately prevent cervical cancer in poor, rural women. Methods: I worked with the Program Manager and Community Coordinator in Jaen to: 1) train community health promoters on cervical cancer, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screenings and cryotherapy treatment; 2) provide logistical support for cerv ical cancer screening campaigns; and 3) conduct the Most Significant Change evaluation process to identify major program successes . Results/Outcomes: Grounds for Health can take my Most Significant Change evaluation report and disseminate it to all stakeholders involved in the program including: local communities and women, local health personnel, donors, partners, the Ministry of H ealth, the coffee cooperatives and anyone else who is interested in the program. Name: Anger, Alison Practicum Site: The Small Things, Inc. Location: East Haven, CT United States Title: Intern on No More Orphans Project Introduction: The World Heal th Organization (WHO) has recently recommended use of misoprostol to prevent post -partum hemorrhage for women that cannot achieve a hospital delivery. The No More Orphans (NMO) Project in Nkoaranga, Tanzania is training traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to administer misoprostol immediately after delivery to prevent post -partum hemorrhage (PPH). Misoprostol's relative safety, ease of use and thermostability makes it ideal for use in regions such as Nkoaranga which lack trained health care providers and consistent access to a cold -chain. Methods: During my practicum, I conducted literature reviews on best practices, reviewed materials related to PPH and collected demographic data on TBAs serving the Nkoaranga area. I created informational pamphlets and p resentations to distribute in community, which I then translated into Swahili. Through the development and administration of pre -post survey, I assessed knowledge and current practices of TBAs. I facilitated procurement of 1 year supply of Misoprostol, co nducted training of 43 TBAs on basic female reproductive health, PPH and the safe usage of Misoprostol, developed a sustainable monitoring plan for the continued implementation of th e program. Results/Outcomes: Forty -three traditional birth attendants wer e trained in basic female reproductive health, PPH and misoprostol use. Follow -up meetings one-month after training provided an opportunity to conduct a refresher training on materials and administration and to evaluate misoprostol use by TBAs. At the ti me of follow up meetings, no TBAs had administered misoprostol. A second follow -up meeting will be conducted at the end of 6 months to determine misoprostol use by TBAs trained in the program. GLOBAL HEALTH Name: Bane, Sunetra Practicum Site: Pathfinder Internatio nal Location: Watertown, MA United States Title: Research Assistant, qualitative data analysis for m4Change Introduction: Pathfinder International is a global non -profit organization focusing on reproductive health and related health services. Pathfinder 's mHealth department works with integrating technology solutions to improve the quality of health services and systems, to reach more clients with behavior change, interventions and streamline data collection and use. m4Change is a project within t he mHea lth department, implemented in 20 primary health centers in Abuja and Nasarawa, Nigeria. The project used an application on the CommCare platform to support community health extension workers (CHEW) providing antenatal care services. Methods: I worked with the baseline (109 CHEW and 17 supervisor) and endline (33 CHEW and 18 supervisor) questionnaires administered to assess usability of the app. I learned how to use the NVivo data analysis software through tutorials and user guides. I then coded the surveys for quantitative responses, and for trends in qualitative responses. I analyzed the data, and started the draft of a working paper about the results. The data is being included in my Culminating Experience Journal Article. The article will be submitted fo r publication at the end of this semester (Fall 2014), and also submitted as a working paper on the Pathfinder website. Results: Preliminary analysis of the application satisfaction data shows an increased health worker, supervisor and community satisfac tion with the antenatal care services provided when the m4Change app was used. Health workers recommend the use of this applicatio n in other health facilities, and to the government of Nigeria. These results are being used towards further studies by Pathfind er about the value of mHealth apps in antenatal care delivery, and will also be presented at the mHealth Summit in December. Name: Carey, Hannah Practicum Site: Multnomah County Health Department Location: Portland, OR Title: STD/HIV/H CV Program Introduction: Multnomah County Health Department's (MCH D) STD, HIV, and Hepatitis C Clinic in Portland, Oregon is the only STD - specific clinic in Oregon and provides disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as active surveillance and partner therapy. Methods: As the STD/HIV/HCV Program MPH intern I had two main assignments. (1) I provided research assistance for a phase three clinical drug trial for a new drug treatment for Gonorrhea and (2) I completed a summary report concerning t he clinic's change in revenue, payor coverage, income, and patient demographic since the passage of the the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As the only research assistant for the Melinta Therapeutics Gonorrhea drug trial, I performed a wide range of activitie s including subject interviews, subject vitals measurement, medical chart and results report organization, data entry, work with clinicians to complete medical histories and physical exam records, and shipping log completion. For preparation of the summary report I identified currently generated data reports, completed a literature review, reviewed websites and spoke with clinical managers to compare the scope of the MCHD's STD clinical services to other categorical STD clinics nationally and internationa lly. Results/Projected Outcomes: My work with the Melinta drug trial contributed to critical ongoing research into Ceftriaxone -alternative Gonorrhea drug therapies, and my summary report provided the clinic with accessible and comprehensive information co ncerning the ACA's impact on the clinic and will serve as an informational resource for staff as well as a reference for future funding and programming decisions. Name: Mexico Title: Economic burden of diabetes mellitus in Mexico, Research Assistant Introduction: The Mexican Health Foundation (Fundaci\u00f3n Mexicana para la Salud, FUNSALUD) is a private non -profit think -tank in Mexico City. FUNSALUD aims to improve health policy and outcomes in Mexico though innovative scientific research. Diabetes mellitus has a major impact on Mexico's current health outcomes and is at the center of new policies. The growing prevalence of diabetes nec essitates an an alysis of the economic burden of disease on the macro level. Methods: As a research assistant, I worked on a cost -of-illness study separately quantifying the direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes, each from the perspectives of the household, e mployers and the state. Direct medical costs include provider visits, medication, supplies and amputations amongst others. Indirect costs include the loss of income and productivity related to absenteeism, presenteeism, temporary and permanent disability, early retirement and premature death. Separately analyzing the direct medical costs and the indirect costs allowed us to determine what degree of the economic burden would be alleviated if various targeted int erventions were in place to reduce prevalence o f diabetes. Results/Outcomes : The final report, which I co -authored in Spanish, will include the full analysis of our work including how various cost - modeling methods were implemented and recommendations. The goal of the report is to involve various sector s of the economy in sharing responsibility for implementing effective interventions that reduce the prevalence of diabetes.

Dimagi is developing the CommCa re certification program to promote standardized CommCare project implementation and successful execution. Methods: We standardized the formatting of language on the CommCare help site and documentations and built certification tests in Commcare. In additi on, we made improvements to certification tests and tutorials and collected feedback from pilot test takers. The use of e-learning platforms for certification was also researched. Results/Outcomes: Test questions were reformatted based on feedback from te st takers. Learning objectives and sections of the help site were revised. We are currently piloting innovative ways of presenting the material that test takers are required to learn in order to be certified. The certification program will allow organiza tions using Commcare to develop the skills necessary to build internal capacity to implement successful programs. Name: DiRocco, Natalie Practicum Site: Uganda Village Project Location: Hummelstown, PA Uganda Title: Monitoring and Evaluation Intern Introduction: Uganda Village Project (UVP) is an international, grassroots NGO focusing on public health promotion for community health and development strategies in marginalized villages located in Iganga, Uganda. Their program addresses these pivotal a reas: malaria, HIV/STIs, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), family planning, and obstetric fistula. In 2009 UVP started the \"Healthy Vil lages\" program, an approach adopted after identifying 70 impoverished villages located in Iganga district. The healt hy villages technique strengthens public health initiatives by collaborating with various stakeholders and stalwarts. Methods: Alongside five team members and various community participants, I worked in the rural village of Buvule to plan, implement, and e valuate public health programs associated with UVP's five main pivotal areas. Follow -up quantitative and qualitative data was collected using structured household surveys and observations, one -on-one interviews, and community focus groups. Data collection was used to analyze and compare Buvule's health progress from previous baseline data collected. Data collection helped recognize zones with the most severe health concerns. Education sessions were informed and carried -out according to these results. Resu lts/Outcomes: Albeit many health issues still persist in Buvule, our SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analyses and follow -up data collection exhibited slight improvements over the past year, especially in mosquito net and tippy -tap us age. Approximately 192 households were surveyed. We found coverage of hand -washing stations increased considerably, from 1.5% to 49% over one year. Mosquito net usage also substantially increased from 32% to 80%, from the previous year. This was most likel y due to the government's widespread dissemination of mosquito nets. Name: Efronson, Emilie Practicum Site: International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) Location: Washington, DC United States Title: Addressing Stigma and Gender -based Violence to Improve HIV Service Delivery to Key Affected and Vulnerable Populations in Guyana Introduction: The International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) is a global research institute based in Washington D.C. ICRW's mission is to empower women, advance gen der equality and fight poverty in the developing world. To accomplish this, ICRW works with partners to conduct empirical research, build capacity and advocate for evidence -based, practical ways to change policies and programs. ICRW and partners are curren tly working on the Guyana HIV/AIDS Reduction and Prevention Project (GHARP). Methods: During my 3 month internship at ICRW I provided assistance and support to GHARP. Adult HIV prevalence in Guyana is 1.07%, yet the prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is reportedly at 19.4%, and is reportedly 16.6% among female sex workers (FSW). As such, reducing the transmission of HIV and stigma and discrimination against these key populations has become a cri tical component of Guyana's national response t o the epidemic. Additionally, rates of gender -based violence are very high. In order to address these issues, I conducted a literature review on best practices of gender based violence programs and identified over 30 key documents. I also researched and id entified 10 validated GBV screening tools. Results/Outcomes: The literature and tools that I identified were adapted into a GBV screening tool specific to the needs of the Guyanese context, which has now been presented for discussion in Guyana. The next ph ase of the project will be to identify the appropriate CBOs/NGOs in Guyana to pilot the tool. GLOBAL HEALTH 22 Name: Guttman -Slater, Maya Practicum Site: Canadian Red Cross Society - Disaster Management Department Location: Ottawa, ON Title: Developing a National Catalog ue of Disaster Supplies Introduction: The Canadian Red Cross Disaster Management Department works on responding to disasters, primarily natural disasters, across Canada. A Supply Chain and Logistics Study for the Canadian Red Cross was undertaken in 2013 to conduct an end -to-end assessment of disaster management logistics activities and determine the structure best suited to support routine operation a nd surge capacity in response to a large -scale disaster. Methods: My tasks were to assist in providing adv ice and support on the planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the Supply Chain and Logistics activities; and provide a forum to consider issues arising from the Zones concerning the implement ation of the enterprise -wide Supply Chain and Logi stics structure. I created a survey to elicit feedback from each CRC regional zone to investigate the most frequently used materials during disaster response, depending on the scale and type of disaster. I conducted an analysis of the survey responses and recommendations given by each respondent. Outcomes: I created a catalogue of standard items that are sent during each disaster response. After receiving over 50 responses from the survey, I added to the catalogue the non -standard items that were most us ed. As part of the initial study in 2013, I researched and proposed an organizational structure for the new logistics and operations department at the national office. I performed an in -depth review of the national disaster response plan. I provided com prehensive feedback based on concepts learned in graduate classes. Name: Johnson, Courtney Practicum Site: Boston University Center for Global Health and Development Location: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Title: Evaluating the Capacity of Civil Society Orga nizations (CSOs) to Improve the Health of OVC in Ethiopia Introduction: The Evaluating the Capacity of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to Improve the Health of OVC in Ethiopia project is a 3 -year longitudinal mixed methods study to see whether changes in CSO organizational capacity can predict organizational performance and health outcomes of OVC. The Measuring Organizational Development and Effectiveness (MODE) Tool was used to assess organizatio nal development in 11 domains: Mission & Values, Leadersh ip & Governance, Strategic Planning, Operational Planning, Management of People, Linkages & Networking, Logistics Management, Quality Management, Management of Information, Financial Management & Budgeting, and Financial Security & Fundraising. Methods: As part of the research team, I conducted organizational assessments at various CSOs in Ethiopia using the MODE tool. During the assessments, in -depth interviews were conducted with CSO staff on the 11 domains, and staff surveys were administered to assess staff opinions about the organization and their work environments. Results from the MODE Tool and the staff survey were used t o calculate an overall organizational development score. Results/Projected Outcomes: After the assessment, each organization receiv ed an individualized report that tracked organizational capacity changes over the three years, and contained recommendations on how to improve their organizational capacity. For all organizations, the overall organizational development score increased from 2012 to 2014; with the largest score increase occurring between 2012 and 2013. Name: Jones, Jerrilyn Practicum Site: Boston EMS Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Training and Implementation of a First Responder Naloxone Program at Massport Introduction: One hundred and fourteen people in the United States die everyday from drug overdoses, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country. In 2012, 53% of overdose deaths were due to pharmaceuticals with 72% of those deaths being spe cifically linked to opioids. In Massachusetts, the death rate from unintentional opioid overdoses reached 10.1 per 100,000 representing a 90% increase since 2000. Data suggests the trend will continue. These facts led Governor Deval Patrick to declare a public health emergency on March 27, 2014. Among proposed strategies to combat the issue was a directive requiring the opioid reversal agent, naloxone, be carried by all first responder personnel. The purpose of this practicum was to develop a first -responder naloxone program for Massport Fire, the first responding agency for Logan Airport. Methods: Practices and procedures from applicable jurisdictions across the United States were used to generate a standard operating procedures guideline as well as a didactic training program to implement the use of intranasal naloxone (Narcan) by paramedics and EMTs at Massport. A train -the-trainer model will be used. Results/Projected Outcomes: Since 2007, Narcan has been attributed to more than 2000 overdose sa ves in Massachusetts. Massport Fire is only one of several first -response agencies expected to have the ability to recognize and reverse an opioid overdose in the field. It is hoped that his training program will be an effective tool to implement the use of Narcan and could be adapted for use by other first - response agencies throughout the country. GLOB AL HEALTH 23 Name: Kinsinger, Lindsey Practicum Zomba, Malawi Title: Monitoring & Evaluation Officer Back ground: For my practicum, I did a 13 -month long Global Health Corps (GHC) Fellowship, as a M onitoring and Evaluation (M &E) Officer, with Dignitas International in Zomba, Malawi. During my practicum, I worked on several projects. The most impactful was a si x- month operational evaluation to understand how health facilities in southern Malawi manage HIV defaulters. Extensive research has been done to understand HIV defaulters at the patient -level, but little to understand what organizational/facility -level app roaches work best . Methods: For this study, I developed the proposal and baseline survey, analyzed the results using R and Excel, and made evidence -based recommendations for improvement. The recommendations were used to develop new tracing tools for clinic al staff to use. Our team developed the training materials for these tools, and initiated the orientation program in July 2014 . Results/Projected Outcomes: Minimizing HIV defaulter is important for individual health and community health. Through this proje ct, (1) HIV clinics across Zomba have improved defaulter tracing tools; (2) the tools were approved by the Ministry of Health as a pi lot, with potential for national expansion; (3) HIV defaulter rates should decrease in Zomba; (4) Publications are being de veloped from the preliminary study findings, so the in formation will be shared. HIV defaulters in Zomba, Malawi and the HIV clinics in the district of Zomba will be positively impacted by this work. Name: Lawrence, Emily Practicum Site: Helen Keller Dhoka, Nepal Title: Research Intern Introduction: The Mixed Farming System is the common practice in Nepal. The purpose of my internship with HKI was to understand how families in Bajura, Nepal, manage their livest ock and backyard poultry and considerations they take into account when caring for their young children. Methods: To carry out the assessment I completed the following activities: 1) completed a desk review of recent documents on \"One Health\" and livestock management, 2) designed a qualitative assessment for mixed farming households with young children in Bajura, Nepal 3) conducted three focus group discussions, three household mapping activities, three in -depth interviews and one key informant interview 4) collected and analyzed the information collected from the field 5) prepared a report on practices, key risk factors for human health, particularly women and children under two years of age and areas for a potential public health intervention, and 6) p rese nted our findings to HKI staff at the annual retreat. Results/Outcomes: The outcome of the qualitative assessment identified several key issues and opportunities for the implementation of an integrative approach to zoonotic disease control for both livesto ck and humans. Based on learning from these interviews several key actions were identified: 1) education on poultry cooping methods, 2) overall improvement of household, shed, and outdoor sani tation, 3) education on food and milk safety, and 4) proper disp osal of livestock waste. These results will help HKI in designing future monitoring tools for their poultry program and provide information on the design of zoonotic disease prevention interventions in Bajura, Nepal. Name: Lipton, Kerri Practicum Si te: Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Title: Researcher for the National Assessment on Access to and Use of Medicines Introduction: Fiocruz is Brazil's largest public health research institute. Nested within t he Fiocruz campus lies ENSP, Brazil's national school of public health. At ENSP, the N\u00facleo de Assist\u00eancia Farmac\u00eautica (NAF), the Center for Pharmaceutical Care, works to promote drug and pharmaceutical care policies through project development. Researche rs at ENSP/Fiocruz and other institutions collaborated on the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o Medicamentos no Brasil (PNAUM), the National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Drugs in Brazil. Sur vey responses were collected from 41, 433 Brazilians across all 5 regions of Brazil. Methods: While working in the NAF department, I conducted literature reviews to learn more about Brazilian medicines policies pertaining to rational use of antibiotics. U sing SPSS, I analyzed survey responses from the respondents who recently used antibiotics to assess compliance with a policy created by the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) in 2011 entitled Resolution 20. Resolution 20 states that only qualifi ed prescribers, (i.e. medical professionals) can prescribe antibiotics, and outlines specific rules for pharmacies that distribute these medications. Results/Outcomes: Although it has been over 3 years since the implementation of Resolution 20, 24.3% of r espondents reporting having received antibiotics without a prescription. Compliance with the policy appears weakest in the North and Northeast regions of the country, where 35.1% and 35.7 % (respectively) of respondents reported having received antibiotics without a prescription. Nationally, 30.6% of respondents obtained antibiotics at private pharmacies without a prescription, versus 9.7% of respondents without pr escriptions at public pharmacies. GLOBAL HEALTH 24 Name: Lopez Cangas, Victoria Practicum Site: Massachusett s Alliance on Teen Pregnancy Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Public Policy Intern Background: Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy focuses on advocating and supporting policies that sup port expectant or parenting teen s. Their core belief is that being pregnant or being a teen parent should not deter young people from achieving lifelong goals and experiencing success. To realize this vision, the Alliance helps young people find the necessary resources to achieve their goals. Methods: The Al liance is engaged in multiple community activities. In the Summer of 2014, the Alliance supported a new policy for expectant and parenting teens in Boston Public Schools. The Alliance spearheaded the community outreach essential to evaluate whether or no t the policy was being adopted in the Boston Public Schools. Members of the Alliance attended wellness council meetings at BPS as well as coalition and group meetings that were essential in assessing the issues and developing new strategies to make this p olicy sustainable. The Alliance also organized the annual Lobby Day, where hundreds of teen parents and their supported rally at the State House to get more support from their legislators and representatives. Teen parents share their experience as teen pa rents to their legislators and representatives, and various organizations provide data demonstrating their needs. I assist in the preparations for Lobby Day by networking and establishing sponsorships, and assisting with event logistics. Results/Outcomes : The ultimate foal of this work is to convince Massachusetts' legislators to include health education as a line item in the annual budget to help educate and support teens on sexual justice and reproductive health. Name: Mbachu, Perpetua at MC -CCAM Introduction: Malaria claims many lives of children under the age of five and still contributes to a reduction in productivity in the overa ll population of Cameroon. The purpose of the practicum is to contribute to the capacity of MC -CCAM to design, implement and analyze malaria control interventions. I worked on two key projects: Building Malaria Prevention (BMP) and CHW data verification. Methods: I worked with MC -CCAM to develop a proposal for, design, pilot and implement a midpoint evaluation of the BMP project. With the evaluation, MC -CCAM could identify areas of improvement as the project proceeds to the next phase of its activities. The evaluation comp rised of 1) a household headcount of all the household and household members in Minkoameyos, 2) rapid diagnostic testing for household members and provision of appropriate medication for positive cases, and 3) interviews with a sample of household he ads. F or the community health workers (CHW) data verification, we 1) authenticated data sheets submitted by CHWs during their home vis its in health districts using a specified criteria and 2) provided progressive feedback on the home visits recorded, by communit y health worker, by community, and by health district. The verification allowed MC -CCAM to pinpoint any discrepancies in the home visit sheets that could jeopardize data reported to the Global Fund. Results/Outcomes: I analyzed and wrote a report for the i n-depth interviews. The interviews revealed pride associated with being part of the project. Upon completion, MC -CCAM intends to use the quantitative results of the evaluations for internal improvement of the BMP project. Name: Mehrtash, Hedieh Pract icum Site: Management Arlington, VA United States Title: Practicum Intern at Center for Pharmaceutical Management, MSH Introduction: The main focus of CPM is to increase access to and improve the use of pharmaceutical produc ts (e.g., essential medicines, vaccines, laboratory testing kits, and other health technologies) and services that support these products. The practicum pro ject involved performing a comparison of a country's Essential Medicines List (EML) with the WHO Mod el EML and inter -country comparison of medicines. The analysis focused on medicines used to treat cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes for 34 countries whe re MSH has a working network. Methods: My responsibilities included data entry and analysis to perform a comparative mapping of EML's. This comprised three steps: 1) Comparison of medicines at the medicinal level 2) Comparison at product presentation level (tablet, syrup, injection) and 3) Identification of medicines and the product presentation that are not part of the WHO EML. Results/Outcomes: The analysis completed during my practicum will allow MSH to better inform countries, especially those with limited budgetary resources, on strategies for improving access to medicines for non -communica ble diseases and ensuring linkage of public sector procurement with their national EML. GLOBAL HEALTH 25 Name: Mehrtash, Hedieh Practicum Title: Public Health Practicum Student, Global Oncology, Queen Elizab eth Central Hospital Introduction: Global Oncology (GO) is a non -profit 501c3 made of skilled professional volunteers ranging from physicians to designers to improve the quality of cancer care in low resourced -settings. Their work consists collaborating w ith partners to improve cancer care through, education, and research in resource -limited settings. Since January 2013, GO has had an ongoing partnership with Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. As a result of ongoing discussions wi th QECH nursing staff, GO has committed to developing cancer educational materials for QECH's low -literate patient population. The practicum project involved the piloting of the \"Cancer and You\" patient education materials at QECH and the preparation of a program design for an impact evaluation in order to further assess distribution and effectiveness of the materials in low -resource settings. Methods: In order to develop the bulk of the program design, it was necessary to 1) perform preliminary situationa l analysis to investigate the patient population 2) organizational assessment of the Oncology Ward at QECH 3) conduct preliminary focus gro up discussions with QECH to staff to finalize the patient education materials 4) to develop the monitoring and evalua tion plan based on the Malawi equivalent -IRB application; COMREC Results/Outcomes: Going forward, GO is committed to refining the evaluation in order to submit it to the IRB and COMREC board for approval. The cancer educational materials are currently bein g revised based on initial results and GO plans to expand the initiative in 2015 in order to potentially reach additional countries or patient populations. Name: Nguyen, Colleen Practicum Site: Boston Children's Hospital, Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Curation Intern Introduction: The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak began in March 2014, and continues to spread within West Africa and has led to autochthonous cases in Spain and the United States. HealthMap, an online disease surveillanc e system affiliated with Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard University, collects and stores online reports of infectious diseases around the world. In response to p ublic concern over this outbreak, HealthMap created a centralized source of data encompa ssing situational context and disease spread. Methods: HealthMap's automated system collects and organizes online media reports and other 'innovative' data sources. Data related to the outbreak was pulled into the system, analyzed, and disseminated through a centralized outbreak timeline website (healthmap.org/ebola). Additionally, visitors could choose to subscribe to receive daily email mailers with breaking news ale rts, alongside alerts providing more contextual background on the progression of the outbr eak. Results/Outcomes: HealthMap's Ebola timeline site has received more than 600,000 unique page views since its creation. Ebola alerts coming into the system appear to follow a temporal clustering pattern around official report releases and milestone eve nts. However, it is important to note that at times of significant reporting of other world news, the number of unique Ebola alerts coming into t he system wanes. Consequently, the system may not be representative of the progression and situation of the out break on the ground. Name: Nishtala, Arvind Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center, Department of General Pediatrics Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction : Social determinants significantly influence health outco mes in children. There is little evidence -based research to guide providers to address social needs. We report on a study evaluating the efficacy of a clinic -based screening and referral system (WE CARE) on families' receipt of community resources for unme t basic needs. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial at 8 community health centers (CHCs), recruiting mothers of healthy infants. In the 4 'WE CARE' clinics, mothers completed a self -report screener that assessed needs for childcare, education, employment, food, heat, and housing. Providers m ade referrals for families ; unmet needs; staff provided requisite applications and telephoned referred mothers within one month to assess contact of resources. Families at the 4 control CHCs receiv ed usual care, which typically included basic social history questions and social work services. We analyzed results with generalized mixed effect models. I particip ated in data acquisition by providing mothers with the WE CARE screening tool and a follow -up questionnaire. Results/Outcomes: 336 mothers were recruited, 168 per study arm. 90% of mothers reported at least 1 unmet need, 68% reported at least 2 needs. Significantly more WE CARE mothers received at least 1 referral at the index visit (70% vs 7% ; p=0.01). At 12 -month follow - up, more WE CARE mothers had enrolled in new commu nity resources (39% vs 24%; p= 0.05). A systematic screening and referral tool for social determinants within well -child care leads to receipt of more community resources, laying the groundwork for designing future program s that address children's social needs. GLOBAL HEALTH 26 Name: Obregon -Schroder, Giselle Practicum Site: Harvard United States Title: Zero TB Deaths: Addressing the Global Tuberculosis Crisi s through Activism, Advocacy and Community Organizing in India Introduction: The Harvard Medical School Department of Global Health and Social Medicine is currently building a grassroots advocacy/activism movement called Zero TB Deaths (ZTB) to address th e global tuberculosis (TB) crisis. Inspired by the achievements of the AIDS activist movements in the 1980's, the ZTB movement plans to demonstrate the effectiveness of community organizing an d activism in demanding improvements of failing national TB prog rams. The first ZTB campaign will take place in India, where the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) has failed to properly address the country's disproportionate burden of MDR -TB. Methods: Two other BU MPH students and I formed a research, metri cs and evaluation team to assess the feasibility and acceptability of TB activism in India. Our internet research (46 assorted news articles, reports, journal articles, radio interviews) and key informant interviews (2 Indian TB NGO leaders) led to the dev elopment of a campaign memo and campaign metrics, which will provide a roadmap for the impending India ZTB campaign. Outcomes: We partnered with Project Axshya and The Partnership for TB Care and Control to create a network of TB activists who will initiat e the campaign. Together we created an Activism Training Institute where trainees learned leadership skills, community organi zing, advocacy, media outreach, TB patient rights, and the goals of the ZTB movement. The three day Training Institute was held at the University of Chicago Center in Delhi, India from September 4 through 6, 2014 and produced a cohort of 26 TB activists. Name: Ptak, Malgorzata Practicum Site: Massachusetts General Boston, United States Title: Approaching Complex Multisystem Medical Conditions Integratively through an Electronic Health Record Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multisystem condition that affects the brain. Currently, ASD is not fully understood, however, clinical, medical, an d electrophysiological differences may help diagnose ASD earlier than existing standards of using behavioral assessments. This would grant earlier access to interventions. Documenting an integrative research focused approach was the g oal of Open Medical In stitute (OMI) when creating OpenMedNet (OMN), a HIPAA compliant electronic health record (EHR). This novel EHR bridges researchers with clinicians, providing the best, most up -to-date care for patients. With this focus in translational medicine, biomarkers can be tracked alongside behavioral assessments and health trajectories to provide a more holistic understanding of patients, especially with multisystemic conditions not fully understood, such as ASD, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Meth ods: During this experience, I collected information on fifteen validated assessments used for ASD to be uploaded to OMN, contacted roughly eight publishing companies on rights to use assessments in OMN, coded two customized TRANSCEND questionnair es, assis ted in creating a high -level screener for incoming patients, provided feedback on overall user interface, and created a comprehensive list of twenty databases focusing on integrative and alternative medicine. This list was supported by weekly/biweekly conf erence calls organized by a non -profit, Epidemic Answers, with integrative and functional medicine doctors across America. Results/Outcomes: The project is still ongoing. Currently, the focus is to create a more useable interface for physicians. The work completed will provide a foundation for future physicians looking for a more translational and integ rative approach to medicine. Name: Sanders, Stefanie Practicum Site: Center for Global Health and Development Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Ethiopia Organizational Development Study/Data Collector Introduction: Measurable associations between organizational capacity and the ability to produce health outcomes have not been previously evaluated prior to the start of the Ethiopia Organizational Development Study. The study designed and used the Measuring Organizational Development and Effectiveness (MODE) tool to examine linkages between changes in NGO capacity, organizational performance and child (specifically HVC) health outcomes in Ethiopia. The third and final round of data collection for the longitudinal study took place during the summer of 2014. Methods: As a member of the data collection team, I assessed Ethiopian NGOs in Addis Ababa and Hawassa using the MODE tool, which included admi nistering staff surveys, confirming each organizational profile, and conducting interviews and record review. Data were entered into CSPro. Individualized reports were produced outlining strengths and weaknesses across 11 domains for each organization. Reports highlighted specific action steps to take in order to develop capacity in each domain. Results/Outcomes: My partner and I completed 12 assessments, entered 100 staff surveys, and produced 12 full reports. Statistical analysis of the results is ong oing, yet improvements were noticed in organizational development processes between year one and year three of the study. The relationship between organizational development scores and health outcomes remains unclear and further research is necessary. GLOBAL HEALTH 27 Name: Shah, Rupal Ramesh Practicum Site: Initiatives Location: Kibong'oto, Siha District, Tanzania and Boston, Massachusetts Title: Training and Implementation of Nursing Standards of Care Introduction: Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital is a national hospital that focuses on caring for patients with tuberculosis. The hospital continues to treat patients with other infectious diseases but primarily serves as a tuberculosis treatment facility . I was responsible for working with the nursing department in order to implement nursing standards of care consistent with the Ministry of Health. Methods: For the first two weeks, we led a training session with a task force of nurse managers. During that session we assessed the current hospital nursing practice and the improvements needed to guide the provision of nursing care. We then developed perfo rmance standards that would measure the quality of nursing care that was being delivered at the hospital. We analyzed the Ministry of Health standards and determined what is being implemented. My role was to provide overall coordination for the task force to develop the standards of care. Results: We developed medical record forms that would be utilized by nurses through out the hospital. The forms consisted of general patient demographics, patient assessment data, notes for nursing diagnosis, goals of care, implementation, and evaluation of care. They also contained a non -tuberculosis drug administration form and a nursin g administration medication form. After developing the forms, we conducted a training session to understand the basic nursing process, nursing diagnosis, planning of care, implementation of care, and evaluation of care. After the training, a pilot process was implemented to practice usage of the forms. Finally, we developed compliance reports to measure the outcome of the pilot study. Name: Shah, Rupal Ramesh Practicum Kilima njaro District, Tanzania and Ontario, Canada Title: Facilities Assessment in the Kilimanjaro Region Introduction: Pamoja Tunaweza Research Centre started out as a women's centre where they provided support to women who were affected by violence . The centre's work included also providing healthcare services and peer support. Over the past few years, the centre's focus has grown. It now provides healthcare services to women and men and conducts research. Methods: One of the projects that I worked on was the Cervical Cancer Health Systems Study. This study was to determine the barriers to effective cervical cancer control, from a patient and healthcare professional perspective. A major component of the study was to conduct key-informant interviews i n Swahili, which I assisted with. Another project was to conduct an assessment of the healthcare facilities in the Kilimanjaro region. This assessment provided an overview, based on checklists, of each healthcare facility. Results: For the Cervical Cancer Health Systems Study, we completed interviews at about six sites. From the data gathered, we ascertain that there is a range of barriers that prevent patients from accessing screening services starting from transportation to lac k of knowledge about the ser vices. For the Healthcare Facilities Assessment I conducted interviews at twenty sites. The data has helped to understand the various components of administration, starting from the level of funding each facility receives to the services provided to t he nu mber of emergency patients they tend to on a weekly basis. The data obtained from the interviews will assist us in understanding the state of healthcare service provision in the Kilimanjaro region. Name: Stevens, Sarah Practicum Site: Girls Project Location: Kenya Title: Program Officer Introduction: Despite many programs in Kenya aimed at reducing adolescent pregnancy, schools in rural districts are often neglected. As a result, many adolescent girls in these areas still become pregna nt, leading to elevated school dropout rates, health complications for both the mother and child, and even morbidity and mortality due to unsafe abortions. GABS is a fledgling program designed to reach schools in these rural areas and provide sexual and re productive health education to secondary school students through a peer educator model. Thus the goal of this practicum was to perform an in depth situational analysis, that GABS will use to apply for grant funding. Methods: I completed the following act ivities during the practicum: 1) lead four focus group discussions with both community members and students to better understand the way they view the problem and their needs; 2) conducted ten key informant interviews wi th selected peer leaders and school administrators; 3) administered a school -wide survey to 100 students to establish baseline knowledge on reproductive health 4) designed and implemented a sample peer education lesson. Results/Projected Outcomes: Through the completed work, the team identif ied a pressing need for a continued sexual and reproductive health intervention. The community is receptive to help and the students are enthusiastic about receiving and participating i n the program. The GABS team is writing grant applications and will hop efully soon have a full -time representative to facilitate the program's next steps. GLOBAL HEALTH 28 Name: Sun, Jennifer Practicum Site: SER Alzira de Aleluia Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Title: WASH Promotion & Creation of an Early Childhood Development (ECD) mHeal th App in the Slums of Rio de Janeiro Introduction: SER Alzira de Aleluia is a local NGO offering education, job training, family support groups, psychological counseling, and youth sports activities to the community of Vidigal, a favela (slum) nestled be tween two affluent neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 1.6 million Brazilians reside in favelas like Vidigal, and face insurmountable public health challenges as a result of socioeconomic conditions like poverty, violence, crime, and social excl usion. Impoverished conditions and lack of good water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices make favela children particularly prone to infectious diseases and experiencing early childhood developmental delays. Methods: I created a WASH campaign by cond ucting a literature review, building trust with community members through over 40 community consultations, and participating in the NGO's weekly Family Support Group for caregivers. These interactions with c ommunity stakeholders informed work on a free mob ile health (mHealth) application for favela caregivers to screen 0 -38 month -old children at risk for developmental delays. The creation of the ECD mHealth app also included conducting a literature review of ECD screening t ools and mHealth in poor urban set tings, building the app using previously validated tools, translating components, piloting the app, and making changes after receiving feedback. Results/Outcomes: I produced culturally -appropriate WASH educational materials, conducted 7 classes for caregiv ers, and distributed 100 flyers throughout the favela. Piloting the app introduced ECD concepts to over 15 caregivers, but the long -term goal is to promote ECD education to all favelas and help identify/refer at -risk children once the app is finalized. Name: Ubani, Boma Practicum Site: Center for Global Health and Development Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Intern; Data Collector Introduction: The Center for Global Health and Development (CGHD) conducted a study on the capacity of NGOs ser ving highly vulnerable children in Ethiopia to examine the linkages between changes in NGO capacity, organizational performance, and child health ou tcomes. The study was conducted over a span of three years, has enrolled 44 local NGOs in Addis Ababa with b ranch offices across Ethiopia, which are receiving funds from a variety of donors, including USAID, Irish Aid, etc. Methods: I worked alongside 7 BUSPH student interns to conduct one -day assessments using the Measuring Organizational Development and Effe ctiveness (MODE) tool at each NGO. The tool included three data collection points: (1) staff surveys, (2) organizational prof iles, and (3) interview and record reviews. The team also developed individual reports for each NGO, outlining the strengths and w eaknesses of the organization. The report prioritized organizational domains for capacity building and provides specific action steps t o take in order to improve capacity in each domain. Results/Outcomes: The data collected with the summer 2014 team adds t o the body of work generated over the past two years. Analysis of the development trends is still ongoing, although preliminary results suggest statistically significant difference between 2012 and 2014. Overall, the data showed only weak associations betw een health performance and capacity building. The results should eventually be able to demonstrate the reliability of the MODE tool as a measure of organizational capacity and relationships with child hea lth outcomes. Name: Wiles, Michelle Practicum S ite: Brookline -Quezelquague, Nicaragua Location: Brookline, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: For at least twenty years, the department of Leon and other areas of Central America have been impacted by an increase in the cases of chr onic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu). While the cause is still unknown, important information on community perceptions of disease origin will be imperative in testing hypotheses of disease origin and designing community -based prevention programs. Under the partnership between Brookline, Massachusetts and Quezalguaque, Nicaragua, with the guidance of local health officials, other health needs related to oral health and sexual health were identified, and interventions were developed and implemented in the community. Methods: With a team with 5 other MPH students, we developed a household survey about knowledge and perceptions of the origins and treatment options for CKDu, to develop a prevention program for the disease; we interviewed local pharmacies and health centers about their use of nephrotoxic medications, to develop an education program on the proper use of pharmaceuticals; and we taught sex ual education classes in the three secondary schools in Quezalguaque. Results/Projected Outcomes: Results of the CKDu household surveys will be used to further investigate origins of the disease, develop a prevention program for the community, and be used to educate pharmacies and health centers on feasible treatment options for disease. After the sexual educa tion classes were taught, a marked improvement in knowledge based on pre - and post -tests administered to students indicated an improvement in knowledge of sexual health, demonstrating the importance and effectiveness of continued sexual health classes in s chool. GLOBAL HEALTH 29 Name: Barsanti, Lauren Practicum Site: Massachusetts General Hospital Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Project Manager, MGH Strategic Planning: Improving Care for Patients with Substance Use Disorders Introduction: Massachusetts General Hospital's (MGH) mission is to deliver excellence in patient care, advance that care through innovative research and education, and to improve the health and well -being of the diverse communities that it serves. As part of that mission and as a result of its most recent community health needs assessment and strategic planning process, the hospital launched an innovative joint inpatient/outpatient initiative to improve the care of MGH patients diagnosed with substance use disorders. Methods: As a member of the Executive Implementation Team, we collaborated with working group chairs to manage the project's timeline, budget, and the deliverables of six implementation working groups. The role also included responsibility for coordinating the hiring process for the permanent project manager, inpatient social worker, and recovery coach positions, including drafting job descriptions, screening resumes, and conducting initial interviews. Results/Outcomes: The Addictions Consult Team (ACT) accepted their first c onsults from inpatient medical floors on September 30, 2014. As of October 2014, the team has hired a permanent project manager, ACT social worker, and three recovery coaches to more effectively link inpatients to the outpatient setting and community reso urces. Initial analysis of the project's impact on length of stay and readmission rates throughout FY15. MA United States Title: Reducing Unnecessary Labora tory Tests for Hospital Inpatients, BMC Introduction: Many routine blood tests for hospital inpatients are unnecessary and do not change their care path. Waste results in terms of money for the test, time for providers and stakeholders, and blood for pat ients that is linked with anemia -associated poorer outcomes. The purpose of this practicum is to determine why overtesting occurs and to explore possible interventions within BMC. Methods: Following a literature review and quality improvement project, I h ave worked with a BMC resident team to design and implement interventions in medical units around the hospital. These interventions include intern education specifically about lab ordering, increased discussion within resident teams, and test cost awarenes s. Results/Projected Outcomes: The pilot test, exploring an intern -resident discussion and literature review intervention, resulted in over $200,000 saved in four medical units extrapolated through the year at sustainable reduction rates. This same reduct ion saved 32 liters of patient blood. Our work resulted in a curriculum change as we presented this topic as part of an intern conference. Ongoing d ata collection will highlight the success of individual interventions. We received a Lown Institute Young In novators grant in order to continue implementing this intervention in BMC. Name: Core, Olivia Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Infectious Disease Intern at Boston Medical Center Introduction: As part o f the internship in Infectious Diseases, I worked alongside my supervisor using the MDPH Electronic Library Reporting and Communication Provider Portal to observe the entry of STD lab results for patients tested at our clinic. Using patients' charts, we c hecked to make sure the correct information was reported, such as: insurance information used at time of visit, whether or not they saw a nurse, and if they received any medications. Methods: We notified the counselors and nurses of the patient's results t o help determine if they need to return for treatment. We also reviewed patient information who had positive lab results in our Microsoft Access database to provide feedback to the Massach usetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) on why this Public Health Clinic is important in this population, which shows why we need the funding to keep the clinic open. We then interpreted data within Excel to show the demographics of the patients who come into both our STD Clinic and our Project TRUST clinic from 1/1/13 -6/30/14 to compare the differences in the two. Findings: After comparing the demographic data from our two clinics, it is evident that the Project TRUST clinic site receives more homeless, transgendered, injection drug users, and patients who have experie nced domestic violence. Although they do not see more patients then are STD clinic, their demographics are widely different, mainly because you can walk -in off of the street and get tested in the same day without making an appointment. HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 30 Name: Demuth , Courtney Practicum Site: Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare Systems Location: Brockton, MA United States Title: Health Systems Administrative Student Trainee Introduction : Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) is a highly complex level 1A he althcare organization. As part of the array of services offered at VABHS, comprehensive gender -specific care is provided to female veterans through the Primary Care (PC), Women's Health (WH), and Gynecology (GYN) departments. However, the relationship betw een these departments is not cohesive. As a result, several critical problems have been identified, the most significant of which is the workflow concerns of Dr. Najmosa ma Nikru. The practicum focuses on reducing waste in the Gynecology clinic workflow in order to optimize workload. Methods : Application of a Lean Six -Sigma DMAIC strategy: DEFINE; Creation of a Project Charter and Root Cause Analysis, MEASURE; Process Mapping, Gemba walks, and the identification of population and procedure data, ANALYZE; Com parative analysis of other VA 1A facilities, and the creation of a Spaghetti Diagram and Catchment Area Map, IMPROVE; Devised a PICK Chart to evaluate potenti al improvement ideas, and CONTROL; Turning over recommendations to the process owners to implement gains identified. Results /Projected Outcomes : Ascertaining waste in workflow is critical for Dr. Nikrui so that she may work to her license without practicing to excess and still address the needs of her patients. Suggested opportunities for improvement i nclude; fewer sites for care delivery (100 hours of wasted surgeon time were identified based on unnecessary travel), monthly patient management meetings between PC/WH/GYN, hire and/or train a nurse practitioner to take on lower -skilled services, and train a resident to develop the future state of the GYN clinic. Name: Hoek, Diana Practicum Site: MA Department of Public Health Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Title V Maternal Child Needs Assessment Introduction: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Family Health and Nutrition conducts a statewide comprehensive needs assessment in preparation for the Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant application. The findings of the needs assessment are used to identify pr iorities of the MCH population for the 5 -year period of the grant. One area of focus to inform the needs assessment is the impact of healthcare reform including the continued increase in healthcare costs, widening disparities, changes in healthcare infras tructure, workforce development, emergency department over -utilization and the evolution of healthcare reform. Methods: A literature review, review of organizational websites, key informant interviews, workgroup discussions and a presentation of findings w ere used to inform key Department of Public Health management staff about the impact of healthcare reform on current MCH priority needs and trends. Results/Outcomes: Based on the analysis, it is recommended that needs assessment priority areas be reviewed in the context of healthcare reform. The vast majority of the Massachusetts population has health insurance, access to a regular source of care and services. Disparities in health insurance coverage and access have decreased. Emergency department over -utilization has also decreased. The trend towards consolidation of healthcare has not yet affected access. Challenges remain though with increasing healthcare costs and shortages of primary care providers.

HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 31 Name: Kirk, Mia Practicum Site: NARAL Pro -Choice Massachusetts Location: Boston, MA Uni ted States Title: Political and Organization Intern Introduction: NARAL Pro -Choice Massachusetts is the political arm of the pro -choice movement in Massachusetts. NARAL advocates for pro-choice legislation, endorses pro -choice politicians, and organizes M assachusetts communities around political issues pertaining to reproductive choice and women's health issues. Methods: The three main goals of the practicum were 1) mobilize and educate MA residents on the Women's Health Protection Act (WHPA)(S. 1696), 2) campaign for pro -choice champions running for office re -election in MA, and 3) contribute to research in defense of An Act Relative to Healthy Youth (S. 190, H. 1063). WHPA mandates that no state legislation can be passed that restrict a wom an's access to abortion. An Act Relative to Healthy Youth mandates that any sex education offered in MA public high schools be age appropria te and medically accurate. Results/Outcome: In support of WHPA, 1,000 signatures were collected from registered MA voters, a letter to the editor was submitted to the Boston Globe, and research and campaigns on two MA representatives were conducted. Extensive research was completed on sex education curriculums in school districts across MA. The research was presented to NARAL interns and staff. In addition to these activities, An Act to Protect Access to Reproductive Health Care Facilities (S. 2281) was passed and signed into law. This wa s a direct result of the advocacy work that NARAL did after the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby rulings. Throughout my internship at NARAL, I have been a part of each stage of the policy process, from development and research, advocacy, and implementation. Name: Lambert, Joanna Practicum Site: East Boston Neighborhood Health Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Operational Efficiency Intern Introduction: East Boston Neighborhood Health Center is one of the largest community health centers in the country, with approximately 300,000 patient visits per annum. As such, the clinic processes a hi gh volume of referrals on an annual basis. As EBNHC has grown, the Appointment and Referrals Management Department has been unable to reflect sufficiently on optimal staffing levels, standard procedures, automation, and efficiency. The department seeks to review its productivity and effectiveness to benefit employees, internal/external providers, and patients alike. Methods: Data were collected, examined, analyzed, and recommendations delivered in three areas of focus; operational workflow, department met rics, and provider and patient interface and resources. Shadowing and interviews were conducted with team leads, staff, physician leaders, and I/T specialists. Research data were gathered from Epic, Clarity, intranet and shared drives, hard copy records, a nd supplemental sources. Analyses and recommendations were delivered as job aids, procedures, graphical analyses, FTE modeling, Visio workflows, and more. Results/Outcome: Through the course of this project, several significant operational changes were m ade, including centralization of customer calls and the decision to automate work distribution through Epic workqueues. Impending developments such as Care Everywhere/e -faxing, referred -to entities' shift to Epic, and Real Time Eligibility for insurance ap provals will continue to aid in operational efficiency and consistency. Small and large -scale strategic recommendations were delivered to the VP of Operations based on SWOT analysis and research and data analytics, so that developed work may be put into pl ace by new manager in the coming year.

HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 32 Name: Marcum, Carly Practicum Site: Kai ser Permanente Location: Oakland, CA United States Title: Graduate Health Policy Intern Introduction: As the graduate health policy intern at Kaiser Permanente's (KP) policy think tank, the Institute for Health Policy, I worked with health policy analysts to develop projects for dissemination to Kaiser Permanente leaders as well as a wider health policy audience. At the Institute, I worked to develop two KP Policy Stories, a Leader Briefing on the topic of Affordability, and other obser vations or blogs for publication on the Institute's website. Methods: During my practicum, I was the lead writer on two KP Policy Stories: one titled Disparities in Hypertension Control in Africa n Americans as well as one focusing on Telemedicine. The first KP Policy Story o n disparities explores the presence of health disparities in health care organizations as well as potential solutions to the problem. This story focused on a Kaiser Permanente interventi on targeted at African American patients with hypertension and how it has led to reductions in health disparities. In addition, I was the project manager on a Leader Briefing that will be distributed to Kaiser Permanente leadership teams later this year. This document hi ghlighted the topic of health care affordability, descr ibed ways to define affordability, as well as examples of how it can be put into action within the or ganization. Results/Outcomes: These projects contributed to Kaiser Permanente's overall mission by taking prominent health policy issues and making them m ore understandable for health care leaders so that they are more informed and knowledgeable in their decision -making. Name: Matousek, Sarah Practicum Site: Elder Services of the Merrimack Valley Location: Lawrence, MA United States Title: Community Care Transitions Program Intern Introducti on: The Community -based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) was created by the Affordable Care Act to improve the transition from the hospital to other care sites and reduce readmissions for Medicare recipients. The program includes a team that identifies program candidates in the hospital, visits patients at home after discharge, and makes calls to check in . These interactions aim to identify problems that may result in a readmission, such as medication discrepancies or lack of social services. Since the program began, a significant reduction in hospital readmission rates has been shown for this population . The purpose of the practicum was to analyze data from the CCTP program and identify disease diagnoses associated with frequent admissions. Methods : The CCTP database included all hospital admissions for clients in the program from February 2012 - February 2013. A separate database included client diagnostic information. Because the database included over 7,000 admis sions for 5,000 patients, pivot charts were used to assess several parameters, such as number of admissions per client and hospital -specific statistics. Based on this information, 147 clients with four or more admissions in the past year were further analy zed for disease diagnosis. Results/Outcomes: The results of the study indicated that 147 clients were responsible for over 800 hospital admissions. Nearly 70% of these patients had a diagnosis of hypertension and 50% had heart failure. The majority had thr ee or more comorbid conditions. Seven diagnoses were common in this population, indicating that clients with these illnesses may require more carefu l follow -up after discharge. Title: Center for Neuromodulation at Boston Children's Hospital Introduction: The practicum revolves around the creation of the Neuromodulation Center at Boston Children's Hospital, the first center of its kind within the pedi atric population. This is an emerging field with widespread applications in brain mapping, as well as therapeutic treatments in highly prevalent conditions, including epilepsy, pain, autism, post -stroke, and depression. Importantly, the objective of the Neuromodulation Center is to provide innovative and helpful procedures to patients in need of care. Methods: In working with the medical director, types of procedures were identified within the Neuromodulation Center. Additionally, in coordinating with the d epartment director, billing specialist, and coding specialist, a business plan was established. In regard to the budget, estimates of costs and revenue based on projected patient volume were forecasted. Additionally, in working with the b illing specialists , projected insurance coverage was reviewed and organized. Lastly, administrative staff was trained regarding insurance authorization and scheduling procedure. Results/Outcomes: Within this practicum, the Neuromodulation Center at Boston Children's Hospita l was evaluated and established. This work has been instrumental in analyzing the viability of the center with the objective of providing helpful and needed medica l care. The medical director now has an established business plan to provide innovative medic al procedures to patients in need of care through the Neuromodulation Center. HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 33 Name: Mobley, Breighl Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center, Department of Family Medicine Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Financial and Strategic Growth Analysis o f an Integrative Medicine Program within a Hospital Setting Introduction: The Program for Integrative Medicine and Health Care Disparities is an independent research, education and clinical program within Boston Medical Center. In my role as Clinical Serv ices Coordinator, my practicum focused on developing a five year business plan for the program's acupuncture services. Methods: This project involved working with a BMC budget manager and SPH accounting professor to develop a Profit/Loss statement based on financial and volume projections. Interviews with the program's director helped to incorporate his overall vision for the program into the plan. Consulting the hospital's Marketing Department helped me develop a sustainable marketing strategy for acupunct ure services. Results/Outcomes: I found that in spite of the evolving financial guidelines around acupuncture, it is possible to operate a cash -based, financially viable and accessible acupuncture program for low -income patients. These findings are import ant for three reasons. (1) They offer a road map for the growth of one of the program's most lucrative services for the next five years. (2) The plan present s the program as a financially attractive option for investment from the hospital given the signifi cant potential to turn a profit from a relatively small investment to cover acupuncture expenses. (3) This plan still aligns with the program's stated goal of making integrative hea lth services available to all regardless of ability to pay. Name: Mor rill, Dominick Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center - Pediatric Ward Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Improving \"Meds -in-Hands\" Delivery Rate Introduction: \"Meds -in-Hand\" is an initiative on the pediatric ward at Boston Medical Center that seek s to provide pharmacist -delivered medications to pediatric patients, per patient/family consent, prior to discharge from inpatient care. The purpose of this initiative is to eliminate, or at least mitigate, barriers that impede the efficacious administrat ion of prescription medication outside the hospital domain. Through this practicum, we endeavored to increase the delivery rate by simplifying workflow processes for residents, improvin g communication between the ward and outpatient pharmacy, and educating families about the benefits of this program. Methods: This practicum involved comprehensive research of care delivery improvement interventions for inpatient care, with a particular focus on workflow processes. Based on this research, and through the app lication of \"Plan, Do, Study, Act\" (PDSA) cycles, we tested various interventions designed to improve delivery rate. Results/Predicted Outcomes: Our primary intervention, which involved replacing the fax -based ordering process with one utilizing the establ ished electronic ordering system in conjunction hospital pagers, produced positive results in the first months following implementation. Since the \"Meds -in-Hand\" process must be taught to new residents each rotation (approximately every 4 weeks), these results indicate that the new, more rapid, process can be learned and applied without sacrificing quality or accuracy. Name: Murphy, Kelli Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Implementation of Transitional Ca re Management Process Intern Introduction: The Cancer Center at the Boston Medical Center (BMC) provides high quality care to a diverse patient population. One of the main objectives for the Cancer Center, and the BMC as a whole, was to reduce the number of patient readmissions. As an intern with the Cancer Center, I worked on implementing a transitional care management (TCM) billing process to both reduce the number of patient readmissions, and increase revenue for the department. Methods: I worked colla boratively with staff members in the Cancer Center through conducting TCM research, drafting revenue analyses and process flow maps, and conducting interviews with people from other departments within BMC. My research included figuring out the rules for TC M billing. I used the information that I gleaned from various people involved with the established TCM billing process within the cardiology department to create a rough draft of a potential TCM billing process within the Cancer Center. In addi tion to drafting a process flow map, I conducted a financial analysis on the potential increase in revenue for the Cancer Center if the T CM process were to be implemented. Results/Outcomes: The TCM billing process is well on its way to being implemented; however, the results of the implementation will not be available for more than six months. The TCM process will be rolled out tentatively by the end of December, and hopefully i t will successfully reduce the number of patient readmissions, and also increase revenue for the Cancer Center at the BMC. HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 34 Title: Healthcare Resource Utilization of Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who Initiate Treatment with Ivacaftor Introd uction: Vertex is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of new medicines for people with serious illnesses. One of Vertex's approved medicines, Ivacaftor (Kalydeco\u00ae), has been used to treat CF patients with specifi c CF mutations. The practicum goal with the HEOR department is to investigate the disease and healthcare burdens associated with C F by using insurance claims data to 1) measure healthcare resource utilization, and 2) evaluate these data as surrogate markers fo r health outcomes. Methods: Studied concepts of budget analysis and medication adherence. The concepts were applied to an analysis of real world healthcare data provided through de -identified, private health insurance claims for patients who take Ivacaftor. By analyzing claims data from 6 months before treatment through 6 months after treatment, conclusions and key messages were provided to the department about the impact of Ivacaftor on healthcare utilization among CF patients. Review of a statistical analy sis plan (SAP) for a Phase 4 clinical trial protocol enabled participation in the design of a SAP that would capture some non -absolute, quality of life survey data important to health outcomes evaluation. Results/Project Outcomes: A reduction in healthcar e utilization was associated with Ivacaftor initiation in patients with identified CF gene mutations. High medication adherence rates to Ivacaftor during the 6 months of treatment may have contributed to clinical ben efits observed through reduction in heal thcare utilization. Limitations: these results may not be generalizable to all insured or uninsured CF populations. Not all clinical data are included in administrative health claims.

These programs are funded through the US Department of Housing and Urb an Development (HUD) and its partner agen cies. The objective of the practicum was to develop systems to ensure the timely, high quality and streamlined collection of Housing Management Information System (HMIS) data elements as required by HUD. Methods: As a program evaluation data analyst I maintained current and ongoing expertise regarding required HMIS data standards. Led the implementation of these data standards for HUD funded programs. Worked with program managers and directors to integrate HMIS data elements, and other required data collec tion into program workflow processes. Assisted in developing and building tools within an electronic database to ensure the accurate collection of required da ta as needed by funding sources. Trained staff on HMIS data standards, and other required data on an ongoing basis . Results/Outcomes: I assisted the program evaluation manager in updating an existing client advocacy assessment to include new HMIS data standards. I will also develop an in -house manual based on National HMIS data standards to ensure accu rate reporting to HUD.

HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 35 Name: Perry, Jed V. Practicum Site: Veteran's Affairs Boston Healthcare System Location: Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, USA Title: Hospital Administration and Management Intern Introduction: In case of a federal audit, the VA Boston Healthca re System (VABHS) reviews to see if policies are up to date and in line with both local and federal practices and regulations. Upon review, the office of the Associate Chief of Staff for Education asses sed that the current resident meal policy needed to be reviewed and updated to adhere to the current local and federal practices. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to create an accurate policy for resident meals. Methods: In order to complete this project, both a Process Map and a Fishbone diagram or PPOEM (People, Process, Operator, Equipment, and Materials) was utilized. The process map was useful in creating both the procedural and responsibility section s of the policy. It helped organize the steps needed to distribute, acquire, use, and document t he process of a meal ticket. The Fishbone diagram also helped with the procedural and responsibility sections of the policy by making it easier to visualize key stakeholders i n the process. Results/Outcomes: An accurate and up to date resident meal policy has been created that meets both local and federal practices and regulations. Name: Sabshon, Sarah Practicum Site: Massachusetts State House, Representative Jeffrey Sanchez Location: Boston, MA United States Title: District Affairs Intern Introduct ion: Chairman Jeffrey S\u00e1nchez is the State Representative of the 15th Suffolk District and House Chair of the Joint Committee on Public Health. Chairman S\u00e1nchez's district has large minority and low socio -economic populations. Often these populations are n ot given a voice in the legislative process, even on matters that greatly affect them, such as gun violence. During this practicum, di strict -level work was brought together with state -level policy efforts to illustrate how community organizations can play an integral role in legislative policymaking. Methods: During the practicum, Rep. S\u00e1nchez's office built partnerships with several community organizations formed by survivors of gu n violence. Office staff met with representatives from these organizations o n multiple occasions in stakeholder meetings to solicit input on existing and future gun violence legislation. Research on gun violence prevention interventions in other states, focusing on policy recommending bodies, programs targeting social determinants , and participatory/grassroots efforts was conducted. Results/Outcomes: Based on research and community feedback, a legislative amendment was drafted and filed to address the concerns expressed by community partners, including a lack of participation in po licymaking, despite intimate experience with gun violence, as well an absence of legislative strategies focused on public health and prevention. While the legislative amendment was not include d in final gun violence legislation passed by the legislature in July 2014, this process cultivated better relationships with community organizations and taught community members how to work within the legislative process. A ssociate Introduction: Sg2 is a healthcare analytics and consulting firm that provides its clients with forecasting data on healthcare trends and th e solutions to address these trends. As a Summer Associate on the Intelligence team, I worked alongside t heir clinical leaders and experts to create resources based on the Impact of Change data -forecasting tool. Methods: I worked on two large projects. First, I assisted in putting together a service line publication based on the forecasting dat a on five dise ase families and their changing trends. Second, I put together an internal report on the behavioral determinants of healthcar e, mapping the way our clients engage with patients throughout the healthcare process. As healthcare delivery systems are shifti ng and patient care methods grow in scope, it is important for hospitals to be aware of the innovative ways in which they can utiliz e new care delivery models and tools to engage their patients. By highlighting different ways to engage healthcare customers, h ealthcare systems can reinvent the way patients navigate their care. Results/Outcomes: At the end of my practicum, I was published in the General Medicine Service Line publication, which mapped five disease families, their inpatient and outpatient trends and strategies that hospitals could use to leverage their resources and address these changes. I also created an internal report on Behavioral Determinants of Healthcare and gave an internal presentation t o the company on my findings. I presented on how th is topic related to many questions our clients had on how behavioral determinants could impact care methods.

Methods: As an administrative intern, a) to ensure successful implementation of the contracting process, I identified liabilities for our department and created a list of deadlines for each deliverable; b) wrote an article for the d epartment's monthly newsletter; c) developed an orientation presentation for the new employees; d) compiled quarterly safety report to address patient safety; e ) estimated and operationalized the implementation of snacks in waiting areas; f) created schedu le templates and list of activities for the observing visitors of the department; g) to identify issues with MD communications, I assisted supervisor to develop a process flow map ; h) coordinated 20+ professional staff to attend all day workflow process im provement workshop and co -led workshop with supervisor. Results/Outcomes: Understanding of the efforts needed to support daily needs of top healthcare executives; facilitation of MD communications to ensure safe care for patients; insight on managing a w ell-coordinated delivery system as a whole. Name: Sokol, Jessica Practicum Site: Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare Systems Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Health Systems Administrative Trainee Introduction: Working closely with senior le adership at VABHS, the primary focus of my practicum is to (1) improve Disruptive Behavior Prevention Programs (DBPP) to drive best practices and (2) reduce waste in the Gynecology Clinic (GYN) workflow in order to o ptimize workload. Methods: (1) Create a streamlined patient -generated disruptive behavior tracking system, revise the procedure manual, and audit DBPP to determine the extent to which they managed violent incidents. Read through large bodies of literature, participate in comm ittees, manipulate raw patient and facility data and conduct stakeholder interviews. Continuously improve the system and influence changes. (2) Conduct stakeholder interviews and evaluate patient and comparable IA facility data. Apply LEAN thinking: project charter, ro ot cau se analysis, process map, gemba walk, spaghetti diagram and catchment area map. Results/Outcomes: (1) Turned an antiquated system of tracking behavior into a self -sustaining, meaningful system, which influences clinicians' decisions and increases safety. Results drove emergency teams to respond quicker, standardize type and stock of medications, and improve reporting forms. Positive feedback enabled buy -in to deploy teams to other services and review the system quarterly. New members receive the manual and the audit set -up DBPP for success during a real audit. (2) Identified the system wasting over 100 hours of the surgeon's time due to unnecessary travel between facilities. Recommend fewer sites of care, monthly patient management meetings among department s, hire and/or train GYN skilled NP, and train a resident for the future state of GYN. Name: Sutton, Brittany Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Pediatr ics Department Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Project RESPECT NAS Quality Improveme nt Project Introduction: Project RESPECT at Boston Medical Center provides obstetric care and addiction treatment to pregnant women with both ongoing/histories of substance abuse. Many of the infants born to women in Project RESPECT are exposed to opioids prenatally, and experience Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). Under the direction of the Dr. James Moses and Tahlia Wolfgang, I was tasked t o continue efforts towards increasing the amount of time NAS moms spend at bedside as a part of an initiative to i mprove non - pharmacological techniques. Methods: I was given the names of nine local residential treatment centers to set up meetings with and gather information. This includ ed (but was not limited to): meeting times, dosing schedules, transportation mea ns, curfew, and length of program. I attended meetings with the NAS Quality Improvement team to learn about current state in improving NAS non -pharm techniques. Together with a fourth year medical student, we are working towards the development of an infor mation card, packet, and potential soft -contract between BMC and NAS moms. Results/Outcomes: My review of the treatment plans at the residential treatment homes found that there are substantial variances between treatment homes. This makes it difficult to create a consistent time for BMC to be able to expect moms at infants' bedside. It is our hope with the creation of these documents, we will help streamline the process of gaining a mutual understanding between BMC and moms regarding when they are able to be at bedside, and how BMC can help them to accomplish this.

Name: Wineland, Carolyn Practicum Site: Milford Hospital Location: Milford, CT United States Title : Hospital Administration projects in policy, Risk Management, and Human Resources Introduction: Milford Hospital is a small community hospital attempting to maintain its status as one of the last few independent community hospitals in Connecticut. Over the summer of 2014, the hospital was preparing for a visit from the Join Commission. The hospital's policies were very outdated and needed to be updated and standardized. Additionally, Risk Management had to address various problems that came up unexpectedly such as depositions, autopsy co mplications, and addressing communication problems among medical staff. Lastly, Milford Hospital needed a continuing medical education program to offer its staff. Methods : In order to complete these projects, training was completed on updating policies an d each hospital was updated systematically. For Risk Management issues, staff reached out to parties involved and conversed with lawyers about issues. In order to instate a continuing medical education program, close communication with the education comp any allowed for the appropriate choosing of courses that would be most relevant for Milford Hospital medical staff. Additionally, the courses were completed so that q uestions from staff could be answered when the program was eventually implemented. Results /Projected Results : Each of Milford Hospital's policies were updated appropriately, ensuring the hospital's preparedness for an evaluation by the Joint Commission. Various Risk Management issues were improved and some were completely resolved. Milford Hospital successfully rolled out the continuing medical education program, offering its staff the opportunity to earn credits f or free. HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 38 Name: Wright, Shanika Practicum Site: Brigham and Women's Physician Organization Location: Boston, MA United States Title: BWH Post Acute Strategy intern Introduction: Brigham and Women's Health Care (BWHC) has rolled out the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) \"Value\" strategy under the larger Post Acute Strategy. The SNF value strategy was created to improve care transitions , communication and to better coordinate care for patients discharged from BWHC to a subset of its highest volume SNF facilities. There is a need to better understand the cohort of BWHC patients discharged to this subset of SNF's. The BWHC mini SNF collabo rative was formed with 6 SNFs with the greatest v olume of discharges from BWHC. Methods: Under the direction of the Medical Director for Care Transitions at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), I helped determine the data elements that were needed/available to better understand the BWHC population discharged from BWH to a SNF. I also met with various stakeholders of the BWHC mini SNF collaborative work group to create a data plan for the first mini SNF collaborative meeting. Results/Outcomes: My work has pro vided a dashboard for BWHC's first mini SNF Collaborative meeting which involved representatives from each of the 6 SNFs in the collaborative. I have also provided an analysis for the Medicare SNF waiver expansion initiati ve at BWHC. The next steps include understanding data from a new stand -alone system which provides Real -time awareness/registry of all BWHC patients receiving at a non-acute facility. HEALTH POLICY & MANAGEMENT 39 Name: Christison, Marquita Practic um Site: Prevent Blindness America Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Assistant to the Regional Director Introduction: Children (birth -5 years) are at a higher risk of visual problems that go undetected, because many children are not aware of their vision problems and/or cannot communicate them. Massachusetts mandates vision screenings before a child starts kindergarten (between 3 -5 years old). In this practicum, I worked with Children's Vision Massachusetts, a coalition dedicated to improve access, systems, and community education at various levels. Methods: A pilot study to evaluate the testability and feasibility of screening children 6 months -3 years old will be carried out in a 12 - month period. I participated in phase I of the pilot study by c ollaborating with a team of investigators to develop a questionnaire to address vision issues in children. I assisted in administering questionnaires and collecting data from parents of Early Head Start participants in the greater Boston area. An optometri st at various Early Head Start locations administered a vision screen to children 6 months -3 years. Results/Projected Outcomes: Results of the survey along with the results of the vision screening will be used in the continuing phases of the pilot study. Next steps will include use of an electronic screening tool and comprehensive eye exam to test specificity/sensitivity on the target population. Long -term results will be used to make recommendations to alter current practices and policies of vision screen ings for children. One in five children in Boston has a vision problem with earlier detection and treatments we can improve outcomes and ensure the best future for them. Name: Corbet, Alexandra Practicum Site: Boston University School of Public Health Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Co -Investigator Introduction: The Binding Health Project (BHP) is a student -led research initiative founded in 2013 by myself and three other Boston University students. We established BHP to investigate the ment al and physical health effects associated with chest binding, primarily among transgender and gender non -conforming populations. Binding refers to the process in which an individual compresses or binds the chest, often as a means of gender expression. Whil e binding provides the individual with a number of benefits, associated physical health effects have not yet been studied. To address this gap in research, BHP designed and distributed a survey intended to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on the range of effects associated with binding. Methods: I first conducted a formal literature review on the topic of binding and relevant transgender health issues to inform and contextualize our research questions. Following the completion of data collect ion, I worked with team members to code over two thousand responses for thematic similarities using qualitative analysis software. Finally, I created a formal presentation ou tlining the BHP's work thus far. We hope to present our findings at the 2015 Phila delphia Transgender Health Conference and will use this presentation if accepted. Results/Outcomes: BHP intends to publish the findings for both academic and layperson audiences. We are in the process of data analysis with the goal of submitting a manusc ript by early 2015. BHP's findings will begin to fill a large gap in the literature and enable individuals, communities, and providers to better promote the health of those who b ind. Name: Day, Jacquelyn Practicum Site: Planned Parenthood League of Ma ssachusetts Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Abortion Services Training Management System Coordinator Introduction: I completed my practicum as Abortion Services Training Management System Coordinator at PPLM's Health Services Department. The sco pe of my practicum involved: updating and creating new content for the Abortion Services Training Manual, constructing an internal, online training management system for transparency within the agency, facilitating a training of th e trainer for the new sys tem (eight staff members in attendance), and evaluating the implementation of the training and new training system. Methods: The purpose of editing and updating the Abortion Services Training Manual was to provide revisions to adhere to new as well as pro viding internal cultural competency by ensuring the manual was gender neutral. The creation of the internal, online training management system was to enable managers, trainers, and trainees to seamlessly communicate about training status and increase efficiency in scheduling staff. These two projects culminated in a training of the trainer (TOT) to provide education and support around utilizing this new system to train staff. The TOT enabled trainers that were working with staff and patients to practice us ing the new system and completed pre and post assessments. Results/Outcomes: Upon completion of my practicum, there was overall growth in knowledge and confidence in using the new training system. I was able to gather feedback after the training system w as implemented and made recommendations to the Health Center Manager and Abortion Services Assistant Manager for adjustments. I was able to develop website infrastructure building skills , expand upon my excel knowledge, and overall gain a deep insight into health center training and operations. MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH 40 Name: Dobson, Kiana Practicum Site: Department of Housing and Community Development Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Commonwealth of Massachusetts Integration Task Force Intern Introduction : The Massachus etts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) is currently collaborating with other state agencies and stakeholders in an Integration Taskforce (ITF), with the goal of initiating systemic reform to prevent and end h omelessness among survivors of domestic and sexual violence. These populations do not always receive the supports they need, in part because of fragmented formal response systems. Understanding the system that survivors must navigate is a necessary step toward improvin g it. Methods: I defined the system by the governmental agencies involved in the ITF: DHCD, and the Departments of Transitional Assistance (DTA), Children and Families (DCF), and Public Health (DPH). I drafted organizational charts of the agencies and programs tha t coul d potentially \"touch\" a client once they entered the system. I edited this chart with feedback from members of the ITF, and inc orporated a flow map of the state emergency assistance system provided by an ITF member. Finally, I charted the referral patterns that occur within and between the governmental agencies. Results: The Client Flow Map is a visual representation of current referral patterns, service options, and housing opportunities for survivors. Survivor services are not built into DHCD's emergency assistance system. Conversely, DCF can help survivors begin the housing process with referrals, but DHCD is the agency that is focused primarily on housing outcomes. The Client Flow Map could poten tially serve as a tool to help ITF members advocate for an improved governmental response to the intersection of homelessness, domestic violence, and sexual violence. Name: Ferrari, Blaine Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Graduate Research Assistant, \"Access to reproductive health for women with intellectual disabilities.\" Introduction: Women with intellectual disabilities (ID) represent an underserved population with notable disparities in terms of reproductive health care access and outcomes. Little is known about the reproductive health care needs and experiences of this population. The Society of Family Planning funded study, \"Access to reproductive health for women with intellectual disabilit ies\" seeks to better understand the reproductive health care needs and experience of this population in order to create effective educational materials. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 women with ID all of whom worked in and around the Boston area. Interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analy zed. Results were analyzed collaboratively using the grounded theory method. We first collected data, marked key points with codes, and then grouped codes into similar concepts. From these concepts, categories were formed and used to inform our results. Results/Outcomes: Important themes abstracted from the collected data included barriers at the systems -, provider -, and patient -levels. A few themes found include communication barriers between patients with ID and their providers as well as a lack of acce ss to desired sexuality and reproductive health educational resources. While further research is needed to more fully quantify reproductive health care experiences and to describe the unmet reproductive needs of women with ID, significant barriers to care seem to drive reproductive health disparities. Collaborative education for patients and providers may help address communication barriers as well as com prehensive educational materials for patients and providers. Name: Garver, Kylia Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center United States Title: Breastfeeding Center Intern Introduction: As a Project Assistant at the Breastfeeding Center, I conducted research to support the CHAMPs project. CHAMPs is a breastfeeding initiative focused on improving maternal child health outcomes and rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Mississippi, New Orleans, and Southern Texas. MCH health indicators are very poor in this region of the country and are further compounded by suboptimal rates of breastfeed ing. In addition, there are significant racial disparities in infant mortality and initiation/duration of breastfeeding. Methods: I worked with the Principal Investigator and Research Assistant to collect demographic data and birth facility data. I helped organize the data in a master spreadsheet for the PI and consultants in the field. I identified existing perinatal quality improvement efforts in the geographic catchment area so that the PI could contact potential collaborators. Results/Outcomes: The cr eation of a streamlined document capturing infant mortality, race and poverty data at the county level partnered with a list of all birth facilities in the tri -state region. MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH 41 Name: Jean, Sasha Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Pediatrics Department Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Behavioral Health Screening in Children with Sickle Cell Disease Introduction: Academic Achievement is associated with improved quality of life and improved health status. Children with sickle cell disease face num erous barriers to reaching academic success. The objective of this practicum was to determine the results of the Vanderbilt Behavioral health screen on the pediatric sickle cell patients at Boston Medical Center through the pediatric hema tology department. Methods: Project consisted of compiling screening data and documenting how many of the 84 BMC pediatric SCD patients screened positive for behavioral/psychiatric health issues and whether the child was connected to the appropriate ancillary service if screened positive. Screening categories included characteristic of inattention, hyper impulsive behavior, oppositional disorder, antis ocial behavior anxiety/depression, academic learning difficulties, and disruptive classroom behavior. Results/Outcomes: Preliminary findings showed 50% of the population screened negative for all of the categories, roughly 24% of screened positive for an academic learning disorder, roughly 10% screened positive for behavioral disorders and another 10% p ositive for disruptive cl assroom behavior. 5% of the population screened positive for ADHD. The study allowed insight on whether the population screened was dealing with any behavioral/psychiatric issues at the time of screening. Some patients who were screened positiv e where already being followed and assisted through other medical providers mostly by their primary medical doctor and some patients who screened positive had no reported actual issues in school or at home. Name: Mamata, Hosana Practicum Site: States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) refers to an event when a patient's membrane ruptures at least one hour before the onset of contractions. Approximately 8 to 10 percent o f pregnant women at term experience PROM. When women experience PROM, management options include expectant management or active management. Currently, Boston Medical Center's new PROM guidelines encourage providers to engage women in a shared decision maki ng process so that together, providers and women can make the best care decision. The PROM survey study seeks to evaluate this new PROM management policy at BMC from patients' perspec tive. Methods: To evaluate the quality of the new policy, I worked with t he principle investigator to: 1) enroll patients into an ongoing patient - satisfaction and experience survey study; 2) create a database for collecting survey results; 3) review and create a set of recommendations to the current IRB application for the surv ey study by compiling patient feedback; 4) conduct a literature review to potentially expand the survey to incorporate providers' perspectives regarding the new PROM management policy. Results: The study team will continue to enroll patients until n=50. Th e survey results are collected in a REDcap database to evaluate the effectiveness of the new policy. My recommendations to the current IRB application will be incorporated to ensure that survey questions are clear and easily understood by all study partici pants. The literature review on shared decision making will be used to inform future direction of the study. Name: Masdea, Jennifer Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Pediatrics Department Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Utilizing an EHR Prompt to Improve Sickle Cell Trait Counseling at Pediatric Routine Visits Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited blood disorder in the United States. While being a sickle cell gene carrier was once considered a benign con dition, recent studies have linked sickle cell trait (SCT) with an increased risk of rare but serious health problems. Many individuals with SCT do not know their status despite universal newborn screening efforts. Primary care physicians (PCP) frequently miss opportunities to counsel their patients because of inaccessible test results, documentation errors, and feelings of discomfort. This quality improvement project aimed to increase the proportion of pediatric patients counseled about SCT by PC Ps during routine visits at Boston Medical Center (BMC). Methods: An electronic health record (EHR) prompt was created to remind PCPs to counsel children with SCT on their problem list during routine visits. The prompt also enabled PCPs to document SCT counseling in a systematic way and print patient education materials. Between May and December 2014, practicum activities included: 1) reviewing patient problem lists to alert PCPs of weekly SCT counseling needs via email; 2) inputting SCT counseling rates in the proje ct database; 3) preparing monthly updates for BMC administrators; 4) addressing physician inquiries; 5) completing the Institute for Health Care Improvement's quality improvem ent course; and 6) expanding the project to pediatric residents. Results/Outcomes : Plan -do-study -act cycles were used to determine the impact of the EHR prompt and weekly email alerts on SCT counseling rates. Significant improvement occurred between April and November 2014. EHR prompt utilization also increased dur ing the same time per iod. MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH 42 Name: McCue, Kelly Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center, Department of Family Medicine Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: The Integrative Medicine Program at BMC brings integrative medicine techniques to un derserved populations, with a mission of providing integrative care to reduce health disparities here in Boston. I assisted the Principal Investigator on t wo studies: 1) Our Whole Lives (OWL) Study: combining Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) with a website and embodied conversational agent (ECA) to reduce pain and depressive symptoms in patients and 2) Go to Gabby for Health and Wellness Study: comparing accessib ility and comprehensibility of health (stress, nutrition, and exercise) information deliv ered by an ECA versus health information packets. Both studies utilize an ECA, an application that merges health care with technology in the form of a virtual health guide. The stu dies will assess whether the ECA can improve health knowledge and empower pa tients to change health behaviors on their own. Methods: To prepare the studies for implementation, I 1) created health scripts with appropriate health literacy level (for the ECA), 2) assisted with website production, 3) facilitated multiple patient advis ory groups to obtain feedback on the website and ECA, 4) edited the IMGV curriculum for use with the website and ECA, and 5) edited questionnaires to assess any differences before and after the studies and between control and intervention groups. Results/O utcomes : The IMGV website ties IM to technology, in hopes that online access to health information and social support (website blog) will improve and maintain health among underserved patients with chronic pain and depression. These studies ai m to improve health equity and reduce patient reliance on emergency services. Name: Monestime, Gianina Practicum Site: States Title: Graduate Student Intern Introduction: The Mattapan Community Health Center (MCHC) improves the quality of life for residents of Mattapan and Greater Boston through comprehensive, accessible, and culturally competent care. Each year MCHC hosts the Mattapan Healthcare Revival, a hea lth fair for children, teenagers, adults, and families. In addition to promoting healthy living, the Revival serves as an opportunity to provide various healthcare services and screenings to community members. My role at this year's 18th Annual Mattapan Healthcare Revival was to co -facilitate the Teen Talk: What's On Your Mind? discussion with HIV Counselor, Vanessa Thiesfeld. Methods: In this practicum, my tasks included: 1) researching public health topics relevant to teenagers in the community; 2) developi ng and teaching a curriculum for Teen Ta lk; and 3) creating an informational resource guide to be distributed on the day of the event. As co - facilitator of this discussion, the goal was to dispel myths and incorrect information that teenagers in the community may ha ve had, regarding any and all public health topics. Results/Outcomes: Despite low attendance at the teen tent, we distributed approximately 50 resource guides and 25 condom goody bags to teenagers in the community. In the future, the planning committee will commit itself to investigati ng new strategies that may be used to attract and retain teenagers at this event. It is critical that community health programs - similar to the Revival - continue to target and educate at -risk teenagers in urban communities. These programs will help them make their own well -informed health decisions as they enter adulthood. Name: Moran, Kaitlyn Practicum Site: Massachusetts General Hospital - MGPO Performance, Analysis, and Improvement Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant for t he MGPO Physician Survey Introduction: Physicians are increasingly asked to perform a variety of administrative tasks in an effort to improve the access, quality, a nd efficiency of their patients' medical care. Paradoxically, these requirements, many of w hich involve the meaningful use of Electronic Health Records, often lead to more time spent on paperwork and computers and less time available for direct face -to-face patient care. The Mass. General Physicians Organization (MGPO) distributes a survey to ph ysicians every two years to assess and evaluate these important issues in their clinical departments. Methods: An online survey was distributed to nearly 2000 physicians in the MGPO to assess factors like administrative burden, satisfaction, burnout, and engagement. We also conducted a comprehensive literature review around these topics in order to create benchmarks for which our results could be compared to. Results of the survey were presented to various stakeholders and inter ested parties. Results: The majority of physicians feel that administrative duties interfere with their ability to deliver high quality care. The findi ngs demonstrate that measures that have been enacted with the intention of improving patient care may inadvertently lead to more frustrated physicians. Results and feedback from the survey will be used to develop future initiatives to address administrativ e burden in physicians. MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH 43 Name: Morrison, Rachel Practicum Site: Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts Location: Boston, MA U nited States Title: LGBTQ in the Workplace Introduction: As the Internal Training Resources Intern in Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts' Education Department, I addressed the issue of workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees by creating a cultural competency educational program aimed at creating a more affirming and supportive environment for LGBTQ employees. Negative physical and mental health outcomes in LGBTQ employees have been associated with an unsupportive work environment. This is especially true for trans* identified employees. Supportive work environments have been associated with improved physical and mental health outcomes among LGBTQ employees and are also related to improved job performance and satisfaction. Methods: During my time at PPLM, I created \"LGBTQ in the Workplace\" - an educational program geared toward creating a safe, affirming, and supportive workspace for LGBTQ employees. In addition to preparing and organizing resources for Internal Train ing programs, I researche d the impact of supportive and unsupportive workplaces on LGBTQ health as well as best practices for developing LGBTQ cultural competency programming, created and compiled a series of activities aimed at rooted in behavior change theories, and developed a list of resources as well as suggestions for maintenance. Results/Outcomes: PPLM will be able to utilize the program as a free -standing educational program in the context of cultural competency as well as pull individual components to use in other progra ms. The program is designed in a way that promotes sustainable behavior change, and not only gives employees knowledge, but also gives them opportunities to practice and become confident in new beh aviors to promote an LGBTQ -supportive environment. Adeolu Practicum Site: Boston Medical Center Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant Introduction: I completed my practicum in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Boston Medical Center whose research is recent ly focused on Streptococcus pneumonia (SP) infection providing ways by which this illness is better understood, prevented and tr eated. It was found that while pneumococcal vaccine use has reduced the prevalence of previously virulent serotypes, the rate of pneumococcal carriage is yet to decrease and an ongoing surveillance study of SP nasopharyngeal colonization among children < 5years was i nitiated. Activation of the complement binding pathway is one immune response used by the host to control bacterial i nfection. I hypothesized that the more invasive an isolate, the less complement it will bind. The goal of my practicum was to identify if 23B serotype was a candidate for inclusion in future vaccine. Method s: I selected randomly 5 SP isolates each of child ren with (invasive SP) and without (carriage SP) pneumococcal disease and compared the isolates' immune activation capacity. I evaluated their human complement binding deposition to the surface of th e bacteria using a flow cytometry assay. I recorded compl ement binding as a change in relative fluorescence of bound and unbound complement for each 23B serotype and compared the mean number of bacteria that bound to complement in both groups using independent T -test. Results/Outcome: The carriage SP had a highe r mean (5.453\u00b10.360) than the Invasive SP (4.497\u00b10.478). This was statistically significant (p=0.007), and may be an indication to include 23B serotype in future pneumococcal vaccine. However, it would be interesting to see the trend with a larger sample. Name: Rahman, Shati Practicum Site: Boston Public Health Commission Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Health Promotion Internship at the Boston Public Health Commission Introduction: In 2009 the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that around 21.8 million Americans from 12 years of age and above are illicit drug users. Illicit drugs include drugs such as heroin, cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, inhalants, prescription drugs used for nonmedical reasons and abuse of common over -the-counter medications. Substance abuse has no boundaries affecting men and women, teenagers alike, often tearing lives and families apart and causing a multitude of health problems such as HIV, Hepati tis C and B and mental disorders due to unsafe practices involved when taking illicit substances. In 2012, in Boston alone there were 16,272 admissions to substance abuse centers. Even for individuals who seek treatment at rehabilitation centers, relapses and drop o ut rates from programs are high. Methods: The Health Promotion Internship at the Boston Public Health Commission, under the Bureau of Addictions, Prevention Treatment and Recovery Support Services focused on developing educational materials based around the 'harm reduction theory' to reduce the risks individuals with substance abuse disorders, especially adolescents, face when taking illicit drugs. The educational materials developed were brochures and info sheets on safer drug taking practices and techniques. An evaluation plan to peer review the educational materials was also developed to evaluate the utility and benefits healthcare professionals working in the field of s ubstance abuse may derive from these new materials. Results/Outcomes: It is hoped the final developed materials will be a valuable educational resource for use and distribution in substance abuse centers in Boston in the future.

The primary activity of the WOCPTLC is the Student Nutrition and Activity Clinic for Kids (SNACK). SNACK provides services to overweight or obese pediatric patients and their f amilies, including nutrition education, free activity sessions and com munity events. SNACK serves the entire pediatric population of Yamhill County (ages 2 -18), where 44% of children qualify for free or reduced lunch and the two largest racial/ethnic populations are White (79.1%) and Hispanic (14.7%). As the SNACK Program Co ordinator, I am responsible for the development and management of all program operations. For this practicum, I completed an assessment of SNACK and a Strategic Plan for 2015 -2017. Methods : In assessment of the program, I 1) analyzed SNACK's organizational documents and previous activities, 2) conducted a series of key informant interviews with providers, patients, family members and community leaders, 3) compiled relevant non -identifiable patient data from electronic medical records, and 4) completed a qu antitative analysis of the program. Finally, I completed a review of literature evaluating similar interventions. Results/Outcomes: Using the information gathered and public health techniques I learned in my coursework, I created a comprehensive list of fi ndings and recommendations that I presented to the WOCPTLC Board of Directors. Based on these recommendations, I negotiated a two year Strategic Plan which is expected to be adopted January of 2015. Name: Rodriguez, Bryan Practicum Site: Boston Medi cal Center, Department of Family Medicine Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Research Assistant in Department of Family Medicine (Boston Medical Center) Introduction: The Program for Integrative Medicine and Health Care Disparities in the Departme nt of Family Medicine at Boston Medical Center (BMC), researches disparities in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) use. As a Research Assistant, I worked o n the Music and Massage Therapy Pilot Study (M &M) and the Back to Health Study (B2H). M &M is a pilot study examining the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) comparing music and massage therapies to usual care with inpatients in a safety n et hospital. B2H is a R01 RCT comparing yoga with physical therapy for patients with c hronic lower back pain. The purpose of this practicum was to implement effective strategies to recruit participants, review relevant medical record data, and collect patient -reported qualitative data in the M &M study. I also provided administrative support as B2H concluded its final cohort. Methods: As part of a multidisciplinary research team, I recruit, collect data, and conduct follow -up interviews. Responsibilities include coordinating with BMC inpatient nurses to determine the impact of the M &M interve ntion on potential participants; pulling primary and secondary data from medical records on pain and anxiety outcomes; and conducting telephone follow -up interviews. Administrative support for B2H included conducting in -person structured interviews, and en suring data quality. Results/Outcomes: To date, 73 BMC patients have successfully enrolled and been randomized to massage therapy, music therapy, or usual care. Preliminary results indicate that both music and massage may have a significant impact on pat ients' self -reported care satisfaction and stress relief. Lessons learned include research and communications skills.

I worked with Dorchester House to improve the processes of universal depression screening and be havioral health Integration in the Adult Medicine Department. Methods: I worked with the Chief Medical Officer, Clinical Programs Manager and a DrPH Practicum student to improve the processes and understanding of process barriers and failures directly rel ated to Behavioral Health Integration. This involved 1) clinical observations; 2) interviews with PCPs, BH clinicians, and medical assistants; 3) process mapping and evaluation. We developed recommendatio ns of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiv eness of behavioral health integration based on our work. Results: Throughout the course of these activities, several themes emerged regarding staff and clinicians understanding of behavioral health integration; 1) medical assistants felt uncomfortable sc reening patients for depression 2) clinicians felt that coverage in the Integration office was not fully consistent 3) behavioral health providers were not clear what was expected of sessions with clients in the integration office. In order to improve unde rstanding and compliance with Universal Depression Screening a training is being devised for Medical Assistants. A report with detailed situational analysis and recommendations will be presented to the Chief Medical Of ficer and the Clinical Programs Manage r.

As part of the health communications pra cticum, I developed a new marketing strategy for an app recently created by TPMG. The app, My KP Meds, is designed to help patients adhere to their medication plans, and the campaign is especially t argeted at patients with new, complex medicine regimes or those who had recently undergone surgery. Methods: I independently designed a new theoretical framework for marketing collateral, drawing heavily from social and behavioral science theory and marketing principles. I wrote a creative brief detailing the con cepts for the collateral, pitched the new piece to the Marketing Director, and worked with the Design Team to produce the piece. Results/Outcomes: The new collateral was produced in August 2014. It has since replaced the original collateral throughout all clinics and pharmacies that advertise the medication adherence app, and the piece will be distributed to patients coming out of surgery. The new framework developed using health communication principles will be used to ensure greater engagement with healt h messages on two additional campaigns, medical video visits and a prevention -focused app. Name: Dattani, Nikhita Practicum Site: Massachusetts Council Gambling Location: Boston , MA United States Title: Research and Data Intern Introd uction: The Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling, in conjunction with the Wisconsin Council on Problem Gambling, aims to survey executive casino management and staff regarding the status of current responsible gambling initiatives and training prog rams.

The Division of Community Health within the department is responsible for overseeing community health initiatives focused on health improveme nt and disease prevention, such as healthy eating and physical activity and adult immunization. As the Community Health Program Associate, I was responsible for organizing and promoting three major events and programs this fall: Car -free School Day, Food Day, and four community flu clinics. Methods: Organizing the community events included collaborating with other Divisions within the health department, liaising with community partners such as the Brookline public schools, and recruiting and coordinating volunteers. Promoting the events inc luded activities such as developing educational and promotional p osters, drafting press releases for local media and school newsletters, and updating social media.

SOCIAL & BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 49 Name: Storm, Marissa Practicum Site: Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) Location: Boston, MA United States Title: Marketing for Behavioral Study of Cigarette and Tobacco Substitution (BSCiTS) Introduction: Since the product's introduction to the U.S. market in 2004, electronic cigarette (e -cigarette) use has been on the rise and now comprises a billion dollar industry. Despite their growing popularity, little is known about the impact of e -cigarettes on tobac co smoking behavior. There is, however, substantial anecdotal evidence suggesting that e -cigarettes are effective for smoking reduction or cessation among some smokers. The Behavioral Study of Cigarette and Tobacco Substitution (BSCiTS) seeks to understand how e - cigarettes affect tobacco smoking behavior among current tobacco smokers seeking to quit or reduce their consumption. E -cigarettes will be compared to the nicotine patch in a randomized behavioral study. This will be the first US randomized behavior al study on e - cigarettes. Methods : In preparation for fundraising, we have developed the following materials: 1) a BSCiTS website highlighting key messaging; 2) a Facebook page and Twitter account to gather influential followers and increase awareness; 3) a formal proposal and a presentation for important donors. Materials were originally developed for a broad crowd -funding approach, but have recently changed in favor of a more traditional, targeted fundraising campaign. A formal fundraising presentation wi ll be held in early December with important potential donors. Results/Outcomes: Upon study completion in 2018, public health officials, the FDA, e -cigarette companies, smokers and non -smokers will better understand the impact of e -cigarettes on tobacco smo king behavior.
