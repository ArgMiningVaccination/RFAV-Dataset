Dharma Parenting Robert Keith Wallace, PhD Frederick Travis, PhD Two renowned neuroscientists and pioneers in documenting the benefits of the Transcendental Meditation\u00ae technique give parents a guided tour of their children's brains through contemporary science and ancient Ayurvedic typology (parents can \"type\" their kids and themselves) for a wealth of methods and insights to maximize your child's learning and behavioral style. Dharma Parenting offers a uniquely individual approach to raising a happy and successful child. The word dharma means a way of living that upholds the path of evolution, maintains balance, and supports both prosperity and spiritual freedom. For the first time, we can understand why one child learns quickly and forgets quickly while another learns slowly and forgets slowly; why one child is hyperactive and another slow moving; or why one falls asleep quickly but wakes in the night while another takes hours to fall asleep. Leading brain researchers Robert Keith Wallace and Frederick Travis combine knowledge from modern science, ancient Ayurveda, and their personal experience to show how to unfold the full potential of a child's brain, as well as how to nurture his or her inherent brilliance and goodness. The first tool of Dharma Parenting is to determine your child's-and your own-brain/body type through a simple quiz. The Eastern system of natural medicine called Ayurveda has used three distinct mind/body types (and combinations of these types) for thousands of years. Scientific studies suggest that there is a specific set of genetic, biochemical, and physiological characteristics that underlie each of the three main Ayurveda mind/body types. Coupling old and new wisdom, Dharma Parenting offers unique insight into why a child is the way he or she is and reveals how to bring each child into a state of balance. Its language is readily comprehensible by parents of any cultural background, with real-life stories to illustrate areas of universal parental concern-such as emotions, behavior, language, learning styles, habits, diet, health issues, and, most importantly, the parent-child relationship. Psychology Transcendence Norman Rosenthal, MD Norman Rosenthal, MD, is a distinguished clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School. Dr. Rosenthal served for 20 years as a senior researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health. His research into seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and pioneering work in the use of light therapy have helped millions of people around the world. Dr. Rosenthal's newest book, TRANSCENDENCE: Healing and Transformation Through Transcendental Meditation (Tarcher/Penguin, 2011), explores the value of this ancient technique for healing and transformation. Dr. Rosenthal's broad-ranging book will appeal both to newcomers who want to know the basics of this ancient technique, as well as seasoned meditators wishing to broaden their knowledge and deepen their understanding about it. By presenting a mix of fascinating stories, published research, and his own clinical and personal experience with the Transcendental Meditation\u00ae TM\u00ae technique, Dr. Rosenthal illustrates its value in promoting cardiac health, reducing anxiety and depression, and helping people suffering from traumatic stress and addiction. Dr. Rosenthal emphasizes that the TM technique can especially help highly successful people to live fuller and richer lives. He illustrates this in interviews with prominent meditators like Paul McCartney, Martin Scorsese, Moby, Russell Brand, and Laura Dern. \"A profoundly important book... incredibly valuable.\" - Mehmet Oz, M.D. \"Whether your troubles are deep, or you simply know life could be better and healthier, read this book.\" - Candy Crowley, CNN anchor \"A very enjoyable read that can change your life, for good.\" - Filmmaker David Lynch Super Mind Norman E. Rosenthal, MD The noted research psychiatrist and New York Times-bestselling author explores how the Transcendental Meditation technique permanently alters your daily consciousness, resulting in greater productivity, emotional resilience, and aptitude for success. Most of us believe that we live in only three states of consciousness: wakefulness, sleep, and dreaming. But there is so much more. In his most ambitious and practical book yet, Rosenthal shows how the TM practice is more than a tool for de-stressing or for general wellness. It is a gateway to functioning physically, emotionally, and intellectually at levels we never knew we could attain. Written in Rosenthal's trademark style of restraint and intellectual carefulness, Super Mind explores how we can aspire to so much more than we ever thought possible. Reflections on Maharishi AyurVeda and Mental Health Jim Brooks, MD Chronic mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, are leading causes of morbidity, disability, and loss of quality of life. It is estimated that as many as one-third of all Americans suffer from some form of mental disorder. In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Brooks addresses the inability of modern medicine to prevent and treat these chronic disorders. He proposes an effective solution found within the world's most comprehensive and ancient system of natural medicine \u2014 Ayurveda. World-renowned Vedic scholar and teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in collaboration with leading Ayurvedic experts, scientists, and physicians, led a modern revival of Ayurveda known as Maharishi AyurVeda. Dr. Brooks anticipates that the Maharishi AyurVeda approach to mental health will have a major impact on how medicine understands, prevents, and treats mental disorders. \u2014 \"I have witnessed thousands of my patients benefit from these recommendations, and I wholeheartedly encourage you to quickly read this book and put it to practical use in your life.\" \u2014 Nancy Lonsdorf, MD, Pioneer in Integrative Medicine and Ayurveda, author of The Ageless Woman Heart Health Total Heart Health Robert Schneider, MD Jeremy Fields, PhD This ground breaking book reveals how leading risk factors for heart disease, can be successfully treated with the Total Heart Health program. Th Total Heart Health program relieves stress, which is responsible for 1/3 of all heart attacks, and has helped with menopause complications, a major risk factor for heart disease. The Total Heart Health program offers a safe, successful, and easy alternative to conventional medical treatments and their hazardous side effects. Robert H. Schneider, MD, FACC, is a physician, scientist, educator, and one of the world's leading authorities on natural medicine and its scientific use in the prevention and treatment of heart disease.

Digestion-Gut-Biome Gut Crisis Robert Keith Wallace, PhD Samantha Wallace Gut Crisis is the ultimate guide to gut health. Poor food quality, the overuse of antibiotics, and other factors are creating an imbalanced state in your gut bacteria and damaging your gut lining. This eventually leads to inflammation that underlies chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, autoimmune disease, heart disease, and degenerative brain disorders. This book reveals a hidden health crisis taking place around the world and talks about the most recent and effective treatment programs. It gives practical advice based on what the ancients have known for centuries: by healing your gut through diet, lifestyle, and simple procedures, you can heal your body and mind. Diet and Weight Loss The Prime Kulreet Chaudhary, MD Prepared to live at your prime? Integrative neurologist Dr. Kulreet Chaudhary discovered a beautiful side effect to the eating and lifestyle tools she gave her brain patients-spontaneously shedding excess pounds. In this, her first book, she shows us how to sharpen the brain, and smarten and heal the gut. Weight gain is not about the food, but about the body's environment. Excess weight is a result of the body being in a toxic, inflammatory state. If your body is not prepared or 'primed' for weight loss, you will fight an uphill biochemical battle. Her program is not about what you can't have or do, it's about adding simple teas and herbs, and succeeding without giving up any foods you love. With The Prime, Dr. Chaudhary has reverse engineered our way of eating, so we can stop dieting backward and start losing weight instead. You'll learn: -The importance of neuroadaptation, food addiction, and the brain (or, why your brain and gut have made it so hard to lose weight in the past!) -Why it's not about what you eat, but what you digest -How to determine if you have a leaky brain\u2014and what The Prime can do about it (Hint: everything) -How to easily crush cravings (no willpower required), ignite energy and fat, and biohack your lifestyle habits. Lastly, you'll learn how to live fully Primed, the secrets of the Super-Primed, and when you're ready to explore new foods, how to eat according to your unique constitution. Transcendental Meditation An Introduction to Transcendental Meditation Robert Keith Wallace, PhD Lincoln Norton The Transcendental Meditation\u00ae (TM\u00ae) technique is for people who lead active lives. Most of us begin TM for practical reasons: we want better physical and mental health, increased energy, less anxiety and tension, more fulfilling relationships, greater clarity of thought, or more success and fulfillment. Many individuals today experience the benefits of this highly effective meditation technique. We hear a lot about famous movie stars, business leaders, athletes, musicians, scientists, fashion models, and talk-show hosts who all do TM. But thousands more\u2014homemakers, teachers, bank clerks, farmers, small business persons, students of all ages, veterans, and people from every imaginable walk of life\u2014are quietly and effortlessly practicing the TM technique, benefiting from the proven release of stress, reduced high blood pressure, and increased success and happiness at work and at home. Yoga and Consciousness Maharishi's Yoga \u2014 The Royal Path to Enlightenment William F. Sands, PhD To many, Yoga is an ancient form of exercise, practiced for its health benefits. But Yoga is more than exercise, and its benefits go far beyond health. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has provided a unique and fresh understanding of the ancient science of Yoga, restoring its deepest significance. His approach is rich in both theory and practice. It provides the key to inner peace, stress and anxiety relief, happiness, wellness, success, and - ultimately - the realization of the true purpose of Yoga - to elevate life to its highest potential -enlightenment. This easy-to-read and far-reaching book explores Maharishi's teaching on Yoga philosophy from several perspectives, including its profound practical benefits for individuals and societies, while also considering traditional areas of Yoga philosophy, such as siddhi performance, Karma Yoga, Gyan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, and the fulfillment of the four traditional goals of human life: dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. Anyone familiar with Yoga will enjoy the systematic, logical examination of Maharishi's Yoga and its powerful conclusion: that the goals of Yoga - from inner peace to full enlightenment - can be effortlessly achieved.
